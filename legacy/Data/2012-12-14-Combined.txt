=======================================================

On a developing siton, and there is devastation at this hour in connecticut as we await a police news conference on a deadly shooting at a connecticut elementary school. At a connecticut elementary school. Sources are telling fox news the 26 people are dead at this time. Eight adults, including the shooter, and 18 children. Thank you for being with us on this important afternoon at "america live." I am megyn kell looking live at sandy hook elementary school at newtown, connecticut. Breaking children being led across a parking lot. An expression of terror been across the face of that one little girl in the blue shirt. The mother of the child called in to fox news. 
Jenna: Can you tell us what happened inside the school were your daughter was? 
>> She was in a small class, a reading group. They started hearing bangs and her teacher, which I am so grateful for, there was just a small group. They rushed the kids into the bathroom. They locked the door. They just told the children that it was hammering, and they tried to keep them calm. The next thing that I know, because it's very hard to get a complete story, the next thing i know is that the police came and they were knocking on the door to be let out of the classroom. When they were, they stop laughing blood. One child was covered in blood. I understand that child is safe and was not hurt. It must have been somebody else. 
Megyn: There is a lot of information coming into the newsroom at this hour. The news has evolved as we have learned more information. I would like to tell the viewers that we are still awaiting a the first news conference on this tragedy in connecticut. That will happen any moment now. It has been scheduled for 1:00 p.M. Eastern time. It has been pushed back shortly as they get the officials in place. This even news organizations working to get the microphones set up. We are told it will happen momentarily. Going live to trace gallagher at the news desk. 

[00:02:21]


Reporter: We wanted to play this thing carefully. We have been getting the numbers all morning long. Police were holding this very close to the vest. We have now confirmed with the justice department that the numbers are horrifying. Twenty-seven dead, including 18 children. Eight adults, and the gunmen. It all begins to make sense. Because even in the early going, the mayor and the police officers were saying that this could be from the early assessments, one of the worst shootings in connecticut history. Now we know if the numbers hold up, this would be the worst shooting in connecticut history. The gunman, apparently, was in full camouflage. He was carrying two different guns. We heard throughout the morning with some of the witnesses heard up to 100 shots being fired. Now you have these numbers. Earlier there was a report, and this apparently happened in the kindergarten class. The kindergarten class was so far unaccounted for. We saw pictures of students being carried and shepherded out of the school toward the fire station. Some of the authorities and teachers telling the students to put their head down and went to the fire station and do not stop running until you get there. We heard early on that this may have been isolated to just be office. The gunman may have gone in the school, went to the office, and opened fire on a principle. We know that the vice principal was injured and we know that eight adults with some of them clearly were in. They were in the principal's office. The principal, vice principal and others, mostly female members of the staff. We do not yet know the breakdown of the kindergarten class. Keep in mind, the school is in fairfield county. A very upscale community. All schools in fairfield county, I would know because my children went there at one time, it would be locked down at 9:30 a.M. To get into the school, you have to have visual identification. There are cameras out front as well as others. Before they buzzy when coming up to let them know who you are. The shooting reportedly happened 10 minutes after the doors were locked. It is unclear if the gunman came in before or after that. But during the morning announcements, we are told that is one they heard the shots being fired. Again, up to 100 shots. Now they are in the process of trying to notify families. Police have not come out and said a single public word about the number. This is all coming from sources. Our source happens to be the justice department giving us the numbers of 27 dead, including 18 children. Again, not to panic. Any parents who have children in the school district, we do not know yet where those children are located in the school. As we get more breaking news, and there is more to be gone, we will bring it to you throughout the broadcast. 

[00:05:24]


Megyn: The hospital in dander, connecticut is on lockdown. To protect the confidentiality of the patients, they say they have only treated three patients and don't anticipate any more being sent to the hospital at this time. The horrifying reality at this hour reminds me of what happened in new york city after 9/11, when they lined up outside of the hospital. 
Reporter: You could even go back to what happened at columbine. Or perhaps at georgia tech. You can see at one point in time, they were alluding to a triage, which is a standing operating procedure and they set up a red tarp and a yellow tarp and other tarps and they will bring the patients out and they will assess them as the need. The red is the most serious. The yellow is not so serious, and then you move on down the line. We look at that tree are set up and there wasn't a single patient out there. At first, it seemed to be a good sign. Now, as you go later on and you see going back to columbine and virginia tech, but that apparently was not a good sign. The fatalities were apparently in the office and in a certain classroom, but we though we don't know which classroom they were in. You kind of touched on how the whole town, all the schools on lockdown, there was a report earlier that police had surrounded a purple van that was in dander, which is just a few miles away. Police had actually surrounded that ban, maybe our precaution, maybe someone else involved. We are still waiting to get that information from the authorities 
megyn: Standby, we are going live to rick leventhal who is near the school at a park where the police will be holding a press conference. 

[00:07:24]


Reporter: We are at a park that is very close to sandy hook elementary. The police have not arrived yet for the news conference, but we hope to have a lot more of these questions answered when they do. I have heard from a federal source personally that the number dead with 26 or 27, and included 18 children, also included the principal of the school and the gunman. Two gunmen were at the scene. A glock pistol and a nonmetal -- 9-millimeter gun. He was dressed in camouflage. Police are saying that he -- but there isn't n active search for any more shooters at this time. There are security procedures in place for the door should have been locked. Anyone who wanted to enter the school after 9:30 p.M. Would've had to be buzzed in and would've had to sign in when they got into the school itself. So we do not know how he got in, but we are told that this gunman may have killed as many as 26 people in the school, including up to 18 children. 
Megyn: What is the status of the children? What is the status of the children at this hour? 
>> We were told that some parents were reunited with their children. The children will be -- 
megyn: Standby, we have a parent on camera now. 
>> It started with the neighbors and so it is -- [inaudible] 

[00:09:29]


>> [inaudible question] 
>> when it happened, you could hear the gunshots. So it was very upsetting and it is one of those things where we are trying to understand what is happening. It is going to make it much worse. 
>> [Inaudible question] 
>> I do not know what happened outside of that. I do not have any information other than what people are speculating. 
Megyn: That appeared to be one of the parents who have older children in the school. The children appeared to have escaped unharmed. I would like to get back to rick leventhal now. Hearing from one of the parents, where are the children? When they arrived at the school, they were told not to arrive. But many people came. Where are they? 
>> They have set up an area of the local firehouse. As we understand, many were led out of the school. The teachers locked their doors when they heard the gunshots fired. Minutes ago, we could see a lot of police officers blocking all the roads that lead where the school is located. That entire area has been locked. So the police have the area on lockdown. We know that they have the school on lockdown. We know that they did a room by room, search. They located the gunman and the children. And as far as we know, children have now been reunited with their families. 
Megyn: Is there any information on this man's connection to the school? The shooter. We heard that this may have been the father of a student. Have we heard anything from one person about that? 

[00:11:45]


>> I have not heard that from law enforcement yet. We do have one source suggesting the shooter may have been a young man, his young at 20 years old. We also have heard that he may live in new jersey and there may have been a separate situation there. A crime scene where they kicked down the door of the person's home. We are trying to confirm that at this hour. We don't know if that is true at this hour spume we are hearing that there are swat teams at this persons home, the possible shooter's home. We cannot confirm that yet the one I would like to ask you what the status is at the school at this hour. They are not expecting any more victims to be brought to the connecticut hospital in danbury. Twenty-six dead confirmed by fox news. We believe it is 26 people plus the gunman? We are getting different reports for the question is, do we believe that the victims are still in school. 
Reporter: If you have that many victims located in the school, it is going to be a very long and very difficult and very grisly crime scene it has to be processed before anybody is our move. Has to be carefully documented, photographs have to be taken. All victims have to be secured. Then transported from the scene once the entire crime scene has been mapped out. That could take hours. You can expect a crime seen around the school for days. Police will continue to keep everyone out as they process this end are covered the victims inside the school. It will not be over quickly. 
Megyn: One can only wonder what the parents of those who are not accounted for are going through. Is there a holding place for them? Do we know whether they are present on the scene at all? We haven't seen that as of late. 

[00:14:01]


Reporter: Our understanding is that everyone who is rushing towards sandy hook elementary was being stopped and redirected to the firehouse, possibly to other locations at this point. Our understanding is that there are no parents now have the school itself. Everyone has been moved away so that the police can do their job now processing the scene. Any parent who may have children who were taken from the school, at this point should have been reunited with those children. We imagine this will be a difficult day for everyone involved. 
Megyn: There were reports earlier that were touched on of a possible accomplice. And there was some tape of police. These are the lucky ones, the parents who get to take their kids on today and explain to them why 18 of their classmates are dead. There were reports of a second person, perhaps an accomplice. We didn't hear much more about that. Now we are getting more reports from other sources for that a second person may be in custody. Have they said whether they believe that piece of the investigation is still open? 
>> What we had heard is that there was a potential second suspect. Oftentimes after these major incidents, you have a lot of reports that turn out to be false. A lot of times there is confusion in the midst of things and someone could be running from the scene. Someone who may be escaping with their life. People could think that they are fleeing the scene because they are involved. We don't know. We are waiting for police to brief us and we have been told there's no active investigation or search for a second shooter. That could mean the they have party captured a second person if someone was involved. But we haven't confirmed that yet. 
Megyn: We would like to tell our viewers that president obama was notified of the shooting at 1030 eastern time. The fbi and local enforcement on scene. He was asked for his reaction and jay carney said that he does not want to relay that until we know more about what has happened. Honestly, the president has a father, so he feels enormous sympathy for the family and wants to do everything that he can to support state and local law enforcement during this tragic event. Jay carney was specifically asked about whether assault weapons bans, whether that remains the commitment of the president. And the answer was yes, it does remain a commitment of his. But today is not a day to engage in this kind of debate. 

[00:16:50]


Reporter: We just got word that an entire entire classroom of students was not accounted for. We were told that you are in class -- would suggest that an entire kindergarten class was gunned down in this horrible incident. 
Megyn: Rick leventhal, we will come back to you in a moment. The reporting seems to be coming together from multiple sources. Twenty-six people dead, including 18 children. An entire kindergarten class unaccounted for. A man wearing full camouflage. Black combat gear, and a military style vest went into a kindergarten classroom and opened fire with a clock and semi automatic 9-millimeter handgun. They said that 100 shots were fired. We have not yet confirmed any of this directly with the police. An entire kindergarten class is unaccounted for. We have bill daley now, what are your thoughts and we have heard so far? 
>> It is so much to absorb on so many different levels. Among law enforcement standpoint, what they are doing right now as they go to through this, it has to be terrific. These parents and family are related and to go to one of these crime scenes is very emotional to them as they carry out their duties. One of the things we are hearing now is that there is potentially a second person. We didn't know that there was a person that was carrying out this act. Providing some kind of aiding and abetting to this individual who entered the school. We always ask why. The big why question. I'm sure they'll come out in time. Right now, it is a crime scene that has now been put under control with the devastation that this person has left behind. It is up to the police we put together what happened. Maybe even out the perpetrators home, which sounds like it could even be new jersey. What would this person to commit this act. It sounds very personal and very specific. What is the connection? There are even suggestions that may have been a father or a relative. These are all unconfirmed. There is a lot of information floating around at this time. I think the key thing here is that as they go through it, they want to make sure they have secured the site. There is a second person, like we saw in aurora, colorado, then they will deal with that and take care of. 

[00:19:42]


Megyn: On the phone with us now we have a mother of a student at sandy hook elementary school. Thank you so much for being with us. How old is your child, and if he or she with you. 
>> My daughter is eight years old. She is in the next room. 
Megyn: Thank god. How did you hear the news this morning? 
>> We received a townwide call from the school board that there had been a shooting in the schools were on lockdown. But they did not say where the shooting was. Because we have had an event like this happen before. There was a shooting near a school. It had nothing to do with the school, then I received a text alert on my phone that there was a shooting at a school on dickinson. That is where my daughter goes to school. So I talked to the parents of a new and they said that there were children being carried out all bloodied. They thought they were dead. I went into total panic. I was numb. I grabbed my daughter and it was the happiest moment of my entire life. The happiest moment. But now being aware of the children that were killed, I am devastated. 
Megyn: Did you have the opportunity to see the other parents at the firehouse? 
>> I saw other parents and achers and I talk to them. I asked what happened. Another mother that I knew said she was in the school, and i said are your girls are right. She said they are fine, but a masked gunman came in and started firing that the principle is dead. I said the principle is dead? This is a vivacious woman who loved children. She was the best principle, okay? It is just hard to believe. You do not expect it anywhere. It's terrible when it happens anywhere. But ucr quaint little downtown here in sandy hook, it is just crazy. 

[00:22:04]


Megyn: Your daughter is eight years old, how do you help her understand? 
>> She's right here, she's okay. They didn't know what was happening until they got into the firehouse. They realize that what was going on. But I still don't know my friends children, if they are okay. I try to call some people, they are not answering their phone. 
Megyn: What is the average class size in the elementary school? 
>> Probably 16 or 17 students. A lot of students, but a small community school. 
Megyn: When you hear that 18 children have died in a kindergarten class unaccounted for -- does that make sense to you in terms of numbers? 
>> Yes,absolutely. 
Megyn: Pc the children and the community revolves around the schools. Especially a country school to a large extent. How do you function? How do you go on from here? 
>> Personally I feel guilty even talking to you and the other news outlets because I feel i should respect the families and those who were killed. I don't know if they are friends of mine were friends of my daughters. 
-- I feel terrible. Especially around christmas time. 
Megyn: That is the thing. We are in the middle of, to an 11 date for christmas. 
>> Exactly. 
Megyn: It appears that we are waiting for official news conference about 26 the 26 people that are dead, including 18 children. Had there been any reports of trouble? Any parent making trouble? Anyone -- you know, sometimes in a small community people are concerned about one person. 
>> No, not at all. Nothing. In the school you have to bus urself in. Secretaries can see you. They buzz you in. I don't know what someone they recognize. Then perhaps -- I don't think they would let someone in with mass. 

[00:24:21]


Megyn: That is a good point. Brenda, I think you so much and I'm happy for you that your little girl is okay. 
>> Thank you and goodbye the one bringing the latest, we are getting reports now. During the press conference may be delayed just a bit. Obviously, they were supposed to start at 1:00 o'clock. We are told within the hour. We believe it is something soon. Now we check in with trace gallagher. 
Reporter: Nbc news has just reported that there was a second shooter. We mentioned earlier that the purple van was surrounded in danbury, just a few miles away from sandy hook. Now, we are being told that, in fact, there is a second gunman in custody. Keep in mind, there are also reports out there that one of the gunman walked in there that have military style camouflage as well as a full body armor, now there our reports about for weapons being involved. Unclear if they are to weapons per shooter, earlier there were reports that someone had been pulled out by the woods near the school. That person was wearing camouflage pants. As soon as they pulled the man out of the woods, he turned to the police, and the parents that were there said I did not do it. So it is unclear if that man may be connected. We are working to confirm this. Now, the reports are for two networks that there is a second shooter that has been taken into custody. 

[00:26:22]


Megyn: Going back to bill daley, what does that tell you? We are using the term second shooter, that is what other news outlets are describing him as. 
>> You know, as much as there is a distinction there, we are talking about someone who appears to be complicit. They are suggesting that he was involved and he was sporting some fashion, we don't know whether he was in the building or not, there are single individuals have a certain event and focus of what they want to do. Some kind of personal connection that drives them to commit these acts, whatever that connection is. In this case, I think that somebody who willingly went along and provided support, aided and abetted, if not committed the acts, is even more horrendous. 
Megyn: I would like to bring you the latest, this is from the associated press, which is now reporting law enforcement officials claim that this is a 20-year-old man, it was a 20-year-old man who was the shooter. Again, from the associated press. With ties to connecticut school. Officials saying that the gun used in the attacks is a .223 caliber rifle. Again, new jersey state police are searching a place that they believe is connected to the shooting. If it is the home of the shooter, we do not know. Bill, do you know what a .22 rifle is? 
>> It just tells me that this is something that someone could have acquired an in number of different stores. 
Megyn: Is this a shot on? 
>> Is used for hunting and other purposes. It doesn't suggest it is what we heard. 

[00:28:24]


Megyn: A semi automatic 9-millimeter glock -- 
>> yes, it would allow him to shoot rounds very quickly and be reloaded very quickly. 
Megyn: We have had with the latest from the white house. 
Reporter: At kearney, jay carney just wrapped up his speech. The shooting was taking place about 10:30 a.M. This morning. The bottom line is that jay carney is being careful. He is not getting ahead of the facts in this case. The federal government was working with state and local law enforcement officials deal with the early stages of this investigation. He did not want to confirm anything in terms of numbers or how this shooting played out. He also did not want to get into how the president personally reacted to this. Clearly, you know that the president is a father himself and realizes the depth of the tragedy. The president is very likely to come out at some point this afternoon and addresses tragedy. 
Megyn: Is it possible that we will hear from the president himself drucker today? 
>> Yes, it is very likely. I think having been to this before, where there has been tragedies like this, president bush, president obama, where they wait a little bit longer to figure out the facts and figure out how deep the tragedy is. Ony have a better handle on that, jay carney said it was likely we would see the president come out. 
Reporter: Here is jay rney moments ago. 
>> At approximately 10:30 a.M. This morning in the oval office, the president was notified by his homeland security adviser john brennan of the shooting in newtown, connecticut. At an elementary school. The president has been receiving more updates about this incident. As the day perceives, as we get more information, we will certainly provide it to you. 

[00:30:41]


Megyn: We will get back to you as news warrants. Fox news has confirmed that the shooter is a 20-year-old man. A 20-year-old man we do not know whether he had a child and that's cool. We were told it was catered for. Kindergarten usually around five years old. That doesn't mean that he couldn't be the father of a student there. It does seem a little young, but we don't know enough right now. We are being told the press conference is expected within the next 40 minutes and we will get the first briefing we have had from the people who actually know what happened. The least better than nothing. Now we have dr. Keith ablow, he joins me via skype. We really need to hear from him today. Everyone out there is feeling disconcerted and sat and stared. Wondering if this is the society that we live in, fearing for the parents of little children. Can you help put it into any sort of perspective for us? 
>> As to the fear and the shock, I understand. The red line, beyond which even the bravest were unhinged among us, this, kindergartners, a classroom perhaps of them, they are unaccounted for. Perhaps gone. This kind of shock resonates with people because it seems like the unthinkable keeps on moving into the sphere of our reality. I think people have to reach out to their kids. They have to tell them that in terms of the probability of it happening to them, it is rare. Also, they should be told that these things don't come out as bogeyman. These are sick and depraved people. But there are ways that they can be identified sooner and we will work to find the ways and we should work to rebuil?? our mental health care system. In the end, there will be things that this person said that folks and there will be things that people shake their heads out and say, how did they not act on that? We are really not prepared to act on that. The system in the mental health care arena is so full of holes. So fragmented and fragile. So underfunded. So I think there should be a wake-up call to rebuild that. And then we should let children help other kids. We should give them something to do with their grief and fear to reach out to these other families. These other families and kids, and do something to try to reassure them and show them that they care. 

[00:33:29]


Megyn: Yes, trying to empower them in some way area to talk about the red lines. It is well put. Even though you know there is depravitd evil in the society, you'd like to believe that there are lines that just don't get cross. Is there reason to believe that? A sociopath has no empathy. There is no feeling at all. The real question is why have there not been more things like this ithe past, and what is making them seem to come out now 
>> well, you and I have spoken about this before both on and off the air. Just as a culture and society, is being diminished by things like reality tv and facebook. Taking people to a fictional rome. I guess you could add computer games to that. Now people feel less for one another. They can think of them almost as third parties or entertainment figures were animated creatures. For the people among us who are vulnerable to acts of violence, those who are violently ill, if you will, that means that they can consider others even less than ever before. So in general, our capacity to resonate with each other stealingbeing reduced, as i believe it is. The outliers are that much less able to feel anything. That red line will keep shifting. Sadly, presidents is a terrible thing for people who are inclined towards violence. What it does is move the bar. Once you have had one shooting in a kindergarten, and I hate to even say it, and yet as a scientist I know it, there could be others. 
Megyn: People have to remember what he said at the top. Statistically the odds of something like this happening to a child or your family are very rare. You think of the number of students to go to school everyday and have for decades in this country, and then a tragedy like this has unfolded. I do want to ask you if there is anyway of moving forward for these families? Everyone here is feeling for these families. Families of all 26 kids dead. Twenty-seven total, if you count the gunman. Eighteen of whom are children. I know you say give children help, and of the mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers of those children. How would you wake up tomorrow? How would you have your breakfast and function in this world? 

[00:36:17]


>> Well, that's the best thing, by the way, you can tell them. That is what I would tell them in this office. I cannot fathom the depth of your grief. I give you credit for your courage. I think that somewhere out of your incredible wound can come extraordinary sensitivity, such that you would be an incredible gift to other people might. Yet I hesitate to even ask that. Knowing now how much they are suffering, and I know that it's possible. But I don't pretend to know everything that you are feeling, and I invite you to tell me. Please tell me, because silence is the enemy of healing. 
Megyn: You know, sadly we have 17 other families of children that need to be comforted. Not to diminish the reports of the deceased adults. We heard one mother's testimony about a young vibrant woman. So oftentimes the adults and victims get overlooked. Each loss is profound. The odds are those dead adults have families as well. Please don't go away, doctor, we need you. There is a lot of information that will be coming out as well. We still have the leeway here and I would like to get live to trace gallagher as well. He has a new news development. A home that is being searched near the shooting scene. Reporter: 
>> We do know, in fact, they have confied that a second person is being questioned. We do not yet know if that person has been taken into custody or arrested. That certainly has been questioned. There are reports that it was, in fact, the man, who we said earlier was brought out of the wooded area by the school and then turned to a parent and, i did not do it. That is a person who is being questioned. No word if he is a suspect or a person of interest. On top of that, as he said, there is no home reportedly being searched in newtown. That home being searched, authorities say is connected to this shooting. Again, we talked about a purple van being surrounded earlier by authorities. We have not heard anything else about that. We are getting more information about the chain of events. Apparently what happened is the shooter went into the principal's office first. When the shooting happened, the morning announcements were underway, and apparently the rest of the school could hear the violence in the shooting over the school intercom. As you said as far as class size, we have confirmed that there are two kindergarten classes at sandy hook elementary school. Both of those classes have 17 students each in there. We know that children have been killed. The numbers apparently are very much in sync, and an entire kindergarten class remains unaccounted for. 

[00:39:37]


Megyn: Trace gallagher, thank you. Bring you this information from washington. Two sources saying, which is not unexpected, this is not to believe it the terrorism is going on in this country -- clearly it is terrorism of some kind. It was not terrorism by some to hottest group. We will try to get more information on that. That is what we are talking about. Fox news has confirmed that a 20-year-old gunman initial reports said that he went into the administration office and then he went directly to a kindergarten. As we await the official word, is that he walked into a kindergarten classroom and took out two or four or weapons. Yet a tary style vest on and started shooting. 
Reporter: Let's go to the press and listen. 
Megyn: They are just testing a microphone. We are going to get the information shortly. 
Megyn: We will pause for one moment when a fox news stations join us now. This is coverage of the deadly shooting coverage in connecticut. We are now getting our first briefing reading from the officials on scene. Let's listen. 
>> We would like to get information as quickly as possible. The governor's chief concern is making sure that the families have information as quickly as possible. That is where he is now. This is lieutenant paul dans from the stately. 
>> Thank you. We will set up regular press briefings as appropriate. Just after 9:30 a.M. This morning, newtown police received a 911 call for an emergency at the elementary school. The newtown pd, we contacted the connecticut state police and surrounding local police departnts. On an off-duty troopers responded to the school. And newtown police, immediately upon arrival, enter the school and began a complete active shooter search of the building. That included checking every door, every crack and crevice and portion of the school. The main objective was to evacuate as quickly and efficiently as possible. Any and all students, and faculty in the school. The entire school was searched. The staging area was set up. The students and staff were put into that staging area. Soon thereafter, the children and staff are we united with her parents and loved ones. There were several fatalities at the scene. Both students and staff. There is no information relative to that. The shooter is deceased inside the building. There is a great deal of work that is undertaken immediately upon locating the shooter, and that is there is a great deal of search one activity, a reat deal of law enforcement activity, both in and out of state to make sure that we cover all the bases relative to the specific individual. Suffice it to say, the scene is secure. State police and the newtown police department and danbury beauty are working to answer the questions about what happened. As was said, we will keep you breathed and informed on a regular basis. We will put everything out via our website with these press conferences. I turn it back over now. 

[00:43:37]


>> The governor to call from president obama, a little while ago, he call to his express his condolences on behalf of the nation and himself. He pledged whatever resources the federal government can bring to bear to assist the families and the investigation. We will get you information as soon as we can get the families the information. That is where the governor is. At some point later today the governor will be here and we will set up regular briefings. Thank you. 
[Inaudible conversations] 
>> again, no questions at this time. I apologize or it we are not able to answer any questions. The scene and secure. The situation is secure. We will notify you shortly when we come back for another briefing. As quickly as we can. 
Megyn: Precious little information coming from the scene of a devastating school shooting in newtown, connecticut, where authorities confirm there have been several fatalities, including students and staff at the sandy hook elementary school this morning. The distress call came in shortly after 9:00 a.M. Eastern time. They did confirm that the shooter is deceased and the building. We are working to track down records of a second suspect somehow involved in this. We believe is being questioned by law enforcement on a second location. We are trying to track that down to confirm exactly what, if any role, that person the economist. You heard the law enforcement officer there, lieutenant paul davis said that they do not believe the public is in danger. But that they are pursuing are torn activity and law enforcement activity in and out of the state. At this hour, we have confirmed independently that 27 people are dead, including the gunman. Twenty-six victims, 18 people of whom are children. We believe the vast majority, if not all of them were in a kindergarten class inside of the elementary school. A 20-year-old man, fox news has confirmed, went into the school and started shooting at least two weapons, which we were told were semi- utomatic hanuns, including a 9-millimeter and a glock. We will give you more information for continuing coverage. I am megyn kelly in new york. 

[00:46:17]


Megyn: Giving life to break leventhal. The shooter remains inside the school that is deceased? 
Reporter: The other key point, the public not in danger. They would not address -- i asked about a second suspect in custody, you heard the state police would not confirm that. We are being told by other sources that a person is being questioned by authorities here in connecticut. We are told this person has not been arrested or taken into custody at. It could be someone they are concerned is connected, but may not be. There are a number of law enforcement activities taking place right now, including search warrants being served on homes. We are told that one of those homes may be in connecticut. Another might be in new jersey. We are also told that the shooter has been identified as a 20-year-old male. The police would not get into the numbers. But we have to remember that we are roughly four hours since this mass shooting occurred. There's a lot that is still not put together yet. Very early in the investigation. As we said earlier, crime scene is very difficult at this point for them to process. There are so many victims. The police would not confirm the number, but we have been told by multiple sources, including federal agents, that there may be as many as 27 people dead. That includes possibly 18 children. Eight adults and the shooter, as well as the principal of the sandy hook ohman preschool. 
Megyn: Thank you, rick. We will get back to you momentarily. One of the worst shootings in u.S. History. Thirty-two people dead at virginia tech, now we are being told that the number is 26 victims plus the shooter, and makes 27. At the sandy hook elementary school. In connection with this case. Preliminary numbers as we ntinue to await official confirmation from those who are on the scene. You can understand why they don't want to give too many details at this time. I'm sure there are a lot of families going through a lot right now and trying to figure out whether their child is among the dead. Bill daley is back with me. The fbi is now assisting the local on enforcement with this for the white house. What did you pick up on a? 

[00:48:46]


>> As much as we'd all like to get more information with details, I think the way they approach this is not to be too much ahead of the curve. To notify the next of kin, understand what is happening before tsay anything. From our standpoint, we are wondering what else is going on. It is quite inspiring that within a few hours, but they move very uickly on a number of different fronts. They're probably getting subpoenas. The fbi is insisting that local law enforcement goes across state lines. In an effort to get more information about this individual, or another individual that they are questioning. The lieutenant who was speaking, it may not mean that it is certainly -- you know, a fact -- but he did not say that they confronted the gunman when going into school. So suggesting that the gunman was already deceased when he went into the school. As he went through his walk-through of what they did room by room in gathering the children and staff and taking them to a safe area to get him out of school. I don't know whether that tells us something about your gunman having taken his own life, but as we hear more about it, this gunman went into the school and there was no way to stop them. They had some clues. We don't know. But the shooter was in there for a period of time. He was with automatic weapons and he fired on children and staff. 
Megyn: I know you are not a psychiatrist, but you have been in law enforcement long time. Have you start to understand how someone puts on a military style dress an takes at least two semiautomatic handguns and those in their and starts executing 5-year-old? 

[00:50:47]


>> You know, in law-enforcement, you have to take a step back. 
Megyn: How do you understand it though? Have you understand that? Have you seen something like that? Is it just a sociopath? Someone who can take a life -- that is who they are? In your history, how do you understand that kind of evil? The amount the thing is that you can't. There are good and evil and people have chosen evil. This is evil incarnate. That is why the good people come to people who up for what is right and good, supporting each other, looking after each other, they are the ones that are good. Evil is always there, and that is why we have law enforcement and teachers and other people out there trying to identify people before it hurts our childr sometimes that people doesn't catch everyone. And it isn't as solid as we would like to be. But we know that as a result of this, people need to go off and do good things. Continuing to do good things to help each other and society. Otherwise people will take over. 
Megyn: Stand by for just a moment. Joining us now is a mother who lost her child. Her daughter, rachel, and the columbine shooting. Her son survive. Beth, thank you for being here. We need your perspective as well today. What are your thoughts as we wonder what the parents are going to? 
>> Well, my first reaction is I'm extremely angry. So angry. Angry that a man would kill babies. And these are just little babies. As far as the periscope, they are not going to know what to do for a long time. With the columbine shooting, my son craig survived but rachel did not. It was like there were times when it was real, and other times it wasn't and you kind of block out the pain of that. The anguish of that. Or at least a year or possibly more, there were times when was just going through the motions of having lost rachel. Also having to deal with a very emotionally crippled young man, because this gentlemantness all of the violence. And then his sister was the first one that was killed. My heart races. I just feel that these parents 

[00:53:29]


-- they are going to hurt so bad for so long and there's there is not much you can do to console them. Losing a little child like this, it makes me very angy. It makes me extremely angry 
[crying] 
megyn: In the same way that your daughter and son were totally defenseless, these children were totally defenseless. The most defenseless you could find on this earth. We are told that there are 26 innocent victims in all of this. Including the 18 children. Did you find peace? 
>> We did, but it came much later. But there does come a day when you don't cry all day long. There does come a day when the severe pain and loss isn't self-evident. It's not so penetrating. But it takes a long time to get to that point. I would like to offer hope that right now these parents can't imagine hope. All they understand is that, hamas. Even though people believe that things will get better. The truth is that is not reality to them at this point in time. It won't be a reality for a very long time. Because you can't get past the pain. It took years to get there, there came a day when I laughed again and talking about rachel, I could talk about her without bursting into tears or had a flood of emotions come out. And we found some good things to do. We have channeled our energy and anger for what has happened. And we did our best to be positive and we were able to take racial legacy and use it for something very positive. Which did bring forth healing. These children are too little. Too little to have anything like that. The birthdays and their moments 

[00:55:52]


-- the little children. It is going to be extremely difficult. My heart is broken for them. It is just broken. I wish icould help them, but there is no shortcut. No shortcut into something of this nature's. 
Megyn: If there is anyone who can do something, maybe it's something like you. Someone who has walked through the pain, as they say. Columbine happened almost 13 years ago, peace and happiness is at least possible. For the victims of these families of this tragedy. Thank you for being with us. There is a lot of news unfolding.

Megyn: Fox news alert. Chaos and fear and heartbreak at an elementary school in connecticut when a gunman walks into the building and opens fire we believe on a kindergarten class, leaving we belie, leaving 26 people dead including 18 children. It's the worst shooting tragedy ever in the state of connecticut and the second worst in u.S. History. It all happened just after 9:30 a.M. At the sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut just after classes got underway. Fox news confirming the shooter was a 20-year-old man with ties to the school. He was reportedly dressed in black combat gear with a military vest and hat multiple guns between 2 and 4. A s.W.A.T. Team among the throngs to respond to the school. All of this less than two weeks before christmas and in the middle of hanukkah. Here is lieutenant paul vance of the connecticut state police department moment ago. 

[01:01:23]


>> I can give you basic and grief information as we know it now. We'll set up regular press briefings as appropriate. Just after 9:30 this morning newtown police received a 911 call for an emergency at the elementary school. After obtaining information we contacted the state police and surrounding police departments. Troopers responded to the school and newtown police immediately upon arrival entered the school and began a complete active shooter search of the building. That included checking every door,er crack, crevice and portion offed the school, our objective was to evacuate any and all students and faculty in the school. Entire school was searched. That was accomplished. The staging area was set up. The students and staff were put into that staging area and soon after the children and staff were reunited with their staff and loved ones. There were several fatality at the scene. Both student and staff. There is no information relative to that that being released at this time until we made complete proper notification. The short is deceased inside the building. There is a great deal of work undertaken immediately upon locate can the shooter. There is a great deal of search warrant activity to insure we cover all the bases relative to that specific individual. Suffice it to say the scene is secure. State police major crime squad, newtown police department, the state's attorney and many agencies are working together to answer all the questions around what happened. We'll keep you briefed and keep you informed on a regular basis. We'll put everything out. Via our web site, and with these press conferences. 
Megyn: That was the last update we had. Rick leventhal is live at a park near the school. 

[01:03:29]


>> Reporter: Immediately after that I asked the officer whether he had any information on a second shooter, a possible accomplice who might be in custody and he would not go into it. He said second address that. But he did say the public was not in danger. They are questioning that person is in custody and that person has not been confirmed as being related to this shooting. We are hearing other sources which are the numbers which are horrific. 27 dead, apparently 18 of them children. An entire kindergarten class unaccounted for. The classes run in size from 17-18 children. A gunman walked into this elementary school and opened fire on a kindergarten class and killed a number of teachers. We are told the principal as well before apparently killing himself. We know the entire neighborhood has been shut down around sandy hook elementary school. Police are blocking the roads. They reunited parents with the children in the school and there are 600 kids inside that school who attend that school on a daily basis. Neighborhood shut down. The school on lockdown. The rooms have been searched but there is a major crime scene that must be processed. Bodies in the school. Die grams and photographs that must be taken before that scene will be cleared. We are look at a lengthy process, perhaps days. We are waiting for further updates from the police here at this park close to the school. But we can't get anywhere near to it bring you any more information about what's happening inside those walls. 
>> We are getting more information on the wires here in studio. And none of it is good. Joining me now mark fuhrman, a former l.A.P.D. Police detective and fox news contributor. Talk to me about how the police are supposed to process this crime scene. 

[01:05:30]


>> As difficult as it is, these men and women have to process the most horrendous scene where children are the recipient of adult violence. It's tragic but they have to go through it. So when you look at this scene, certainly now you have the homicide of 26 people and the suicide of one, you have to process this scene for the weapons for the suspect. You have to look at certainly we are talking about the weapons. So you have to know what casings from these semi-automatic weapons are on the floor, how many calibers we are dealing with. You have to account for the weapons. I heard you report there was a 223 supposedly used. If that is the case, there would be rifle casings on the floor. 
Megyn: What is that? 
>> It's an ar platform. It's a caliber of a rifle round it's most predominantly in a type of military -- para military platform. Most people generically call them assault weapons. It's a semi-automatic weapons. I'm not sure they make any platform other than pistols. I don't believe they do. If there are three or four weapons all accounted for, then you could assume or at least start to speculate that one person had all four weapons. Were they in his possession. Were they in close proximity to his body? Two suspects -- if one suspect is gone and they didn't flee on foot, there would be a vehicle missing. There should be a vehicle that the suspect transported himself to the location. It should still be there. They will account for that. But the process of the scene is a homicide and we don't know at a later time -- is there a conspiracy to commit this act? What is the motive of this act? Does it pertain to, involve other people that actually supplied this man with anything and they knew this act was actually going to take place? In other words, a conspiracy. So the investigation and the processing of the scene has to be done correctly and it will take 2-3 days and there will have to be a task force set up because you can't expect one detective or one team to stay up for 2 or 3 days. They will get ragged and they will make mistakes. So this will take some time. It will be emotionally taxing on everybody that's inside that school. 

[01:08:20]


Megyn: I want you to stand by for just a minute. I'm told trace gallagher has breaking news and is following information regarding the home that was searched. Is that the case, trace? 
>> Reporter: We talked about this home being searched. We had no idea what connection it was to the school shooter. Now one of the locals is reporting that there was a body that was found inside that home in newtown and they are investigating whether it might be -- and again we say might be -- none of this has been confirmed -- the body of the mother of the shooter. We said there was a second person of interest who was being questioned by police. We have no word if that person has been arrested or taken into custody. Simply being questioned. That would if you are connecting the dots eliminate that person as being connected to this new town, connecticut home. Reports are that a body was found inside this home and it may have been the mother of the shooter. Again we are going by local reports. So we want to make sure that very clear. Top add one more exclamation point. A car being used? We knew earlier a car was cordoned off at the entrance to the school. It had been taped off. Unclear if that was the car of the shooter, about it was park the right directly in front of the exit and entrance to this elementary school. 
Megyn: Keep work our sources and bring us the information as you get it. We now confirmed the it was a 20-year-old shooter. We are getting information, there are reports about this identity. We are not going to go with that until we know for sure the identity of the shooter. But I want to ask you, mark. We confirmed it's a 20-year-old man. Earlier this week we saw a mass shooting -- an attempted mass shooting, two people dead at a mall out in the portland, oregon area. That was a 22-year-old shooter. What's going on? 

[01:10:29]


>> I'm certainly not equipped to tell you psychologically what's going on. I never quite understood most crimes on the street. But when you look at this you will be able to go backwards. When trace gallagher was reporting about finding a body at that home, possibly the mother of the shooter, that was not a surprise to me. I suspected they would find a relative, a girlfriend or wife at that location. Certainly the first thing they do is try to secure the suspect's locations, do search warrant and try to circle the wagons around any possibility of something that would continue or to collect evidence. But when you look at these shootings, you kind of wonder what is the cause? And I know people are going to say guns. But that's not the issue. It's the people -- we watched this nation be brought to it's its its knees by men with box cutters. That not the issue. It's the people. To be candid. I can couple with nothing short of mental illness that would lead somebody to think they were going to prove something. Or accomplish something except for immortality in the most black and bizarre and macabre way. 
Megyn: The extreme cowardice of a military vest and combat gear to go in and execute a couple of dozen 5-year-olds. There is no one who can help us understand that. But just the sheer illness and cowardice of it. 
>> One more thing, megyn. When you hear that he had already killed or most probably killed his mother at a location that he probably left from this morning, he knew that he was never coming back. An what else just -- 

[01:12:35]


megyn: Before you finish that thought we are told we believe this video is the police outside of the home where we believe this woman's body was found. Initial reports are that it may be a woman linked to the gunman, possibly the mother. All unconfirmed. Go ahead, mark. 
>> You just look at this. He was -- he was tidying up his mentally disturbed life. He killed a person at the residence that he was either related to or stayed at. He was never coming back there. He was never leaving this crime scene. Whether he was shot by the police or he totally and absolutely always intebledded to take his own life. You ask about what is going on. I see one thing we have people that are going to commit suicide that somehow want to be less anonymous in the realm of suicide and more famous in the area of homicide. I don't understand it. I never understood it. But it is the fact that this is the society we live in now. 
Megyn: Mark, thank you. Dr. Ablow will be back with us in just a bit. We are going to check back in with him. But I want to get to an expert on school security. Bob, thank you for being here. Your thoughts on what we have seen. 
>> How do you prepare for something like this? As much as we are in schools around the world, we set up protocol. You look at the relationship between the police department and the school. You look at the crime statistics in the neighborhood. You look at your parents who have domestic violence issues. These are part of a good scenario to build a preventative program. But when you see something like this, this is almost impossible to prevent. 
Megyn: They had security in place. I know you have done security for connecticut schools. They had a security system where you had to be buzzed in. They had to see you on the camera before you get into the school. We are told the shooter had quote ties to the school. I don't know what that means but something failed. 

[01:14:56]


>> That's why you have a close relationship with your psychiatrist and local police department. Because you want to know if there is a domestic violence situation in town. The school and the police have to work with each other in order to respond. It is something the police are aware of. We don't know here yet what the case is. 
Megyn: But the odds of this guy having behaved completely normally and not having had any red flags prior to this day -- 
>> they are slim. There has got to be some issues here. The police are looking through his facebook and telephone calls. They are look at the hard drive on the computer. They are checking everything out in his past and current past. One to make sure no one else is involved, that there is no other coconspirators. How did he get to this point, how did this happen? 
Megyn: What can you say to the parents who have kids in school. You don't think about -- there are areas in this country where schools are near war zones and it's a tragedy and a story in itself. But most parent send their children to school and they don't worry about their safety. What do you say to them now? 
>> I can tell you as a co-chair with the terrorism task force in ne york, being involved with dare america with police officers going into the schools on a regular basis it's a matter of having that relationship as strong as it can be it's making sure the parents, the teachers, the school board, the police are all working in concert with one another. You do the best nuk terms of preventing a situation like this from occurring. 
Megyn: Most schools are safe. 
>> Some schools have metal detectors. This was a nice lovely beautiful town where parents let their little children go to school in kindergarten and first grade to feel perfectly safe. 

[01:17:07]


Megyn: Like most towns and schools in america. Most towns and schools in america choose to live as a free society and we won't have metal detectors where our 5-year-olds go in to learn the most basic lessons. So that's a decision we make. But you have to have some line of security. Here the days and weaks ahead will tell us what the failing was. That's not a judgmental thing. It's a let's learn from it. But it appears he was buds in when he shouldn't have been or piggy backed on somebody. Somehow found a way in. Do schools need to take this as an opportunity to revisit even the most basic security procedures they have in place? 
>> Yes. One of the failures we have is we tendo think because we are in a safe neighborhood and we can get out of the city and go to new jersey or long island or connecticut or anywhere across our country where we are away from the big cities and away from the crime population that we have a sense of security. Very often those are the areas where you need more security because you don't have the police officer on the corner with a weapon to be able to shoot this guy. No one was around with a weapon fast enough to kill him. 
Megyn: Do most schools have a security officer. 
>> Most schools have a security officer from the local dhoapt is assigned to the school. But he's not in the school all day. Most of these small towns maybe have 8, 10, 15 police officers. They hardly have enough part time police officers to even do the dare program to teach kids about drugs and violence. It's not like you have a full-time police officer. The kids sometimes in the dare program will tell the dare officer their far it is violent, their mother is violent. They have a brother or uncle who is violent. You get information by communicating with the kids. 

[01:19:09]


Megyn: This is looking like it wasn't the father of a student. He's only 20. We don't know. If this is some random shooting. He has some ties to the elementary school. If it's a random shooting how do you foresee that and plan against it? 
>> It's hard. That's why you do the best in terms of the cctv and a system to let people into the school. You build perimeters outside the school. 
Megyn: It's when your guard is down at something happens. 
>> It may change the way that we go fly on an airplane. This may be what it took for schools to wake up and change the way they conduct security. You don't get near that school without going through perimeter security. With a gait going up -- if he's dressed in combat gear and wearing a military-style vest and he has between 2-4 weapons. A .223 caliber rifle. No one is going to buzz him in if that's visible. The point you make about the police is an interesting one. I have two kids. Now I want to see an armed police officer in the schools. I never even thought about that trier to now. What would that take to have an armed police officer in every school? 
>> I think we just saw it. Every town we deal with with the dare program, it has lost about a third of its teaching capability across the country because of budget cuts in local municipalities. It's a reality we live with. Budgets are down in cities and towns across our country and they can't afford to have the programs. How are they going to afford to put a full-time police officer into the school? They will have to the preventative programs we recommend for sls in terms of perimeter security. Cctv. All that will have to be put into place. In addition you might have to have a security officer that doesn't have necessarily not a police officer but an armed security officer. 

[01:21:27]


Megyn: It could be something parent pay for. 
>> I think lit change the way we look at tngs. For schools this will be what 9/11 was for airports. 
Megyn: I want to get to trace gallagher with breaking news. 
>> Reporter: We just confirmed the shooter is identified. He is 20-year-old ryan lanza. We are trying to figure out. We have some pictures and identifications. We want to make sure we have the right guy before we put his picture up on the air. He's now the short and apparently according to other reports he lived in newtown, connecticut in fairfield county. Because the other reports were police went to his home and reportedly found a body inside that home that they are investigating the possibility the body may have been the mother of 20-year-old ryan lanza. We do know that in fact you can see directly below me, this is a picture of 20-year-old ryan lanza. You said earlier he had a connection to the school. The school at 9:30 goes into lockdown. Before you can get in the front door you have to be buds in. They can see what you look like then you give them a reason why you want to come in. If this guy was buds in, it's unclear. We are being told ryan lanza is 24 years old. This would change things. We were figuring out how would a 20-yold have a connection to the school if he didn't work at the school. If you are 20 years old it's highly unlikely you would have a student who goes to the school. If he is 24 years old, maybe this is not someone who worked for or with the school. Maybe this was a parent of a student at the school. We are trying to work all that out. He was buzzed in through a new security system which apparently was just put in place a couple weeks ago but has been in place in much of fairfield county where you cannot get in the front door unless you are given clearance to get in the front door. 

[01:23:46]


Megyn: Stand by with me. I want to update our viewers. At sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut just after 9:30 a.M. We believe this man, 24-year-old ryan lanza went into the school wearing combat gear, a full military-style vest and had between 2-4 weapons including a glock and a semi-automatic. We believe he found his way into one of the kindergarten classrooms. We are told an entire kindergarten class remains unaccounted for. We are told 27 people are dead if you include the gunman. Ryan lanza. Of the 26 innocent victims. 18 are children. That is our information at this hour. There had been reports that over 100 shots were fired. We have not been able to confirm that. We don't know how many shots were fired. And the police say that the shooter is dead inside the classroom. We believe that the bodies of the victims remain inside the school as well as the police continue to process the crime scene and we are trying to get more information now on reports of a possible second suspect. Keep in mind sometimes these things come down and they don't turn out to be anything. But we did learn earlier there is a house near the school in which a body had been found and there were early reports this person may have been related to ryan land today, perhaps his mother. Back to trace now with more. 
>> Reporter: You are talking about more information about this short. We just read his facebook page and matched the picture. He is 24 years old. He lives in hoboken, new jersey. You heard rick leventhal talk about how police were searching a home in new jersey. He's from newtown, connecticut. His mom lived in newtown, connecticut. He lives in who broken, new jersey. Was he a former student? What capacity does he have a connection to this elementary school and why was he buzzed in. That's the information we are getting. He's from newtown, connecticut but he lives currently or currently lived in who broken, new jersey. And that's why authorities are also in new jersey searching the home there. So the puzzle is getting a little bit more pieced together. But as you mention, other potential suspect or person of interest police are talking to. We have gotten very little more information about what role he may or may not have played in any of this. 

[01:26:35]


Megyn: I want to go to tony perkins who we happen to be fortunate enough to have with us today. He's the president of the family research council. What an important day for faith and what a challenge to it for those families. 
>> As a father of five kids my heart is broken for those families. As a former police officer that has been at crime scenes before I can only imagine the stress these officers will have in processing this crime scene. You are right, in times like these we see communities across the country turn to faith. Churches open their drs, they reach south. It's part of the grieving process as this continues to unfold. Many people will be trying to make sense of this and you can't. There are some things in life you simply cannot make sense out of. This one of those senseless acts of violence. Our staff in washington today -- we are gathering even in this hour praying for these families. Most of us have kids. And every american is touched by a tragedy like this. 
Megyn: The family research council was targeted not too long ago by a madman who shot the guard. He's okay now. 
>> He's back to work. 
Megyn: You have bent victim of violence. Dr. Ablow was on earlier talking about the depravity and disconnection people feel from society. Because we have become so obsessed with online and game or waste is. America looks very different than it looked 30 years ago. We don't interact with each other the way we did 30 years ago. Faith has been diminished as well. Faith has been something that's been a common thread in america that bound us to one another for so long. 
>> It has been a common thread and we find tonight times like these. In tragedies that's where we turn to. It's part of who we are as a people. Innately we have a need to reach out. And it's only when we trust our creator. And those who have a relationship with christ or sense of spirituality, but as i come from the evangelical world, it helps us process this grief. 

[01:29:06]


Megyn: It helps us look out for one another. You go to church just to bind with the community, to have that shared experience. It could be a concert. The shared experience of up and down and together and bond. But we need to have that bond. 
>> It keeps us account be as individuals. It keeps us connect candidate as a community. And that's why -- it keeps us connected as a community. We see a callousness and coarseness of our society that is troubling to all of us. If I were to say religion would solve our problems, relationship won't solve our problems. Having a relationship with christ, with the judeo christian world view, that makes sense for us individually. But as a society we moved away from that. And it is important that we bring that back in and not he can collude it from the pc square. It is -- and not exclude it from the public square. Who knows what motivated this guy to do this. But we need to be looking out for others and having a moral standard of what's acceptable d what's not. Clearly this is not acceptable. But how do we prevent tragedies like this from occurring again? 
Megyn: A lot of people go to temple, they go to church on a day like this and look to connect with their fellow human becomes to remind themselves we are here together and we have this shared experience. For some of us there is a higher power that will help us through it. 
>> We should all be praying for these families today. 
-- As a parent of a 5-year-old I can only tell you my heart is broken for them. 
Megyn: We are going to take a quick break. We'll be back in moment with dr. Keith ablow who earlier shared this message:Those who lived this firsthand. The mothers and favorites and brothers and sisters of those 18 children. I don't know how you would wake up tomorrow and have your breakfast and function in this world. 

[01:31:26]


>> That's the best thing, by the way you can tell them. That's what I would tell them this office. I cannot fathom the depth of your grief. I give you credit for your courage. I think somewhere out of your incredible wound could come extraordinary sensitivity such that you would be an incredible gift to other people in life. Yet I hesitate to ask that of you knowing now how much you are suffering. Yet I know that's possible for you. But I don't pretend to know everything you are feeling and i invite to you tell me, please tell me, because silence is the enemy of healing here. ] time...

[01:35:16]


Megyn: Fox news alert. You can see the scene in newtown, connecticut as we have remained with the number of 26 dead. 277, including the gunman. 27, including the gunman. There are reports from other news outthreats not independently confirmed by fox news that that the shooter may have been the son of the kindergarten class teacher. We are working to confirm that. Please take it for what it's worth. Two news outlets confirming that. We did hear earlier that the body of a woman had been found in a house nearby the school and she may have had ties to the shooter. We were told the shooter lived in hoboken, new jersey. We are doing our best not to get ahead of our skis on it so bear with us. Ken, thanks for being here. Something didn't go right here. How can we learn from it? 
>> As you know, as a mother, i was standing on the play ground of my own children's school supervising elementary kids as this started break as a favorite volunteer. We know at elementary school levels very often when we see violence incidents arise, shootings or alter cases, they come from domestic situations between parents, non-custodial parents, or school employees. So as this news is unfolding what you just describ could possibly fit some of the things we have seen in the past. I want to say first my prayers going out to the families as a father, that parents need to across the nation are going to be asking questions at their children's school. They are doing so now even at my own school. I just got a text. Parents need to remember they should be sending their kids to school next week because this is the time where schools across the country will be safer because this is the forefront of our minds. What I want parents to know is we need to talk about school safety in the weeks, months and years ahead. As we looked a at budget cuts at school, focus on important things. Test scores, financial issues. It's easier to school safety to fall to the back burner. You hit on something important earlier when you talked about or alluded to training our staff. We could have the locks on the doors, the buzzers, the intercoms. We have to train our school employees. We have to train our parents not to piggy back in when someone ahead of them goes in the door. We need to talk about situations in our families and share those as school employees with our employers if there is a risk and we need to be working with age-appropriate levels with kids to have drills. We don't need to teach kindergarten kids to attack armed intruders and throw pencils at them and I don't think we need a metal detector at every door. But we need alert staff. We need to do our training. 

[01:38:47]


Megyn: I was talking about this earlier with bob tstrang. Should parents think about pooling their resources to pay for armed security guards? Do we need them at schools to protect our kids? If an armed security guard had been on site could this man have unleashed the type of damage he did? 
>> We have school-based police officers. There is some civil rights and special interest groups have just this week been before congress complaining about police officers in schools. And I think that we need to really take a look at the role of the officer. I support having school-based officers. 
Megyn: My apologies. Breaking news outside of the hospital. 
>> They gave limited information. They were talking about three patients who were brought here. But they would not go into particulars about who these people are. Whether they are male or female, children or adult. They wouldn't say anything whatsoever. They saider in the process of notifying the families. And maybe they would end up having a news conference in the next half-hour to an hour or so. At that point they are still not saying whether they are going to be giving us any more information as far as the particulars of these people. However, we did hearhat who these three people are. One is a teacher who was shot either in the foot or the leg. And the other two are children. We were told or we are hearing that those injuries are not life-threatening. Which is so good, that's such good news to hear about these three people considering the tragedy that this town and all of these poor families are dealing with. We have cameras set up here. You have the local reporters in connecticut as well as reporters from new york who came up. You can see all the cameras lined up there waiting to see whether there will be a news conference. The location where they have us -- we are on the campus of the hospital but we are at the medical arts center. 

[01:41:06]


Megyn: The three victims -- we were told three victims were taken to the hospital in connecticut. We had precious little information on them. Now, you heard it from our wnyw affiliate reporter that they are believed to be in a position to recover. Their wound are not life-threatening. That's a big relief in a day of unspeakable tragedy. Ken, you were touching on the issue of armed guards in school and you a raise an interesting issue. Some people have a real objection to that. I suppose the thought is do we want to have somebody with a loaded gun walking around our school campuses when it may not be necessary. When thank god in 99% of circumstances it's never necessary. 
>> One of the things we work hard at in training schools is to have a relationship with their local law enforcement. There are many school police officers assigned from local law enforcement county sheriff's detectives. State police officers, in some cases local police, who do work in our schools and most of them perform a preventative role. They build relationships with kids. They find out about these issues that start at home. Things that may spill over into the school. I think that one tool. Trying to logistically put an officer in every elementary school would be an implementation challenge, financial challenge and I'm not sure if it's something we would be able to do in the short term. The first and best line of defense is a well-trained highly alert school staff and student body who has relationships with their mental health, police and community sponsors. We need mental detectors. We have people with mental health issues. It's not some real thing you can get your hand on that's concrete. We don't deal with that well in our society. 

[01:43:11]


Megyn: If the last few years haven't proved that, I don't know what they proved. 
>> I have been in this business 25 years and I have a very strange feeling as I sit here talk with you today. As a favorite, send your kids to school, talk with your school officials, don't panic. Find out what they are doing. See how you can support. Go out on the playground if you can and help supervise. That's worth a million dollars. 
Megyn: I want to get to trace gallagher. We have breaking news on the shooter and his mother. 
>> Reporter: The information we have is there is a possibility the shooter's mother may have been a teacher at the school. But then we went onto the web site of the school and the two kindergarten teachers don't sounds like it would be the mother. These are reports coming out of there. We have not confirmed them. There is a possibility the mother worked at the school. Going on to ki of as we scan this, ryan lanza lived in hoboken, new jersey. He went to high school in newtown, connecticut. From newtown, connecticut. His mom lived in newtown, connecticut and apparently had some connection to the school. He was a graduate of newtown high school. And police confirmed there was a body found in there. And it is a very strong possibility the body was the shooter's mother. We are now trying to get more information about what he did for work. 
Megyn: Just to jump in. Our justice department sources are telling us that ryan lanza's mother nancy is presumed dead. That's what we are being told. His mother is being presumed dead. That she did work at that school where the shooting took place. But it's unclear if she was killed in the school or at her home. Also being told his parents were divorced. It's possible the mother lived in connecticut, the father in new jersey. She is presumed dead. They don't know if she was killed in the school or her home. It earlier information was they found a body in the home near the school. 

[01:45:26]


>> Reporter: That's the information we have. There was a body found inside the home belong together mother in newtown, connecticut and she worked for the school. And the report went on to say the belief was that he targeted the mother first, then went and was targeting the students at the school. Remember if you look at the chain of events. He was let through the door sometime between 9:30 and 9:40. Went to the ad min stray tough office and opened fire during the morning announcements and attacked the principal and vice principal and psychologist. The nurse was in there. While the morning announcements were being made the rest of the school could hear the violence and gunfire over the school intercom. At that point apparently went to a classroom. We know a kindergarten class is unaccounted for. We don't know what classroom he went to. But he apparently went to a classroom and shot and killed 18 kid. The information we are getting is he apparently was going to the school to target the kids to begin with. Whether these were her students or former students, still have much unconfirmed. But we are working to find out much more information about 24-year-old ryan lanza. 
Megyn: Moment after we reported from the juice department and the "new york times," also reporting now that the alleged school gunman killed his mother who was a teacher at the school along with student and others. The story does appear to be getting more clear at this hour. Though understanding it remains impossible. We are also just getting comments from a father on the scene who spoke about the horror that any parent would feel upon hearing their child's school has been targeted by a gunman. 
>> There is no words it's sheer terror, and a sense of immediate urgency, and, you know, to get to your child and to be into protect them. Because that's the immediate thing. Is my child hurt? They are alone, they are not with me. How do I get to them. 

[01:47:36]


Megyn: The parents were out the. You can imagine the panic. The full-body panic. You can see tonight some of the pictures. There was one mother I saw earlier, you could see her ringing her hands -- you could see her ringing her hands. There has to be a guiling feeling as well. Forgive me I'm hearing president obama will make on camera comments on this coming up momentarily. I believe just after 3:00 p.M. Eastern time the president will speak to this incredibly awful school shooting in connecticut that began today. We were hoping there were initial reports on another channel that no children were injured. No reports of children injured it read. Now we know the truth is very, very different. Want to get back to dr. Kiet ablow. 
-- Dr. Keith ablow. Those dual feelings of thank god it wasn't my child, then the awful guilt or I don't know what the world is when you realize you are feeling he late as other parents are mourning the death of their 5-year-old who died at at hand of a gunman who gunned them down like they were nothing. 
>> The ran document and cruel nature of this kind of act complicates things psychologically even for the survivors who will need help later on to try to put this in some kind of perspective. Because I worked with people again and again for whom either having a tragedy visit or having survived sit, when a sibling is stricken with cancer. Having not been the one to get sick leads them to feel unsafe. The randomness of it. Unfairness of it. The fact that is there not a lot you as an individual can do to protect yourself from it makes people visit their own mortality and that fine thread from which we all hang. Earlier than you had hoped. Hasn't what these kids are contending with. These will be forever special children perhaps, capable of extraordinary bravery or ema any but also vulnerable in a special way. 

[01:50:06]


Megyn: Your thoughts on what we are hear being this act pat we believe this gunman killed his mother. We believe in the house outside of the school. And it appears he may have killed his mother who are was teacher in this school. 
>> My thoughts are this. As more facts come in, this will likely be another story where you say, well, the unthinkable and inexplicable now is fathomable. We can see the train coming down the tracks. The awful collision coming and sadly spectators by the railway who felt disempowered or didn't file was their place to intervene or even a therapist who didn't think it was time to pull the trigger and hospitalize this person, I think right now this can be sadly a laboratory where we look and say what could have been done. If it's nothing, fine. But it is likely there will be things that could have been done. I can't tell you how many of my colleagues -- I don't mean to call anybody out here -- but in the mental healthcare system i sometimes make strange calls to E.R.s WHERE I WILL SAY YOU Have got to hospitalize this person he was in my office an says he wants to kill somebody. You will hear back from a clinician, well, he's not saying that now. I said now he's in the e.R. And he's saying that to leave. They say he's contracting for safety and the insurance company says they won't pay now. So we have so much fixing to do. 
Megyn: What's it going to take? 32 dead at virginia tech just a couple years ago and we didn't revamp' the mental health system. Now you have 18 dead kids. Is this enough? 
>> I don't know if it's enough because there is so much stigma attached to the mental healthcare system. so much re much retiscence. We have some to empower people to give treatment to those to don't want treatment. 

[01:52:31]


Megyn: Fox news confirming ryan lanza, that his father was also killed in his home in new jersey. This is in addition to his mother being found dead in connecticut. 
>> These stories in my experience as a forensic psychiatrist, the strangers who pay the toll are paying it for intensely personal dramas. Connected usually to incredibly intense psychological conflicts between individuals who are very close to each other. We see it again and again. People kill because there is a spouse at sods with his wife who -- spouse at odds with his wife. 
Megyn: I know you can't answer this but I have to try. I think we are all trying. Then what makes you kill a kindergarten full of babies. 
>> The terrible sense that you are disempowered and you are spiritually dead makes you create in the world an awful canvas representing your interior world. That's not always the case, but that is one way to see this. That you project the fragmented nature of your internal world. The fact that you feel decimated. You create abol of that. An awful, terrible monstrous symbol of it that this will be your legacy. That you have finally spoken and shown everyone what you have been feeling inside. That's the terrible, awful truth. 
Megyn: The shooter is 24 years old. The shooter at the mall shooting in oregon was 22 years old. These are young guys. You mentioned how people lose themselves in certain online activity, game, what have you. I don't know what the background was with these guys. But it doesn't seem totally coincidentally that they are BOTH IN THEIR YOUNG 20s AND Young men. 

[01:54:33]


>> I think we have to look at the forces that empower people to get some knowledge through the internet. But there are a lot of dehumanizing forces that come with that. Reality tv is no friend of preventing such things. Facebook is no friend of preventing such things I have to say. And I think we are at a time again and we mentioned this earlier. We pushed the red line of the unthinkable into kindergarten classrooms. We have got to dial it back. We have got to show a big response here of grief, empathy, outreach to balance the monstrousity of this. That's some kind of insulation against someone saying I think that my forum. That's where I'm going to express myself. How fractured I feel is going to be seen in the blood on the floor of this classroom. 
Megyn: Thank you so much for helping us. We appreciate you being here. I want to bring you this sad update as well. The number of children killed s now been increased to 20. 20 children dead. Five adult dead and the short. 26 dead, 20 of them children. The law enforcement community has not iendently confirmed these are kindergarteners. That is our belief based other reporting. One father said his on was in class when the gunman burst in and shot the teacher. He grabbed a bunch of of his friend and ran. The shooter did not say a word. President obama will speak to the nation at 3:15 p.M. Eastern time. We appreciate you being with us on this important news day. We'll get through it together. Then we'll figure it out together. But our coverage continues now with "studio b." 

[01:56:36]


>> There is no words it of the sheer terror and sense of immediate urgency and to get to your child and to be there to protect them. That what you want -- that's the immediate thing, is my child hurt. You know, they are alone, they are not with me. You know, how do I get to them. to and...

>> Steve: A big show for you. 
>> Gretchen: "Fox & friends" christmas party picks monday. That show today. Good morning, everybody on a friday. Bowing out u.N. Ambassador susan rice is out of the running as secretary of state. Many questions remain on the response to terror attacks in benghazi. Some wonder whether or not we'll learn the truth. Good morning, everybody. I'm bill hemmer. Welcome to "america's newsroom." We have our nice little "elf" here today. 
>> I'm alisyn camerota in for martha today. She wants to avoid a vote, length i, disruptive and costly confirmation process. Critics say regardless of ryce's decision the investigation into benghazi will continue. Here is lindsey graham on that. 
>> I hold her accountable and responsible for misleading the american people. Failures on the intelligence community. There is fog of war component. I think she was chosen for a reason 
bill: Still more on that statement now with buy on york, chief political correspondent for the "washington examiner". Good morning to you. So many questions remain. First off why did they make this move now? 
>> Because time was running out and the administration, I think, hoped that opposition among republicans in the senate to rice would diminish but it didn't. The thing that really killed it, they understood, john McCAIN, LINDSEY GRAHAM, Kelly ayotte opposed her. The thing that killed it when she met susan collins who ivtroduced her at her confirmation hearing and been a rise supporter and said there were serious questions about the nomination. At that point the handwriting was on the wall. 

[00:02:04]


Bill: She is considered a moderate, if you have a good chance of getting through that would be the sign you have a chance but what graham just said, she was the most politically compliant person they could find, that's loaded. 
>> Well I mean this goes back to what she said in the aftermath of those benghazi attacks when she said it wasn't a terrorist act. It was the result of spontaneous protests against that islamic video. We know that susan rice was picked in part because of her intense loyalty to president obama. Not like she is the best-loved person in washington. It is the fact she has been with the president for quite a while. She was a clinton person and went with obama early in 2006 and 2007. There is a lot of loyalty there and the president could count on her. 
Bill: Within a week, you were five days when you saw susan rice in the following image. Five different sunday talk shows on every network on that sunday. Now here is part of the interview on "fox news sunday" where chris wallace started all of this too, listen. 
>> What happened initially it was a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired in cairo. As a consequence of the video. People gathered outside the embassy and then it grew very violent. 
Bill: As a consequence of the video. Do we get to the bottom of benghazi now? 
>> Well, republicans are certainly going to keep trying. Hillary clinton who had a much bigger role in all this, will testify before the house and the senate soon but I tell you they're very frustrated. Representative jason chaffetz who is helping lead this investigation in the house, wants to talk to a lot of people who were survivors of this attack. It is not just that ambassador stevens and three others were killed, several others were injured and they have information. He can not get in contact with them. There is lot of conflict between republicans on the hill and the bdministration that has not been resolved. 
Bill: That is an interesting point. All the people have a story. The question is whether or not we hear is publicly. Byron york, thank you. 

[00:04:11]


>> Thank you, bill. 
Bill: Alisyn. 
Alisyn: Ambassador rice is expected to meet with the president privately today. The president has been vocal for her and blasting republican critics for what he calls unfair and misleading attacks on rice. 
Bill: More americans want to see senator hn kerry nominated as the next secretary of state more than ambassador rice even before she took her name out of public contention. The latest fox polling showing 23% supporting senator kerry, 19% went for ambassador rice. 37% said they want to see someone else in that job. 18% saying not so sure. 
Alisyn: Interesting to see what everyone saysing these two hours. There are now conflicting ports whether secretary of state hillary clinton will actually testify to a house committee on the libyan attacks. We reported to you that clinton was expected to face the house foreign affairs committee next week. Now the state department is saying not so fast. In just a couple minutes we'll speak to congressman ed royce from the foreign affairs committee to see what he thinks about all this. 
Bill: What do youing this weekend, huh? What is john boehner doing this weekend? The speaker of the house and president obama met face-to-face for a 50 minute meeting late yesterday afternoon. The two men spoke for about an hour. As speaker boehner left the capitol he said, quote, we're doing great. Before that meeting the president did a round of local tv interviews and told a reporter the following. Listen here. 
>> The big problem right now is that republicans in the house are resistant to the idea of the wealthiest americans paying higher tax rates and I understand they have a philosophical objection. On the other hand, you know, we're willing to make some really tough decisions about spending cuts. 
Bill: Well, it's boehner plan for the weekend maybe the real sign of any progress. We'll tell you what he is doing and talk to "fox news sunday" anchor chris wallace on that coming up a bit later this morning. 

[00:06:13]


Alisyn: Fox news alert for you now because defense secretary leon panetta announcing that the u.S. Is sending patriot missiles and troops to turkey to deal with the growing threat from the neighboring syria. 400 troops will join nato forces and stand ready to act if syria intends to unleash chemical weapons. Fox's leland vittert is in our middle east bureau. Leland, just a few days ago the head of nato said the assad regime is about to collapse. Why deploy these troops now? 
>> Reporter: It really has to do with showing solidarity with the turks who are clearly very scared and timing comes a couple days after we learned that the syrians were mixing chemical weapons to possibly use. So this is the united states and nato's way of really get being behind turkey, a close ally saying we support you. The secretary of defense was quick to point out that the patriot missiles are just that, defensive weapons that will be put down along the syrian border to protect syria, protect turkey from attacks by syrian jets or scud missiles that would fly in but that is not exactly the whole story. The patriots could be easily programmed and put in a no-fly zone over northern syria. So far turkey is denying that as is nato saying this is purely defensive move by turkey but if there were to be a no-fly zone in the coming months it would be a game-changer because the rebels control much of northern syria. The president assad is using his air force and the first real step to provide sis -- assistance to rebels to overcome president assad's regime would be a no-fly zone. We have to read behind the headlines to see what else the patriot missiles could mean for the larger conflict. 
Alisyn: That is good context. What is russia saying now about the assad regime? 
>> Reporter: Yesterday they came out and said, all right, we think there is a possibility president assad would fall. This is one of those things speaking to truth as this russian diplomat did may not exactly jive with the party line. Inside baseball here as russia came out today and forcefully gotten behind president assad said, no, no, our diplomat was misquoted. He was saying what the opposition was saying. A little fanciful. There was hope as the humanitarian crisis increases inside syria there are many more hundreds if not thousands of people dying inside syria that russia may be loosening ties to president assad. Sadly for the united states and allies we found out that russia is continuing to hold fast with president assad their long time ally and happy to see him kill as many of his own citizens as he would like. 

[00:08:55]


Alisyn: Thanks leland. 
Bill: You think about the last two years of headlines and think about this region how much it dominated the coverage we've had and here and all over the world frankly. Here is syria in the middle of all this mess here but headlines out of turkey, libya, and into iran way to the east but specifically with regard to these patriot batteries, patriot miss sis ills -- missiles, advance to here is the border that separates turkey and syria. About 500 miles from west to east. You heard leland talk about the patriot treat missile battersries. There is 500 mile border. You have a couple of significant border crossings here and over here. Damascus the capital city is down in this area. It is our understanding that the two batteies the u.S. Will send, 400 troops will go along with that, you're talking about an area maybe 60 miles north of the border, said to be defensive measures only. So this goes along with what we've heard from germany and also the netherlands agreeing to send some patriot missile batteies there as well along with troops as well. You're looking about 1200 troops between the three countries. You want to contain it. So far you've been pretty good keeping it within the borders of syria. If it spills over you're looking at area already racked by war for two years. What can happen then? They want to make sure that doesn't. We'll watch that. 
Alisyn: Next three weeks obviously will be critical. We're just getting started here. We have a heartbreaking story of heroism linked to the horrible oregon mall shooting. We'll talk about a man who put his own life to try to save another. 
Bill: A former u.S. Marine locked up in mexico on what his family call as trumped up charge. The desperate plea for the government's help and serious concerns now that his life is in danger. 
>> I asked you to continue to pray for him. We got a call from him last night. He's just in a really tough situation because it's public in mexico at this point. So we are praying that you will pray for his protection and his quick release. ?????? ??????

Alisyn: A large earthquake shaking southern california this morning. The quake with a magnitude of 6.4, it struck in the pacific ocean off the southern coast of avalon, california, and about 170 miles from mexico. No reports of damage or injuries and no tsunami warning has been issued but coming up we'll talk with a seismologist to see if this could be the start of something bigger. 
Bill: There are new concerns secretary of state hillary clinton will not testify about the attacks in benghazi. Both the house and senate foreign relations committees had announced she would testify and in fact that would happen in about a week's time. Now the state department says that is not such a done deal. Congressman ed royce is on the house foreign affairs committee. He chairs the terrorism committee. He is my guest now and, sir, good morning to you. 
>> Good morning. 
Bill: What do you read into this? 
>> Bill, since the beginning we haven't been able to get answers but now we have the accountability review board's report which is dewey has to be shared with congress. We expect the secretary of state to come and answer some questions that frankly have been asked by the media and by the house and the senate. One of those questions is how is it possible we had no contingency pl how is it possible that over six-hour period of attacks we didn't have any helicopter gunships, we didn't have any manned drones that could be used to defend that compound? We didn't have any quick reaction team in the theater that could be sent in to defend our personnel? We lost an ambassador here after all, as well as other personnel. And then there is the whole question of the explanation because when you think about the fact that our ambassador on the ground had expressed concerns about al qaeda and the al qaeda camps increasing their operations and the attacks, frankly that it closed down the british, the red cross, even the u.N., We're stepping up, we're stepping up the defense of their facilities, and instead, you know, this falls on deaf ears. And so there are real answers to be, to be given here. Somebody knows these answers. It is the secretary of state's responsibility and it was on 9/11. Somebody forgot to circle the calendar. 

[00:16:33]


Bill: Indeed on that, on all those points but secretary clinton suggested she is more than willing to testify. The question is what would be holding her back? Now there's a review board that's looking at this at the state department. Would you give them the benefit of the doubt? Perhaps it's not done just yet? Perhaps it is not finished? Does it take 3 1/2 months? 
>> This is what is just so frustrating. Not that is just took so long. If you've seen the news reports, a recent report a few weeks ago, about a month after, a month after, reporters were on the site finding two of the 9/11 memos sent by our ambassador to the foreign minister of libya and to the benghazi police chief explaining their concerns. That very day there had been a police officer, benghazi police officer, suspiciously taking photographs. They were asking for assets to help defend that embassy. So you think about the fact that the fbi had not secured that site. Here it is possible for reporters to find this information and share it with us but we're not getting straight answers and haven't gotten straight answers yet. I would say three months later it is time for some answers. 
Bill: If secretary clinton does not testify, is the truth on benghazi buried? 
>> No because we're going to exercise oversight and we are going to get that report and we will eventually have our secretary of state testify as to what actually happened. During that testimony we will finally get some answers to some very pertinent questions because the necessity of having the contingency plan, when your allies put in place a contingency plan and your own ambassador has expressed his concerns that his personnel may be attacked from al qaeda, and you're monitoring al qaeda's presence and then you, and then you distance yourself from the argument that it's a al qaeda attack on 9/11, frankly none of this made any sense from the beginning. So it is finally time, if we're going to learn from this and we need to, that's why that law is there. That is why the 1986 act was passed, foreign accountability review board for that report from the state department to the congress. We expect that report. 

[00:19:07]


Bill: There is another page on this that's yet to turn and we'll see whether that happens. Ed royce, thank you, sir. 
>> Thank you. Bill:19 minutes past. 
Alisyn: Bill, there is a bizarre situation involving an american hero. 
[Applause] medal of honor resipient dakota meyer is recovering after being attacked. We'll investigate what happened. 
Bill: Mystery there. There is deadline on the health care exchange. States must decide today to set up their own exchanges or let the federal government to do it for them. We'll ask dr. Marc siegel what it means for your health care in america soon. ?????? ?????? fats. Avoid bad. Don't go over 2000... 1200 calories a day. Carbs are bad. Carbs are good. The story keeps changing. So I'm not listening... To anyone but myself. I know better nutrition when I see it: Great grains. Great grains cereal starts whole and stays whole. See the seam? More processed flakes look nothing like naturalrains. You can't argue with nutrition you can see. Great grains. Search great grains and see for yourself. For multi grain flakes tt are anxcellent source of fiber try great grains banana nut crunch and cranberry almond crunch. clean toothpaste. I tell them dentures are very different to real teeth. They're about 10 times softer and may have surface pores where bacteria can grow and multiply. Polident is specifically designed to clean dentures daily.

Alisyn: Update from the terrible tragedy in oregon, the oregon mall where that gunman shot and killed two people before taking his own life is reopening today. We understand security will be ramped up and crisis counselors on hand. This cops as we hear from the accused shooter's family of the his aunt served as his legal guardian since his mom died when he was three. She is tearfully apologizing saying this is not the boy she knew. 
>> For jacob's mom, I'm so sorry for jacob caused so much pain and trauma. He was always good buy and -- boy and caring. HE L xJPLAYING WITH LITTLE Kids. This is completely out of character. 
Alisyn: Well the gunman was apparently estranged from that aunt who raised him. There is no word on any possible motive. 
Bill: We're hearing stories of heroism through all this including one man who tried to help victim cindy yuille. First he thought the shots were something collapsing in the mall. He told his family to hide and ran to help her. 
>> I don't know why I did. Just instinct I guess. I don't know. My adrenaline was going. I was never worried about being shot or anything like that. I was just there to help people. 
Bill: He said two other people tried to help cindy but it was too late for her. He stayed by her side until police forced him to leave the mall saying he did not feel right leaving her alone. 
>> There are new details about a troubling incident involving medal of honor resipient dakota meyer. He is recovering after he was allegedly attacked by an 18-year-old last weekend. Fox's anna kooiman is here with the latest. This is peculiar. What more do we knowabout this? 
>> Reporter: Dakota meyer recently spoke with our rick leventhal. He said he was hit over the head with a bottle and kicked and beaten on the ground by a group of up to 10 or more people. He woke up hospital with three staples in his head. Meyer says this. He gave us a statement. He said the circumstances are unfortunate and doesn't go beyond that the altercation broke out at an event facility in columbia, kentucky, called, the red barn. We're waiting to find out from police specifics on sunday's at kerrtation. Authorities say the severity of charge against alleged teenage attacker suggests that dakota meyer was see rememberly injured. He was hurt bad enough to be treated and released at a local hospital. The 18-year-old is charged with second degree assault following the fight that happened in the early hours on sunday. Dakota meyer is the recipient of the med tall of honor which he received last year for his role in a 2009 fight against the taliban in afghanistan. Meyer killed eight insurgents and said to save the lives of 13 american and 23 afghan soldiers. Meyer was recently on the "fox & friends" talking about the events that earned him the medal of honor. He was 21 at the time of the fight with the taliban, guys. 

[00:26:38]


Alisyn: Anna, this is not the only controversy that surrounded dakota meyer. 
>> Reporter: You're absolutely right about that as well. Meyer filed a lawsuit against a former employer. Bea systems, defense contractor accused him of having alcohol problems and being mentally unstable. Meyer claims the company lashed out against him because meyer voiced disregard for bae selling high-tech sniper scopes to the pakistani military. For details surrounding sunday's altercation we do have a call into police. Back to you. 
Alisyn: Anna kooiman, thanks for the update. 
Bill: He has had a heck of a life since coming home and being honored at the white house. 
Bill: A u.S. Marine is being held at a mexican prison for what his family says is an honest mistake. They say his life is in danger. We'll talk to the family attorney about the efforts toet him out safely. Here is his father.

>>> Closer to home now, a desperate plea for help from the family of a former u.S. Marine locked up in a mexican jail. The family of john hammar says he is stuck behind bars because of an honest mistake. There is word he might be in danger. The young war veteran was on a road trip when he tried to cross the mexican border with a shotgun that was a family heirloom. He is locked up on gun charges in mexico. Hammar's father says they are not losing hope and many people are behind him. 
>> It is chaos down there, you know. There is people coming and going that are good people and bad people. I get a call the other night in the wee hours of the morning from a teacher there in there on the ground, he said, john, we read about this story and there is good people here. You know, we're not all cartel members. We're not all bad people. I said I know. I understand. She said, it doesn't help you but, you know, we're praying that you get your son home. 
Bill: That is the father speaking there. Steve harrigan now live in our bureau in miami. Steve, what is the family saying about their son and the prison he is in now? 
>> Reporter: Bill, it has really been a four-month ordeal for the family. They began getting threatening phone calls inside the prison days after john hammar was arrested. The first call was a demand for $1800 to be sent via western union or the caller said your son would be killed. Olivia hammar said the call made her physically ill. 
>> We have your son and we're going to kill him. You know, I had this really weird response, I said, no, we're going to call the consulate. He was like, they can't help you. 
>> Reporter: It was only after those numerous threats that john hammar was moved from the prison's general population into a storage room, bill. 
Bill: Who else is pushing for his release? Who else is giving him support? 
>> Reporter: Throughout this four months the family has been initially low-key but that didn't get them anywhere. Now they're becoming very public. A lot of friends and family and online petitions as well as elected officials. The family's congresswoman has implied that the state department is not doing enough to free john hammar. 

[00:34:01]


>> I am very frustrated that with the response of the state department. It is very 
[electricity crackling] ic, it is very cold. And I don't want to say that it's the state department's fault. Of course the mexican government is at fault. The mexican authorities are the responsible ones. 
>> Reporter: Questions too about the legal process so far. Hammer he is attorney in mexico told us one of the hearings that hammer had no translator present either. Back to you. 
Bill: Steve harrigan from the story on the legal aspect now. 
Alisyn: Joining us is john hammar's family attorney, eddie levy. He is with us live from mexico city. Good morning, eddie. 
>> Good morning, alisyn. Good to talk to you. 
Alisyn: Let me make sure we have the story correct. John has been held since august. He was traveling through mexico on a road trip with a buddy. They were going to costa rica to go surfing. Why did john have this antique gun with him? 
>> I'll tell you the way i understand they were going to go hunting in costa rica and nicaragua. They had a single shotgun in winnebago kind of a camper. They had to go through mexico to get there. That is where they were going to use it, which is sporting gun used in the united states of america. 
Alisyn: He did all the right things. He declared the gun. He filled out all the paperwork. He alerted officials that he had the gun and yet they still arrested him. Now we understand that the prison where he is being held is notorious for housing very dangerous criminals, members of the lo is the zetas drug cartel. We have been reports he is chained to his bed in the cell, the prison officials feared he might try to escape. The state department was asked about all of this yesterday. Let me play for you their response. 
>> This is unbelievable that the mexican government is not stepping in to help us while they take our money and take all the help we give them. It is incredible that our own u.S. Government is not doing all that we can to bring hammar home for christmas. The family deserves this. He has done nothing wrong. 

[00:36:17]


Alisyn: That was actually ileana ros-lehtinen, leading the charge to get him out. What the state department told us we fixed those problems. He is out of the general population. He is no longer in danger and he is not being chained to his bed. Is that accurate? 
>> Let me take this one by one because the, your preamble is correct up to a point. There was something very wrong that took place in the first place. When he went to mexico he stopped in the u.S. Border site and asked a customs and bored protection agent whether it was legal to take the gun to mexico, the shotgun. He responded, yes. All you have to do is fill this paperwork and then, you're on your way. He filled paperwork but that paperwork was really to come back into the united states. The united states customs personnel had no business telling him because they don't know what mexican law states. Mechanic can law states that certain kind of weapons, whether we like it or not, are used or deemed to be for exclusive use of the armed forces. That is the issue here. 
Alisyn: In other words he got misinformation. He didn't understand that what the rules were. So this seems like a technicality. Between two countries that are allies could be quickly resolved. Why is he still in prison from august? 
>> Okay. First of all, it has to be resolved under the law. I mean people are saying with a phone call. Things can happen but we, just like we have in the united states a court system. But let me put a little more depth into this. You're correct. I filed three federal injunctions. One should have been given to me about four weeks ago. The prosecutor didn't even respond to it because we allege and we proved violations of john's mexican constitutional rights. M still waiting right now for the judge to issue his judgment because he could be free within 24 hours once he find those violations. I already talked to the judge more than two times. Now we're going, if we need we'll take it upstairs. We'll take it to the mexican supreme court. 

[00:38:24]


Alisyn: Okay. 
>> Right now this is an issue. It is a technicality but it gets better here. You see the caliber of the gun which is .410, what is seemed known for exclusive use for the army. The bullets are nonexclusive use for the army. Only the shotgun. Only thing making it okay like administrative fine it is .18 millimeters. That is the size of your finger, alisyn. That is what is ridiculous. 
Alisyn: Eddie, a lot of stuff here taken on face value does sound ridiculous. I understand you say it has to go through a court process. Okay. Is h getting a trial? Is he scheduled for trial? 
>> Okay, he is but I'll tell you, right now I'm putting the mexican judicial system, because of two judges really and a prosecutor who didn't use his prosecutorial discretion, that he could have used it. The first prosecutor made a big mistake in measuring the shotgun. The prosecutor's own expert had another measurement. So I have my expert because we believe anyway that measurement is incorrect that was taken. That's what is making the difference between liberty and prison right now. But we believe and we're very, very certain that john is going to come home, I can tell you that. 
Alisyn: I am comforted by your optimism as we also know john suffers from ptsd. He served multiple tours of duty in afghanistan and iraq. In fact he was in a gunbattle in fallujah in 2004. How he is doing today? 
>> Let me tell you because i have spoken to him lately, his family has. We decided to do, have some strategy I'm not at liberty to discuss because I'm going to the court hearings. John, let me tell you this for the public. It is great we're all pushing for him and we need your help in that. Let me tell you, john is a tough cookie. Semper fi, marines, prepare them really good. You stated something else which is very true, he was moved over, when I got into the case because other lawyers had been there and there was some legal maneuvering if you will that took place. After this I spoke to the judge personally because i wanted to cross-examine the mexican customs agent that should have released him anyway. There were two court hearings set, one for NOVEMBER 17th, ONE FOR NOVEMBER 23rd. So the judge continued HEARINGS UNTIL JANUARY 17th, I say, november 30th we're ready to go to trial. I'm in new york with my kids in thanksgiving I get a phone call, john was taken TO COURT ON NOVEMBER 23rd, Without his lawyer present, that's me and most important they talked to him. And I was adamant and furious because they really wanted to push him to kind of plead guilty. Of course he didn't. Yeah, let me tell you. After his first lawyers wanted him said you would be out in three years. I will not allow him to plead to a felony. No way. 

[00:41:24]


Alisyn: Of course you are. You are convinced of his innocence as he is. And his family. 
>> I am as the family. We'll bring him out. 
Alisyn: We like your optimism. Eddie, thanks very much for the update on exactly what is going on down there. 
>> My pleasure, alisyn. Thanks for having me. Everybody keep writing letters. Keep praying please. And I need all the support, especially praying. We'll, I'll be filing let me tell you that right now. 
-- With the judiciary. 
Alisyn: I'm sure our viewers will comply with your requests. This is topic that is near and dear to their hearts now. Thanks so much, eddie. 
Bill: You innings ined this prison too. 
Alisyn: Very dangerous. Notorious. 
Bill: Members of the zetas and other drug cartels are held there. Said to be a tough, tough place. They are former special forces members of the mexican army. Said to be highly involved in human smuggling and known to kill migrants for not running drugs for them. At 1:00 hour with megyn the parents of the marine will be onto tell their side of the story. 
Alisyn: Heart-breaking for them. 
Bill: Meantime, it is decision day for the states on the president's health care law, did you know this, today? Will they or will they not participate in the new health insurance markets and what will that decision mean for patients everywhere? Marc siegel on that. 
Alisyn: Rock and roll right into a home. Now how a giant boulder ended up inside one family's GARAGE.re so awesomely delicious my husband and I can't stop eating 'em! What's...that... on your head? Can curlers! Tomato basil. Potato with bacon. We've got a lotta empty cans.

[00:46:02]


Bill: This is significant day for obamacare. Today is the deadline for states to decide whether they run a key piece of this law or leave it to the federal government. It is called an exchange and what does it mean for you? Dr. Marc siegel, a member of our fox news medical a-team, professor of medicine at nyu langone medical center in new york and good morning to you, doctor. The exchange is what? Define and remind us what it is. 
>> The exchange is virtual thing. It takes place on a computer like medicare part-d. You plug in your zip code, bill, it takes you to a place where you get choices. What health policy do you want? What subsidy do you qualify for? Maybe you qualify for medicaid. All of that in the same place online. 
Bill: Got it. Each state is supposed to set one of these exchanges up if you do not have what, insurance through your employer or your own private insures you can go to this exchange? 
>> As we talked about he have, the employer may say we can't cover you anymore and more and more millions coming to the market that will have to get it from these exchanges. Bill:19 states already said we're not going to run our own exchange in our state. What does that mean for everyday americans living in that state? 
>> By the way, bill, I think the reason they're saying it one might argue there's politics but also issues of fiscal restraint. Those 19 states may be saying hey, we can't afford to do this. We play not be able to afford to set up these exchanges. The federal government may, by current estimates will have to spend almost a billion dollars in those states setting up exchanges. Now for people out there what this will mean, if you live in one of those 19 states, come next october, you're going to have to probably deal with an exchange that the feds set up for the states and the problem with that, in my opinion, is that it adds another left of bureaucracy, because, bill, since we don't have portability of insurance, since insurance companies are state by state, it's your state government that is used to dealing with your local insurance companies, not the federal government. So if the federal government is running the exchange they may not be used to dealing with your local blue cross-blue shield. 

[00:48:07]


Bill: That's a great point. There are 17 states and washington, d.C. Say they will set up an exchange with the federal government. Am I better off to live in one of those states or not? 
>> The far west, new york, states like that, I think you are. I think you're better off. 
Bill: You are what? 
>> I think you're better off living in a state where the state is running the exchange rather than the federal government. The federal government has not given out the plans how they will do the exchange but the states are already ramping up for it, ones doing it. If you go to minnesota's website you see a tutorial. That is terrific. You have until next october but people better start learning now. I think you're better off living in a state with an exchange. 
Bill: You deal with medicine every day. This is your profession. That's why we have you sitting here. You say the states better understand their own distribution of healthcare better than washington does? 
>> By far because the insurance companies are state by state. They can't go across state lines. When an insurance company has a problem in a state they go to the state government, not the federal government. The states are used to dealing with insurance companies. I hope people are out there living in a state with an exchange. 
Bill: You can put states in one category or the other. That seems to be way they are breaking down. We're waiting for two states to make a decision. Virginia and florida. Both with republican governors. We'll see what they say. 
>> Bill, there will be a lot of confusion and a lot of money spent. I'll tell you that. 
Bill: Dr. Marc siegel. Thank you, sir. Good to see you as well. Alisyn, what is next? 
Alisyn: A woman lucky to be alive. She was trapped upside down in her car overnight for eight hours. We have her story. 
Bill: U.S. Sending missiles and troops to help secure turkey's border with syria. What does that say about america's involvement and the bloody civil war inside of syria? A closer look at that and what it means.???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

bill: A woman in massachusetts recovering after she spenent a freezing night trapped upside down in her minivan. She is 27 years old. Megyn hayley is her name. Crashed her van wednesday night in woods on cape cod. A man walking his dog came across the wreck next morning. Firefighters cut down the trees around her. Removed piece of the car in order to get hayley out after she spent the night inside. 
>> Took 30 minutes to safely get her out. She had a serious head wound. She was able to speak. 
Bill: She is in the hospital listed as stable. She is lucky to be alive. Merry christmas. ?????? ??????. 
Alisyn: Well it's a very festive song and it's a festive time but of course there is downside to all that festivity. Time of year when many americans hit the holiday parties and some will have way too much to drink. One of those is our own william la jeunesse who just took part in a police approved study he wants us to know on booze. He is live in los angeles. William, how much wine did you consume? 
>> Too much. I had seven glasses. Some of my friends had up to 14. But tell you the holidays do mean alcohol. That means a risk of driving drunk. Which is one reason people are buying pocket breatholyzers. How do you know you're over .08? Are these accurate. We found what you think you know about alcohol is probably wrong. Said I would take you home tonight would you be willing to do so? You said you would but what our audience didn't know, ed had been drinking jack and coax for past three hours. Eight in total. 
>> I had five glasses of wine. I'm starting to slur my speech. 
>> Reporter: Ashley, what did you drink? 
>> Six glasses. 
>> Reporter: I had seven glasses of white wine. 10 coarse lights. 

[00:55:12]


>> Eight jack and cokes. 13 vodka. 
>> Reporter: Our night of boozing had one purpose. To dispel misconceptions about drinking and driving. A bigger person, fatter overweight, can they handle alcohol better? 
>> No. People are heavier have less water because fat has less water. 
>> Reporter: Is it possible to feel sober at the bar and not be sober behind the wheel? 
>> No. Alcohol volume, blood-alcohol content continues to rise after your last drink for a good 30 minutes or so. 
>> Reporter: As we saw with the volunteer ashley. 
>> I'm drunk and I honestly would beli I blow over the legal limit. 
>> Make a tight seal. 069. 
>> Come on? I'm hammered. The. 
>> Your blood-alcohol continues to rise for 30 minutes. 
>> Reporter: Coffee, exercise, shower, does that sober you up? 
>> No. Wakes you up. Gives you more stimulated effect. You're still feeling effects. You're still drunk. 
>> Learn that no matter what you drink you can only metabolize so much. Regardless what you feel your alcohol level is still higher than you think. 
>> Reporter: So my blood-alcohol after those seven glasses of wine was .14. That is almost twice the legal limit. Other three guys were .15. The woman was.09. Your liver can metabolize one drink an hour. Anything over that, especially on empty stomach is like pouring alcohol into your brain. Food does not stop you from becoming drunk or make you less drunk. As for the breathalyzers, two of them were repeatedly wrong. One was pretty good. The cops say these degrade over time. Don't leave it in the glove box and risk your license on it a year later. 
Alisyn: You are an intrepid reporter. Thanks very much, william la jeunesse. 
Bill: Kudos for showing up today. 
Alisyn: What an assignment. 
Bill: My oh my. A break here.

gregg: Brand-new hour, fox news alert on the new fallout in the investigation into the terror attacks in libya. The chairman of the house intelligence committee, republican mike rogers saying that he believes the state department showed gross negligence by not providing adequate security in benghazi in the weeks leading up to the attack that killed our u.S. Ambassador and three others. So much more in this story. I'm bill hemmer, welcome. We are not in the condition that william la jeunesse is in today. 
Alisyn: We feel better because we tonight have seven glasses of wine. I'm alisyn camerota in for martha maccallum today. There are also conflicting reports this morning about when secretary much state hillary clinton will testify before congress or even if she will about this terror attack. Catherine herridge is live in washington. Catherine, give us all the latest. 
>> Reporter: First of all I'll start with the comments by the rub chairman of the intelligence committee where he describes the state department's actions prior to that attack as gross negligence, that means there is sufficient evidence that the state department bears some responsibility for the deaths of four americans. As we first reported here at fox news, based on the classified cable there was an emergency meeting in benghazi after secretary clinton's office was specifically warned the benghazi conflict could not withstand a coordinated assault. There were ten camps within benge linked to islamist militia's as well as al-qaida. 
>> It's been typical the names are held for 48 hours. We don't know how many they are, what states they are from, who the families are and we would like to talk to them. 
>> Reporter: New fox polls show by a wide margin that americans think president obama should have sent u.S. Troops to benghazi to stop the 9/11 attacks. Americans are divided over the administration's handling with the attack with a slim majority believing that it coast amount to a cover up. 

[01:02:14]


Alisyn: Will congress tullahoma lee get to see the complete report? 
>> Reporter: That is an important question. A review of the regulations by fox news and the regulations that govern the state department apartment internal investigation known as the accountability review board or arb does not suggest there is a specific requirement for the entire report to be given to congress, just as secretary clinton must provide her written comment to congress within 90 days of the report's completion. Listen closely to this exchange yesterday. 
>> We'll get you the statute if you'd like. Is that the secretary's response to the arb's conclusions has to go in writing to the congress within 90 days of her receiving the report. Obviously will intend to consult with them earlier than that as she's commit. 
>> Reporter: If you listen closely to that response what you hear is that there is not a commitment to provide the entire unvarnished report to congress, there is only a requirement for clinton to provide her own comments, and now there has been this back and forth over whether in fact she will receive thursday next week. The state department characterized that as a date on the calendar rather than a date certain. 
Alisyn: So many questions remain, catherine herridge, thank you so much. Congress really wants that unvarnished record. 
Bill: We have new reaction to the u.N. Ambassador susan rice bowing out of this. The fallout from benghazi weighed heavily on her decision. Hillary clinton responding to this decision writing quote from the national security council, to the state department to the united nation susan has worked tireless to advance our nation's values. I am confident she will continue to represent the united states with strength and kill. 
Alisyn: There was a long lead up decision, it goes back to september 16 this when ambassador rice went on five shows and said the attack was not pre-med taeutd. That continue sreubted information that was known set. Almost two months later ambassador rice's name is mentioned as a top candidate to replace outgoing hillary clinton, and almost immediately near lie 100 republican house members write to president obama discouraging him from nominating her. At the end of november ambassador rice met with republican lawmakers to discuss behazi and afterwards g g.O.P. Senators say they are more concerned about her response tow the attack. Yesterday, december 13th ambassador rice withdraws her name from consideration to be the next secretary of state. 

[01:04:54]


>> Add this to the mix now, questions being raised after nbc news correspondent andrea mitchell talked about the withdrawal of susan rice and the perception of the republican party. This is what she said. Roll it. 
>> I think that this had become sort of an impossible challenge for her to be confirmed. She realized that, the white house realized it as well. I think they know that they are on good political fallen ground as you pointed out. This is not going to help republicans at all the fact that a woman, and a woman of color has been forced out of the confirmation process even before she was nominated. 
Bill: A woman and a woman of color. I have chris wallace with me. How are you doing. 
>> Good morning, bill. 
Bill: I don't know how that squ condoleezzaa rice or colin powell. 
>> As I heard this I'm trying to help the last time there was a white man as secretary of the state, because madeleine albright back to the clinton years, I think it was warren christopher in the first term of bill clinton 96 , so i don't know. 
Bill: When you think about susan collins she was the moderate female senator that susan rice went to capitol hill to meet with. If they got susan collins support she'd be okay and susan collins came out and blasted susan rice. 
>> Susan collins is interesting because susan rice had a connection to main. What happens when someone is nominated for a position there is a senator from their home state who introduces them to the committee, and it was susan collins who introduced susan rice to the committee back in 2009, and you're quite right. There were some people like lindsey graham and john mccain who were against susan rice and I'm not sure anythin was going to satisfy them. When she went to see a quite moderate republican like susan collins and she came out and said she had more questions than before the meeting. I've never seen when there's been a nomination -- even before there is a nomination somebody is going up and doing that nomination charm tour to try to grease the skids on this kind of a thing to make it easier to get the nomination. This she did before she was even named and it backfired terribly. She did badly in every session that she had with republicans and democrats. 

[01:07:33]


Bill: Let's move on now to the fiscal cliff. John boehner may go home to ohio this weekend. Does that tell us anything? 
>> No, I mean first of all, i mean there are telephones, and there is internet. At this point a lot of the stuff is being done by staff and they are not going to their homes, both white house staff and john boehner's staff. The fact that they had the 50 minute neating and it was described as frank which in diplomatic language basically means we just talked about our disagreement, no, we are nowhere. There seems to be no progress being made and we are one week closer to the cliff as of sunday it will be, what, 16 days i think, so we're getting pretty close. 
Bill: Nowhere you're saying. You talk to these guys every day down there in washington. You're saying we are nowhere close to an agreement? 
>> Oh, no. I mean absolutely not. John boehner is continuing to hold the position that he's not going to bulge on tax rates. I think he probably would, but what he needs to do that not just a sort of political cover but also to get it passed by the house, republicans in the house, is he needs serious spending cuts and even entitlement reform and there seems no disposition on the part of the president or democrats to go along with that. You know, you see people like dick durbin, like nancy pelosi saying flat out, we are not going to go for any cuts to medicare right now, or medicaid. So I think that we are still at loggerheads and the race for spending cuts is going nowhere. 
Bill: People stop me and ask me one simple question. Are we going over the cliff or are we not. Today you're saying we could very well. 
>> I would not answer yes to those folks that are asking you, it sure looks more likely than a week ago. Two weeks it may not seem like much, an awful lot can get done in two weeks. No vacations for the people here but they can get it done if there is a will. 

[01:09:44]


Bill: We will eye see you sunday. Our regards to winston. That was very touching. Thank you, chris. 
>> Thank you very much. 
Bill: Dirk durbin and kelly ayotte, two of the guests sitting down with chris wall as. 
Alisyn: Fox news alert, growing tensions in egypt this hour as rival factions take to the streets. Support earths and opponents much egyptian president mohammed morsi staging massive rallies one day before voting on a draft constitution that has plunged the count are country into a political hotbed. Here is the scene. 
>> Reporter: We are on the eave of that crucial vote. This is what it's all b. This is a copy of the draft constitution. It is 63-pages long, 256 articles and it is causing a lot of problems, including in the egyptian cit today of alexandria. Protestors for and against president mohammed morsi and the constitution clashing in the streets after a cleric urged a yes vote at friday prayers, he's not supposed to do that. Rocks were torn, cars were torched, there were injuries and arrests. So far in cairo it has been quiet. The muslim brotherhood, promorsi forces gathering in one location in fairly big numbers. Also behind us here in tahrir square and in the presidential palace the critics of the constitution and president mohammed morsi also gathering. So far the two sides have stayed apart. 
Alisyn: Is there anyway to predict what will happen this weekend? 
>> There are no polls right now. We have kind of an idea of what is going to happen. Tomorrow it is the first stage of polling. One-half of the country will be going to the polls on this constitution. The other half will be voting a week from saturday. The polls will open at 8:00am. We are told that tens of thousands of troops will be mobilized. We are told that the polling material is going to the polling station and the judges will monitor but it is so disorganized that former president carter center which has observed half the elections here decided they are going to sit this one out, I is too disorganized. We will be watching this all for.

Alisyn: New information on the massive gas pipeline blast, what investigators say about the condition of the pipeline just before it exploded. 
Bill: There is growing angerafter a 12-year-old girl in wheelchair is detained by the tsa and deemed a security threat. This is cellphone video. You'll see more of this and the incident in the girl's own words, her experience. 
>> There was these people saying, really you're going to do this to her, you'll have to take her somewhere private to where she is not out in the private where everyone can see her. time again and now -- I got a great new way to get deals.

bill: New information on this massive gas pipeline explosion in west virginia. See that police car right there? Dwarfed by that flame in the background. A portion of the metal gas line had thinned less than a 10th of an inch before that blast. That would explain it. 
>> The investigators conducted a detailed on site investigation of the ruptured pipe. This examination revealed that there is roughly a six to the area that ran along the bottom of the pipe, along the bottom of the pipe, running for about six feet, where the pipe thickness was thinner than designed. 
Bill: This is what you get in the end, look at those flames. The explosion destroyed four homes, charred a huge area of interstate 77 in west virginia, no serious injuries, though. Officials say the exact cause may not be determined, though, for some time. They've got a clue as you can see. 
Alisyn: There are major new out of syria. The u.S. Helping turkey protect itself from growing violence in the engine. Leon panetta signed a order to send two u.S. Missiles to turkey along with 400 american troops, part of an effort to secure the southern border with syria. Chuck nash is a former retired navy captain and a fox news analyst. We have sent 400 troops to the border with syria. Can this be interpreted as u.S. Troops getting involved in the syrian conflict? 

[01:17:40]


>> I think this is more accurately described as u.S. Troops helping out the nato ally, this is purely a defensive move. These troops are not being put directly in harm's way, they are not crossing the border. The patriot missile system is a defensive weapons system and it's being used to help the turks understand that nato is with them on this and the u.S. Is doing something and taking part with germany and the netherlands. 
Alisyn: You say this is a defensive mission only, but could there be a scenario in which these 400 troops end up having to enforce a no-fly-zone over syria? 
>> That is a potential, because you don't need to necessarily do that with aircraft. Depending on where the missile batteries are put in place, and the range, those missiles are perfectly capable of not only shooting down theater ballistic missiles which is the first thing that everyone would think of, the scuds to be blunt, everything is thinking about the scuds right now but you could use that system to target manned aircraft as well or uav's. 
Alisyn: We've heard from leaders insurance nationally this week who believe that the bashar al-assad regime is close to collapsing. And if you agree how close? 
>> It sounds like it. Even the russians are talking about evacuating their people. They have a lot of advisers in there, they have embassy personnel in there as well, military advisers, and so if they are talking about that, then look for activity around the ports of tartus and latakia. Depending on how much equipment they would retrograde and get the people out those two ports would be important as well as the airports around damascus. 
Alisyn: Meaning what if you saw more active around the ports that would mean bashar al-assad is making a run for it? 
>> He probably is going to want to get some stuff out of there. He would probably get flown out because they want to do it with as few of people that knew about it as possible because you would have a massive collapse in that case. No matter how this turns out you'll have a lot of bad people with access to a lot of really bad weapons. And you've got al-qaida groups in there. Everybody in the main opposition is connected with the muslim brotherhood, so there really aren't any good scenarios for the end of this thing. 

[01:20:06]


Alisyn: On that chilling note captain chuck nash thank you so much for your input. 
>> You're welcome. 
Bill: A rude awakening for so many this morning. Why the location of an earthquake only hours ago is telling.

[01:23:44]


alisyn: Breaking news to tell you right now. There are reports of a school shooting in new town, connecticut. At the sandy hook elementary school. Officials are saying there is not much information but we are gettining this from our local fox affiliate, fox 61 there. They say police are reporting a number of injured parties. We are not sure if they are adults or children. They say the nature of the injuries is not clear. We are getting the information into our newsroom. Students are apparently being escorted from the building in groups. There is a staging area that has been set up for parents who naturally will be terrified to receive this news, and the police are on the scene. So we will bring you any more information as soon as we have it on this unfolding story. 
Bill: Back to that in a moment. In the mean time a powerful earthquake a few hours ago hitting the southern california coast and off the western coast of mexico here. 6.3 magnitude, about 2:30am local time, about 5:30 here on the east coast. About 160 miles off the coast of san diego here and local news reports say that folks in long beach and newport beach in southern california, they felt the shaking. Dr. John ebos, a seismologist from boston college, tk morning , good morning to you doctor. You said interesting things to our producers. You said the interesting thing about this earthquake is the location where it occurred. How so in. 
>> That's right all of the earthquake we've seen off of southern california has been on the continent itself, this earthquake occurred in the rock where the continent has dropped away and now we have purely oceanic rock, very unusual for earthquakes in southern california. 
>> I want to show the folks the san andreas fault, how it returns along the entire west coast of california. What you are saying, sir, is that whether or not the onshore activity is related to the offshore activity. Can you make a connection or not? 

[01:25:50]


>> Well, we'll be studying that, we don't really know. What we know is obviously the pacific ocean plate is moving relative to the north american plate, the san andreas and the other faults are the boundry. Awful the demore station are on the fault or on either side of the fault. The question for us is there some plate deformation that is taking place in the oceanic rock to the west of california, could that pose a threat of earthquakes or even tsunamis. Tsunamis. 
Bill: Does that help us predict the next big stpwhopb. 
>> It could help us predict the next big one if we see unusual deformations offshore that are associated with earthquakes onshore. So far I don't know of any unusual onshore activity. 
Bill: Thank you, doctor. Doctor john ebus from boston college in massachusetts. No tsunami on this one, the magnitude was not big enough to create one. The depth was interesting too, only about six miles, which is shallow. Thank you, we'll call again on you doctor. 
>> Okay. 
Alisyn: Back to breaking news that we just reported moments ago, that is of a school shooting in new town, connecticut, about 50 miles outside of new york city. It's a wel healed suburb there. The state police are on scene. They say they are responding to a report of a school shooting at sandyhook elementary school in new town. They say there are a number of injured parties, the nature of the injuries is not clear at this hour. They say students are being escorted from the building in groups. A staging area has been set up for the as you can imagine terrified parents who are showing up at the school. We are sending a reporter on the way there. We will bring you more information as soon as we have it. 

[01:31:21]


Bill: Welcome back. We are in touch with the police department, also the school in southwestern connecticut. Reports of a school shooting only moments ago. We know very few details. But this is what we can report. State police have responded to the report of a shooting at sandy hook elementary school, which now we understand is kindergarten through fourth grade, police reporting a number of injured parties, but we don't know the extent of these injuries, obviously, at this point. 
Alisyn: And who is injured, this means teachers, students. We are told that all schools not just this school are on lockdown after the reported shooting and police are on the scene. We have scant information unfortunately. We can imagine how terrified parents are if they are getting information from the local fox affiliate. It says afternoon kindergarten will be canceled today. There will be no midday bus service. We don't know if that was preplanned or is connected to what is going on. Several troopers are responding to the school. There is a staging area outside. Kids have been led out in groups from the school. It's a terrifying situation, obviously for all parents, not even just in newtown and we will see you posted and new information as soon as we get it into our newsroom. 
Bill: A little bit here from the "associated press." According to the superintendent speaking with reporters there at the office in newtown the district hats been on lockdown as a preventative measure. This is important now, the superintendent's secretary says that reports of a shooting are confirmed. We'll work through this together and gather information as we can. It just crossed the wires about seven minutes ago. Be patient with us as we work through it. You mentioned a number of people escorted out of the building, perhaps that is the case. This bit of information from the superintendent's office -- 
alisyn: Is comforting, that's comforting if it's not confirmed, where we're getting our information it's just a very tiny blurb from a website there that says that police are reporting a number of injured parties. Let's hope that in the confusion of these early reports that that is not accurate, but, again, it's impossible to know until police are able to make a statement and we are on the phone with them at this hour. 

[01:33:35]


Bill: We are working this story. As we get more information you'll hear it here first from the police and also that school. In the meantime let's move forward on something that we came across on our latest fox polling numbers now. The latest numbers from our polling a month after the election, half of americans believe the government provides too many services for too many people. 25% say it's just right. 20% say the government provides too little. What about this now, a great panel, juan williams, fox news political anal hr euts, mary katherine ham editor at large "hot air.Com, a fox news contributor. How are you two tkofplgt merry christmas, whatever applies. I was thinking about the polling number here half the people responding says the government does too much. Think about the deadline today for these health exchanges. Put those two together if you can. 
>> Look it seems obvious to a lot of people that the federal government especially is very bloated. You talk in these numbers of trillions are really hard to put in perspective because it's more than any person will ever see in their lifetime usually. So I think that is part of where this is coming from. When you get down to the nuts and bolts of cutting certain things, people say hey I don't want that cut, or that cut, that's why we have problems with that. As far as the healthcare exchanges go I don't think anybody should under estimate where you like the bill or don't like the bill how much really intricate tough work is ahead for states and the federal government that they are quite behind on at this point in order to accomplish that. And, frankly when the government is doing a lot of stuff, in my opinion, often that it should not be involved in, you end up not being very good at a lot of things. 
Bill: If that's the case then that 49% number gigs to go higher. 
>> I would not be surprised if some of these things go very wrong and the federal government is not able to pin it on certain g.O.P. Governors and people look at the thing and say, hey why did you decide to do this giant bill if you couldn't accomplish it. 

[01:35:42]


Bill: What do you think about that juan. 
>> I saw in the paper, someone was quoted as saying, a republican, that basically a lot of the republican governors are cutting off their nose to spite their face. People think the federal government has too much power. Here you have republican governors refusing to cooperate with the healthcare plan because it's president obama's plan and giving more power to the federal government to establish these exchanges and determine standards of healthcare inside their states. 
Bill: They are going to save money by way of this. 
>> They are not going to save any money. 
Bill: I think it's true about policy whenever it happens from federal government, there is always a yi yang. If you go too far voters are going to pull you back. 
>> When you say to voters, yeah the federal government does too much, maybe we should stop having social security or cut become on medicare, or what about food stamps or unemployment. They say, no, no don't do that, please, no we don't want to do that. Somebody has to make tough decisions. 
>> On the exchanges I do want to make the point like 25 states have decided not to -- about half of the states have decide. Bill:19 officially I think. 
>> There are some undecided as of today. 
Bill: It could go to 25, you're right, continue. 
>> It's not just about politics, it's about actual technical ability to set this thing up. The federal government has no sign of what its federal exchange will look like. The federal data hub you're supposed to plug into has not yet been created, that's why they are worried about what they'll be able to do. As a matter of logistics this is very costly, tough, and the federal government by the way for political reasons did not give people even the requirements for an exchange healthcare plan until a week and a half ago. And so now these guys are having to set this up in nine months. 
Bill: Good luck with that, juan. I'll give you the last word here. 
>> This to me is an argument for states saying, here is what we want to do, here is how we want to do it and using their voice, their power. 

[01:37:43]


Bill: They are. 
>> Which is the argument in the congress from the republicans opposing the bill saying we want states to have more authority and set their own standards and that was insisted upon by republicans, it was a point that was conceded by democrats and now you have the republican governors out of spite saying we are not going to cooperate and it's the federal government's problem. 
>> The fact that the federal government handled this incompetently, they haven't given anyone the standards to actually build this thing. 
Bill: You'll get a real contrast overt next couple of years, whether the health exchange is a good idea or a bad idea, we'll measure it state-by-state. By the way, 42% say it's going to be a good year in 2013. 41% say it's a bad year. Boom. 
>> Do you think we are a divided country. 
Bill: Right on, see you juan, see you mary catherine. Have a good weekend. 
Alisyn: We have a few updates to the breaking news we have been reported for the past few minutes, that is a possible shooting at an elementary school in newtown, connecticut, 50, 60 miles north of new york city. The new information that we have is that the shooting was reported at this elementary school, kindergarten through fourth at 9:41am, the school opens at 9:00am every day. This is according to state police. "The two town b is reporting multiple police and ambulances are at the scene, they say there are multiple reports of injuries. We have not been able to confirm this yet. Our local fox affiliate says that connecticut state police are on the scene, they are responding to these reports, and another dispatch, the police dispatch says that this actually happened outside of the school, but we understand the school is in lockdown mode, we've also heard reports of children being led out of the school in multiple groups to a staging area where their terrified parents can hopefully reunite with them. Again, this is all preliminary. We have not been able to confirm yet that there was a shooting at this school, but it sounds like the connecticut state police are taking this very seriously and they are at the school surrounding it en masse. We will bring more of this information and this story to you as soon as "america's newsroom" continues. again. Time for citi price rewind. Because your daughter really wants that pink castle thing.

[01:43:08]


Bill: The fog of breaking news in southwestern connecticut, we are working through the story. In newtown connecticut at an elementary school there the news crossed about 30 minutes ago and we are still trying to gather as much as we can for you this. This is what we can report. State police are assisting local police amid reports of a school shooting. We are getting word through the superintendent's office that reports of a shooting are not confirmed. That does not mean it did not happen. The school apparently has been evacuated with children being led outside, anna is in touch with the school as well. What information do you have. 
>> Reporter: We have our producers on the phone trying to work to get more information about the shooting that did happen in western connecticut there in the town of newtown. These are just reports. All of this is preliminary. There have been reports that at sandy hook elementary school there was a shooting. They are reporting that multiple police, ambulances and emergency crews are on the scene. There are all the am reports of injuries in that area. What we are hearing from the superintendent's office is that they are locking down the school, just simply to insure the safety of students and staff, they are not, you know, confirming anything to us at the moment, but we can tell you that local police are being assisted by the police in the state of connecticut as well. 
Bill: Thank you. When you get more we'll bring you back on the air working that story from our newsroom here in new york. 
Alisyn: I know newtown well, this is a very sweet, little pretty town, lots of churches and public squares, just a small town, again about 60 miles northeast of new york city, lots of commuters from new york live there. This. Again is all the reports around sandy hook elementary school, we understand it's a kindergarten through fourth grade school. They start at 9:00am every day and at 9:41 this morning the newtown police began getting these calls. They rushed to the scene and there are reports of all of these police, ambulance and emergency crews on the scene, not to suggest that that means that there was a shooting, but then there are also local reports from our local fox affiliate, and the newtown bee which I'm assuming is the local newspaper that there are multiple injuries. We have heard there are staging areas outside. We can only imagine that parents would be racing to the school to try to reconnect with their children who as we also understand may or may not be inside on lockdown at this time. Bill. 

[01:45:46]


Bill: You think about colleges across the country and how they have changed and they've got even plans together, contingency plans in cases like this. You think about high schools too. You don't think about elementary schools, kindergarten through fourth grade. There is a website for sandy hook elementary school. There is no information on it of value that would lend any sort of factual information on the ground. That is your first image right now out of newtown, connecticut. Let me just check the wires here real quick. 
Alisyn: This is the first photograph we're getting from a local newspaper. You can see clearly something is happening at this school. Yellow police tape surround an area and you see crowds assembled outside. Hard to tell from this vantage point if those are teachers or parents. They look like adults. Clearly authorities are taking this very seriously. To your point, bill you hope that local police stations, regardless of how small, because newtown, connecticut is a small place, have done some of these drills in the horrible possibility that something like this could ever happen in their town. So they are surrounding the school. 
Bill: We can add this too and this is important information here. The man who answered a phone when fox news called a moment ago said they have two ambulances on the scene, and waterbury is sending pwhraepbs as well. The report they have is one teacher has a foot injury after being shot in the foot. She was taken to the hospital. It is their information that police are clearing the scene. So put that together and try and figure out whatappened here. 
Alisyn: Very scary stuff. We have been on the phone also with the newtown police department and our producers report that it just sounds very chaotic there. You can imagine them fielding all sorts of calls from other schools in the area, from parents, from the media wanting information. They are doing the best they can but they do not have a lot of information yet, other than to say that we do know the school is on lockdown, and that kids and at least parents have assembled outside, and we don't know the magnitude of the injuries or how many there have been. There were initial reports of multiple injuries, but of course in breaking news it's hard to know if those are accurate. 

[01:48:01]


Bill: We don't have the information we need right now to tell you exactly what happened, but the mind runs wild here if you have a teacher shot in the foot and the superintendent's secretary says the reports of a shooting are not confirmed. If that's the case did the teacher shoot him or herself? We don't know the children are outside, and you can imagine parents now up and down the southwestern connecticut concerned about this. Its a beautiful day in the northeast as you see from the picture there, and the beautiful blue skies, high, mid 40s today, 45, 47 degrees in mid december, which is unheard of here. We are working through the story. We'll try and figure out how the kids are doing inside the school as our coverage continues. 
Alisyn: When you go to the sandy hook elementary school website it just says that kindergarten has been canceled. We'll keep you updated.Bbb ?? 

[01:52:00]


bill: New information just joining us. There is breaking news in newtown, connecticut at an elementary school for kids, kindergarten through fourth grade. There is new information from the hartford current on its website, the newspaper out of hartford, connecticut. A number of injured parties, we are told. The nature of the injuries not clear. Don't know how serious they are. There are unconfirmed reports of two shooters, one still at large, one dead. It was 9:40 in the morning, about an hour and ten minutes ago, police report a shooter in the main office of the school, a person in one room had, quote, numerous gunshot sounds. Groups of students said to be crying and holding hands, being escorted away from the school by their teachers. Some of the students apparently are still inside the school as of 10:30 this morning, which would have been 22 minutes ago. 
>> We understand the school is now on lockdown mode. What you're seeing on your screen on the left side of your screen is the first and only, as far as we know, photo of the scene. This is from the hartford current, and that all you can see there of course is the yellow police case cord dong off the scene and some adults in the background there, hard to know if those are parents showing up at the school or teachers escorting students out. On the right side of your screen is our local fox 5 affiliate chopper heading to the scene to see more. This is new information, bill that you just reported. Apparently again this is from the hartford current, that there were two shooters and a person in one room had numerous gunshot wounds. This was apparently, according to police, they have reported that a shooter was in the main office of the school. We don't know if that is an employee of the school, we don't know if it's a parent at the school, we don't know if this is a stranger at the school, but that numerous gunshot wounds were reported. Now of course I mean it's just so terrifying any time you hear that there are groups of students who are terrified and holding hands and either hiding in the school or being led out -- outside of the school. But they are being escorted by! Authorities, sometimes their teachers. It's hard to know again with breaking news who exactly is hurt and if this gunman is still on the loose as these initial reports are suggesting. 

[01:54:13]


Bill: Numerous gunshot wound at least to one person. If that's the case and that story holds up this could be a targeted shooting inside this elementary school. Newtown, connecticut now in the town of fairfield county, southwestern connecticut. 45 miles southwest of hartford. 60 miles outside of new york city. A decent sized town, population about 27,000. But the school district itself has about 5400 kids. It's a pretty large district. This school in particular, kindergarten through fourth grade as the wnyw helicopter moves closer to that town. 
Alisyn: It's sandy hook elementary school. About that town it's a very, very pretty town. It has a lot of beautiful town squares, churches on corners with pretty old steeples. Parts of it are historic. It shows that this sort of terror parents experience everywhere, sadly. This story happens everywhere and you can just imagine how parents are feeling as they are getting this news that something apparently has happened at this school today, and there were gunshots, and that someone is hurt, but beyond that it is hard to know if all the students are okay. We wish we could report that, but at this hour we don't have that information. 
Bill: Crime is very few to this town, very low. One violent criminal offense in 2010 is are being reported in newtown, connecticut. Okay, we're working through this. We'll be on the phone with police and the school as we get more information here. Let's get a break. Breaking news in "america's newsroom" as we work through the developments in connecticut. bullpen. Here he comes. You wouldn't want your doctor doing your job, the pitch! Whoa! So why are you doing his? Only yr doctor can determine if your persistent heartburn is actually something more serious like acid reflux disease. Over time, stomach acid can damage the lining of your esophagus. For many, prescription nexium not only provides 24-hour heartburn relief, but can also help heal acid-related erosions in the lining of your esophagus. There is risk of bone fracture and low magnesium levels. Side effects may include headac, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Call your doctor right away if you have persistent diarrhea. Other serious stomach conditions may exist. Don't take nexium if you take clopidogrel. Let your doctor do his job. And you do yours. Ask if nexium is right for you. If you can't afford your medication, astrazeneca may be able to help. 

[01:59:03]


Bill: A few more pieces of information here we're picking up locally in newtown, connecticut. The current website. "Hartford courant", police sources say the shooter is dead, at least one of them. Earlier reports of a second shooter are unconfirmed. This too, schools in that town are on lockdown. You can imagine that the case throughout the town of newtown, and sandy hook, connecticut. Newtown bee reporting one child was carried out by a police officer and apparently the child was wounded. How we do not know and seriousness is not clear either. 
>> It says dozens of state troopers are on the scene. They're assisting local police. Heavily-armed police gathered around the school at 10:45. This is all so recent. Stretchers have been set up and saging area set up for

Shooting. Right back on sunday night with a special editio of "piers morgan tonight" "ac 360 starts now." 
>>> Piers, thanks very much. 10:00 on the east coast. Only one story tonight. New details to tell you about. We won't pretend we understand it any better than we did right after it happened. It is a horror beyond words. Ab elementary school, kids as young as 5 years old, second deadliest school shooting in this country. 20 children killed, 7 adults, including the adult shooter. About 90 minutes' drive from. All of the latest information tonight. We won't repeat the shooter's name over and over again as has been done throughout the day. We don't want history to remember this murderer. We want history to remember the victims, the teachers, the children, those whose lives have been unfairly taken. We have a team of reporters working, including soledad o'brayen on the scene. 
>> A vigil held tonight. The people of newtown trying to come to grips with what has happened. Just behind us this morning. Right now, right now, this is still an active crime scene that means many of the bodies are lying where they fell inside the school, including the body of a killer. We want to at least tell you his name. And as anderson, we won't be repeating it much tonight at all. 20 years old. His mother taught at the school. She was found dead at the family home. Unclear exactly how she died or when she died. 
>> Soledad, the idea that those kids are still in the school, i mean, it is such a horrific image to think about tonight, and for the parents, not to be able to see their children yet. 
>> Yeah, the police say it's an active crime scene and they told us they thought by sunday, they would be able to have the crime scene part of it and the investigation at least that portion of the wrapped up. But now we're getting told that actually it might be even as soon as tomorrow morning. But as you can imagine, knowing your child has perished inside that school and you can't even go and get the body, it would be a horrific thing. 

[00:02:21]


>> Let's hope the children are brought home soon. We know that the mother of the shooter, legally purchased the weapons that were used. Rita cosby reports that he broke his way through the front door into the school, two semi automatic handguns and a bushmaster. Police in hoboken, new jersey, took the older brother in for questioning, did not label him a suspect. No word whether he's still in custody. A lot to tell you about right now this hour. Let's start at the beginning. 
>> Individual I have on the phone is continuing to hear what he believes to be gunfire. 
>> Reporter: The first word was chilling. It only got worse. 
>> They are reporting multiple fatalities involving in the shooting at the elementary school. 
>> Reporter: With each new report, the horror deepened. 
>> The number of dead closer to 30 than 20, and most are children. 
>> Reporter: Every detail brought more sadness. Each fresh piece of information, part of the picture. A school, kindearten through fourth grade. A sanctuary supposed to be a place of safety, torn apart. 
>> She heard the intercom came on in the school and heard a scream and heard a gunshot -- two gunshots, and the school went into lockdown. 
>> Reporter: A student, teenage big brother described the sound. 
>> Newtown police, immediately upon arrival entered the school and began a complete active shooter search of the building. 
>> Reporter: They arrived to carnage. The killer was dressed for battle in black fatigues and armed for mass murder. Two pistols and a military style rifle. In parts of the school, students were told to hide in corners. Teachers risked their own lives to pull boys and girls to safety. 
>> So grateful to the teacher saved him. 

[00:04:22]


>> The teacher saved his life? 
>> She definitely did. He had bullets going by him and she grabbed him and another child and pulled them into a classroom. 
>> Eventually, kids were evacuated to a nearby firehouse, from frantic parents descended. 
>> It was terrifying. I'm still terrified and still in shock about it all. I don't know everything that happened. I know that there are some people missing, taken to the hospital. 
>> Reporter: His son was okay. His son's teacher was alive as well. 20 other children and 6 adults were killed. The dead believed to include sandy hookpsychologist and the principal. The gunman's mother was discovered reportedly at home in newtown. The gunman himself is dead. A tight-knit community, a nurse rushed to help, shot, distraught. 
>> I see have you been crying? 
>> Yes. 
>> Reporter: Because of what you saw? 
>> One of the cops said it's the worst thing he had ever seen in his entire career, but it was when they told the patients. All of the parents waiting for the children to come out. Thought they were still alive. There's 20 parents just told that their children are dead. It was awful. 
>> Reporter: Awful. And late today, speaking for the nation, but also as a father, an emotional president obama fought back tears. 
>> Reporter: This evening, michelle and I will do what every parent in america will do, which is hug our children a little tighter. And we'll tell them that we love them and we'll remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in connecticut who cannot do that tonight. And they need all of us right now. 
>> We'll play you the complete statement that president obama made today, with the hope it may bring some peace to some people. As one mother said tonight, too many of our babies died. With us now, janet volmer who teaches kindergarten at sandy hook and was there today. First of all, how are you doing? 

[00:06:28]


>> I'm okay. Family is here, that helps. My sons came and my husband and the dog, so we're together. That's what it's all about. It was awful. 
>> You were in your classroom. 
>> I was in my classroom. 
>> You were in your classroom. What did you hear? 
>> Well, you know, about 9:30, 9:40, we heard noises and the announcement system was still on, so it didn't go off, so you could hear what sounded like pops, gunshots, of course, I'm not going to tell that to 5 year olds, and I said we're going over in a safe area and we're going to -- we read a story and kept them calm. Did a lockdown drill. Closed the door, locked, covered the windows. And, you know, kept the children with us. I havether adults -- 
>> I find that amazing -- I find that amazing that fearing that you hear gunshots, you were able to have the composure to sit down and read to your students. That's extraordinary. 
>> That's what you have to do with 5-year-olds, you can't lose it. So, you know, you just kind of -- I've been doing this for a long time. It's my 18th year of teaching, and my job was to keep them safe. I didn't know -- no announcement of what was going on. You know, my I stingt was it wasn't good. So we kept them calm, sd in the room until there was banging at the door, which was police, troopers, whoever was there, and they had us exit the building and told the children to cover their eyes and walk in a line and leave the building and that's when we went down toward the firehouse. So, you know, we were all safe. I had 19 children in the room with me, and thank goodness, their parents were able to come, pick them up, take them home. 
>> When you were reading, did the kids realize something was going on, or think it was a dr like before? 
>> Right, it didn't seem a natural thing, although we do practice drills, and w just said, well, we're not really sure, but we're going to be safe, because we're sitting over here and we're all together. And that's, you know, as we got down to the firehouse, later on, there was a lot of the events started to unfold throughout the day, I think some of them realized the magnitude of what was going on, saw other people upset, but, you know, we just held them close until their parents came and we released them, and, you know, my room, my children, were all accounted for, and safe in my kindergarten classroom. 

[00:09:04]


>> For all of us, incomprehensible, you knew the children, the families involved. Your colleagues have lost their lives. I certainly won't ask you about any wf the kids. What do you want the world to know about your colleagues? 
>> Yeah, I mean, we heard a lot of things as we were down at the firehouse. You know, people were texting news reports and this one, that one, I'm sure -- I'm not sure still of the magnitude of who everyone is, I hear six or seven adults and many children, and, you know, I know those first graders were children I had in my room last year. So those parents were showing up today, and they couldn't find their children, and, you know, they were all taken to separate rooms and so -- I don't know who they all are, but I'm sure as the days unfold, it will not be -- it will not be good news for many of those people. 
>> And -- yeah, it's really beyond words, and I appreciate you taking a few moments to talk to us tonight. It really is -- 
>> well -- 
>> janet, thank you for your composure. 
>> You're welcome. 
>> It's extraordinary what you did, and the other colleagues of yours. 
>> Some of those teachers were heroes. One of the teachers, she locked everybody in the bathroom. And wouldn't open the door. You know, I think we do this as teachers, we are trained, we do have drills, we talk to the kids, and in case something were to happen, this is what we do. And it's kind of what happened today. Everybody just in stinctively kept the children safe. 
>> A lot of teachers I think of heroes, and you and your colleagues showed that ay. 
>> Thank you. 
>> I wish you peace and strength in the difficult days ahead. Seiver is joining us. She a parent. How is your daughter doing, your family, how are you holding up? 

[00:11:12]


>> Okay. It's a very rough night here. When your first grader goes to bed and says, mommy, is anyone from my class last year, are they all okay? Are they all okay? And you look at them and say I'm not really sure, it's not the best night when you tell thato your 7-year-old. It's -- very, very sad night for this town and a lot of families here. 
>> Has your daughter wanted to talk about what happened or first grade, I don't -- do they want to talk? 
>> She asked a lot of questions abt the principal. She caught wind very quick that will something was wrong with our principal. Which we didn't tell her until just now that, yes, she was definitely hurt and it wasn't good. It took her -- it's taking her a while. I think tomorrow will probably be harder for her. I also have a fifth grader who came off the bus crying, because she, one, had a sister who she was worried about, and just basically left that school, a few months ago and I think for a lot of those kids, they kind of are a little older and can get it a little bit faster, even though they weren't in it. So it's -- the questions I think are coming. They are not really here yet, especially for the littler ones, but it's started as I put them to bed tonight, the questions. 
>> Do you know -- as a mom, do you know how you are going to answer those questions? Because there are a lot of parents around the world, frankly, whose kids are going to be asking them questions in the days ahead about what happened. Do you think you know what you are going to say? 
>> Unfortunately, we have been through a bit of trauma in our own life, for me, and I can't speak for moms -- other moms or moms around the world, but for my family, I speak kind of quietly anthfully and try to answer t questions that they ask without a lot of detail. I definitely don't lie. Is prince hohsprung okay? And I said no. And she said is she dead? And I said yes. I try not to offer too much. I don't know what they know. I sit back and wait for them to ask. If they ask, I give them an honest answer. And, unfortunately, for a lot of us in town, the answers are not good. 

[00:13:54]


>> The principal, dawn -- 
>> and they are very sad tonight, I don'tink anyone can answer these questions easily -- they are definitely not fun answers. 
>> I've heard so many great things about the principal, dawn hochsprung, and the fact that your child was asking about her. What do you want people to know about dawn? 
>> A very lovely compassionate woman. Extremely helpfu as a chair on one of the pta committees, could not have come out to support me better this year. I needed support this year, and she was the first one on my team, the first one to help, the first one to be there. Never saw her without a smile. You know, was just in my daughter's classroom this week, reading a book to the kids. Very, very lovely, very lovely woman. And definitely had the children I believe had the children's best ientions all the time. She was always looking out for them. Just a very sad thing. 
>> You must be exhausted, and I'm going to let you go. I appreciate you talking tonight, and thank you. I really -- I just wish you and your family a lot of strength. Thank you. 
>> My family is one of the lucky ones, anderson. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people, you know, that aren't so lucky tonight in town, but thank you, and I -- we pray for all of the families that are out there tonight. 
>> Yeah. I thk there are a lot of prayers around the world tonight for the families, amy, thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> It is frankly unbelievable. Let's go back to soledad. 
>> It really is. It really is. And it's almost impossible i think to fathom what the people of newtown are going through now and what they are going to be going through in the next days and weeks, especially the parents and siblings and family members of little children who did not survive the massacre today. So many lives were lost, so many other people's lives were just changed forever. Friends and neighbors and in some cases complete strangers gathered and continue to gather at this hour, hold each other, cry, and to remember. A vigil tonight, took place at a local church and jason carroll has been there all day and through the night and an update on how that went tonight. Jason, the mood has got to be so sad. Tell me a little bit about tonight's vigil. 

[00:16:28]


>> You know, I've seen a lot of emotional things throughout my life, but tonight was -- it's really hard to explain. The vigil here tonight. So many people came out, soledad. There wasn't enough room for everybody inside st. Rosa linea church. They came outside. Stood inhe freezing cold. Hundreds of people stood inside and listened. When the vigil that let out, all of e standing outside went inside and you heard some singing at one point. Groups broke off into separate groups and started singing. People really came here tonight, and I know you just heard anderson give that very emotional interview. People came here looking for answers, just like that mother was trying to give answers to her daughter. And it's difficult, it's very tough to try and get those answers at this time. People came looking for that. They came to lean on each other and they turned to their faith. This is such a small community that it's the kind of place where literally so many of the people came out tonight knew someone. Knew one of the faculty members, knew one of the children. They talked about one the littte girls who lost her life who was supposed to be in a christmas pageant here at the church. Spoke to another man who knew the principal. He wanted to speak out before he went into the vigil and I want you to listen to a little bit of that conversation. 
>> Dawn, the principal at sandy hook, I had dinner with her last spring, she was excited, exuberant, an exceptional educator. It's sad. But my prayers will be for our community as well. 
>> One of the other points that he wanted to make was that this was a woman who loved not only her school and her job, but she loved all of the children at the school as well. Soledad. 
>> So, jason, I know you had a chance to talk to the deacon, and I'm sure he will be a focus of many of the questions that people are having. What did he tell you? 

[00:18:32]


>> It's -- it was difficult for him. He became emotional during our conversation. He said that at least 100 people had come to the church doors throughout the day looking for answers. And I said how do you try and provide answers? He said it's too soon to come up with some sort of deep philosophical answer as to why this happened. He was also feeling the emotion of what has happened as well. He knew some of the children that were killed, including some of the faculty members. He spoke about one child in particular, who he remembered receiving her first commune here at the church, and a child who really left an impression upon him, and he explains the reason why. 
>> I heard one of the victims, I'm not sure about it, but i heard one of the victims recently, I think it was birthday money, her birthday gifts and donated it to the parish to give for hurricane sandy victims. She's 6 years old. So that's -- that makes it very, very personal. And very intimate. 
>> His struggle is that he has got to be a rock for the community now. He has got to try to keep it together as more people cometo him to lean on him for emotional support. I asked him, I said what do you do? I'm going to go home, hug my own daughter, and I'm going to come back here and be the support this community needs. Soledad. 
>> N carroll for us, thank you, jason. Appreciate that. And, anderson, it's a question that we're all trying to get an answer to. The why behind it. We've talked a little bit about the shooter, but the motivation is always the thing I don't think anybody is close to understanding at this point. 
>> Yeah, and may never. I mean, you know, sometimes there isn't any why. But we'll continue to investigate, soledad, we'll come back to you shortly. Authorities have not yet released the name of the victims, the process of identification continues at this hour. Those children's little bodies are still inside that school and will be throughout the evening. As we learn who they are, when it's appropriate, we'll focus on the lives. We'll tell you about them when we learn about them, what parents want to know about them. The victims we want history to remember and honor. According to witnesses, the school's principal are among the dead. You heard parents talk about tonight. She became the principal at sandy hook in 2010. She arrived with 12 years of experience as a school administrator, a mom raising two daughters, three stepdaughters according to a local paper. And a lot of folks who worked with dawn said she was extremely passionate about her job. An expert on curriculum, fun, but a fi leader. One friend said she was the kind of person you would want to be educating your kids, and the kids loved her. Even little kids know when someone cares be b them, and that was her. She posted messages and photos about events and developments at the school. ON AUGUST 24th, SHE TWEETED, Welcoming our kinders this morning. 74 new opportunities to inspire life long learning, talking about the new kindergarten class. She had recently installed a new security system where all visitor has to ring a doorbell and wait to be buzzed in. Two witnesses told our sister network hln that the glass entrance was shot out or smashed allowing the gunman to get into the building. We don't have any photographs of the other victims according to witnesses, mary sherlock, the school psychologist, 56 years old. At sandy hook 18 years, she had a master's and a six year professional degree. Wife and mom. Mothered to her husband bill for more than 30 years. Two grown daughters, the oldest works as a high school chorus teacher in new jersey. Mary sherlock and dawn hochsprung, we will remember them. When we come back, more of president obama's emotional reaction. We want to play his complete comments and more from the parents as well. 

[00:22:56]


>> It's not -- it's not something you shake off very easily and certainly not for little people and we lost a lot of babies today in this town, and there are a lot of very sad families, and as everyone can think, you never think it's going to happen, but basically it happens all over the world at this point. Bye! Bye! Bye! Santa, we made a video for your trip! Yeah, you can watch it on your sleigh! Ok! Here you go. Aw, thanks elves. I also made you a video. You are so sweet. But you probably shouldn't watch it on the sleigh. Say goodbye to Santa boys! Bye! Good bye Santa! Bye! Exclusively at AT&T, buy any Samsung Galaxy smartphone, get up to $100 off a second msung Galaxy device. @ 

[00:26:14]


>>> it doesn't even seem real. It just does not even seem like it's possible. You read it in the paper, see it on the news, you're like oh, my god, that poor family. And something happens so close to home, it's like I think I'm still in shock, to be honest with you. 
>> Well, no doubt a lot of people feeling the impact same way tonight. The massacre inside the school, the deadliest elementary school shooting in american history. All the words spoken today, and all of the words I'm speaking tonight in this hour, they all sound so small in the face of this horror. 20 little children, 7 adults. Last night alive, getting ready for another day of school, tonight they are gone. President obama spoke to the nation earlier, we played some of it before the top of the program. But I think it's worth hearing all of what he said. 
>> This afternoon I spoke with governor malloy, fbi director mueller. I offered governor malloy my condolences on behalf of the nation and made it clear he will have every single resource he needs to investigate this heinous crime, care for the victims, council their families. We have endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years, and each time I learn the news, I react not as a president, but as anybody else would, as a parent, and that was especially true today. I know that there is not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams, so our hearts are broken today for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the pants of the survivors as well. For as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early, and no words will ease their pain. As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it's an elementary school in newtown or a shopping mall in oregon or a temple in wisconsin, or a movie theater in aurora or a street corner in chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. This evening, michelle and i will do what I know every parent in america will do. Which is hold our children a little tighter, tell them we love them and remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in connecticut who cannot do that tonight, and they need all of us right now in our days to come, the community needs to us be at our best as americans, and i will do everything in my power as president to help, because while nothing can fill the space of the lost child or loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need, to remind them that we are there for them, that we are praying for them, that the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories, but also in ours. May god bless the memory of the victims, and in the words of scripture, heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds. 

[00:30:55]


>> President obama speaking earlier today. Not just as president, but as a father of two daughters. Denise korias' daughter goes to sandy hook. Was in school this morning. We spoke earlier tonight. Denise, I cannot imagine what this day has been like for you, for your child. How is your child? How are you? 
>> I think everyone is coping as best as they possibly can, and it is shocking when it happens anywhere. So we're all trying to wrap our arms around the situation as best as we can. 
>> Did -- does your daughter want to talk about it with you? Or are you encouraging her too? How do you handle this? A lot of parents around the world are trying to figure out what to say to their child. 
>> You know, the hard thing for me is, anderson, I'm a new yorker, so I'm very accustomed to manhattan and accustomed to always telling my kids to be careful. I guess you never expect it to happen in your school, and at the end of the day, you jus -- I'm letting her talk. She's mentioned quite a bit about the principal, who many of us have worked with, and i adored her. I worked with her personally with my business. That is one person I know we've lost on a personal level. I know they are going to have counselors at the intermedary school tomorrow, and I already told my children, they are all welcome to go there. We are planning on doing that tomorrow, so if they need to speak to somebody, they will. 
>> Has your daughter said much about what she saw or what she heard? 
>> She did mention that she did, of course, hear gunshots, and on the same floor, and she -- her teacher, managed to take two children out of the hallway, pull them into the classroom, lock the door and move everybody to the other side of the room, when, you know, it was very confusing as it would be in any of these cases to go and pick up your child, once we figured out that everything was dispatched to sandy hook elementary, I was one of the first parents there along with a friend of mine, we both figured out what was going on, ran over there, they were very smart to get them out of the building, moved them over to the firehouse. You could see my daughter's teacher was visibly upset as well as the children there. She did a very heroic thing. Pulled two kids out of the hallway, shoved them into the classroom and locked that door. The kids will suffer from this. Like everything else, a psychological event that will take time for healing and as long as everyone gets the proper help, it's not something you shake off very easily and certainly not for little people and we lost a lot of babies today in this town and there are a lot of very sad families, and as everyone can think, you never think it will happen, but basically it happens all over the world at this point, so we have to be very cognizant of mental health and gun control in my eyes and how schools are locked up these days. And it's unfortunate. You wouldn't think to take your children to school you have to worry about someone going in and blowing them all up. It's an unfortunate state of affairs, but, unfortunately, it's our reality these days. 

[00:34:43]


>> Denise, I'm sorry that reality was visited upon your daughter today. And everybody else. And I wish you strength and peace in the difficult days ahead. Thank you for talking tonight. 
>> Oh, thank you so much, anderson. 
>> And there will be a lot of difficult days ahead. Let's go back to soledad. 
>> No question about that. So, anderson, as word start to spread throughout the state today, so did the shock, so did the horror and now there is the grieving. 
>> You can never be prepared for this kind of incident. What has happened, what has transpired at that school building, will leave a mark on this community and every family impacted. I only ask that all of our fellow citizens here in the united states and around the world, who have already offered their assistance remember all of the victims in their prayers. 
>> That was connecticut's governor, dan malloy speaking earlier today. He said his main responsibility now is the investigation along with local and federal authorities. I want to emphasize once again that is the focus now. Susan candiotti, handling our coverage of the investigation. Let's focus first on what we know about the shooter. 
>> Not very much. That he is 20 years old, we understand that he came to the school with three weapons, two of them were handguns, one described as a glock. One described as a sig sauer, and another one not found in the classroom with him, but instead was found in a car outside the school, and that is call a .223 bushmaster, a semi automatic weapon. It seems those guns were not registered to him. But we are told according to our law enforcement sources they belong to his mother which is -- don't have an explanation for that right now. 

[00:36:48]


>> Were all those guns legally purchased in this state? 
>> Yes, they were legally purchased and purchased in the state of connecticut. We believe he might have been living with his mother. Our sources tell us his mother's body was found inside a residence and she lives in this area, so it's possible he lived with his mother. Still waiting on that detail. 
>> Some confusion as well with his brother. Police went to hoboken to do an investigation there, and took the brother off for questioning as well. 
>> The brother is older, 24 years old, he does live in an apartment in hoboken, and they did go to him to ask him questions about his brother. Everybody tightlipped about exactly what he told the authorities. But also his father has been questioned as well. His father is divorced from the mother who was killed in this incident and we're simply trying to find out more about that as well. 
>> Susan diotti, the investigation continues. The suspected shooter's mother, we'll get more information on that right back to anderson for more. 
>> Soledad, as we mentioned, just in case you joined us. We're intentionally limiting the use of the killer's name. We don't want to use it over and over again. We are trying to learn more about what led this person to the school. Drew griffin joins us live. 
>> Having covering so many of these, a shooter with possible mental health issues, a family trying to deal with those issues, something snaps, guns easily accessed and we have the outburst of violence in the case of this 20-year-old shooter, beginning play out in exact that will order. Here is what we do know. The 20-year-old shooter had an older brother. That brother reportedly told abc news that the shooter had a personality disorder and also mentioned autism. Cnn heard that same information from a man who called himself a friend of the shooter's in newtown where the shooter lived. We can confirm the guns, two handguns and semi automatic rifle were legally owned by the shooter's mother, now deceased, you can see the picture of the gun there, and somewhat standard in these cases, we find people that are shocked that the particular shooter could have been involved in anything like this, as is the case with one of the shooter's former classmates and former school bus driver. 

[00:39:28]


>> He was just a kid. 
>> Just a kid? 
>> Just a kid. 
>> Never anti social? 
>> No, no. 
>> Trouble maker? 
>> No, definitely not. 
>> Noticeable? Did he just kind of blend into the background? 
>> Yeah. Nothing that would warrant any of this. 
>> He went after her mom and her class of kids, can you wrap your head around that? 
>> No, I cannot. I don't know who would do anything like this? 
>> Your general sense is what? 
>> This is -- this is unspeable. When I first heard about -- I'm still in shock. Excuse me a moment. I want to go. 
>> He was a nice kid. Very politely. She raised very nice boys to me. That's why I think it's a shock. To even know them and realize who they are, and what he did. You can't understand what happened that he snapped, what have you, and took such innocent lives. 
>> So what can we expect? Well, anderson, as we've learned in the other cases, virginia tech, the shooting of congressman giffords, the mass killing at the movie theater in aurora, colorado, in the coming days, maybe by tomorrow, we'll see multiple warning signs, dangerous messages, ignored or perhaps or even practice sessions or an obsession with the mom's guns that weren't taken seriously or the family in many cases doesn't know how to handle the situation. They don't have anywhere to turn and there will never be an answer or explanation that could be anywhere near good enough for the victims' families to understand this, because in a lot of cases, it's just senseless and it's never going to be understood. 
>> Yeah, and hearing the -- one of the people say autistic, or could be autistic, that -- i mean, I have never heard of somebody autistic doing something like this. It doesn't seem like it jives. 

[00:41:39]


>> It's two separate things. The brother said personality disorder and also autistic. We're not trying to put those together or say one leads to the other. 
>> Got it. 
>> But some hints, early hints, like we've seen in the other cases, early hint where there is some sort of mental issue going on and we learn as things go on that there are warning signs. That's what I expect. That's what I've seen other experts expect talking about this. 
>> And there will be debate over gun issues, gun controls. Connecticut has very strict gun laws and these guns were legally purchased as far as we know by the mother. 
>> If you were going to make a gun law to prevent this, you would have to take this woman's legally owned guns away the reason we found out so soon where these guns came from, connecticut has it's own registry, you have to have a certificate to own a handgun that comes with a -- a test -- not a test, but a class. A handgun safety class. No one under 21 can own a handgun and they have an assault weapons ban. This assault rifle, I don't have the details if it was legally owned, she must have owned it before 1993 and also had a certificate of possession registered with the state. Some ofhe older guns were grandfathered in. Can't have an assault weapon purchased in connecticut as i read from the law. 
>> How were they stored? In a locked box? A lot we don't know. Drew, appreciate it. 
>>> For parents, the ordeal began with the word that sandy hook elementary school was on lockdown. The first word that parents got. When we come back, we'll have more about what happened throughout the day. of Washington about the future of Medicare and Social Security. 

[00:44:03]


ANNCR: But you deserve straight talk about the options on the... table and what they mean for you and your family. 
ANCR: AARP is cutting through all the political spin. Because for our 37 million members, only one word counts. Get the facts at earnedasay.org. Let's keep Medicare... and Social Security strong for generations to come. 

[00:46:23]


>>> I was in new york, and my wife called me in hissterrics, so I rushed home, and she -- she heard some bangs and she went running into a bathroom. 
>> It was frightening, it was like my heart stopped beating. I can't even explain it. 
>> Jason carroll gave us a look inside the vigil tonight. We're joined by the church's pastor. What do you say to a parent? What do you say to a parent who is going through the worst possible kind of grief imaginable? 
>> You know, I had a number of conversations with parents today. A number of people belong to the parish community. The words are few. What can you say? Many said thank you for many here with us. We prayed together, hugged each other, a lot of tears. Certainly a lot of emotion, and I -- I don't really think it's settled into their lives. Their child has been taken from them. I must say for the parents i spoke with today, there was a tremendous amount of love for these children, and inow that the days ahead are going to be very, very difficult. We as a community, certainly as a church community will be very present to them. But the words? What can you say at a time like this? 
>> There are a lot of parents wrestling around the country and around the world with what are they going to say to their children who ask them questions about this. What do you recommend for people to say to their kids. Not kids at newtown at the school, but children who hear about this, want to know if they are safe, want to know about what happened? 
>> That's the one thing you have to assure them. Some of the circumstances are beyond any human control. We have to teach these children they have to trust. You know, I know it's a difficult world in which we live and very difficult to trust everyone, but they have to have faith, faith in god and faith with each other and I hope parents learn the value of family and keep the values straight. The children need to know they are loved and they are in an environment where they can grow up to be productive citizens. I don't know how you take fear out of a child's heart except by love. And these children were deeply loved by their parents. I'm sure when they dropped their children off at the school, the last thing on their minds is this the way the day would end. I hope parents take the opportunity to talk to their children about the importance of being family and the importance of trusting and loving each other. 

[00:49:13]


>> One of the things I was thinking about today, after the aurora shooting in aurora, colorado, they had a sort of memorial service, and I remember the speakers would read the name of each person who was killed, and then the crowd would shout back, we will remember. We will remember you. That was so powerful. And I kept thinking about that today, our coverage tonight. We emphasize the importance of remembering the victims. And we saw that tonight at the vigil, people were literally -- they were outside. It was so many people wanting to go. They couldn't fit in. What was your message tonight? 
>> Our message, I thut this was a day about hearts. I witnessed this morning, being with the families, with them for almost six hours. Compassionate hearts, broken hearts, caring hearts. Really about love in so many ways, and love lost, but love that will never be forgotten. I encourage people tonight -- we've got to do something about violence in this country, violence in the media, violence in the entertainment industry. It is filling their heads with an awareness that evil does exist in this world, but that good always conquers evil and the only way we'll change is by coming together as a community, and that's exactly what hapned tonight. People came together to support each other and to encourage each other. To let each other know there is a better way to live. We don't have to be afraid if we work together as a community. 
>> Monsignor, I know it's been a long day for you, a horrific day for you. I appreciate you taking the time to talk to us. Thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Again, soledad, as we've been saying all night long and all day long, there will be many difficult days ahead. 
>> No question, for those who have lost children and those whose children survived. Tough conversations. Many were telling us what happened when they came racing to the elementary school. They got word that the school was on lockdown and they were panicked. Some tried to run to the school. Sent to a nearby fire station, completely frantic scene by all accounts we've heard. People had to basically sit and wait to see if their children were alive or not. Earlier, I spoke with christine wilford about her experience. Her son is a second grader at the school how are you doing now? 

[00:51:41]


>> It's still processing. It's -- it's scary, scary. No words. 
>> How is your son doing? Are you encouraging him to talk and share or trying to take his mind off the terrible things that he witnessed and experiences? 
>> We've done a little bit of each. Try to spoil him and, you know, take his mind off, let him play the ps3, stuff like that, and then trying to talk and process with him, letting them know when we found out about other children that he knows. 
>> You've gotten an electronic alert is really how you got the message, a robocall. How did that come across? What was said? It must have been the most terrifying thing. 
>> My husband and I were sitting there, and a neighbor was over and we got a robocall that all newtown schools were in lockdown due to a reported shooting. We immediately got online. My neighbor called her husband and he said he heard it was sandy hook. We hopped in the car and went down. 
>> The school was on lockdown. What does that mean? 
>> I'm not sure completely what that means. When I got there, all of the childrcuated were in the firehouse. Which is close pitch. 
>> How are the kids holding up? 
>> It aries. My son seemed to be okay. Mom, I'm okay, I'm safe. He gave me a big hug. A lot of children were crying and scared. 
>> How did he describe what happened? 
>> He said he heard what sounded like large pans falling, just loud noises. He said his teacher stepped outside the classroom, immediately came back in and locked the door and had them all get into a corner and sit down and just had them start reading quietly. 
>> How much time went by between that happened and before he was able to get to you? 

[00:53:44]


>> I don't know. He isn't able to piece how much time actually passed. He said after a little while, a police officer came and took them out of the building and brought them to the firehouse. 
>> We know that the principal had installed a system where you have to be buzzed in. 
>> Yes. And it's been that way for the two years we've been here. You had to ring a doorbell and be let in, and the office is right in front of those doors, they can look out and see who is at the door? 
>> Any particular reason for that? It's very typical in big cities, but communities pretty rural, a little bit of a rarity sometimes? 
>> I think they take the safety of our children very serious. It's a fairly large school. There's between 500 and 600 students there, and they want to keep control, and, you know who is in the building with our children. 
>> I was talking to the state police, and they said they are processing the scene still, which means there are children still inside. How do you explain to your son what has happened about his classmates? 
>> We -- we are a fairly religious family and we just had talked about that they had gone to heaven, and to, you know, be with jesus and that's about all we can say. You know, and talk about you're not going to see them anymore and not going to be around, and it's -- you really just struggle to find the words, you know, as to what happened. 
>> You should know that everyone is sending their well wishes, not just to you and your family, but to the community as a whole. 
>> We are a strong community. A strong family community with a lot of love. So I think that we'll get through this somehow, some way. 
>> Christine, thanks so much. We appreciate it. Right back to anderson. 
>> Soledad, thanks very much. We'll be right back. Americans are always ready to work hard for a better future. Since ameriprise financial was founded back in 1894, they've been committed to putting clients first. Helping generations through tough times. Good times. Never taking a bailout.

>> I would like to share with you a letter from his holiness, pope benedict xvi, I was promptly informed of the shooting in sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. I conhave a my heartfelt grief and my personal prayers to the victims and their families. To all of those in the community of newtown and especially the parish of st. Rose of lima. 
>> I have no words that make the pain of what happened today easy to bear. I'm heartbroken, as I know all of you are. Nothing more hurtful or tragic than the loss of innocence, but no more so when those lost are young children. I'm heartbroken. 
>> People's children, brothers and sisters, were taken from them. People's spouses. Those teachers and administrators were taken from us.

=======================================================

Three patienere admitted there. The hospital is in lockdown as a precaution. David, how do we absorb this kind of unfolding horror? 
>> Well, I think very slowly as we get more details, and this is just horrifying. You know, I have three young kids, and, unfortunately, they're subjected to drills now in schools with this kind of scenario of a gunman coming in, how to stay safe. It's a very difficult thing to discuss with children, but we are in the middle of what is an unfold and a horrifying situation, so we'll await for the details, but there very quickly becomes a national conversation, not just absorbing these details and warning, but also about some kind of debate about guns in our culture that we never seem to really get around to have. After mass shootings, we say, well, is it not appropriate to have some sort of discussion? Well, we'll do it later. We've had a congresswoman shot. We'll do it later. Presidential race comes and goes, no big debate about gun violence in this country. I think we know that those debates get renewed in this town and beyond. That will be part of this. At the moment we're going to be monitoring a breaking situation with all of the horrifying and chilling details. 
>> In fact, only 24 hours ago on this program we had people from the brady campaign talking about the fact that 40% of the guns that get out there are sold on-line with no back ground check. 40%. No background checks at all. Susan paige, you were just sharing that one governor -- a governor in a western state has now spoken out. Of course, aurora fresh on their memories there as well as the rest of the nation. Has spoken out in terms of some gun control. Let me just update from wnorthbound's jonathan dietz, and this is very preliminary and we know these numbers are going to change, and the story will evolve, but a law enforcement official who jonathan, who is our experienced criminal justice reporter in new york at wnbc is reporting that a law enforcement official in the area is saying that 17 or 18 children may, in fact, be dead and that seven or eight adults as well are believed killed. 

[00:02:09]


>> Well, first, of course, our thoughts and prayers are with those people with their family members who are now, I'm sure, trying to find out what happened. We hope that situation -- we -- our thoughts are with them. David is exactly right. There's been no debate about gun control in this country for years, despite a series of these horrific shootings. I wonder if that's about to change. Governor hickenlooper, the very popular governor of colorado, says enough time has passed since that movie theater shooting that was so horrific says now may be the time in january for the legislature there to talk about gun control, and michael bloomberg, who is about to leave as mayor of new york says he wants to be a counterweight to the nra and has made some contributions in this past election for candidates who are willing to talk about gun control. 
>> Exactly. Countrying melvin has an update on what is happening in connecticut as we await the news conference from law enforcement and hospital officials. Craig. 
>> Hey there, andrea. Just -- I heard the conversation briefly. I do want to update the numbers right now. This is, again, according to nbc news.Com. At this point 4 killed, 24 killed in that school shooting including 17 children. Again, as you just indicated, those numbers are expected to change, but, again, at this point, 24 killed. 17 of them are children. We are awaiting a news conference as well. There are numerous injuries as well as you might imagine. This is newtown, connecticut, for folks who are not familiar. This town is roughly about 27,000, 28,000 folks who live there. I live roughly 15, 20 minutes away from newtown, connecticut. It's a very small town, and this is one of those stories that affects you in a very personal -- even if you don't have children, for instance, one of our directors who works here at msnbc, I just saw him before I came out here. He was rushing home. He has a daughter who goes to this school, thankfully, according to his wife, his daughter is okay. He has talked to a number of parents who have children in this school who have described in vivid detail what transpired there some hours ago. Some of the stories we are going to hear play out here over the mechanics few hours, but according to him, according to the director, one of the things that happened inside that school based on conversations that he had with his wife, at one point when the shooting started there were a number of adults in that building, presumably 250e67ers, but a number of adults who managed somehow to block some of the gunfire, so there are going to be some stories of heroism that come out of this, but at this point those aren't the stories that we're talking about. This is a tragedy that is, as of right now, this is the worst school shooting in american history. 24 killed, and, again, those numbers expected to change. We are awaiting a couple of different press conferences right now. We are waiting to hear from law enforcement. At that point we should find out a little bit more about the circumstances perhaps that led to the shooting. We heard from our justice correspondent pete williams a short time ago. What we know about the gunmen, according to pete, is that he is 20 years old. There have been some other reports indicating that he did have a relationship to a child in the school, that he may have been the father of one of the students, but, again, at this point we don't know a great deal about the gunman other than the fact that he is dead, so, again, as we continue to await -- again, I have just been told during the course of our conversation here that the death toll is now gone from 24 to 26 now. 26 dead, 18 children, eight adults. As you indicated, andrea, those numbers we expect to change. I'll send it back to you right now. 

[00:06:00]


>> Pete is reporting now. Pete williams is reporting that according to federal officials the total number of dead now are 26. Obviously fast-moving events as we await for law enforcement, we've been told by jay carney that the president was notified in the oval office at 10:30 this morning by jon brennan, his homeland security advisor of the evolving situation in connecticut. We can see that ambulances and emergency responders went to the scene immediately. There were, of course, horrifically children witnessing all of this. Here's some of what they said. 
>> I was in a gym, and I heard a loud -- well, I heard, like, seven loud booms, and the gym teachers told us to go in the corner, so we all huddled, and i kept hearing these booming noises, and we all started -- well, we didn't scream. We started crying. So all the gym teachers told us to go into the office where no one could find us, so then a police officer came in and told us to run outside, so we did, and we came in the firehouse and waited for our parents. 
>> There were other eyewitnesss, other children also responding. 
>> Is he with her, thank god, and they went into a corner, and they didn't move until they found out what happened and the principal was killed and some other people were shot, and i don't know anything else. 
>> Susan paige and david gregory here with me in the studio as we watch these scenes unfold and we're waiting for law enforcement news conference. David, as the father of three children, three young children, you know that schools are now in a completings completely different zone preparing for these kinds of emergencies, and teaching children how to deal with it. 
>> That piece is so important as well. We watch these pictures, and we await details. All of the horrifying details as these numbers come in. Some of the context is that, as I say, schools are doing all kinds of drills. They do fire drills. In the west they do earthquake drills, but they're also doing lockdown drills where ty anticipate a shooter coming on campus and getting the kids in a lockdown situation, be it in a gym. It might be in a closet in their cubbies. It could be in their rooms. It could be in the bathroom. They drild drill this with kids as young as 5, 6, 7 years old. I know this from firsthand experience. The additional challenge -- the fact that they have to do this in the first place is how families can discuss this with their children, and I can just tell you, it's a very tough conversation to have with their children, as I did recently talk about columbine and why you would do this kind of the massacre at columbine in colorado some years ago, why this would happen, and it's a struggle for families to talk about, for schools to talk about. They advise, by the way, not necessarily going into that sort of detail. And the reprecussions are far and wide. What we're primarily focused about is, as susan said, just a moment ago is how awful this is for everyone who is involved, how everyone is touched by the initial shock waves of this tragedy that we're watching unfolding right now. So many of us can be empathetic about this, just watching the pictures come in. 

[00:09:48]


>> As we've been reporting, pete williams arks consideringed to federal law enforcement, officials and the fbi has the lead here now supporting the local and state officials. We're talking about 18 children reportedly dead, eight adults. We know of at least three individuals who were brought to the danbury hospital, which is a trauma three hospital. The president having been informed at 10:30 this morning by john brennan. Obviously they are tracking it very closely at the white house. The state has the lead, but the fbi supports local law enforcement and local responders who came to the incident. The local police department has about 46 or 47 officers. This is a small community about an hour and a half outside of new york city. 
>> As david said, hard to explain to our kids. Hard to explain to ourselves. What in the world has happened here? All these kids killed by a lone gunman in an elementary school just before christmas? I mean, it's just impossible to understand. 
>> Here are some of the initial police transmission tapes when the calls came in. 
>> Indicated she thinks there's someone shooting in the building. 
>> The individual that I have on the phone is continuing to hear what he believes to be gunfire. Responding at this time. The shooting appears to have stopped. The school is in lockdown. 
>> Roger. 
>> There are reports that two shooters were seen running past the gym, which would be the rear -- shooting. 
>> You are requested to stage at methodist church. I will need two ambulances at this time. 
>> Now, this is the newtown police, the police chief and commander there is chief michael keho. They have a total of 47 sworn officers in uniform. I'm here with susan paige and draifd gregory, and we're waiting for the law enforcement officials who presumably are trying to get the latest information. We know that the shooter has been killed. There are lockdowns at all schools and at the hospital which we are told by hospital officials about 20 minutes ago was precautionary to makes sure that the hospital employees felt safe and that the security and privacy of victims was preserved. They are clearly worried about outsiders and even the news media trying to get information or get in. We're talking about newtown, connecticut. The population there as of the last census was 27,550. It's northern fairfield county 45 miles southwest of hartford, 80 miles northeast of new york city. About an hour and a half. Susan paige and david gregory, when we talk about gun violence in this country, are we not talking about second amendment rights? We're talking, as I was discussing with the brady campaign officials yesterday about reasonable background checks, reasonable controls, automatic weaponry and ammo. The multiple rounds that cause the greatest amount of violence. Remember the names. We remember littleton, colorado, APRIL 20th, 1999, COLUMBINE, YOU Just referred to. This history -- aurora. Obviously, what happened to gabby giffords, out of school context, but gun violence has been epidemic in this country going back for decades and we go through temporary periods after the reagan assassination attempt and after, you know, several of these other incidents where we have an assault weapon ban and then it is permitted to expire. 

[00:13:37]


>> We know the contours of this debate, and it will get heated after an appropriate period of mourning and absorb this tragedy, but it is worth adding all sides of the debate. We don't know what the motive is here. We don't know more about the shooter. We don't know about the weapon involved. We know this is another horrifying case of gun violence. 
>> Here we have hundreds of children in an elementary school. Children age 5 to 10 years old. Here is one of the children after this morning's terrible incident, which apparently started around 9:30 when the kids were all in -- 
>> I was -- I went in the hall when, like, everybody heard the bullets. 
>> Yeah. 
>> They, like, went into a total panic. 
>> How are you doing? What went on in your head as this was happening? 
>> Whoa. 
>> Whoa. I am just -- 
>> it's also -- 
>> fear and shock. Bloo to think about even the kids that witnessed them being witnessed to or thinking about it. The issue about what we don't know about what motivated the shooter, so many facts we don't know, and we shouldn't speculate about. One obvious point that comes up, you heard in the 911 call, andrea, this was a school that was in lockdown. There are lockdown provisions in place in schools across the country. I know I think you can watch this and have an immediate reaction. Just anyone from walking up to our school campuses with a gun and doing this sort of violence. That's something that will be looked at as that is to contemplate. 
>> Gun control not an issue at all in the presidential campaign. We just had. The only time I remember being raised was during that debate, the town hall debate in new york where a woman in the audience stood up and asked president obama about trying to extend reenact the ban on assault weapons, which has not been something that either side has been willing to discuss at any great extent. 

[00:15:54]


>> What do we do to get to deal with that? Culturally, what do we do with mentally disabled people? How do we address this? Again, in this situation, we have no idea what the access to weapons here, what any of those factors were? We won't speculate about that. We have another horrifying episode of gun violence and it involves children and, unfortunately, that is going to only heighten the vitreal on both sides, but it's going to heighten everyone's awareness about this and the discussion about it many the most horrifying of ways because of who is involved. 
>> The fact that it's an elementary school -- we've had virginia tech as horrifying as all of these incidences are, i think no one seeing the face of that little boy who presumably should not have been interviewed in the first place, but was clearly in shock and was trying to cope with the emotion of what he had just experienced. 
>> Right. There is, you know, as -- I talk to my own kids and I talk to other kids. There is such an age of curiosity. My guess is that that last young man was probably 6 years old or so, and, you know, there's a tremendous amount of curiosity in the most basic ways about why something like this would happen. I don't think we can answer that any better as adults thinking about it, but there would be a lot of questions and I suspect there's principals around the country is that -- 
>> we are seeing this could be the press conference with the law enforcement officials. It's not about -- it's about to start. They're setting up the microphones. As soon as they are ready to go, we're going to go with them. You can see also that from those aerial shots that they are still making sure that the area is secure. Pete williams said that it is not entirely clear that -- we know that one of -- one shooter is believed dead, but it's not entirely clear that there was only one person involved. That there is some confusion about that. We're waiting for connecticut state police. They are being supported by the fbi just to recap. We're talking about newtown square, connecticut, about 80 miles plus from new york city. A small community. A small elementary school. Children believe it goes from the fifth grade usually and then they usually go to a middle school. 

[00:18:18]


>> Then oh usually they go on to middle school as well. All schools in the area obviously in lockdown. Greg melvin, let's recap what jay carney had to say when the president was notified at 10:30 this morning in the oval office by john brennan. 
>> No presidential reaction just yet, but his spokesman jay carney did say during a news conference a short time ago in part, "i think it's important on a day like today to view this as in the eyes of a father and others that are parents certainly do which is to feel enormous sympathy for families that are affected." Again, that coming from jay carney about an hour or so ago. That school that you mentioned there, sandy hook elementary school, it's a k through 4 school, we're told. That means that the kids who go to school there are somewhere between 5 and 10 years old. We do know that after that call came in at about 9:40 this morning that law enforcement evacuated classroom by classroom. They went room by room. Those nearby the school, we're told, took in some of the students as well. At this point as you guys just indicated, we are still waiting to find out more about the gunman. At this point all we know, according to -- 
>> craig, let me just interrupt you. Pete williams is now reporting that a second person is in custody, so there may have been more than one gunman involved, but at least one more person, according to pete, has been taken into custody. 
>> Second person in custody. Again, at this point we know that there are two handguns found at the scene. We also, according to the information we've been given, we also know the gunman discovered at the scene was wearing all black. That is some new information that we found out here over the past 20 or 30 minutes, but 20 years old, wearing all black. It's starting to sound, unfortunately, like he was dawning the uniform of some of the other shooters that we have spent a fair amount of time talking about here over the past few years. 

[00:20:23]


>> We can see as you can see there in that area near the school, the law enforcement, connecticut state officials are going to be holding a news conference. We will, of course, bring that to you as soon as it happens. Susan paige, we were talking earlier about the political impact of this. The president now is going to be pressed and as a democratic leader he was asked, as you pointed out, at one of the debates about gun control, but he is not des moinesing to be pressed by activists and advocates that have long want to have a national conversation. 
>> Maybe the timing is better for him at least. He is not running for re-election. He has been re-elected. You know, democrats who have been the party that has pushed gun control really pulled back from it at a time they thought it was costing them support in states that where guns are important to the culture or where a lot of people hunt. That would include a state like colorado. That's one reason I think it's significant that colorado, which has been the scene of a terrible shooting, two terrible shootings, three, I guess, terrible shootings in colorado, that they -- that state legislature may move ahead at the governor's -- 
>> very significant. 
>> That would be a significant development. 
>> Pete williams joins us now from the newsroom. What is the latest? 
>> A couple of things. To emphasize, andrea, in terms of the numbers, you know, we're still trying to sort this out as the authorities are. We believe the number of children killed is 18. The number of adults is either 8 or 9. We're still not sure whether that number includes the gunman or not. Now, there is a question here about whether there was just one gunman. Everything we've been told indicates that there was, but there a second person, we're told, in custody, who is being questioned now by the state authorities, who was seen running from the school about the time that the shooting began. Was this someone who was somehow involved in the shooting, or was this somebody who simply happened to walk into the school for whatever business they may have had at the moment when the shooting began and was running away? So we're waiting to see how that resolves. Obviously, the shooting investigation is being conducted by the state authorities. They're in charge here. The local police and the state police. Federal agencies are assisting as asked by the state authorities, and there will probably be some federal issues here. If it turns out, as we've been told initially, that the person who did the shooting is living in connecticut -- was lig in connecticut, but had some connection to new jersey, so it still isn't clear why this particular school was -- did the gunman have some grievance about the school, what the reason is? That is still very unclear at this point. 

[00:23:07]


>> Pete, when we talk about this kind of violence and about the fatalities, we also know that there have been injuries. We know of at least three people taken to the danbury hospital. Do we know if some of those were among those that died in this, or are there others who are injured? 
>> I believe there are others who are injured, andrea, as you say, and the one thing I would emphasize here is that this is the single most difficult scenario for a school to defend itself from because the number of school shootings in america has been rapidly in decline over the last decade or 15 years since they peaked in the late 1990s AROUND THE -- WITH THE Columbine shooting, and since then the number of school shootings has gone down for a number of reasons. Teachers now have better training to spot potential trouble. Other students are told to report cries situations where they think other students are out of control, better anti-bullying programs, law enforcement people in the schools. All of hose things together are able to spot potential trouble signs from the source of what the school shootings were at their peak, which is other young people shooting their fellow classmates. This is a situation that's very difficult to defend against when you have an adult walking into the school, so it's the worst possible situation for a school, the hardest thing to defend itself against. 
>> Just briefly, I know you have to go, pete, to do more reporting, but do wynn anything about the security and whether there are magnetometers or security officials or any kind of checks on -- at the elementary school level, especially in a community like this? This would seem strange, wouldn't it, in this kind of community, in a suburban or rural community? 
>> We'll start with metal detectors. They are the exception, not the rule in public schools in america. They tend to be in big cities. 234 areas where there has been a problem with guns, knives, other weapons of the past. Very few elementary schools in america have metal detectors. 

[00:25:20]


>> Thank you very much, pete williams. I know you are going to continue reporting. Connecticut state police are going to be reporting. We're talking about so far 26 dead, 18 children, we believe, eight or possibly nine adults. We don't know according to pete as to whether one of those adults was the shooter himself, second person has at least been detained for questioning. Was seen running away from the school. Don't know if that person was involved, and law enforcement officials there, the connecticut state police, have the lead as well as local officials with the assist of the fbi, the governor malloy is on the scene. Any other information? 
>> We do know that the governor has been many communication with president obama. We also know at this point that it is expected. It is likely that the president will have? Sg to say about this, whether it's a statement or otherwise we'll have to wait and see. Again, andrea, this is what we were tug about. The second deadliest school shooting in u.S. History, second only to virginia tech back in 2007. At this point what we know is that the gunman who is dead was a 20-year-old from connecticut. He was wearing all black. He was carrying two handguns, we're told, from one of the students at sandy hook elementary school he told our affiliate there in connecticut, he says that he was in the gym. He heard a loud boom. Then he heard seven more loud booms. The gym teachers told the kids at that point to get in the car and all the kids huddled. In fact, in fact, here's one of those eyewitness accounts. 
>> She came out. She was crying. All the other students were crying. The thing she told me was that it really started when she heard gunshots and she heard screams on the intercom. The intercomcame on, and there were screams. You know, the school went on lockdown, and based on what she said, she was in art class, and they were hiding in the closet, and tiny closet all bundled up, and they were hearing screams and it was horrible. 

[00:27:28]


>> Earlier you told me you find this situation to be disgusting, that anyone would do anything like this. 
>> It truly is. It's sickening. It's horrible that some people, you know, think that they can do this stuff. It's unfortunately a growing trend here in the united states, and it's just horrible. 
>> Again, you also told me that state police actually told your sister and her class to close their eyes. Describe that scene to me. 
>> Correct. When they were leaving the schools, the school has a really one big hallway. It's shaped like a square. They were leaving the school. The state troopers and the fbi, whoever was there, they were telling all the children to hold hands and close their eyes until they were outside, so, I mean, obviously what was in there must have been very gruesome and my sister said she -- what she saw was just police everywhere. Police with guns in every corner. 
>> A terrifying situation. Mark, thank you so much for speaking with me. I'm glad your sister is okay. Thank you very much. 
>>> Again, that's just one of the eyewitness accounts there from sandy hook. For folks who are not familiar with newtown, this is a small scenic town. It's a very small town just about 27,000, 28,000 folks who live there. It's 60 miles northeast of here in new york city. The white house spokesman jay carney, again, earlier today in a news conference, he did not say that this was the time to start a conversation about gun control in this country. Today was a day to grieve and to mourn and to try t figure out precisely what happened here. Again, we are waiting on that news conference, andrea, to find out, again, precisely what went down this morning in sandy hook elementary school. 
>> Thanks, craig. Susan paige is here with me. Suzanne, we've talked about these incidents before. Gabby giffords galvanized the nation. That not a school incident, but children were killed in that, in fact, among the dead. It was a child that had gone to the congress on the corner gathering place as an object lesson citizenship. What has to happen for this to have a critical mass as far as a political issue? 

[00:29:52]


>> That's the right question. Is this the moment or not? Wfk, it's true that this is not the day to talk about the politics of it. We're still trying to figure out what happened, and we're still thinking about the people who have been hurt, but is this the tipping point? I don't know the answer to that. You know, it's -- I guess we've come to expect that at colleges and even in high schools that kids will be prepared for terrible situations like this, but this is a school -- this is a kindergarten to fourth grade school, and they've apparently also had lockdown protocols established with these kids that they were following. Thank goodness they were. The idea that they felt it was necessary and that it turned out to be necessary, what does that say? 
>> As we wait for the law enforcement, for the connecticut state troopers to give their reports, obviously, they are trying to figure out what the situation is on the ground. We know that the shooter, one shooter, is dead. Pete williams is reporting that a second person, the second man, has been detained, is being questioned, has been arrested. We have correspondent on the scene and en route to the scene as well. We're talking about several hundred children who were evacuated from the school, and we're told, according to that eyewitness, to avert their eyes because of what had happened, the carnage around them. 
>> It's such a horrifying picture of these -- you can just picture these children holding hands, closing their eyes and walking past what must have been carnage. The little boy that we heard earlier talk about what he heard and his reaction. They said how are you feeling. Awhat did you think? He said whoa. Just really tumpz -- certainly something he will never forget. 
>> Some of the eyewitness accounts as the children were being evacuated, they were seeing this kind of horrific pictures as well as hearing the sounds. Joining us now is jeffrey goldberg from "the atlantic." Jeffrey, you have covered these kinds of incidents before. This is a debate this country has not been willing to engage in. 

[00:32:01]


>> It hasn't been willing to engage in. After aurora, if you recall, the democratic governor of colorado said this isn't about gun control issue, not even this is not even about the gun show loophole issue, so it's -- it's interesting. This, I imagine, will spark the debate that aurora -- as bad as aurora was, this has to spark at least some debate. Not only about the gun show loophole, but about schools and how they defend themselves and the rights of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves and being aable to operate the dangerously ill from guns because that's what we don't know what -- this is mujahedin. 
>> That was a debate also because of the clinical history. 
>> Absolutely. Absolutely. 
>> Of the suspect in aurora. I do know that after virginia tech colleges across the country were under legal obligation and moral obligation to take steps and very different kinds of alert systems were put in place. Kristin walker is at the white house where the president was notified around 10:30 this morning, so that's about an hour after this took place after the incident first started at 9:30 this morning, and the president was notified by john brennannd has also spoken since with the fbi director, director mueller. Kristin. 
>> That's correct, andrea. He has also spoken with the governor of connecticut. White house officials say he is monitoring this situation. He is getting regular updates. White house press secretary jay carney holding his daily briefing. He was peppered with questions about the president's reaction, and carney said, look, he i going to with hold his reaction until he has more details, but he is obviously watching these horrific tragic events unfold along with the rest of the country. Here's a little bit more of what white house press secretary jay carney had thoughs a few minutes ago. Take a listen. 
>> I really encourage all of us to give a moment here to focus on what is an unfolding tragedy in connecticut, and not to engage in washington policy battles that are long-running. That they -- we do that often and it's appropriate and I'm sure the day for this will come, but today support that day in our mind. We'll focus right now on what's happening in connecticut. 

[00:34:23]


>> And, andrea, that was carney's response to a question about whether or not this ent would spark the president to get reengaged in his efforts for stiffer gun control, and carney making the point that today is not the day to have that conversation. Today is the day to essentially be focused on the victims in connecticut. Carney also made the point that the president is a father. He is a husband. He is watching these events unfold in that capacity as well as the president and carney says it is likely that we will hear from president obama a little bit later on today. As you know, andrea, it is customary for president obama to come out and to address the nation when such a tragedy occurs, so it seems as though that is something he is currently considering, but, again, right now the white house really withholding its response until they have more information about what exactly occurred and the events that unfolded, but president obama getting updated throughout the morning, throughout the afternoon, and he was notified at about 10:30 this morning by his national security advisor, john brennan. Clearly in close contact with him as they all w these horrific events. Andrea. 
>> Kristen, thank you. I know you're standing by there at the white house. Jeff goldberg, what is the chal inc. Here for washington with -- to work with governors, to work with state and local officials who are now governor malloy is dealing with the emergency, but he is going to move very quickly to try to show some new leadership here. 
>> Well, you know, there has to be -- the sides in this are so polarized. You have a gun lobby that doesn't want any regulation whatsoever, any background checking whatsoever. 40% of all guns sold in this country legally are sold without background checks, so there's -- people call this the loophole, but it's bigger than a loophole. That's one area. One of the other issues -- this is why the conversation always goes off the rails -- is that people in the anti-gun side of things tend to demonize the legal gun owners and treat them as barbarians instead of people that they have to have a dialogue with, so you have -- brady campaign is in the middle. They've done a good job in my coverage of nondemonizing people who own guns and believe even in the right of self-defense. 

[00:36:39]


>> To that point they were here yesterday. We did a segment on this very subject, and they said they were not arguing with the second amendment. They're -- 
>> they've given that fight up. 
>> They're talking about the 40% who are not covered at all by any kind of background checks. 
>> You know, dan gross, the president, you know, I was speaking to him recently about this. There's the loophole issue, and there's this separate issue, which is how do you keep the non-adjudicated mentally ill, people who haven't gone to -- people who haven't been committed involuntary, how do you keep them from gaining access to weapons? It's a very small portion of the mentally ill community, but this rizs questions that make the gun show loophole look like an easy problem, because, you know, you're talking about psychiatrists and therapists reporting people they feel might one day be dangerous. It's a very, very -- we don't know who this person -- we't know anything about these people, but we know from past experiences, giffords, aurora, and going back to columbine we know that mental illness, this is the vektor. It's mental illness, plus access to weapons, and that is a -- that's something that has to be explored deeply, even though it's xwred reply troubling about medical privacy issues, et cetera, but it's something that has to be done. 
>> Let's listen in on the local coverage right now, wvip. 
>> When this all went down. Again, the governor being briefed at the moment. He might be leaving this building soon. We're told he is going to be heading up the road to that press conference in just a little while, but again, very much a somber scene out here right outside of the sandy hook school where we continue to hear that more children have been -- have passed because of this awful shooting. Again, we're expecting to learn more about the gunman, more about the motives. Once police give says an update in just a little while, and we're starting to see family members, parents possibly heading to this staging area. Not really wanting to talk to the media, of course. Such a sensitive topic for this community. Everybody that we spoke to has, you know, been so upset by what ppened. Let's show you what one parent had to say about the teacher who stepped up and saved the kids at her school. 

[00:38:53]


>> Wvit's reporter there on the scene. Joining us is colin goddard, a survivor of virginia tech. That shooting still carries several bullets in his body, and has become an advocate many favor of controls. You are going through this experience now watching this. Obviously an elementary school and a different experience than you hilary clinton but share with this whatever this brings to mind and this horrible day at virginia tech. 
>> I'm still trying to wrap my head around what happened in oregon earlier this week. You know, when I saw on twitter this morning that this had happened, I sunk in my chair, you know. You really can't do justice to what these kids and what these teachers have just experienced the violence, the intensity, the sadness. This is not something that should be normal in our country. This is not something that other countries experience like we do. Today is the day for sympathy. Today is the day to be with your loved ones to tell people who you're close to how much they mean to you, you . We have to think about what we're going to do after today, what we're going to do between now and the next major shooting that happens. Our decision makers think this is something they can't influence, this is something they think they can't do anything about. The majority of us don't want to see these things continue to happen and live in a country like this. We need to let them know that we want to live in a better country than this. We want -- that we're better than this. You know? It's -- it kills me every time i see this. I try to put it towards more motivation to keep doing, to keep calling for changes torque keep calling for improvements in our society across all levels so that these things don't keep happening to other people. 
>> Colin, right now we're going to go to the news conference with the connecticut state officials. 
>> As can you imagine, the governor is horrified by what's happened. He is meeting with the families right now. His chief concern is to get the families, the information they need as quickly as possible. That's why he is not here. I'm going to introduce lieutenant paul vants who will talk about what's going on so far. You are interested in information. We would like to get you that information as quickly as possible wrshl the chief concern was making sure that the family has information as quickly as possible, and that's where he is now. 

[00:41:33]


>> Good afternoon. I will give you basic and brief information as we know it now. Newtown police received a 911 call for an emergency at the elementary school. Newtown p.D. Upon obtaining information contacted the connecticut state police and requested assistance from state police and sounding --hey responded to the school and with newtown police immediately upon arrival entered the school and began a complete active showter search of the building. At included checking every door, every crack, every krif is, every portion of that school. Our main objective was to evacuate as quickly and as efficiently as possible any and all students and faculty in the school. The entire school was searched. That was accomplished. A staging area was set up. Students and staff were put into that staging area, and soon thereafter the children were -- staff were reunited with their parents and loved ones. There were several fatalitat the scene. Both students and staff. There is no information relative to that. That's being released at this time until we've made complete and proper notification. The shooter is diocesed inside the building. There's a great deal of work that is undertaken immediately upon locating the shooter, and that is there's a great deal of search warrant activity, there's a great deal of law enforcement activity both in and out of state to make sure we cover all the bases relative to that specific individual. Sufficed to say, the scene is secure. State police major crime squad, newtown police department, danbury state's attorney and many agencies are working together to answer all the questions surrounding exactly what happened. As was said well, will keep you briefed and keep you informed on a regular basis. We will put everything out via our website and with the press conferences. I'll turn it back over right now. 

[00:43:35]


>> The governor took a call from president obama a little while ago who was calling to express his condolences and condolences on behalf of the nation and pledged whatever resources the federal government could bring to bare to assist the families and to assist in the investigation. We will get you information as soon as we can get the families the information. That's where the governor is. At some point later today the governor will be here, and we will set up regular briefings. Thank you. And so without any specifics -- 
>> I apologize. We will not be able to answer any questions. As I said, the scene is secure. The situation is secure. We will notify you shortly before weather we will come back for another briefing as quickly as we can. The public is not in danger. That's correct. 
>> Lieutenant, everything here, right? All the briefings here? 
>> Right here. 
>> That is the headline. The public is not in danger any longer. That is lieutenant jay paul vantz of the connecticut state police. They did not give any information about the numbers of people who had been shot, killed, or wounded. The shooter who had been shot is inside the school. It is a crime scene. They have law enforcent agencies on the scene and search warrants are in process. All of the students and staff have been evacuated to a staging area where children were reunited with their parents. As you heard from the governor's aide, governor malloy is at the scene, but is with the families, and that is his priority is to be with the families giving them information comforting them. He will then brief later. He did take a call from the president who offered his condolences to governor daniel malloy of connecticut. With me here is susan paige and jeffrey goldberg. Jeff, we also have with us collin goddard who survived the shooting in virginia tech. Collin, you became an advocate for -- to prevent gun violence. From your perspective since virginia tech, what progress, if any, has been made? 

[00:45:53]


>> There's been very little progress. We're still focussing on getting the american people to understand that there are things that we can do together to make these things likely to happen agto other people. You know, that's the unfortunate thing. We've seen these mass shootings and we express our condolences. We express our sympathies, and that's when it ends. There is no action of that. To get together and call on our cision makers to change things to give any better nation that we all want and deserve. 
>> As you sperned at virginia tech, the families of those affected are horrified as they go to the scene of these emergeies. Here is a father at the scene in connecticut. 
>> I could try to explain it, but I'm sure I would fail. There is no words -- there's no words that I could come up with that would even come close to describing the sheer terror of hearing that your son is in a place or your child is in a place where there's been violence. You don't know the details of that violence. You can't do anything to immediately help them or protect them. That is a powerless and terrifying experience. 
>> Collin goddard, take us back to virginia tech and how that situation evolved. Tell us what happened that day on that campus. What did you experience? 
>> There really isn't any way to describe it. I mean, it's nothing like you've seen in movies or read about in the newspaper. It's the most terrifying experience that you could ever imagine. My parents got a phone call telling them that their son was in the hospital, that he had been shot one time, to come down as quickly as they could, and half an hour later they get a call from the hospital saying he has been shot twice and another half an hour later he has been shot three times. Your parents don't even know what's going on until they see you. That's what every parent wants is just to hold their child and to embrace their child. This is a time where -- when you have to do that. This is a time when you realize how precious life is, how important it is that we keep each other safe, how important it is that we come together as a community and bond and be one together in times like this. You know? You don't know the feeling of seeing this again happen with another town of americans -- of american city on the tv screen. It brings you right back to everything that you experienced yourself, you know, and as much as it gets you down, I have no choice but to put it towards motivation to keep doing this, to keep having this conversation, to keep bringing new people into this conversation with the belief that we are better than this. I don't know what else to say. 

[00:48:41]


>> Collin goddard, well, it clearly motivated you to take a big turn in your life. Kristen welker at the white house, we understand from governormalloy's aide that the president did call the governor with condolences. 
>> He did. That's right. President obama spoke with governor malloy and offered his condolences. He also spoke with fbi director mueller. He wotified about this tragic ens dent at 10:30 this morning by his national security advisor john brennan. He has been monitoring this situation all morning, all afternoon. He is continuing to get updates. The white house right now really reserving really the information about how he responded. He is waiting to give his response until he has more information. We're told it is likely will he speak later on this afternoon or early evening. Jay carney just wrapped up. He got a number of questions about whether or not this incident would insight president obama to get reengaged in the effort to bring about stiffer gun control laws. That is something that president obama has spoken about in the past. Carney's reaction to those questions, andrea, is that today is not the day to discuss those types of topics. Discuss those types of topics. Today, the white house, this administration will be focusing on the victims in connecticut and really monitoring the situation there and providing assistance they might be able to to the people of connecticut. Andrea? 
>> Thank you so much. We are talking about newtown, connecticut. And it's about an hour and a half from new york city. And this with several victims in the danbury hospital and also as many as 26 may be dead, children as well as adults. All children and staff from the hospital -- from the school, rather, have been evacuated safely according to lieutenant paul vance of the state police. This is the reaction of the children after they left the school. 

[00:50:46]


>> Well, when I was out in the hall, when, like, everybody heard the bullets -- 
>> yeah. 
>> They, like, went in to a total panic. 
>> An how are you doing? What went on in your head as this was happening? 
>> Whoa. 
>> I was in the gym an I heard a loud -- well, I heard like seven loud booms and then the gym teachers told us to go in the corner. So we all huddled and I kept hearing these booming noises. And the -- we all started -- well, we didn't scream. We started crying so all of the gym teachers told us to go in to the office where no one could find us. So then police officer came in and told us to run outside. So we did. And we came in the fire house and waited for our parents. 
>> Jeff goldberg, as a parent, how do you find any value teaching moment or how can you comfort children to deal with the violence of every day life in america? 
>> Well, I mean, the good thing is that this kind of violence isn't an every day thing. You know, look. If you live in chicago and you have random shoot thags are regular -- 
>> highest icide rate. 
>> Generally going down. 
>> Children in chicago are being killed horrifically. 
>> Any children, obviously, who dies is one child too many in a homicide. Whether it's gun or knife or anything else. But the rates are going down so you can say, look, it is actually a relatively safe country given the fact and this is what we have to focus on. There are 300 million guns in the united states of america. Between 280 million and 300 million. 4 million guns come online every year so we're a country saturated with guns and somewhat of a miracle this doesn't happen more than it does. I mean, what do you tell your -- I don't knowful I'm trying to work but that right now. How do you explain evil and breakdown in policy an people who aren't fit to carry a pen knife much less a weapon have access to weapons? Even in the state with relatively tough gun laws like connecticut. I don't know how you explain any of that except to say that maybe this is the day to talk about those issues. As much as I understand the impulse to say, this is not the day for politics, maybe we should be having a frank discussion about how to defend ourselves against this kind of violence, how to shape policy so that doesn't happen quite so often. Collin goddard, your thoughts? 

[00:53:40]


>> We have to have this conversation. I mean, the 32 of us who are killed every single day, this happens all the time. If you follow the logic of you can't talk about this, there's never a day to talk about this. We should have had this conversation yesterday. We should have had this before the shooting in oregon and wisconsin, before the shooting in colorado, before the shooting in virginia. I can go on. This is a conversation long overdue. This is what the american people need to understand is the next part of this. After the days of sympathy and empathy and condolence is sent, it cannot end there. We have to make the decisionmakers believe as we believe that we are better than this. We deserve a nation better than that. They can make decisions to make us safer in the churches and schools and daycare centers and streets. It is past due to get those things done. 
>> Just to remind everyone, this is newtown, connecticut. We are talking about a shooting that started around 9:30 this morning. According to lieutenant paul vance of the connecticut state police, all of the students, all of the children, this is k through 4 all have been evacuated and as well as the staff. They have all been brought to a staging area to be reunited with family and parents. There will be another briefing later. Governor malloy on the scene and at the staging area with the families and comforting the families and communicating the latest to them. His top priority accding to aides and he will be giving a briefing later on today. He did resef a call of president obama offering support and condolences. The fbi are there in support of a lead law enforcement officials which are, of course, the connecticut state police and local police, as well. The danbury hospital, a trauma 3 grade hospital, had three patients earlier and said the hospital as a precautionary measure in lockdown for the protection and safety of those employees as well as for the privacy and security of the patients, as well. And those who were victims. We have reporters at the scene. We are going to be bringing you all of the details throughout the day. This is going to ignite another conversation about gun violence. We don't know how long that will last. 

[00:56:01]


>> We know -- we know if we started --'m sorry. 
>> Here's a local reporter with an update from t scene. 
>> A little bit more information. Now, we are hearing that the shooter did have ties to the school but police haven't released that suspect's name. What they do tell us is that the shooter was found dead inside the school. And now they're actually securing search warrants so they can go ahead and then search the school and start their investigation. They do say that that whole scene is secure and they'll be starting that investigation. Now, one other note. We are told that governor malloy was called by president obama who offered his condolences to the families dealing with so much here in newtown and said that the government will pledge any resources needed to this community in order to get through this. 
>> That coverage from wvit in newtown, connecticut. We will, of course, continue to have all of the latest information from newtown, connecticut, where 26 are feared dead including 18 children and 8 adults. Craig melvin now takes over our coverage from new york. Craig? 
>> Thank you so much. I'm in for tamron hall today. Following the breaking news. A massacre at an elementary school in newtown. Nbc has confirmed at this point that 26 have been killed. Including 18 children. And eight adults. Also confirmed among the dead, the 20-year-old shooter who we're told is from connecticut. Law enforcement officials telling us that he wore all black. He carried two guns. The weapons have been recovered. We heard just a few moments ago from lieutenant paul vance with state po there. Telling officials there, telling the reporters who gathered that the scene is secure. That the public is safe at this point. He also indicated that they were -- they were serving search warrants, search warrants according to state police have been issued in and out of the state of connecticut. Newtown for folk who is are not familiar with the area, about an hour and a half outside new york city. This is -- this is about an hour and a half outside new york city. Northern fairfield county. Small town. Some 27,000, 28,000 people in newtown, connecticut. We have heard from a number of parents and students throughout the course of the morning. Describe the scene that played out shortly after 9:30 in newtown, connecticut. This is sandy hook elementary school. In newtown. This is a k-4 school. Kindergarten through fourth grade. So the 18 children who are dead there are between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. This is the police chief just a short time ago. 

[00:58:51]


>> Just after 9:30 this morning newtown police received a 911 call from the emergency at the elementary school. Newtown pd upon obtaining information as to the situation requested assistance of state police and surrounding local police departments. On and off duty police troopers responded and immediately upon arrival with newtown police entered the school and began a complete active shooter search of the building that including checking every door, every crack, every crevice, every portion of the school. Our main objective to evacuate as quickly and efficiently as possible any and all students and faculty in the school. The entire school was searched. That was accomplished, a staging area was set up. Students and staff are put in to the staging area. And soon thereafter the children and staff reunited with staff and loved one. There were several fatalities at the scene, students and staff. There's no information relative to that. There's being released at this time.

On the hottest day anyone could remember, speckle and his friends just couldn't stay cool, not even in the wading pool! Everyone wanted to play and have fun, but it was just too hot to do their favorite things. Then speckle thought of a way they could play and stay cool! He brought over some ice cubes and plopped them in the pool, then started a game of "catch the cube." Then, twirling the garden hose, speckle made a water jump rope! Soon, the grass was all wet and slippery, and speckle led the way in a water slide across the yard! Giggling and joyful, the friends all agreed: Speckle's new way of playing was totally cool. The end. That was a great story. Isn't reading fun? Woof! Heh heh! Hi, my name is emily elizabeth, and this is clifford, my big red dog. ??????

Emily Elizabeth: Clifford! It's story time! You want to hear a speckle story, don't you? Woof woof! Heh heh! I thought so. He's your favorite. Today's story is "speckle and the balloon ride." One afternoon, speckle was floating through the sky in a hot air balloon. ! He was up so high, the trees and houses looked like tiny toys. It was such a fantastic view, he wanted to share it with his friends. So he landed the balloon and invited them to climb aboard. They were all eager to sail into the sky and see the fantastic view from way up high! But with everyone in the basket, it was too heavy to lift off the ground. So speckle jumped out of the basket to let his friends take their turn in the balloon. Seeing ravi, reba, luna, and darnell enjoying themselves, speckle thought that this was the most fantastic view of all. The end. That was a great story. Isn't reading fun? Woof! Heh heh! Can't get me! Ha! Clifford is "it!" Ok, I'm "it." But first, let's eat! 

[00:25:39]

>> And now, "bbc world news america." 
>> This is "bbc world news america," reported from washington. Innocence massacred in a suburban school in america. 26 people including small children are killed by a shooter. A tearful barack obama addresses a stunned nation. 
>> They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. 
>> Elsewhere on the eve of a historic referendum in egypt, opponents and supporters of the president clash on the streets. Welcome to our viewers on public television. They have their whole lives ahead of them. President obama echoes the sorrow of the whole nation after a gunman opened fire in a school full of little children. And the small community of newtown, conn., At least 26 teachers and children are killed. The shooter is also dead. This is the 12 the mass shooting this year and america and mr. Obama said that the country must take action. 

[00:02:44]


>> A friday morning with chris this looming. 
-- Christmas shooting. Moments later, heavily armed officers went in and it terrified children aged between 5-10 were being carried out. 
>> I saw some of the bullets going past the hall that I was right next to and then the teacher pulled me into her classroom. We heard shots and everyone went on the ground. 
>> We all went over to a corner and the teacher was to keep us until the police officers. 
>> They had machine guns. 
>> I heard seven loud booms and then the teachers told us to go in the corner. We all huddled. I kept hearing these booming noises. 
>> As alarmed parents rushed back to the school, are the reports told of the gun at confronting a children and three 
-- confronng a teacher. It became clear that this was murdered on a horrific scale. 
>> There were fatalities, there was 18 children that were pronounced dead at the school. There were two that were transported to area hospitals and were pronounced dead at the hospital. There was six adults pronounced dead at the scene. The shooter is deceased. 
>> U.S. Networks say that the killer was a man and his 20's his mother was thought to be a teacher at the school. In washington, where the flag flies at half mast, barack obama addressed the nation as a president and a father. 
>> The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them -- birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. This among the fallen also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. Our hearts are broken. 

[00:05:22]


>> He demanded meaningful action, a hint at perhaps tighter gun laws. That argument is for tomorrow. For now, america is trying to comprehend the how and why of the mass killings and a small rural community. New town was supposed to be a haven, a world away from the bustle of nearby new york. Today, the elementary school was robbed of it and since joining colorblind and virginia tech of the grim roll call of loss. 
-- Joining columbine and virginia tech of the grim roll- call of loss. 
>> What are the police saying? Do we know any more about what happened? 
>> >> Police are not saying very much, actually. They have not officially released the name of the gunmen but they have confirmed there was only one. They were arguing that there might have been a key. What we had been hearing unofficially is that he was a 20-year-old who was the son of a teacher at the school. The way he was described was completely dressed in black carrying two handguns. He stopped at the principal's office, shot the principal, scott the school psychologist, injured the vice principal and then continued on to the kindergarten class where his mother was a teacher. Most of the shootings took place inrooms. The children that were killed were apparently very on. We have heard that two children who were in hospitals have passed away now, so that brings the number of children killed from 18 to 20. 
>> It is just unbelievable, an extraordinary family tragedy for the teacher who was killed whose son now is suspected of doing this. What do we know about where the families are now and everyone knows now who has been killed and who got away. I heard one of the police officials say that they wanted to make sure they got the information exactly right before they released it. 

[00:07:48]


>> Yes, we don't have a great deal of detail about the shootings were related to the family of a gunman. We had been told that the police are presuming that his mother is dead and that another relative was killed in the house in the committee. Very few official details. In terms of the other death, no names or other details have been released but we do know that 20 children were killed. We know that the other children have been reunited with their parents. There was scenes of panic when their parents came running up try to figure out what happened. We came across one that young man on the street was frantically waving -- wailing. We asked him what was wrong and he said he had lost a brother. There are many questions being asked about what happened during the shooting but more than that, people are saying, how could this happen? How could a man do this? 
>> How are people responding tonight? There does seem to be a sense of shock that it could happen in this affluent suburban neighborhood that is a pretty idyllic place for people to live. 
>> It is a very small town, 27,000 people. Once to get away from the main street, you go into a small street with a lot of trees. You almost feel like you are in a forest and some areas. People have felt they were very safe here. That was the impression. I think that that is going to make coming to terms with this order. Everybody knows everybody. One day and the police said is that they will respond to the scenes. Some of the policeman had children in the school. Everybody connected, they will have to come together and deal with the grief. 

[00:10:11]


>> President obama had this to say about the shocking number of shootings which have taken place in this country. 
>> Of the country, we have been through this two times, whether it is an elementary school, a shopping mall in oregon, or a temple in wisconsin, or a movie theater in aurora. These neighborhoods are our neighborhoods and these children are our children. 40 me to talk about the gun violence is the director of the johns hopkins center for gun violence and policy. Lay out for us the differences between what happens in america and what happens in other countries are around the world in terms of gun violence. 
>> Well, the u.S. Has a homicide rate that is approximately seven times as high as the average homicide rate in other high income countries. That is largely due to the fact that power firearm homicide rate is 22 times higher than average than other high-income countries. Is that because the u.S. Is simply a more violent country? I doubt it. If you look at urban crime data from u.S. Cities compared to other cities in canada and other places, they're not radically different. What is most distinctive is that our violent crime is far more lethal and that is largely due to the fact that we have a rather porous system from trying to keep guns from dangerous system. 
>> Connecticut has some of the strictest gun control laws in america get as you suggest it is very easy for weapons to move across this country, in my experience come whenever one of these mass shootings happens, it does not lead necessarily to tighter gun control. 

[00:12:26]


>> Sadly, that is the case. Typically, when such incidents occur, you have different agitations of those events. You have one set of individuals who say that we have to do something to strengthen our gun laws. Then you have another group of individuals who say that we made it easier for teachers to have guns in public schools or what i consider to be rather fantasy come rather bad ideas. There are too many people who have this notion that the way we are going to solve this problem is to simply have more citizens armed and ready to respond in a uruguay to take down the bad guys. 
>> Which is of course a very difficult thing to implement but do you think that this might be different because the age of the children perhaps in trying to tighten those loopholes and allowing people with mental illnesses or psychological promise to have access to guns? 
>> I did not hear the last part. 
>> Could this lead to tight restrictions on people with mental illnesses having guns? 
>> I think it would. We have seen these instances before with individuals with a mental illness. We really have not taken the steps. I hope we are learning our lesson that this is something that we should not tolerate, that we really can and develop systems for the accountability that makes it far more difficult for these kinds of tragedies and everyday gun violence. Every single day, roughly 32 individuals are killed with guns and homicides in the u.S.. 

[00:14:39]


>> Which is a shocking number. Daniel webster, thank you very much for joining us. President obama says this is the time to take action in the light of this unthinkable tragedy in connecticut. We will have more on that story later but let's get a quick look at other news from around the world. Tensions are high in egypt tonight ahead of the voting and a referendum on the country's draft constitution. President morsi says that ratification is essential if the country is to move on from the rule of hosni mubarak. We have been gauging opinion among egyptians in the final hours before voting began. 
>> The mood is festive and tahrir square on the eve of this crucial vote. The birthplace of each of's a revolution is still a place to protest. Now, it is against the constitution. A draft driven by the muslim brotherhood is too vague on issues like individual freedoms and of women's rights. 
>> They were the majority of the people who were writing it, they came from the brotherhood. So, they wrote it. So, this does not represent egypt. 
>> The presidential adviser denies this charter has an islamist agenda. 
>> We are fighting against the autocratic system. We don't believe that this is distinct but all individual rights, all democratic would observe it in the best. 
>> This quite a village is where the president was born. Most egyptians live in rural areas. Most are poor. This new constitution affects every aspect of their lives, from rights, religion, to the roles of the state. I would be the first one at the polling station with my wife and family, said this man. This gives power to the poor. A half hour's drive away, the president's family home is now encircled by barricades. It was recently targeted by angry protesters. It is not hard to find people's views here. 

[00:17:03]


>> Have you seen your constitution? 
>> Yes. 
>> Evolution gave them new freedom to speak their mind. Our straw poll in the streets quickly transformed into a passionate debate. 
>> This is very healthy. The people say yes, the people say no. Whatever the results, I say yes. 
>> The above sites, some voting yes, some of voting no. This is all through the resolution. 
-- Revolution. Tomorrow's vote is a major stepping stone. The nation is now deeply divided over where it is heading. 
>> A tense weekend in egypt and there was news from syria. The pentagon announced that it will send patriot air defense missiles and 400 troops to turkey as part of a nato force. The aim is to protect turkish territory from potential missile attacks from syria. This comes as russia is backtracking on yesterday's statement that the opposition might actually win there. 
>> Syrian forces bombing rebel positions on the turkish border earlier this year. The wounded brought across to the turkish side. Syrian shells have landed on turkish territory itself also causing casualties. It could be vulnerable to serbian missile fire, turkey asked to protect against any such threat, we are deploying two patriot battalions here to turkey, along with the troops that are necessary to man those batteries. So that we can help turkey had a missile defense that they may very well need in dealing with threats that come out of syria. 

[00:19:17]


>> The american defense secretary announcing that the u.S. Was joining germany and benevolence in providing patriot missiles. Does this risk raising the stakes? 
>> I see these as predominantly a defensive move. I think the assad regime knows it is a defensive move. They can theoretically be used to shoot down planes, this is probably not going to happen. They are far too expensive to use for that purpose. 
>> Syria's most important ally has already responded, saying that the american missile deployment creates extra tension and is not help for a diplomatic solution. It does put the spotlight again on the volatile a syrian-turkish border. An area given support to the rebels. The patriot missile sites have not been disclosed. All will be under nato command and control. 
>> Significant elements in syria. Four days, they had been celebrating in p'yongyang after a successful missile launch. Today was the biggest display yet. Hundreds of thousands were summoned to show their enthusiasm to the world. The launch came just 8 months after a similar attempt ended in failure. We report now from seoul. 
>> Celebrations are not spontaneous affairs. In the p'yongyang's main square, hundreds of thousands of people took their places, standing stiffly in the cold. Over their heads, the banners describe to the people's fervent joy. There was little celebration on their faces. Many of the soldiers looked cold. The speeches talked of their south korean scientific prowess. Also in praise of its leaders, in particular, its current one. Kim jong un has been in power for less than a year. He oversaw the process and gave the order. This is the second time he has pressed ahead with a lunch in the face of fierce international opposition and he has promised there will be more to come. He has said that north korea is exercising its right to the peaceful use of space. Not everyone sees it that way. The u.N. Has deplored the launch same that it breaks the u.S. Ban on missile tests. South korea and the u.S. Say it is a cover for north korea's missile program. They promised there will be consequences. North korea faces consequences and also has food consequenc. The launch of the satellite might be impressive but it is the only thing they can celebrate this year. 

[00:22:25]


>> Scientists say they are surprised by an astonishing development. New research shows that obesity kills more people around the world than malnutrition. In one of the biggest global health studies ever carried out, researchers assessed 650 million individuals. Results from 187 countries. Our health correspondent has the details. 
>> We are eating too much of the wrong food. Obesity is killing three times more people than hunter. Almost 500 researchers around the world worked on this data could which shows infectious diseases that were big killers are being tackled successfully. The downside is that adults it is becoming much less healthy. Diseases like tuberculosis are much less likely to make you ill but deaths from of the city is on the rise. Globally, obesity has increased by 82% over the past two decades. Middle eastern countries are more apiece than ever, seeing a 100% increase since 1990.

=======================================================

Announcer: The following is a paid presentation brought to you by my pillow, incorporated. Hello, I'm mike lindell. I've invented of the wld's most comfortable pillow. I make 'em right here in the united states. Do not change that channel because the next half-hour is going to change your life. 
[Audience applauds] 
>> it took me a while just to get out of bed and rejuvenate myself again, but after having the my pillow I just feel so much better... Just, everything is just well taken care of, it feels like. And there's no problem anymore. I don't fight with my pillow. 
>> I fall asleep with it right where it needs to be and I go to sleep and I don't think I move nearly as much as I used to, so I don't have the need for other pillows anymore. It's the perfect pillow. 
>> Being made in america is wonderful but it's made right. And to the average consumer, you're looking at helping yourself to help the body help itself more. The pillow's a great place to start. 
>> I'm tonja waring and I am so excited to introduce you to our revolutionary new sleep aid that has literally changed people's lives, including mine. It's made right here in america, and you won't find it in any store. But first, let me ask you a few questions. Do you or someone you care about wake up more tired than when you went to bed? Do you wake up with a headache, a stiff neck or that tingling feeling in your fingers? 
How 'bout this: Do you find yourself tossing and turning all night, stacking, folding, re-smooshing your pillows or even flipping it to the cool side just to get comfortable? If you've answered yes to any of these questions, then you, like millions of other americans, simply aren't getting a good night's sleep. My friend and sleep expert, michael j. Lindell, is the founder and inventor of a revolutionary new sleep aid. Mike's here to share with us why getting a good night's sleep is the secret to a happy, healthy life. 

[00:02:04]


>> Hi, tonja. >> Hi. Mike. 
>> Well, it's not only the secret to a happy life, it's critical to your health, and like everybody else out there, I have used my arms, folded my pillows, got migraines in the morning from sleeping on poor pillows and what it is, what i found in my studies over the last seven years is the cervical nerves on each side of your neck need to be held straight in order to get that deep rem sleep that we all need. That's our healing sleep. Healing is critical to one's health and pillows are the problem. There is no bigger problem than pillows. >> Mike, I hear what you're saying. According to the national sleep foundation, the average adult purchases 58 pillows over their lifetime, they own six different pillows at any given time-- and this is what blew me away-- 70% of us do not like our current pillow we sleep with every night. What's going on here? 
>> Well, I just happen to have some here. [Laughs] these, these pillows, uh, in THE LAST 30 YEARS, IN THE 1970s, Pillows kind of changed forever and we've all slept with this pillow here. This pillow here is, uh, it pushes back. You know when you sleep on your back, you feel that pillow. 
>> Yeah, yeah. 
>> It's like spring, it's like pushing back at you. 
>> Oh, right. 
>> You're on your back and you're like this with a tilted neck, you wake up in the morning, you've bent your precerebral arteries and you're gonna get headaches. This is no good. 
[Audience laughs] okay, this pillow here, it becomes a hard surface. We've all slept in that, with the curve. The problem is pillows give you support here and here, nothing where your c1 and c2 is-- your axis and your ulna. Those are critical to snoring, central sleep apnea, all these different things that you need support in your neck. This one h need to be kept cool. This pillow here will heat up, will also become a hard surface and it's no good. 
[Laughter] 
>> what about this one? 
>> This one here has ruined america. We've all slept on this. There's no support. This has done more for bad sleep deprivation than anything anywhere. And another thing too, when you sh these pillows, you know they ball up in a washer and dryer... The big pillow company wants you buying more and more pilland they don't care about your health. They don't care about our sleep. They don't care that we keep buying pillows over and over and over again. I just wanted some sleep and i did something about it, and this pillow here, I can't say enough bad things about, but it's terrible. 

[00:04:20]


>> Mike, I love your pillow. It has a great warranty. I love that it's made in america. 
>> The best thing you're gonna like about this pillows I get rem sleep, the deep-healing sleep, the sleep that helps all your, your health, how you feel the next day. I have a patent on this pillow, and what it is, is all three sizes of my fill are in every pillow. This stuff was warrantied 10 years, it won't go flat. It's the healthiest thing ever invented. It's got... It's non-allergenic, it's anti-microbial, but the best thing it does... Wherever you set this, okay, until you first get comfortable on your pillow and you're like this and you go like this and... Now, tonja, I want you to feel that. You see how that holds? 
>> Oh, my gosh. 
>> That will not migrate. Wherever you set it, you get exactly what you need for your individual neck support, okay? You can trim this any way you want. You can make little balloon animals out of it. [Laughter] it's gonna hold. Okay, it takes six pounds of pressure to hold that in position. Your average head weighs 12 pounds, so wherever you set that, you get exactly what you need for you as an individual. It's amazing, it will change your life. There's nothing like it on the planet. It's just amazing. Now, if you're on your back... We've all seen that curve pillow. I think we just threw one away a minute ago. Okay, that curved pillow like that only fits one in 30 people. Reer, we told you that. It gives you support here and here, nothing here. Well, you could be that one in 30, tonja. You take the pillow, you do like this, you tuck it, and you know what? No more snoring, okay? The reason is you're supporting your c1 and c2, your breathing is better. Other companies have said, "oh, yeah, we have this amazing cure for snoring." This will really work. From the testimonials I have from all the pillows I've sold, about 70% of the people don't snore anyme at all. 
[Applause] 
>> what mike hasn't told you is that, already, hundreds of thousands of people have benefitted from sleeping on my pillow. 
>> I give 'em a 60-day money-back guarantee 'cause people, quite frankly, are tired of buying pillows that they can't return and get their money back. >> Yeah. 
>> And we have... Our customer service is the best in the country.

[00:08:35]


>> We started with one or two and then, all of a sudden, kids realized that, the kids... I think kalli borrowed mine for the first time, and she said, "i want one of those dad." So I got her one of the pillows, and ever since then, our whole family has 'em. 
>> Healthy, normal people need to go to bed, stay asleep and wake up feeling good. When somebody's changing, um, anything in their lifestyle, um, you want to make sure that you're prepared to adapt to stress, and that's what sleep does. It prepares you and improves your ability to respond to stress, and so, right out of the chute, easiest thing I can recommend is my pillow. 
>> In order to get a good night's sleep we need to be in a position that is comfortable. If our body is contorted in any way, we can impinge on nerves that would lead to tingling, ness, discomforts of various sort. If you could position yourself with a pillow that is comfortable, then these motor and sensory signals that you get in a restless state don't occur and you have a lot more rem sleep. 
>> We're here with sleep expert michael j. Lindell, founder and inventor of a revolutionary new sleep aid called my pillow. 
>> Over the last seven years, what I came up with is a theory, after talking to hundreds of thousands of people that have the pillow... There's eight cervical nerves on each side of your neck, and what they do... They need to be in alignment, okay, to get-- for the signals to go to your brain. REMEMBER THE OLD-FASHIONED TVs That had the horizontal hole, you know, the wavy line when it wasn't clear? When you first get set at night, you first get comfortable on your pillow, your brain says, "okay, I'm comfortable," 'cause your cervical nerves are lined up. >> Yeah. 
>> Well, what happens is the air starts going out of that pillow and they're bent, like bending a water hose, okay? When you do that, you go... 
[Mimics gushing sound] your signal's not going through. Same way with your arteries, your precerebral artery and your carotid artery... The blood flow to the brain needs to be, um, you know, open like a hose. 

[00:10:38]


>> Is that why my concentration is so much better after i sleep on my pillow? 
>> That's exactly right. 
>> Good support, which is somehow the miracle of my pillow, uh, throughout the night is what we want. It's nice to fall asleep, but then, as your pillow collapses, you're gonna wake up again 'cause your position's changed. The my pillow, it seems that we're at a state tha comfortable and it stays the same throughout the night. 
>> What dr. Kolodny has to say really reinforces what you've been telling us about my pillow. 
>> What it does.... That it can put you in a deep rem sleep, which is the healing sleep. It's also the most comfortable sleep. When you get comfortable at night, that's what sends you into the rem. That's when your cervical nerves, your neck is lined up. And, interesting enough, what's my theory on this-- this theory was brand new-- and it's true, and it's real and everybody knows that. Now, it's out thercause you've all done that with your arms, folded your pillows and done all this stuff and flip-flopped all night like a guppy. Here, you stay with my pillow. Wherer you set this pillow, it's gonna hold, exactly for you as an individual. With my pillow, by keeping all those things in your neck straight, you get the best sleep of your life every single night and I guarantee it. We make 'em right here in the united states. The reason why I'm still in business is to help people. That's my calling, that's why I'm here and I want everybody to have the best night's sleep they've ever got in their life. 
>> Absolutely, absolutely! [Applause] 
>> I discovered that having my head, neck and spine perfectly aligned all night, whether it's on my side or whether, occasionally, I'm on my back, i can get a perfect cervical curvature, and my aligning that spine, the four cervical nerves running right through the middle of my neck going everywhere in my body and reporting back up, everything is in alignment. It's a phenomenal difference in the way that you're able to sleep. 

[00:12:41]


>> I fell asleep instantly... Instantly. 
>> I have found that I have more energy during the day. I sleep better, I'm not rustling around. My wife used to tell me that i used to flip around and move all over the bed. She has not said that since I've had the my pillow. So it's just been, it's overall has given me a better night's sleep, and again, that's why the rest of my family has the my pillow as well. 
>> With those other pillows that you're getting at the markets, they're just trash, really. They're just... They're cheap. And after you wash them, they bunch up, they're not the same anymore. With my pillow, you can toss it into the wash, you can air dry it, toss it into the dryer. It's such an easy pillow to take care of and it's gonna last you forever. 
>> Earlier we talked about the importance of a good night's sleep which is something i can really relate to. I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical, but michael told me it would really work. And after about two or three weeks, I noticed that l of my migraines had disappeared. And what I really noticed is that I could start going out to the gym, I could start exercising more, because any time I tried to do that before, I just would get excruciating headaches. And so, uh, one of the things... We talk about washing and drying a pillow... I've washed hundreds of pillows where they end up in that clump. Well, I put it in the washer machine and when I took it out of the dryer and when it looked just like it did the day i bought it, I was sold. And that's when I wanted to buy 'em for my kids because my kids are always taking their pillow in the car. They're taking it to grandpa and grandma's house, they're throwing it in front of the tv and so I'd always end up washing their pillows and I knew that i was spending more money on gas driving back and forth to the department store to buy them a new one. And the other thing that i really wanted and I knew is that if they really started getting a good night sleep now, keeping their cervical nerves in alignment and doing all that stuff for their health t hopefully, when they got to be my age, they wouldn't have the kind of problems that I've had. So it's really important for me that my kids sleep on a great pillow. And they've even commented. My daughter-- I was out working one day-- and she said... I was kind of telling my pillow story, and she said, "mom, I had no idea you were in that much pain." And she said, you know, and I just know that it's made me a much better mom.

>> We've had several people drive across the country today so that they could be here in our audience so that they could share the impact that my pillow has had made on their lives. And one of the first people that I want to introduce to you is andy. Andy, if you'd be so kind, we'd love to hear how my pillow has made a difference for you. 

[00:17:04]


>> Hi, mike. >> How you doing, andy? >> Good, I met you at the state fair last year. 
>> Yes, I remember. 
>> And I didn't even know I was looking for a pillow and you saw me and said, "i need to talk to you." And I gotta tell you, thanks, you know? Its changed my life. It's changed the way I sleep. 
[Laughs] I sleep, I think, is the big thing. 
>> It's a miracle. With your big shoulders-- there's a lot of people already like you. You have all kinds of lems because of, you know... 
>> And I'm a side sleeper, I've always been a side sleeper. My aalls alseep... Not anymore. 
>> Not anymore. That's amazing, yeah. That's why I love some of these pillows, because of stories like yours. 
>> I take it with me everywhere. >> Right, right. 
>> It's been to texas twice, arizona... 
>> Right. 
>> It didn't go on one trip. 
>> ...That went well for you. 
>> And, well, it didn't work too well. The first night I was down there-- it's two hours away to my wife's folks and, uh, it didn't make it. I woke up, you know, after an hour, two hours, three hours. Finally, five o'clock in the morning, I got up, drove back up to where we live, grabbed the 
PILLOW... >> Tonja: Wow! 
>> There you go! 
>> So, on the second night... [Applause] the second night, I had a good night's sleep. 
>> Mike: Right, that's awesome. 
>> And then, my wife, she'd like tthank you because I don't snore. 
>> Wow, that's a... [Laughs] you're back in the same bedroom! >> It's great. 
>> You know, it just goes to show even someone your size... We help everybody, from the smallest person up to the biggest, you know? 
>> It's great. 
>> That's an awesome story. 
>> And we're gonna see you again at the state fair this year? >> Yes, you are. I'll be there myself. 
>> Thanks. 
>> Thank you. 
[Applause] 
>> andy was so enthusiastic about sharing his story and being here today so i can see why. Thank you, andy. And next we have jennifer. I'm very happy to have jennifer up to share with us how my pillow's made a difference in her life. 
>> HI! >> Mike: Hello. 

[00:19:05]


>> Tonja: Hello, jennifer. 
>> How are you guys? 
>> Mike and Tonja: Good. 
>> Good. Um... I just am a busy person on the go. I have two little girls that i chase after and I have my own company, a floral design company, and I volunteer every day. So when I go to bed, I really, really need sleep and I've tried pretty much every pillow out 
there: The flat pillows, the firm, I tried a water pillow and those memory foam pillows and i always woke up with a dull headache, just... It was not, you don't have the energy and you can't deal with children when you're dealing with that. I saw my pillow at one of your shows and I thought, you know, I'd invested enough money on pillows that didn't work, so i thought I'd just try it. And that night I had the best night's sleep of my life in years and it's... It's, I've had the best night's sleep every night. I don't toss and turn anymore, i don't wake up with a dull headache. I just really feel good when I wake up. I have energy and i love my pillow. 
>> Did you believe it when you saw the sign that said it did all that? It's too good to be true! 
>> I was really skeptical. My husband is the biggest skeptic ever. He's like, "you want to spend money on a pillow? Go ahead, we'll see what happens," rolling his eyes. And, honest, it worked so well. I love my pillow, love it. 
>> Mike: Thank you, that's awesome. Thank you. 
>> Thank you for making it. [Applause] 
>> I know, mike, that the 60-night money-back guarantee really makes a big difference for people who are skeptical, who know that they want to try a pillow but maybe they're afraid because they have had so many in the past that didn't work. 
>> Right, and I've said, you know, back when I invented this seven years ago, or eight years ago, whatever it's been now, that was the one thing I wanted people to not have, that skepticism, so I gave the... I believed in it so much, that's why I gave the 60-day money-back guarantee so they'd have nothing to lose and everything to gain. You have everything to gain. Your health is the most important thing to your life. >> Absolutely. 
>> And my pillows are more supportive of your health. 
>> Absolutely, hands down. Well, we have another gentleman in our audience his name is michael, and michael,thank you for being here today. 
>> Well, my pillow helped a lot. A few years back I had a medical scare-- I had a jaw joint that was getting eaten away by a tumor. The good news is it wasn't malignant, it was benign. The downside of that is when they actually do the surgery, they actually have to sever the muscle that normally fits over your jaw joints, so now, at night, I've found that my mouth would come open and I would start snoring. My wife did not like that very much. So I came across my pillow at a county fair, and I thought, no, I'm not gonna buy a pillow. And he talked to me, he said, "listen, it's a money-back guarantee, try it out. What do you have to lose?" Thought, okay, that's a pretty good pitch, let me try it. That night I slept through the night and it really was one of the first night's that I can remember where I didn't toss. It was a nice, comfortable feeling and I woke up cool and i work. Thank you for making what you made. 

[00:21:56]


>> And you don't snore anymore, you said? 
>> I don't snore anymore. 
>> [Laughs] that's amazing. That's why I love selling this pillow, that's a wonderful... It's a miracle product, isn't it? 
>> Yes, it is. 
>> Definitely a life-changer. 
>> Thank you. [Applause] well, I want to thank you for those great my pillow stories anfor joining us today. I know so many of us are grateful for the pillow that you've made, mike. And you get thousands and thousands of testimonials... 
>> I've got one here. I get these all the time, you're right. This is from... I've sent pillows over to afghanistan. This guy, he wrote me. He said, "i'm writing you because I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in over a month. We work 24-hour shifts so getting our crew rest is very important. Right now, I'm sleeping on a cot with a bag full of unused clothes as a pillow--" which can be better than some of the pillows you've slept on! 
>> Some of those we've seen today. 
>> What we did, we sent some pillows and here was their response. "Your pillows came in the mail two days ago, so I was able to test it out for two nights now, and I can't begin to tell you how nice it is to wake up with no neck pain and to be able to get a good night's sleep. I've already told the rest of my guys how much of a difference your pillow is already making. Thank u so much and god bless, chief warrant officer patrick devlin, afghanistan." And what we've got... 
[Applause] and what I've done since we got that... We've been sending more and more over there to our troops and we've also.... In the united states, just the military bases, to be able to sell in there because they like our product and we've been okayed for... All the way to alaska. We're helping, you know, not only the everyday people but we're helping our troops through it and it's just amazing. This is why I sell the pillow. 
>> Mike, you just have my utmost respect for your commitment to our troops, for your commitment to the american people, for manufacturing here in the united states, and just what you provide for people's overall health. 
[Applause] 
>> I would recommend if you're taking medications to fall asleep at night and coffee to keep you awake in the day that you try my pillow and see what a difference it can make in your life. 

[00:24:02]


>> My pillow is all I need. I don't need two pillows, uh, and I don't need to constantly tuck it in the back of my neck and shoulders to be comfortable as the night wears on. 
>> I work in a physical therapy clinic and we see a lot of patients with stiff necks and sore shoulders and just having difficulty sleeping. And since my experience with my pillow I recommend that they give it a try. 
>> I know that most of us never stop to think about the tremendous difference that a pillow can make to our overall health and well being. But my hope for today is that you'll take this valuable information and you'll experience for yourself the tremendous difference that a my pillow can make in your life. [Applause]

Who are watching these images. As we know in this day and age it's not even network television, it's the internet and there's really no escaping it. Although we ask parents obviously to flip the channel or move the kids elsewhere in the house as they watched this unfold here this afternoon. Another parent front and center today was the president. President obama speaking from the white house. And as is so often the case, he was most emotional in talking about an incident here in america, given the fact that he is a father himself. Sasha and malia and we all know that the president and the first lady have worked to keep their family, to shield their own daughters from the public cameras, and so to look at those images today, and see the fear on those faces, to hear about the kindergarten teacher, and those kindergartners in that classroom 5 years old sitting there, just beginning their day, hoping to get through to christmas, and it would certainly help explain why we saw what we believe to be perhaps one of the most emotional moments from our president as he tried to console a nation. Here he is. 
>> This evening michelle and i will do what I know every parent in america will do, which is hug our children a little tighter, and we'll tell them that we love them, and we'll remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in connecticut who cannot do that tonight. And they need all of us right now. In the hard days to come that community needs us to be at our best as americans, and I will do everything in my power as president to help. Because while nothing can fill the space of a lost child or loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need, to remind them that we are there for them, that we are praying for them, that the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories, but also in ours. May god bless the memory of the victims, and in the words of scripture, heal the broken hearted, and bind up their wounds. 

[00:02:13]


>> The president speaking at the white house just a short time ago, about 45 minutes ago. It's now just a couple of minutes past 4:00 eastern time. We plan to take you through the next hour here on abc news. Many of you will then join your local news during this horrific, what's become a national tragedy in newtown, connecticut, of course at that school. Sandy hook elementary school began unfolding shortly after 9:30 this morning. 27 people are dead. The connecticut police helped describe the scene inside the school. The shooter is believed the suspect's mother was that kindergarten teacher, that that was one of two rooms, presumably two classrooms that her kindergarten class was one of them. She didn't survive it. Nor did ny of the students inside that classroom. You can only imagine the horror inside that classroom. He was described as wearing a vest that he had walked in with at least four weapons. There was one mother who said, you know, he was masked alto we will not know that until, of course, the hours that follow here when we get a slightly better description. Though it's already horrific enough. That he skood at the doorway and we don't know if he actually entered the classroom. But here are the numbers as they were laid out just moments ago by connecticut authorities, that there were 18 children who died at the scene. 18 unfathomable, two children were then rushed to area hospitals. They'd been shot, as well, and then died at area hospitals. So that brings you to 20 children who were killed today at that elementary school in connecticut. Six adults also killed at the scene. That brings you to 26. And we've been hearing that number at least 27 all day. That's where we get to the additional adult at another scene there in newtown, connecticut. They wouldn't tell us what the scene is, or perhaps the relationship with that additional adult. So at least 27 people dead, and then you add the gunman, and what's not clear, authorities making it clear to all of us in that press conference just moments ago, they don'tw whether or not at this point he took his own life or whether authorities had already arrived at the scene. And as we learn more about this particular suspect you heard jen ashton say here a moment ago on the desk that this is mental illness. And there's a lot of talk about gun control in this country but there will be a lot of talk about mental illness. How we reach out to people who need help earlier, much earlier than something like this can then unfold. And I wanted to bring in brad garrett, an fbi profiler. He's an abc news analyst and we turn to brad in times like these to try to wrap our heads around why someone could be capable of this and how we wouldn't see it earlier to try to help prevent it. it. Brett, how does a 24-year-old walk into his own mother's classroom, if that is indeed the case, with children beginning their school day, kindergarteners and perform such a heinous act? 

[00:04:57]


>> Well, david, this is probably built up over a number of years, I would guess. And when you look at the profile of mass shooters, it's like their life never went together. That they had problems when they were a child. They had problems in relationship, whether they be female, a wife, a parent. And these things tend to build. Now, a lot of the times they cause the problem. But they perceive it as it's our fault that they are failing at things that they are doing. So as they ach, unfortunately, THEIR LATE TEENS OR EARLY 20s, There is this period where they believe that they have to empower themselves and as add as this sounds, they think they have the right to go out and destroy everything they believe has wronged them. And I think the reason he went to the school, obviously, to shoot, perhaps, mom, but to all of her kids, is that those kids are associated with her. And I'm going to bet that the other scene is a relative, o brother, a father, somebody else that he believed he needed to wipe off the earth because they had wronged him. 
>> Chilling when you put it that way. And you're the profiler. You know, I hate to typecast, but you look back at these shootings, aurora, I was there earlier this year, in colorado, for that. Virginia tech. Columbine. And you see this pattern of young, white males and perhaps you can shed a little light on why that builds into this profile. 
>> Well, the male part i understand, and I think the age range we just talked about, 18 TO EARLY 20s, SOMETIMES UP TO 30, seems to be where it falls. But it -- I also think, david, this has something to do with how males in general deal with stress, failure, anger, and rage. Where females tend to internalize it, males externalize it. And if you combine that with how males typically are socialized to be more aggressive, that it makes it easier, I suppose, for a male to go and commit such a horrendous act, and we look historically about how people kill each other. Males tend to do it much more violent fashion and, unfortunately, in a mass fashion like we have today. 

[00:07:28]


>> And the extraordinary thing is, is that this particular family is dealing with horrific loss, too. And we often find that in these cases. You know, the mother is dead. The kindergarten teacher. We don't know who this second adult is at this second scene in newtown, connecticut. But as is so often the case, the families say afterwards that they, too, feel and pray for the victims of these tragedies, but when we go back and look, jen ashton, part of our medical unit here on the desk, dr. Ashton, when you look back, there are often warning signs along the way and nobody's saying, why didn't you do this, why didn't you do that? We have to as a nation look for these warning signs. 
>> They're warning signs, david, that are only clear in hindsight, of course. When you look, again, at the profile of an acute psychotic break, because that's what this is, when you talk about mental illness, we're talking here by definition of a situation or state known as acute psychosis which means there's an impairment of reality and judgment. When you look at people who suffer acute psychosis, typically you're talking about people who may have paranoid schizophrenia who may have an extreme or manic form of bipolar disorder, and possibly as we just heard, you know, a history of either psychological or physical trauma or abuse in the past. As to whether or not those warning signs, as we're going to be talking so much about, in the upcoming days, had been apparent, again, maybe in hindsight, yes, but looking forward, a lot of people can have their moments where they behave erratically. It's only when you put those as a sum total and then make a whole timeline of over a course of someone's life then do you start to connect the pieces. In times, yes, there can be glaring warning signs. People who withdraw from their job, withdraw from their family, who have a history of abusing animals, who have a history of violence or violent thoughts, or hearing voices. But sometimes those things are not apparent. 
>> So many of these issues came up in the aurora, colorado, shooting. The batman movie, of course, and we then saw the suspect in court with the hair that sort of fire engine red/orange. And there were signs in that case, too, as that continues to unfold. 

[00:09:42]


>> Right. And, you know, it's important for people to understand when you talk about this condition of acute psychosis that a crime, a heinous act like this can be premeditated. And can be methodically executed in someone who is acutely psychotic. That's where the mental illness comes in. 
>> We'll be talking about that in the days to come. Of course, there's always that debate about giving a suspect in any of these cases any more attention than they deserve. T we obviously do it to try to prevent it fromappening again. I want to turn to your teammate, dr. Besser who's at the scene now. The most important people to focus on, tonight, of course, and this afternoon, and into the weekend, are those children who were shuttled out of that school today and what to say to them. Rich, you're a dad, too. The question for you tonight, is, what will you say to your own children? 
>> You know, that's a tough one, david. And, you know, everyone knows their own child best. So you really want to deal with them based on their age, and their own personality. Very young children, children who are in elementary school or younger, if it's possible to shield them from this so they don't even know about it, that's the best approach. If they're a little older than that, if they're elementary school up to middle school, you want them to be able to talk to you about what they're feeling. You want to be able to talk to them in clear language about what you're feeling. But overall, you want to give them that sense that they are safe, that this was a bad man who did this, this was someone who wasn't well and he's not around anymore. The police did their job. That will give them that feeling of security. Hugs, physical contact, can be very, very important to communicating that sense of wellbeing. When you're looking at older kids, I have teenagers, my kids, they want to talk about this. Why did this happen? How could it have been prevented? What can they do in their lives right now to take charge to make sure that these things don't keep happening so often? And so understanding your child, letting them talk, letting them know that you're fng bad about this, that you're feeling sad, that you're angry, those things are all very important to do during this phase. 

[00:11:43]


>> Rich, thanks so much. I know you're there on the scene. Have you had a chance to talk with any of these families, to hear how this community is dealing with this? We know it initially, you know, began at that 9:30 call that went into authorities and then that sort of -- that technological side of the times that text alert that went out saying to pick up your children at that firehouse, which was just around the corner from the elementary school. And, you know, in the beginning, what was early reported was that parents didn't actually know which school they were talking about. You can only imagine the fear that strikes in any parent. I'm curious if you've been able to talk to any members of that community. They've been described as close knit and they likely all know each other and are pulling together already. But what have you seen? 
>> You know, I haven't had a chance to talk to anyone yet, david. The police have barricaded off that area. There are long lines of people trying to get close. I don't know how many of them are family and how many of them are media. But these are the sort of e events that do pull communities closer together. This is a time when you need to reach out to your friends, to your neighborhood, to your neighbors, and to those people who may be alone and make sure that they are well -- they're being well cared for and that they have someone who is giving them the emotional support that you are giving your own family. 
>> And, rich, for the students there at sandy hook, I mean, this is a k-4 school. It's an elementary school. We know two of the rooms targeted. One of them was a kindergarten class. In cases they just shut town the school for a couple weeks. We don't know if they'll have class now through what was going to be their christmas holiday and their new year's holiday in just a couple of weeks' time. Mow do you convince students at this school, students across the country, but in particular at this school that when they go back that their classroom, that their hallways are safe? 
>> You know, that's a great question. And I think they're going it look for some expert opinion about when to let children back into this school. When you look at countries tha face a lot of terrorism, one of the things that they try and do right away is to normalize the situation. And remove any sign of the event that took place. You ow, we haven't been inside this school. There hasn't been a lot of information about that. But the more they can do to make that area look normal so that when kids eventually go back into that school, it looks like they remembered it as a safe place, that will be very important in terms of healing. 

[00:14:10]


>> Rich besser there on scene in newtown, connecticut. Dr. Richard besser. We'll be checking in with you throughout our coverage. Viewers joining us, 15 minutes past 4:00 eastern time, my friend, colleague, diane sawyer will be anchor from the scene, a one hour edition of "world news." She's been on the scene much of the day and talked with parents earlier who described a chaotic scene when they got there. Some of the teachers, very calmly telling children to cover their eyes as they were walking out. In fact, one of the images that struck me was the father who held his own hand, his own arm over his son's eye, doing the shielding for him. On your screen, just a quick look at our programs. We'll be covering this obviously throughout the evening. "World news" of course with diane. 2020." "Nightline" tonight. Throughout the night. "Gma" through the morning. We're going to take you through the afternoon. We're not going to leave you. For those of you who have to leave the tv, abcnews.Com, find the latest developments. I want to bring you up to speed on what we've learned. The portrait of the school is the clearest we've had yet since this tragedy began unfolding this morning. As we look back to images of that scene, here's what we know. We know 18 children died inside that school. There were two rooms, it's believed, the suspect actually targeted. One of them was a kindergarten class where his mother was the teacher. Two of the children who had been shot they hoped to be able to save. We saw the images of the ambulances going to the school. They rushed the two children to an area hospital and they, too, died at the hospital. We are told. You can see the anguish on these faces here. As we go down the list and the numbers here. 6 adults were also killed at the scene. So it's 18 children, 6 adults. Two additional children at the local hospital. And then what we don't know, and we're waiting for more reporting from our justice team, led by pierre thomas, is the additional scene where we believe from lieutenant paul vance of connecticut state police that there is one more scene in newtown, connecticut, where authorities continue to investigate that there's an additional adult who has died at that scene, but they were very reluctant to offer any more details because of how early we are in the investigation. This little boy here, and the mother, the anguish and one of the things that we've talked about here, jen, is that the children, themselves, walking single file out of that school, one of the very early reports as we were sitting here on the desk was from someone on the scene who said they could hear the cries, a little bit of whimpering, but there was no screaming. The children did exactly what they were told. That the real emotion came from the adults and the teenagers at the middle school, the high school who were worried about their own younger siblings at the school. They had a better grasp of the horror that was unfolding. You can see in the difference between the reactions. 

[00:17:00]


>> What really strikes me, david, we see those images which are so distressing. You know, the parents as streed and upset and concerned as they all certainly appear to be, they're doing their jobs and their jobs is to try and find their children and to try and protect their children and to try to remove their children from that scene. That's what the teachers did. That's what the faculties' task is. To some extent, that's what the first responders tried to do after the scene was as secured as possible. But make no mistake about it, david, just as we'll see this from the children, we'll also expect and see from the adults, from the parents who were at the scene, even from the first responders, once they're alone and know their children are safe, this will take its toll on them. There's no question. I mean, it's impossible not to. 
>> Once it settles in, you have to hand it to the bravery of these teachers who kept those kids focused on the sole purpose, the sole task at hand which was to get out of that school and get to the firehouse right around the corner. I wanted to play for you a mother and a daughter who dan harris spoke to a short time ago. She was one of the little girls in the school who got out and her bravery was really something. She talked about the emotion and quite frankly about how she felt on the inside. Here's dan's moment with that mother and daughter. 
>> Reporter: You were in there, alexis? 
>> Yes. 
>> Reporter: What happened? 
>> Nothing really much. Just, we heard, like, an ambulance come and police officer come. Everybody was scared crying. I felt a little sick. I felt like I was going to throw up. To my teacher, too. 
>> Reporter: How did you get out of there? 
>> We had to go through the building and then we had to just go to the firehouse. 
Reporter: And did you know what was happening at the time? 
>> No. Until our next door neighbor mrs. Walker, one of our friends from -- and then she said that if there's a lockdown, just you have to be calm and then just her class came into our room and then we just -- 

[00:19:03]


>> Reporter: Were kids crying and screaming? 
>> Yeah. Kids were crying. Not really screaming but they felt -- they're all huddling together and they got, they felt so sick. 
>> Reporter: And how old are you? 8. 
>> Reporter: You're 8 years old. What's your name again? 
>> Reporter: Alexis. 
>> What's your last name? 
>> Wasik. 
>> Reporter: How do you spell that? 
>> W-a-s-i-k. 
>> Reporter: How did you find out about this? 
>> They have an alert system through the school. They sent a message saying -- i don't remember the message. Something about lockdown. And so we're just -- I figured it was the high school. Little did I know that it was actually here. So I actually called my husband and said, can you go find out what actually -- what are they talking about? He goes, get in the car and drive, go get her, I'll meet you at the school. He got here. I got here. He was actually -- he had her in his arms and, you know, cryi and so she's just -- she goes, mama, I'm okay, I'm here. But it just doesn't even seem real. I mean, I still, like, really? I mean, here in newtown? In this small town? You know, you read about this everywhere else, but here. And it's just -- it's heart wrenching for the children and for the parents and grandparents and everybody. Just, I just can't -- I can't fathom. It just doesn't even seem real. It's like should I be pinched to see if it really is real? Just, it's just heart wrenching. 
>> Reporter: Feels like a dream and a bad dream. 
>> It's a nightmare. It feels like a nightmare. You just never in a million, in a million years would you ever think, you know, you drop your child off at school, hugs and kisses, have a good day, I'll see you later. And see you at the end of the day. And you never know. You know? Are you still going to have -- you know, in 20 minutes from now, what's going to happen? And you count your blessings every day for what you have. 
>> Reporter: Alexis, I'm really glad you're okay. Really glad you're okay. You're pretty tough. You're pretty tough. 
>> We are, too. 
>> Reporter: Thank you very much. I'm sorry to -- 

[00:21:04]


>> very tough. That mother saying counting your blessings and we'll all be doing that across this country and hugging our children tonight. When they get home from school. As this has become a national tragedy. There are images already from the white house tonight. They have said that flags will be lowered to half-staff at government buildings across this country, at federal buildings. We saw very emotional president obama about an hour ago. The most emotional, quite frankly, that we've seen him as president. And not surprisingly given how often he's talked about his role as a dad, being equally as important, if not more than his role as the president. And you see the flag there flying at half-staff. This is going to be a tough story to get through over the next couple of days. We're going to swing through all of our reporters working this and let's begin with dan harris at the scene. Dan, there would seem to be a couple of outstanding issues we don't know the answers to yet. And forgive me for put you on the spot. We still don't know, but it's unclear when the gunman was in the building whether or not authorities actually got to him or whether he took his own life. What do we know about the second scene there in newtown, the connecticut state police talking about there being a second scene with another adult? But we're reluctant to add anything more. I'm wondering if you've heard anything there on the ground. 
>> Reporter: I think you've put your finger on the two huge outstanding questions. I would add a third which is what was the motive of the alleged shooter? Why would he do this? It may, as often is the case in these story that you and I have covered so frequently, david, in the last couple years, the motive is often deeply unsatisfying and illogical but we still don't know that. As to the questions you raised, was he killed by police officers or was he, did he do the deed himself? We should know more soon on that when police hold a news conference. Day were, as you said, reluctant to say, we just don't know at this point. We do know that there was an enormous response here. Here in this woodsy little neighborhood called sandy hook which is part of newtown. So named for a sort of bend in the river that runs through this neighborhood. A sandy bend in the river. In this neighborhood, we've had this stark juxtaposition today of having all of these tactical team officer, people in full, full armor, with their long guns drawn. They responded in a massive way when the reports came in of this school shooting. So it's unclear whether they took the shooter's life or whether he, as I said, did the deed, himself. The other question, of course, there is a second crime scene here tonight. There is another body present at another location. We believe, as you said, an adult. Police still working that scene. We hope to have answers on both of those fronts in the not too distant future when the police hold another briefing. 

[00:23:48]


>> I can see the emergency trucks behind you. You've been there on the scenes really for hours since this morning when the first call came into the newsroom. One of the striking things that we learn from this press conference a short time ago is that first of all we believe only three peoe were taken to area hospitals. And now we've learned that two of them were children who did not survive. So one of the really stark things about this particular school shooting is the fact that so few people had a chance to get out of that school. So few students and teachers who were targeted even had a chance, were carried out by those ambulances. 
>> Reporter: Right. Right. And, you know, one of the sad things that we've seen here today, among many, many sad things, and you and I have discussed this, david, is to see ambulances leaving the scene here driving slowly, their lights not flashing. They would much rather, one has to imagine, have in their cargo load patients who need to be treated. The fact of the matter here is this shooter was all too successful and he was able to take out a lot of very young, young people as the president called them, beautiful children, and it's an incredibly sad fact. Only three people taken to the hospital. We know two of them children. Both of them, unfortunately, deceased. You mentioned this place where I'm standing. This is the local firehouse. It's just up the street just a little bit from sandy hook elementary school. This is kind of the emotional epicenter of this story because this is where parents were told to come to pick up their children. So all day long, we've been watching these astonishingly emotional reunions. You saw the parent and child alexis and her mom speaking earlier about what it was like to finally be reunited after this scare. What we've also seen are the parents who are not going to be reunited. 20 parents, 20 families, shattered by what happened at the little school right down this little road here today and this little town is now, as you pointed out, david, in the history books for all the wrong reasons. 

[00:25:48]


>> All right. Dan harris. With us all day long. We'll see you again shortly. Dan, our thanks to you. I want to bring in pierre thomas, senior justice correspondent tonight. We'll take you through each of the points here. First of all, pierre, for those watching and just tuning in, what do we know tonight about the suspect? 
>> Again, law enforcement officials were initially told that the suspect was identified as a ryan lanza. There's now some information that it's, in fact his brother adam lanza. Law enforcement officials are trying to get definitive clarity on that. As soon as we know that is definitively, one brother or the other, we'll get that information out. Again, the information is that the shooter is dead at the scene. As we've reported all afternoon. The suspect's mother, we do know that, who was an employee at the school, was also among those killed along with those children. And the law enforcement officials now are now trying to sort through person's background trying to get some sense of what the motive may have been for this tragic shooting. 
>> So the question at this hour is which of these two names has been attached to the suspect by authorities. There's some question of whether it's adam lanza or ryan lanza. They're both brothers. As they sort through that, pierre, the relationship with the woman targeted, the teacher targeted in the school, would be the same regardless of which name is actually finally settled upon by authorities. If this was -- the mother, correct? 
>> That is correct. As one source said, look, you have a dead suspect at the scene, again, the initial information provided by local authorities, the federal officials have been working off that information. But they are now becoming increasingly certain that it's probably going to be adam lanza, but, again, we'll know more shortly. 
>> But this would be a son going into a school where his mother was a teacher, and it would appear targeting her kindergarten class. 
>> Well, that is the information that the people who were at the school were -- the target was at the school, again, the thought, the early thought is that the mother likely was the initial target. 

[00:28:00]


>> Wrap your head around the numbers, pierre, as they've uncovered this afternoon. You've covered a number of tragedies for us, particularly school shootings around the country. This one, as we look at the numbers. 18 children. Two additional children at the hospitals. This will go down as the deadliest school shooting at an elementary school in this country. 
>> Awful, awful situation, as a father of a 10-year-old, I often go to his school and I ring the buzzer and they let me walk into the school. This is the kind of situation where no parent could even fathom of something like this happening. Again, as we talked to many of the law enforcement officials today, who were trying to get the information, trying to assess what was going on, you could hear the sadness in their voices as well, david. 
>> Pierre, thank you so much. You been working your sources throughout the day here on what's been a very difficult story. If I could, I would love to take our viewers back to that image. The flag above the white house tonight. Because this has become a national tragedy. In times of tragedy, this country does come together and leading that effort was the president this afternoon who said before the country that he addresses th, reacts to it initially, as a parent, not a president. Flags are now at half-staff, and inside that white house tonight, he described a scene that will unfold. He and his wife, michelle, he said, will hug their daughters when they get home fm school just as every parent across this country, and jake, he wasn't overtly political, but he did -- he did offer a little bit of insight into where he's thinking that this conversation about how to prevent this has got to move forward in some sort of constructive fashion. 
>> Reporter: That's right, david. Considering how much president obama has avoided talking or acting for gun control, he originally when his political career began as a state senator, was very active in gun control. And even somewhat as a u.S. Senator, but as a presidential candidate, he has not talked much about it. Certainly as a president, has not done much about it. He alluded to it today, talking about how we needed to come together as a society to prevent tragedies like this from happening again. No matter what the politics are. That would seem to me, based on covering him for r the last five or six years, to be at least a nod toward gun control, whether it is high capacity magazine clips, or keeping guns out of the hands of people with a history of mental and emotional problems. I can't tell you. But it was at least an allusion to it which is more than we've heard from him in the past. But beyond the politics of it, david, of course, there was the raw emotion of it. I've covered president obama, as I said, for more than half a decade. He is not known as a particularly demonstrative or overly histrionic person when it comes to his emotions. He was tearful today in a way that I have not seen him except for a couple times, the death of his grandmother who helped raise him shortly before the election in 2008 would be one of those times. But he's not somebody who is emotional, but he really had to collect himself a few times during his remarks, not just with wiping tears from his eyes but taki moment, so as to seemingly to gird himself emotionally to prevent himself from having to break down. He did react, as he said he did initially as a father, as somebody who is feeling demonstrable grief about what happened today in newtown, connecticut. Of course, we all know his daughter, sasha and malia, who are now 11 and 14 years old, he said he and the first lady tonight would do what so many parents will do across this country, hold his daughter, hold their daughters a little bit tighter tonight. And, of course, he noted all those families in connecticut that will not be able to do the same, david. 

[00:31:48]


>> We were looking at images as you were describing the president wiping away those tears along with your description of him there in the briefing room. And you and I just covered this bruising campaign, but one thing his challenger, governor romney said through the campaign, when asked what do you respect the president for? And he often said, his role as a father. That he's a dedicated family man. And that moment of emotion there at the white house today will likely be welcomed by parents across the country but in particular in that one community, jake. 
>> Reporter: Indeed. And, in fact, one thing that is not as interesting and not as important, but certainly I took note of as well, while the president was speaking to the side, were that his press secretary and one of his deputy chiefs of staff, as is normal, but in this instance, they were holding hands. And wiping away tears themselves. This is the kind of thing because the president, whomever he is, is the commander in chief, the caretaker of the nation, responsible for keeping people in this country safe. That is the number one responsibility of the president. Events like this, although they can't be compared to how hard it's hitting people in newtown, connecticut, they do hit rather hard here. Because people here feel responsible for the wellbeing of the american people. Especially children. And so it is very sad here today, david. 
>> All right. Senior white house correspondent, jake tapper there at the white house. Where he's been all day following the president and his briefings. Jake, thank you. We'll talk to you again soon. In the meantime, I want to bring in my friend chris cuomo, of "2020" in shady brook, connecticut. The community surrounding that school. Chris, you said you were inside one of these hes as this played out tonight. The uncertainty and finding out the answers. Do you know anything more about the text messages that went out, that immediate alert that sent a shockwave through this entire community? Parents didn't know at first really which school, certainly didn't know whether or not they would fiheir children when they got to that firehouse. 
>> That's exactly right, david. The first word that these parents heard was "lockdown." And imagine that. You've got a kid in a k-4 and you're hearing the words "lockdown." Then the phone tree starts. And that it's a shooter and that there are injuries and then everybody in this small community rushes this place, the place has been choked with traffic all day. And they couldn't get within a quarter mile of the school, so then they run up to the school. Police are hectic and hurried at the same time. There's rumor of a second shooter. These parents are desperate for their kids. They wind up coming to a firehouse. Holding up signs. Desperately searching around. All these kids all look the same within that age range. Over time they start connecting with a face, they see a teacher's aide, see a teacher, see their own kid. Lives from from the darkest of moments into the most guilty of feeling good in a situation because you have your kid. I sat with these mothers and fathers today who didn't know where their kid was and didn't know which way it was going to go. There were other parents who lost their kids today. And then they wound up having theirs come home. And they're coming together in their homes, they're coming together in each other's arms in what is unfixable. In terms of the pain and the senselessness. We've heard it all before, but for these families, it's all new and they're all trying to handle what to tell their kids. It's one of the complicating factors of thistory for the victims and even for everyone involved. What do you tell the kids who are at the center of it who are too young to understand what happened? You don't want them to know these types of things. That's how young those kids were, david. That's what the families are struggling with tonight. 

[00:35:26]


>> You know the calendar, it's DECEMBER 14th. The countdown is on to christmas. And you're a dad, yourself. You know they have an internal clock. They wake up every morning knowing how many days until santa comes. 
>> You know, these parents, i watched them. You watch them, you know, they shatter a littl bit listening to their little girl. She's got new teeth in the front of her mouth. She's talking about an american girl doll. And that's what was on her mind this morning. It's what should have been on her mind this morning. The next thing she hears are loud bangs. We know what they were. She didn't. And the teacher keeping their poise in the worst of moments. And she could keep focused on christmas. She's told to close her eyes tightly and she does because she's so young. She doesn't even know what she moves past. What's inside that school right now. Which families are never going to recover from. And this being at christmas is a mixed situation, because at once, it makes is so much worse because you were so close to something that was going to make people happy. Yet, more families here than not who got christmas early today. The numbers are staggering. No one could take it away. We don't know how many kids are left inside that school yet. But these families, a lot of them got christmas early, david, because they have a gift that for moments today they did not know that they were going to have. That is a pain for the parents. 
>> You're absolutely right, chris. For the children, santa will be playing a more outsized role this year, from an escape of what it is they just survived. I want to check back in with pierre thomas. Obviously he's been trying to sort through this developing investigation. There had been some question about which of the two sons might have been involved in targeting their mother. According to authorities. Pierre, are we any closer? 
>> Reporter: Yes, we have at least two sources now who have gone back and double checked the information. The initial information was provided, was ryan lanza. They're now saying they're pretty much certain, certain that it's going to turn out to be adam lanza who was 20 years old. The younger brother. Who they believe to be the person who went into the school and did the shooting. 

[00:37:28]


>> And there's some reporting, pierre, that the other brother is being questioned a this point. What can you add to that? 
>> I don't have any clarity on that yet, but any person who's associated with the believed shooter is an that will be talked to by law enforcement. 
>> And, of course, the big question, at thi hour, among many, is the second scene in newtown, connecticut, pierre, and is there any more guidance on what they're searching for and who the person is who's deceased at that location? 
>> Again, all we know so far, it's another person who's dead. Somehow associated with the young man who is believed to have done the shooting. Again, no direct confirmation exactly who that is yet. 
>> Pierre, we'll check back in with you shortly. I want to check in with your colleague, jim, who is up from washington, and in the region covering the story. And, jim has been looking into the family dynamic, too. And I know so little is known at this point, but jim, can you shed any light on the family that we're talking about here, the lanza family, the mother who is the kinder garden teacher, and, of course, trying to figure out which of the children investigators are zeroing in on. 
>> Look, david, just following up on what pierre just reported, if indeed the shooter turns out to be adam, I just spoke with a local realtor here named barbara fry who is a neighbor of that family. Her son went to school at the sandy hook elementary school with adam. She described to me that adam, in fact, was a bit of a troubled child. That she describes the mother as saying tt -- describes the mother saying he had asperger's and al suffered from ocd. She quotes the mother as saying that. She also says the mother, she knew the mother briefly and that the mother was a dignified woman, is what she said, but that she was a very strict parent. And that sometimes her son, adam, would rebel at that as her children grew up with adam. So that's the beginning of a portrait we're getting of the family we're getting from here, if it is adam, he may have had some kind of trouble, some kind of learning disability, ocd or asperger's of some kind. That's what we're getting from people here. We've also been reporting on the school, itself, david. I'll just tell you that this is a very special school, and i mean that in the terms of honored and, an honored school, a school where people, in fact, move to newtown so they could go have their children go to this school. In fact, p often had longer commutes but they wanted to live here because the school was so good and the teachers were so -- had such a great reputation. 

[00:40:21]


>> And, jim, we reported this earlier, stick with us here, because this school seemed to be doing everything right when it comes to protecting your children. When you travel to these schools across the country to do stories or if you're a parent or uncle and going to pick up the children from school, often there are these procedures in place, not metal detecters, although there are some of those at schoolsthis country. More often it's the case that you walk in, tre's somort of camera involved and a sign-in desk in the office and that's exactly what they had done just this year is to add some sort of visual monitoring system. You get through that, have to go to the office, show i.D. They even sent out a letter saying it might be a bit of a hassle, but please understand us that we have to do this in asking for i.D. Certainly we now know how important that is. But as you point out, this would seem to be a school that was trying to do just about everything it could for the wellbeing, the welfare of its little children. 
>> Yes. I just spoke with a former student who's now in college who went to sandy hook, and she said that when she was in elementary school there, they even had drills back then. And that the parents, the teachers would tell the children that we're having a drill now, and they would have to go to the corners of the classroom and they would have to be quiet and wait for further instruction and they were told in advance how to handle this. And that's, in fact, a young student told me that when she heard today about these stories of these little kids running into closets and hiding in closets and hiding from a gunman, that, in fact, it sent chills up her spine because she remembered those drills and what these kids were going through. 
>> Yeah. 
>> So it is a very difficult time for everybody in this community. Because sandy hook elementary school is sort of the jewel of this community and something that the school had had a reputation for something totally different. 

[00:42:24]


>> Let's just say it's still a jewel tonight because, jim, as you know, on this end of reporting the story, we've been watching the images of these dedicated teachers, extraordinary bravery as they took those children out of the school today. We can see some of the clergy, this nun here in this image arriving at the scene. As we continue to look at images just coming into us now, I want to bring jen ashton, a doctor with our medical team, in on the conversation. You were nodding your head as jim talked about, really a way of life in schools in america right now. These drills that students go through. Even at the very youngest of ages which might explain why they were so calm and followed everything right down to a "t" in getting out of that school today. 
>> Yeah. I think this is a reality ofhe times in which we live, david. My own children have lockdown drills regularly at their school and they explain them and describe them to me in explicit detail. You know, they are told that they have 60 seconds to get into the closest building, the teachers lock the doors. They are then instructed to go into classrooms where they are told to get under desks, in the corner of the room. The shades are pulled. The classroom doors are locked. I mean, these things are really routine now many many, many schools. So I think that even at these young ages in elementary schools, yes, these drills were practiced as any disaster drill is practiced. Unfortunately, you never want to need to use those skills, but they are unfortunately routine now in many, many schools. My children's included. 
>> They were employed today, and I want to keep with these pictures here now if we could. But, jen, I was struck by the children inside that first grade classroom. The teacher who said she had them hiding in the bathroom in the classroom. And one of the first instincts, these are first graders, was to ask, how are the other kids out there? Is there anyone else out there we can get into the bathroom? 
>> When you see a disaster like this, david, you see reflex behavior, instinctive behavior and reaction become automatic. 
>> But at 6 years old. 
>> Instinct and reactions of those 6-year-olds, instincts and reactions of any adult there. If you have ever been around a child, whether you're a parent or not, you know that your instinctive human reaction is to protect that child. That's what these teachers did. And thildren, you know, yes, they're brave, yes, they're selfless, but their instincts kick in and we see that across the board with this type of tragedy here. 

[00:44:48]


>> We're looking at pictures now, parents, or perhaps grandparents picking up their children today. The ambulances that arrived with their lights going and then as dan harris reported earlier, parked there. The lights turning off. That was one of the things i heard from one doctor today who said what they were expecting was to deal with an influx patients who had been carried in from the hospital. Instead what they got was a situation very much like what we w on 9/11, was that emergency rooms were ready and no one came. 
>> Right. Let me take you inside the hospital, david, to these close hospitals. These trauma centers. To what they would have been doing in preparation for this type of mass casualty trauma situation. They immediately stop all elective surgery, they will clear out the trauma bays in the emergency room. They notify the blood bank. They make sure they have massive ready amounts of blood transfusions available for the incoming patients. And they designate sometimes between 10 and 20 medical personnel per patient and unfortunately at this time, they got very, very few, unfortunately, that were around. But, you know, this type of disaster drill, trauma drill, routine at any level 1 trauma center. 
>> We want to bring in brad garrett, who's an fbi profiler, formally with the fbi and works with us here at abc news. Brad, as we look at this and we try to learn more about which of these two brothe it was, what doesn't change is the relationship that this was -- this was son and this was mother. She was a kindergarten teacher. And for some reason the suspect appeared at her doorway today and that's going to be a huge part of this as we move forward. 
>> I think one of the more interesting reportings is that if we have the right son, he had some learning disabilities. So you're talking about a child excluding what happened today growing up more frustrated, many times feeling more alienated because they have difficulties developing relationships. And so to go back to what we briefly talked about earlier, this sort of goes up and it escalates as they get older, they get more angry. And so result, I think he just couldn't take it any more and he wanted to empower himself. And unfortunately he chose a horrible way to do it. 

[00:47:16]


>> It almost sounds -- some are talking about this notion of some sort of a suicide mission, if you have a suspect. We clearly don't know whether or not he took his own life. If that's the case in going to two different locations, the mother now dead. The teacher. And 18 children in that school in two separate rooms, many of the children in her own classroom and then the two children who died at the hospital later. This is someone who looked into that classroom and saw 5-year-olds sittinere and still was able to, capable obvious pulling this off which is just impossible to comprehend. 
>> But they weren't 5-year-olds to him. They were just objects. They were something that was connected to his mother. You have to wipe away any empathy, any belief or feeling that he has about anyone else except himself. This is all about me. These massoters could care less about the rest of us. That they are going to get -- they're going to seek revenge and if the person that wronged them is touching other people, they're going to get rid of them. So if it ends up being that the shooter, mr. Lanza, shot himself, doesn't surprise me. I tell you why. Then he's actually controlling the ultimate end to his life. That he took his life before he allowed law enforcement to take it. So, like, you're not going to talk to me, I'm going to take this with me. So we have seen that across the board in these shootings. 
>> Brad, stay with us here. You've been so helpful throughout the day. It's still hard for anyone to accept that someone couldn't have empathy for children sitting in a school classroom. But that's the mental health component of this. And why we need to report that in the coming days, too so we can try to see these warning signs before something like this can develop. But we've learned that there's going to be a prayer vigil at the newtown united methodist church. That's this evening we believe. They secured a location there for peopleo come and pray together. This is going to be a community that, as jim pointed out, had long come together. This was a school that prided itself on its awards and what it was able to do for its children, educationally. We've learned about the additional strategies for keeping their children safe, employed just this year. And tonight, it's now a community that will hug like the hug you saw there just now on the screen and come together at this vigil. The investigation and the producers will let me know when I have pierre thomas back on the line, continues tonight, and for those of you joining us, looking for your local news a short time from now, in much of this country, we wanted to bring you up to speed. There are two locations tonight where investigators are. The school and the second location. Is that not correct, pierre? 

[00:50:04]


>> That is correct. And, again, we are getting additional confirmation that adam lanza, age 20, is thought to be the shooter as we just reported a few mom ago. Our law enforcement officials are now dissecting his life, trying to figure out what the motive may have been. They believe that he went to the school in part, the early theory is, to kill his mother who worked at the school. Law enforcement officials are now, we're also being told by a number of sources, speaking with and interviewing his brother, ryan, who's age 24. 
>> Do we have any idea, pierre, about what he had on his person? He's been described as wearing a carrying four weapons, i believe, you reported earlier today, and there was one mother who told us earlier in our reporting and talking with diane saying there was word of a mask. You would know better than any of us. Can you describe what we know he had on when he entered that school? 
>> What we know officially we're told at least two handguns were recovered near the shooter's body. That they also found shell casings which appear to be fm a .223 assault-style rifle. We don't have confirmation on it yet as to whether that rifle has been recovered. So law enforcement, again, is meticulously going through that crime scene trying to gather all the evidence they can as well as trying to reconstruct this man's final few days. 
>> In the follow-up of the investigations, these are the kind of questions that get cleared up with time. There was some initial reporting perhaps one of them lived in new jersey, one of the sons, b it would seem that the family lived in newtown, is that correct? 
>> Well, david, you know, in these situations, having covered them a number of times, there's so much information that police are trying to get. Some of the eyewitnesss tend to have wrong information. They get initial information from the crime scene, from the person's body sometime. That information is sometimes confusing. So, again, right now, they're simply trying to assess the damage. They now know the number of dead. They've removed all the people from the scene who were injured. Now the difficult work of why? Why did this happen? Is beginning to take place. 

[00:52:26]


>> Pierre, do we have any update on the timeline for the parents who are still waiting for confirmation? Hours have gone by and many know the inevitable, but do we know how this will play out? The most difficult part of this day? 
>> We know the governor, as you reported earlier, spoke to some of the parents. Again, we don't know the specific details about what was said about each child which is the most difficult part. 
>> Pierre, thank you so much. Your hard work in our washington bureau today. So here's what we know. Reporting in just now, pierre thomas, the suspect is believed at this hour to be adam lanza. He's 20 years old. One of the victims, his mother, a kindergarten teacher, and many of the children inside her classroom. In fact, we don't know if any of the children survived in that kindergarten class. And so the numbers are as follow. 18 children in the school. Two children have been shot. They rushed them to the hospital. That was the danbury hospital where they had set up a triage and the two children did not survive there. So 20 children in all, 6 adults. We believe that some of those adults were in fact teachers. Obviously the kindergarten teacher, the mother. What's not known at this hour is that second location in newtown, connecticut, the additional adult that's also deceased. We don't know the relationship between them, but we do know that the suspect, again, at this hour, is adam lanza, 20 years old and it's his brother, ryan, who might be at this hour being questioned. That's what we do not know at this point. We certainly do not know who that other person is in that house we talked to. One of the things we did talk about here with the medical team is the reaction from the children inside that school, how calm they were, how terrified they were t how calm they were in getting out of that school. Then the reaction from older siblings that were at the middle school, at the high school and so worried about whether or not their younger siblings had survived. There was a 17-year-old earlier today, he talked with our affiliate wtnh and it was a moment that I thought was quite powerful about the worry one sibling has for another, particularly when you're a teenager and you know the breadth of what's going on. Take a look. 

[00:54:33]


>> Reporter: What did your sister tell you? I saw her with you earlier. She won't even look anywhere near the camera. She seems pretty horrified. Was she able to explain to you what she witnessed? 
>> Well, I mean, again, she's very traumatized. When she walked out of the school, she was crying. All the students were holding hands. The teachers were traumatized. But, you know, based on what she said was, at about, like, early in the morning, there was -- she heard, like, the intercom came on the school and she heard a scream and she heard a gunshot or two gunshots. And then the school went into lockdown. And when they hid in the closet. She was in art class and they had to hide in the closet. Were quiet. The children obviously were very shaken. They were crying in the closet. And the closet of the art room. And eventually, you know, they were leaving and when thfy were leaving, the police made them hold hands and the police told them to close their eyes. 
>> The 17-year-old who talked about his reaction when he found out his younger sister in the fourth grade, his little sister, was okay. We want to take you back to images that are just coming in now as the scene continues to unfold. As we look at them, I wanted to bring in jen ashton from our medical team. When you talk about a 17-year-old boy, this is a teener. We know what younger siblings are like, in the makeup of a household. Boy, do you see the true colors of a love between two siblings when something like this happens and how worried and devastated he was at the notion, the thought he might not see her. 
>> Absolutely. And I think a lot of that has to do with what we know as we get older. We can theorize or guess and imagine what that 5-year-old or 6-year-old or 7-year-old has just seen, heard, felt. And in and of itself is mind-boggling for an adult or late adolescent. When you talk about those children, we used to remember developmentally they're at a stage right now where they're very vulnerable. 
>> Thank you, jen. We want to go back to connecticut now. 
>> I told you the number of deceased in the building at the hospital, and at the secon crime scene. It's our policy and protocol that we have to establish positive identification of those victims. That is a time consuming process. That's something that's going to take a great deal of time. The medical examiner has already arrived on the scene. He's going to work very closely with us to expedite that, get that done as efficiently as possible. As I told you, the families have been assigned a trooper, an officer, as a line of communication. But that was done specifically to ensure the families that they have constant communication with this ongoing investigation and they won't have to sit and watch television news or anything else. They will be the first to know any of the progress that's made as this investigation continues on. As I stated earlier, the assets that were utilized initially were certainly when the call came in, newtown police department immediately responded and immediately called for help. Surrounding local agencies sent officers and the connecticut state police sent all off duty and on-duty troopers to respond so they could immediately gain access to that building and begi search process that i alluded to before. We had the state police team, we had k-9 teams out here. We certainly had trooper 1 in the air. It was pbly to keep some of your helicopters away, quite frankly. But we had every possible asset. Came out to this scene the minute that this alarm came in or this call came in and it was certainly to do everything we could to protect certainly life and property. The community has been outstanding in supporting this effort. As you can see, you've taken over their park and they're showing up. They're offering condolences. They're doing everything they possibly can to support the victims, the victims' families of this horrific tragedy. The fbi crisis management team has offered to respond, going to respond here tomorrow to assist in crisis management, to assist not only with the families and the family members, but with all the first responders, the police, fire, ems, all working at what I describe before as a very hor and difficult scene. Certainly local mental health crisis intervention teams had been on scene and have been here all of today working and assisting and helping. I just want to make it very clear that there were 18 children who were pronounced dead at the scene. There were two children transported to area hospital pronounced dead at the hospital. There were six adults that were pronounced dead at the scene. And obviously the shooter was also pronounced dead at the scene. I don't have much more detail about that secondary scene, but there is a related scene that we discovered as we were continuing the criminal investigation and specifically investigating the shooter. And you probably saw and someone asked me on the way in here about the bomb squad and, yes, we brought all our assets in in case they were needed and when we went out with newtown

>> Oye, pues felicidades maestro, te quedo excelente.

>> Pues son la misma y te copio la idea, se me antoja bastante hacer unamaestria en el extranjero. 
>> Que suerte tienes de que tus papas sean gente de dinero. 
>> No, hombre, hazme la buena, si pienso pedir una beca. Mira ??como te explico? Los cervantes somos los pobres de la familia. 
>> ??Pobres? 
>> Bueno ??y que me dejas a mi? Los chavero siempre hemos estado en la quinta chilla, hombre. 
>> Pues nosotros ricos no somos. Digo, sobre todo a comparacion de los ancira. 
>> ??Los ancira? ??Y quienes son los ancira? 
>> Los ancira son primos de mi papa, eso si para que veas, estan nadando en dinero, no tienes idea, increible. 
>> Que envidia ??no? ??Que se sentira tener montones y montones de dinero para comprar y hacer todo lo que se te antoje? Algun dia.

>> Bueno, ya dime que quieres ??no? 
>> Necesito un libro para esta clase y cuesta una lanita. Prestame para comprarlo ??no, nachito? Acuerdate que hoy por ti, ma??ana por ti. 

[00:06:30]


>> A ver, quitate ya de ahi que niuiera sabes hacer nada. 
>> Vino el cliente a preguntar si habias encontrado la falla y se enojo de ver que no estabas dandole a su maquina. 
>> ??Y que no le explicaste que fui a recibir una llamada? 
>> ??Por que no compras un celular, nacho? Asi puedes hablar y seguir dandole. 
>> Porque la lana de mis ganancias va para mi casa y eso lo sabes. ??Para que quiero un celular si no salgo de aqui? A ver, hazte para alla. ??Y que mas te dijo el cliente? 
>> No, nada, no ha venido, era broma. 
>> No te doy un gomazo porque eres mujer aunque no lo parezcas ??eh? 
>> Vaya, pues el que si vino fue el due??o del deportivo rojo, el clasico. Dijo que se lo dejaste mejor que nuevo y te dejo una lanita de muchas gracias. Mira, toma. 
>> Que buena onda, dejamelo ahi en la caja porque tengo las manos scias. 
>> No, pues mejor te lo pongo de una vez en su lugar ??no?

>> Conste que no toque nada. Ahi nos vemos. 
>> Oye, chamaca, esperate, no me dejes aqui... 
>> Refugio, que gusto verla, la esperaba mas temprano ??eh? 
>> ??Que tal, polo? Es que antes de venir por el pan pase a la optica. 
>> Muy bien, hace muy bien en cuidarse esos ojitos tan chulos que dios le dio. 
>> Comportese, apolinar, yo no le he dado motivo para tantas confianzas. Hay gente muy chismosa. 
>> Bueno, reconocer lo bello no es pecado. Es mas, para que se ponga contenta, le aparte varias... Porque se que le encantan y mire, tambien roles de canelas, porque tambien son los que se lleva. Gracias, polo, muchas gracias. Les encantan a mis hijos, siempre se los pelean. 
>> ??Y cuando me va aceptar que la invite al cine? Asi nada mas, de amigos. Es mas, que nos acompa??e quien usted quiera, para que vea que mis intenciones son buenas. 
>> Deje de insistir y mejor cobreme lo del pan por favor. 
>> Esta bien, como dice la cancion, si no es ahora, sera ma??ana. 
>> ??Lucero, que haces aqui? ?????????. 

[00:08:42]


>> Vine para pedirle a tu mama que me aconsejara, ya te dije que vamos a trabajar juntas. 
>> Si, me queda clarisimo, pero crei que me habias dicho que hoy no nos ibamos a ver porque tenias algo que hacer en tu casa. 
>> Ya me iba, patricio, acabo de despedirme de ama. 
>> Es cierto, hijo. ??Estas molesto por algo? 
>> No, mama, no, claro que no. Bueno, lucero, entonces, nos buscamos ma??ana. Digo, si quieres. Con permiso. 
>> Creo que si se molesto, no vaya a pensar que lo vine a checar. 
>> Ay, no, no te fijes, a veces llega un poco de malas, pero es que estudia mucho y se cansa. Ya esta por recibirse de abogado ??sabes? Pues claro que lo sabes. Si ustedes estan viendose ??verdad? 
>> Pues si, hemos salido juntos ultimamente. 
>> ??Y como amigos o? 
>> Do??a refugio, disculpeme, pero mejor que se lo diga el, con su permiso y gracias otra vez. Gracias. 
>> Con cuidado, hija. ?????????. 
>> Ah, pues entonces la galana fue a conocer el prospecto de suegra para echarsela a la bolsa, claro. 
>> No, claro que no, tampoco, mi mama la conoce desde hace muchos a??os. 
>> A ver, ??como? No entiendo. ??Tu mama te la presento? No, yo tambien la conocia, porque vivimos juntos, ??ya? 
>> Esperame, esperame, ??como que vivieron juntos? No me digas que es tu prima o algo asi. 
>> No, para nada, lo que pasa es que todos nosotros llegamos a vivir a su casa cuando... 
>> ??Cuando que? Ya, patricio, sueltala, me tienes en suspenso. Bueno, te lo voy a decir, pero te lo vas a callar, ??ok? Fue cuando mi papa se suicido despues de perder la fortuna familiar. 
>> ??Quien dices que se suicido, patricio? 
>> Callate, edmundo. 
>> ??Te cae que tu papa se suicido, hermanito? Te pregunto porque sies que tenemos el mismo, ??no? Y bueno, yo tambien lo sabria. 
>> Si ya te luciste te puedes largar. Por cierto, a ti no te consta nada de eso. 
>> Tampoco a ti. ??Que edad tenias cuando salimos de la casa? ??Cinco o seis a??os o que? 

[00:10:45]


>> Tenia uso de razon, en cambio tu todavia usabas los pa??ales. 
>> Te busco despues. ?????????. 
>> Ahi te ves, mas cortala. 
>> ??Que? 
>> Peinate. 
>> Bueno, patricio, nos vemos luego. >>... >>... Que naco eres hasta para hablar. 
>> Entendiste, ??no? No cambies el tema, otra vez te estas inventado una vida. ??Por que siempre estas mintiendo, patricio? 
>> Lo que yo haga o deje de hacer no te importa, ??como la ves? ?????????. 
>> ??Estas hablando en serio? 
>> Totalmente, cuando dejamos de vernos porque entro a la universidad, yo me senti fatal. Cuatro a??os sin tenerlo cerca y volvi a ser feliz cuando nos reencontramos y me invito a salir, me dio un beso. 
>> ??Que? Hija, pero nada mas un beso, ??verdad? Dime la verdad por favor. 
>> Si, mama, un beso, no ha pasado nada mas, pero yo estaba esperando ese beso desde siempre y descubri que tenia razon, patricio es el amor de mi vida. 
>> Ijefa, ya llegue! Buenas noches, mamacita. 
>> Ay, mi amor. 
>> ??Que transa? 
>> ??Que pasa, nachito? ??Como estas? 
>> Hijo, edmundo acaba de asegurarme que el dinero que le di lo va a usar para comprar el libro que necesita. 
>> ??Le explicaste que yo te habia dado tu lana para que pudieras comprarte tus anteojos nuevos? 
>> ??Es en serio, mama? Oye, que mas rollo, es que si me hubieras dicho no te pido nada, mama. Ma??ana mismo voy a libreria para que me devuelvan ese anticipo, te lo juro. 
>> No, ya te dije que no, para mio lo primero son tus estudios, ya luego habra manera de conseguir mis anteojos. Mientras con hacer la letra mas grande en la computadora, pues veo mejor las cifras. Voy a preparar la cena, >> si, ma. 
>> Gracias, ma. 
>> Te acompa??o. 
>> Si. 

[00:12:52]


>> ??Te cae que fue para un bro? ??Te cae que fue para un libro? 
>> Sueltame y te contesto. 
>> Primero contestame. 
>> Me estas escupiendo. Si, si, fue para comprar ese libro, o sabes, hombre. Ay, esperate, estas loco, ??que te pasa? Yo no ando pensando en esas cosas. 
>> ??Seguro? Dame eso. 
>> Quitamelo. 
>> ??Me las das? 
>> ??Me das o que vas a llamar a mi mama o que? 
>> Vas a jurar ahorita mismo que le vas a reponer ese dinero o le voy a ense??ar esto para que se de cuenta de quien eres. 
>> La vas hacer sufrir, pues orale, ??como vas? 
>> Imama! Imama! 
>> Ya, callate, tu ganas, hombre. Callate, te lo juro que fue para eso. Mira, con las ganancias de esto voy a tener para reponer ese dinero y hasta para mas, nachito. Es que se nota que no tienes ni idea de la suerte, esto es pura buena suerte. 
>> Si tuvieras tantita suerte, no tendrias que robarle a mama. 
>> Ah, robar, que llevadito. Ya veremos quien es el que no tiene la suerte de su lado. Lo que no es saber, nachito. 
>> Hola, pa. 
>> ??Que paso, hijo? 
>> Oye, ??habra manera de conseguirle trabajo de medio tiempo a un amigo? 
>> ??Que tipo de trabajo? 
>> Pues no se, es para patricio, mi amigo. Te lo juro que me duele ver lo buen estudiante que es y lo mal que anda de dinero. >> Pues es una lastima, hijo, pero lo mejor seria que pudiera colocarse en algo que tenga que ver con su carrera. 
>> Pues si, tienes razon. Oye, ??y no le podriamos conseguir algun trabajo ahi en el despacho de mi tio? Porque la verdad patricio es el mejor de la clase. 
>> Pues que casualidad que lo mencionas, me acaba de citar tu tia mercedes en su despacho. 
>> Esperame, te cito a esta hora ahi en su despacho ??y no en su casa? 
>> Ay, ya conoces a tu tia, cuando me pide que vaya a hablar con ella a la oficina, es porque me va a pedir algun favor. 
>> Pues aprovecha para pedirle a mi tio lo que te digo, andale. 
>> Hijo, es mas facil sacarle sangre a una piedra, que pedirle un favor a tu tio. Pero bueno, voy a hacer la lucha. 
>> Gracias, pa. 
>> Adelante. 
>> El ingeniero cervantes la busca, do??a mercedes. 

[00:14:53]


>> Gracias. 
>> Pasele por favor. 
>> Gracias, con permiso. Prima, que gusto verte, tu siempre tan guapa. 
>> Y tu siempre tan amable, marcos. Gracias por venir. 
>> Bueno, tu diras, ??para que sera? 
>> ??Ya te ofrecieron algo? ??Quieres tomar algo? 
>> No, no, no, prima, no me lo tomes a mal, pero estoy un poquito a las carreras, ya sabes como se pone el periferico de noche, ??no? 
>> Entonces, voy al grano. Olga regresa ma??ana de dubai y ya lleva como diez veces que llama para pedir que no se nos olvide ir por ella al aeropuerto. 
>> ??Y no tienen chofer o que sucede? 
>> Romulo no tiene remedio, se la vive del tribunal a la oficina y de la oficina al tribunal. Y yo tengo una junta del patronato, exactamente a la hora que llega el vuelo de olga y soy la presidenta, marcos, no me puedo romper en dos. Tu la conoces, si no estamos sus papas para recibirla, ya sabes como se pone. 
>> Bueno, ??y que es lo que quieres que haga yo? 
>> Tu sabes que ella quiere muchisimo a su primo raul. ??Crees que tu hijo podria ir por ella al aeropuerto y luego la lleva a la casa? 
>> Tranqua, tranquila, mercedes, ten por seguro que mi hijo va a estar esperando a olga a la hora que tu me digas, ??ok? 
>> Mi amor, hola hija. 
>> Aqui la tiene sana y salva. 
>> Perfecto, agustin, muchisimas gracias. ??Como esta mi peque??a? Ique guapa! ??Como te fue, mi amor? ??Que te pasa? >>Ada, no puedo creer que no hayan ido por mi al aeropuerto. 
>> Ay, mi amor, ya te explique. Pero vas a ver como esta tu cuarto nuevo, te va a encantar. Vas a ver que valio la pena el feng shui. 

[00:16:54]


>> No creo que este tan padre, pero bueno. ??Mi papa donde esta? 
>> En una junta del bufete y de ahi se va a ir al tribunal, tu ya sabes, mi amor. 
>> Si, si se. Fijate que chistoso, el tonto este de agustin, me dijo que me habia extra??ado muchisimo y mi papa no esta ni siquiera en la casa para saludarme. Ya te puedes ir. Agustin, gracias. 
>> Pierda cuidado. 
>> Ay, hija por favor no seas asi, tu papa te adora y si trabaja tanto, es para que puedas tener todas las cosas que te gustan. 
>> Ay, mama, esos son pretextos, yo se perfectamente bien que mi papa no quiere convivir conmigo. 
>> Eso no es cierto, mi amor. 
>> ??Ah no? 
>> No. 
>> Entonces, ??por que me mando un mes y medio a dubai? 
>> Porque tu le dijiste que querias conocer un lugar exotico, si ya estabas harta de europa. 
>> Si, pero no sola. ??Sabes que, mama? De verdad estoy muy cansada, yo no se ni siquiera para que discuto contigo. 
>> Bueno, vete a descansar, mi amor. 
>> Es lo que voy a hacer. ?????????. 
>> ??Y cuando menos en mi fiesta va a estar mi papa? 
>> Por supuesto, mi amor. 
>> Ojala, ojala, porque si no, me largo seis meses a indonesia y no van a saber de mi en much tiempo. ?????????. 
>> No, no, esperate, esperate. 
>> Perdon, buenas noches. ??Como estan? Se me hizo un poco tarde, estaba estudiando con un compa??ero. 
>> No te preocupes, pero aqui mi hija se moria de ganas de ver a su novio. 
>> Voy a la cocina. 
>> Te ayudo amiga. 
>> Es que deje unos sopecitos. 
>> Ay, que rico, me muero de hambre. 
>> Entonces, patito es tu novio. 
>> Bueno, hemos estado saliendo, pero no hay nada formal. 
>> Todo a su tiempo, pero cada vez nos llevamos mejor, quizas muy pronto nos formalicemos. 
>> Claro, todo a su tiempo. 
>> Si, ya decia yo. 
>> Pero bueno, ese no es el tema, sino que mi mama queria celebrar que ella y lucero ya son compa??eras de trabajo. 

[00:18:57]


>> Vengan, hijos, ya no dejen que nfrien. 
>> ??Quienes? Ah, los sopes, los sop 
>> que gracioso, mundo. Me vi muy optimista pensando que mis hermanos sabrian comportarse en altura. 
>> Yo no he hecho nada, nada mas te he servido costales. 
>> Hijos. 
>> ??Pasa algo? 
>> No, no, no. Nada, do??a cleta, solamente la sorpresa de descubrir que una mujercita tan linda como lucero se hizo novia de un tipo tan odioso como mi hermanito. 
>> Edmundo, por favor controlate. 
>> No, mama, si estoy controladisimo te lo juro. Permiso. Lucero ??un sopecito? ?????????. ?????????. ?????????. ?????????. 
>> Hija, ??como te fue? 
>> Muy bien, gracias, papa. 
>> Me dijo tu madre que te compraste muchas cosas en el viaje. Aunque yo lo habia yo notado en tu estado de cuenta de la tarjeta. 
>> ??Y que otra cosa podia hacer? Viajar sola es aburridisimo. 
>> Ah, caray, como le a??adiste dos semanas a tu viaje, yo pense todo lo contrario. Ademas fue contigo lorena y... 
>> Aurora. 
>> Auror. 
>> Uhum. 
>> Se fueron en la mitad del recorrido ??o no? 
>> Si, pero se quedaron en londres. ??Pediste que me espiaran o como lo sabes? 
>> Bueno... Pero por favor, son hijas de mis socios. A si es que ellos se enteraron de sus gastos de la misma forma que yo. 

[00:21:13]


>> Ya que los mencionas, no estoy de acuerdo en que los hayas invitado a mi fiesta. 
>> Bueno, de algun modo tengo que sacar provecho a los da??os que le causas a mi cartera. No te preocupes, no estaremos con ustedes si eso es lo que te preocupa. 
>> Esta bien, pero tienes que pedir doble menu, porque odio tener que estar comiendo comida de viejitos. Y te veo ma??ana, papa, porque el cambio de horario me trae loca. ?????????. 
>> Te trae loca entre otras cosas. ?????????. 
>> Tenle paciencia, mi amor. 
>> Lo tengo, de verdad, pero tu hija lo hace muy dificil. ?????????. 
>> Ayer me la pase muy bien, tus hermanos son muy buena onda. 
>> Que buena onda, ni que nada, se la pasaron fastidiandome toda la noche. 
>> Oye ??no se te antoja ir al cine? Ma??ana entrena una pelicula que me llamo la atencion ??vamos? 
>> Ma??ana no voy a poder verte, es que voy a acompa??ar a raul a un compromiso donde me van a presentar a varios abogados. 
>> ??Ah si? Pues mucha suerte, mi amor. ?????????. ??? Corona de lagrimas ???. ??? Corona de lagrimas ???. ??? Camino de espinas que hiere ???. 

[00:26:05]


>> Defender bandidos deja mucha lana. 
>> ??Como que bandidos? Es tu tio, raul, no hables por hablar. 
>> Mira, ya te lo presentare y entonces, tu decides como te late que hizo su lana. 
>> Esta bien. 
>> Mira, ahi viene mi prima, te la voy a presentar. 
>> Hola. 
>> Oye, buenas noches, gracias por la invitacion. 
>> No, no, patricio, ella es olga, mi prima. 
>> Ah, hola ??como estas? 
>> Hola. 
>> Prima, te presento a mi amigo patricio chavero. 
>> Ah ??de los chaveros de teca? Ay, primo, hasta que te conozco un amigo decente. 
>> Encantado de conocerte, olga. Le estaba diciendo a tu primo que tienes muchisima suerte de vivir en un lugar asi tan agradable. 
>> Ah, pues muchas gracias, la casa podria estar mejor, pero tiene sus detalles. 
>> Mi tia la redecora mas o menos cada dos a??os. 
>> Pues si, pero muy a su gusto, ese es el problema. Solamente se salva mi papa y porque su despacho es sagrado, pero lo que es mi recamara. Despues te doy un tour para que veas como la dejo. 
>> Bueno, a nosotros no nos han presentado, soy ramon cervantes. 
>> Norma, norma lamadrid. 
>> ??Ah si? ??Como? ??No se conocian? Yo pense que si, que ma bien ya te habia hartado. Oye, pasemos a la sala para que la conozcas. 
>> Si. ?????????. 
>> ??Pasamos? 
>> Claro. 
>> Se que tambien estudias para abogado, muchacho, ??te interesa alguna especialidad, alguna rama? 
>> Derecho procesal penal, licenciado. 
>> Bien, litigio en los tribunales. No como aqui mi sobrino, que le gusta el derecho internacional, licenciado. Eso es para juristas ociosos, la realidad esta en los tribunales, no en los aburridisimos congresos, discutiendo leyes de paises que nadie conoce. 
>> Yo estoy totalmente de acuerdo, don romulo. Sin duda, licenciado, la vida de la ley esta en los tribunales, no en debates diplomaticos. 

[00:28:07]


>> ??Que no pensabas hacer tu tesis sobre...? >> Sobre derecho procesal penal, concretamente sobre la historia del proceso judicial de mexico, me apasiona el tema. 
>> Pero me parecio escucharte otra cosa hace una semana. 
>> No, no te preocupes, no es grave y tampoco es la primera vez. ?????????. ?????????. 
>> Este lugar parece salido de ?????????. ?????????. ?????????. ?????????. ?????????. ?????????. 
>> Este lugar parece salido de una pelicula. 
>> Tu no sabes, pero esto a veces parece de terror. 
>> Pues yo estaria feliz viviendo aqui. 
>> Esta bien. 
>> Oigan, ustedes dos, ??por que no se van por ahi a platicar y me dejan a solas con patricio? Porque este tour es exclusivo para el. 
>> Que oferta tan tentadora. 
>> Y tu, que hombre tan tentador, me encantas. 
>> ??Estas hablando en serio? 
>> En cuanto nos dejen un poco mas de espacio libre, te contesto. 
>> Ok, ya recibimos la indirecta, ??nos vamos? 
>> Vamos. ?????????. 
>> Ahora si, ??que me decias? 
>> Me dejas mudo con todo lo que veo y descubro. 
>> ??Y que te gusta algo de lo que ves? 
>> Muchas cosas. 
>> ??Y una de esas cosas soy yo? 
>> Pudiera ser. 
>> De verdustan mucho los enigmaticos. 
>> No, no es eso. 
>> ??Si no que? Que soy demasiada directa, ??eso es lo que te tiene asi, sin decir nada? Bueno, perdoname, es que asi soy, ??que hago? ?????????. 

[00:30:12]


>> No he dicho que no me gustes, tampoco que me disgustes que seas tan directa, al contrario. 
>> Por favor no me vayas a salir con la pesima noticia de que tienes novia, porque me echas a perder la noche, patricio. 
>> Con permi, aqui esta lo que me encargo, se??orita. 
>> Ay, que bueno, provisiones para os habitantes de la isla, que rico, ??no? Bueno, ya, lulita, gracias. 
>> Con permiso, se??orita. ?????????. 
>> ??Estas contento? 
>> ??De verdad? Feliz, nunca en mi vida me habian tratado tan bien. 
>> Pues, ??con quien te juntas? No me digas que nunca te han tirado la onda, porque no te lo voy a creer. 
>> Pues creelo, nunca. 
>> No te creo, a menos que vivieras entre puras mujeres ciegas, ??no seras gay? 
>> No estaria tan a gusto contigo. 
>> No me hables asi, porque me estas poniendo nerviosa. 
>> ??Ah si? 
>> Si. 
>> Me voy a comer una de estas. 
>> No, no, no, no, no, yo te voy a dar de comer en la boca, para que veas lo que te has perdido por vivir entre ciegas y tontas. ?????????. ?????????. 
>> Hasta comes bonito. ??Donde dejaste la nube estacionada? 
>> Junto a la tuya. ?????????. 
>> Hija. 
>> No puedo creer, es en serio. 
>> ??Que hacen aqui encerrados? Tus amigos estan alla abajo y pregunta por ti. 
>> Mama, les deje todo: Musica, comida, tragos, ??que mas quieren? 
>> Te quieren a ti, la fiesta es en tu honor. ?????????. 
>> Mi amor, ya llego el cronista y el fotografo del magazine social. ??Donde vas a querer tus fotos? 

[00:32:19]


>> Aqui esta bien y con patricio para que se mueran de envidia, todas. 
>> Bueno, ??ya le has comentado a tu amigo? A lo mejor tiene algun compromiso y lo estas metiendo en un problema, mi amor. 
>> No, no, ninguno, nada me dara mas gusto que posar junto a su hija. 
>> Ya ves. ?????????. 
>> Se??orita, si me permite, luce usted esplendida esta noche. 
>> ??Que es eso de esplendida? No seas ridiculo. ??Que quieres? 
>> Perdon el atrevimiento, el licenciado pregunta por el muchacho invitado que estudia leyes. 
>> ??Que paso, agustin? ??Me busca mi tio? 
>> No, joven, dijo que el, no recordo su nombre, pero lo espera en su despacho, parece que el juez quiere conocerlo. ?????????. 
>> Gracias por la visita y por la flores, apolinar. 
>> Fue una velada maravillosa, gracias. 
>> Ay, que pena, nunca lo deje decirme lo que vio hace dos noches. ?????????. 
>> La luna, estaba hermosa la luna, se lo queria compartir, que descanse. 
>> Igualmente. 
>> Buenas noches. ?????????. 
>> Oye, prometeme que ma??ana nos vamos a ver, dejamos muchas cosas pendientes por platicar, prometemelo. 
>> Bueno, no se si pueda ma??ana. 
>> Ay, no te hagas el dificil. No se, ma??ana o pasado, pero nos hablamos. 
>> Bueno, claro, claro que si. Oye, de verdad gracias, estuve feliz. 

[00:34:26]


>> Igual yo, adios. 
>> Pero... Adios. Que noche. 
>> Oye, ??puedo preguntarte algo? 
>> Si, claro, por supuesto. 
>> ??Que va a pasar con lucero? ?????????. ??? Corona de lagrimas ???. ??? Corona de lagrimas ???. ??? Camino de espinas que hiere ???. 

[00:38:49]


>> Patricio chavero estas guapisimo. 
>> Hija, ??podemos hablar? 
>> Depende de que. 
>> ??Te estuviste besando con ese muchacho? 
>> No, no, no se si te acuerdas que entraste a mi recamara y me echaste a perder el plan, como ahora que estaba muy feliz viendo las fotos de mi fiesta, ??y que crees? Me amargaste el momento. 
>> No seas grosera conmigo. 
>> Tu no seas metiche, mama. 
>> Olga, por favor. 
>> Bueno, ya. ??Que quieres? 
>> Saber que intenciones tienes con ese muchacho, eso es todo. 
>> Ninguna, seguir viendolo y ya. ??Cada vez que me intereso en alguien tiene que haber un interrogatorio? 
>> No, mi amor, pero si me preocupo es porque te conozco. 
>> Mama, por favor, ??si? No empieces con ridiculeces, ademas ya estoy grande para decidir que hago con mi vida. ?????????. 
>> Que descanse, mi amor. ?????????. 
(Suena el telefono). 
>> ??Si? ??Que quieres, lucero? ?????????. 
>> Bien, estoy bien, casi llegando a mi casa. Si, me fue muy bien, te llamo ma??ana. ?????????. 
>> ??Que paso, mi amor? Te oi hablando con alguien, ??llamaron por telefono? 
>> Llame a patricio para ver como estaba y creo que se enojo. 
>> Ay, lucero, te dije que lo dejaras atender su compromiso en paz. Lo vas atosigar, mi amor. A nadie le gusta que lo esten vigilando de dia y de noche. 
>> Si no es tan tarde, mama. 
>> Es que no es la hora, es la manera. Mira, el amor es como un jabon humedo, si lo pones en tu mano abierta, ahi sigue. Le das un apreton, sale disparado. 
>> Solo queria saber como le fue en su compromiso, pense que ya estaba en su casa y... 

[00:40:53]


>> Pues se lo dices ma??ana tal cual, hija. ??Y sabes que? Vete a descansar porque ma??ana trabajas, mi amor. 
>> Si, mama. 
>> Si me aceptas un consejo, ma??ana espera a que sea el el que te hable, por favor. 
>> Si, mama. ?????????. 
(Suena el telefono). 
>> ??Que quieres, lucero? 
>> Soy olga. ??Quien es lucero? 
>> Olga, disculpame, pense que era otra persona. 
>> ??Interrumpo algo? 
>> No, no, no, para nada. 
>> Ah, que bueno. ??Y con quien me confundiste que estabas tan molesto? 
>> Con una compa??era de la facultad, que siempre me llama para preguntarme algo de la clase. 
>> Pues quien te manda a ser el mejor del salon. 
>> No, no es para tanto. 
>> ??Como no? Hasta a mi papa e caiste super bien. 
>> ??De verdad? Pues a mi solamente me importa lo que pienses tu de mi. 
>> ??Con quien hablas? 
>> ??Con quien hablas? 
>> Es mi hermano, permiteme. Regresate a dormir, no es asunto tuyo. 
>> No hables tan fuerte, al rato va a ser asunto de todos los vecinos. 
>> Permiteme un segundo. ?????????. 
>> Perdon, ??que me decias? 
>> No se, ya se me olvido. La verdad es que me moria de ganas de escuchar tu voz, no te importa. 
>> ??Ya tan pronto me extra??as? 
>> Puede ser. 
>> Mentirosa. 
>> Y a ti te encanta hacerte el dificil. ??Vas a llamarme ma??ana? 
>> Claro que si, olga. 
>> Bueno entonces, hasta ma??ana, patricio y felices sue??os. 
>> Bye, igual para ti, chao. 
>> ??Quien es olga, hijo? 
>> Ah, nadie, mama, es una chava que acabo de conocer. ?????????. 

[00:43:02]


>> Bueno, mi amor, que dios te acompa??e y dale un beso a refugio de mi parte. 
>> Bye, mami, gracias, lindo dia. 
>> Adios, mi amor, hasta luego. 
>> Oiga, ??no tiene la ultima? 
>> Esa es la ultima que me queda, se??orita. 
>> Oigame me permite tantitito.

>> Rose: Welcome to the program, tonight, one of the most highly appraised actresses working in film today, jessica chastain, she received a golden gold nomination for best drama for her performance in "zero dark thirty". 
>> You will notice the stealth panels similar to what we use on the the rotors have been muffled. 
>> It is slower than a blackhawk, lacks the offense and stability, but it can hide. 
>> So excuse me, what do we need this for in libya? I mean, qaddafi's anti-air is virtually nonexistent. 
>> Well, do you want to brief him? 
>> There are two narratives about the location of osama bin laden, the one that you are most familiar with is he is hiding in a cave in the tribal areas, that he is surrounded by a large contingent of loyal fighters. But that narrative is pre9/11 understanding of osama bin laden, the second narrative is that he is living in a city, living in a city with multiple points of egress and entries, access to communications, so that he can keep in touch with the organization. You can't run a global network of interconnected cells from a cave. 
>> Rose: Jessica chastain for the hour, next. Funding for charlie rose was provided by the following. Captioning sponsored by Rose communications 

[00:02:31]


>> Rose: Additional funding provided by these funders. And by bloomberg, a provider of multimedia news and information services worldwide. From our studios in new york city, this is charlie rose. 
>> Rose: Jessica chastain has been everywhere and is everywhere, in 2011 she appeared in six movies, including the help, which she was no, ma'am made for an oscar. 
>> I can cook corn pone, boil potatoes, I can do grits. 
>> Rose: She also appeared in the debt. 
>> Where have you come from? 
>> Argentina. 
>> Really? Wants. 
>> Cordoba. >> 
>> Rose: The tree of light and texas killing fields. 
>> By the way, are you the one selling tickets here because i sure as hell would like to buy one, detective stall, do you think you can do me a favor and get this. 
>> Rose: Now she stars in captain bigelow's upcoming film, zero dark 30 about the hunt for and killing of osama bin laden. 
>> We are spending billions of dollars, we are still no closer to defeating our enemy. >> 
>> no birth certificate, no cellphone. The guy is a ghost. 
>> He is right in the inner circle. 
>> The whole world is going to want to know why was he targeted? 

[00:04:37]


>> When was the last time you saw bin laden? 
>> Oh, my god. Is that what I think it is? 
>> When was the last time you saw bin laden? 
>> Rose: Three is also performing on broadway today in the heiress. 
>> Father, don't you think she the most beautiful man you have ever seen? 
>> He is very good looking, my dear, of course you wouldn't let that sway you unduly. 
>> Oh, no, no. But that is what is so wonderful to me, that he should have everything, everything that a woman could want. 
>> Rose: In january she stars in a horror film called momma > 
>> Rose: Joining me now the actress called hollywood's most fashionable chameleon she is clearly the actor of the moment I am pleased to have jessica chastain back at this table. 
>> Thank you so much. 
>> Rose: Let's talk about captain bigelow. 
>> Yes. 
>> Rose: What was the call from her and what did they say. 
>> That was the exciting thing, I was shooting momma in toronto and I got a text from mehegan from an purr naah pictures and says if I ever ask you anything it is to call me for five minutes, it was very dramatic and deserved a call back. 
>> So I called her and she said there is a big movie she is making, the part is amazing, it reminded her of jodie foster in silence of the lambs, it had been told I was unavailable because of my schedule but wouldn't take no for an answer. 
>> Rose: Bigelow orehegan. 
>> Mehegan. 

[00:06:37]


>> Look I am a huge fan of bigelow, she is a big hero of mine, of course I am interested let me know if we can make the schedules work, and then within the week I got cold called from kathryn bigelow, super exciting I was coming home from work and turned my cellphone on and had a message from kathryn, asking me to call her back, I never met her before, kind of freaked out in the car and had to compose myself and called her back, hello kathryn, it is very nice to talk to you, of course i would love to read your script and I read the script and I mean I knew page 2 it was something i had to do. 
>> Rose: What was it about that made you know you had to do it 
>> well, first of all, I was really shocked that there was a woman at the center of -- 
>> Rose: In the search for bin laden. 
>> Yes the greatest manhunt in history and there was a young woman involved and. 
>> Rose: Sort of a team. 
>> Yes. 
>> A small team from the cia. 
>> Yes, but she just really made me laugh with her sass and her 
-- 
>> Rose: From the text. 
>> From the text, absolutely. 
>> Rose: The script. 
>> And her strength and, you know, even when she comes up against brick walls, whether it be interrogations that don't go the way she wants or colleagues that don't believe in her lead she does not take no for an answer and I was so inspired by her, and of course working with kathryn bigelow so immediately i sent kathryn the e-mail that says if you want me, I am there. If we can make the schedule work I am there. 
>> Rose: When you look at her tell me what you nought about her, you felt this arc she had gone on. 
>> Well, you know, from the very first scene she then, there are so many clues in the text about the character, and from the very first thing I read she shows up and in an interrogation that is not what she expected it to be, you know, she wearing a nice suit, she is in islamabad but never asked to be stationed there and in the. 
>> The interpreter: Gation they are using extreme measures, you know, water boarding, and even within that scene without a lot of dialogue I found to be really compelling, to think of playing that, you know, as an actor and to start from there to see where, as the journey goes on she descends the rabbit hole and becomes a stranger to herself, this life that she knew, like a shadow. 

[00:08:59]


>> Rose: She loses herself in her mission. 
>> Yeah, until the very end when the pilot asks her where do you want to go there is this moment of not knowing where she can go even who she is, and it is such a big question for maya at the end. 
>> Rose: Who is she? 
>> Well, I don't think she knows who she is, you know, because -- 
>> Rose: Or where she goes from there. 
>> Exactly, she lived her whole life with this one goal, what happens, and what means did she use to achieve that goal, and what does that make her now that over? 
>> Rose:. 
>> Where do we go now? The movie ends with a question, and it is unanswer unanswered which I think is really commendable. 
>> Rose: What was the hardest part about filming? 
>> Being in ah man and walking into a place of what they call extreme interrogation was taking place? 
>> Yeah. I mean, everything, we filmed that scene in an active jordanian prison so even going to work wasn't a fun experience, going in and you can't have a llphone, you can have all of these things, it is an open-air prison and certain times of the day you are not allowed to be outside, the way people would look at me because I was fair skinned with red hair, you know, was strange, it wasn't the most comfortable place, also playing a character who she has been trained to be unemotional and analytically precise and my whole life I have been trained to be emotional. 
>> Rose: Just the opposite. 
>> So it is like acting in many cases with a straitjacket on when I want to react, in an emotional way, I have to think, okay I can have this impulse like maya would but now I have to be professnal and hide it until those moments where maya lets the lid off and goes a little crazy in the film. 
>> Rose: It is said this movie sort of puts the human face on the war against terrorism. I think kathryn may have said that. 
>> Yes, I think it definitely signs a light on many, many workers who worked behind the scene, who we never really hear about, maya, it is based on a true story of this woman, he is an undercover agent and I don't know that we would have learned this story had not mark bowl and his investigative journalism discovered it. 

[00:11:22]


>> Did you see or talk to her. 
>> No, no, no. 
>> No, no, it is very dangerous it is too dangerous because they is an undercover agent you wouldn't want to do anything of putting her at risk to losing her job or being discovered. 
>> It leads to the notion of whether there is somebody played this role and they really define her by what she did instead of who she was. 
>> Yes. 
>> Rose: Whatever the emotion and whatever the intensity, whatever the sense of character that you know how to inhabit. Or was it simply from the text and they described how she was and you had the lines that reflected in the movie from, from mark who did the research what she was like? 
>> Well I had three months before we started shooting to basically go to school for this film, and, you know, a lot of that consisted of meeting with mark, in the meantime asking questions about the cia, asking questions about maya, asking questions about, and each scene, everything's job, who has seniority over her, that helps her the way I am speaking to them, I read a lot, I found particularly very helpful the book the moving towers, on osama bin laden, I thought that was a great book, michael shore's book. And then I had to us my imagination to answer questions that could not be answered in the research because she is undercover, so things like who who is at home waiting for her? What is her favorite american candy? 
>> Rose: What kind of movies does she like? 
>> Exactly. What is her favorite stopping, when she feels lonely what does she think about? All of these things I had to create. I do this for every character i play, even a fictional character and like a little book, and then kathryn being who she is the director who she is can then incorporate it into the film so you will see like in maya's apartment in pakistan you will see a drawing made by a child. You will see there is a scene where I am eating american candy in a robe after I have gone to the market and what I found great is kathryn took me to the set and said what do you think the apartment should look like and I asked for certain pictures and postcards and child drawings, candies and then when we were filming the scenes, kathryn says, well why don't you have in that robe eating candy and I think it is so incredible because it is this contradiction of like where she came from and where he is now, and that is all kathryn. 

[00:13:54]


>> Rose: Kathryn bigelow said on discovering that maya played a central role and was a woman was like a royal flush for her. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Rose: She wanted to make the movie but to find a woman was at the center of it -- 
>> yeah. 
>> I think she would have made the movie no matter what. 
>> Rose: Of course she would but she loved the idea. >>Es, it is incredible when i read the script I was so blown away on page 2, you know, even the way we meet maya, were introduced to this character and I thought wait a minute will is a woman at the center of this? I was really upset at myself i was so shocked there would be a man at the center of this. Why wouldn't there be? 
>> Rose: The second scene are the film, from the film. 
>> You are in luck. I got you on. 
>> Seriously? 
>> Wait until you hear what i want for it. I want to take care of all of this before your favorite subject. 
>> Deal. 
>> Rose: What is that scene? 
>> That is him, that is bradley telling her he is going to get a one-on-one which is an interrogation with abu faraz. 
>> She wants to lesson about abu ahkmed is that is an important thing to do, and she hopes to get information about ahkmed. 
>> Rose: Let me go back to san francisco. 
>> All right. 
>> Rose: Your dad is a fireman. 
>> Yes. 
>> Rose: Your mother is a cook. 
>> Well, yes, he is a vegan cook and used to have a restaurant, he is a cook/stay at home. 
>> Rose: And then there is your grandmother. 
>> Yes. 
>> Who when you were seven took you to the theatre. 
>> She took me to the theatre, i think she must -- I think I said this the last time, she must have sensed something in me that needed to be expressed. I didn't quite get along with others very well, I was kind of a loner. I had a very active imagination, but had difficulty expressing my emotions and always used to tell me as a child, why don't you smile? You have a beautiful smile. 
>> Now I smile all the time, but so she was constantly trying to find out outlets for me and bought me ballet lessons and took me to a play when I was seven years old and on the way there she said, you know, there is a professional thing, this is whhey do for a living. An then as soon as it started there as little girl I think the narrator on stage and immediately, that is. 

[00:16:12]


>> Rose: That is what I want to do es that's who I am. 
>> Yes, it is not I want to be that when I grow up, it is like that is what I am. And then my whole life made sense. This thing about -- 
>> Rose: You know how lucky it is to find that when you are seven? 
>> It is incredibly lucky but also it is a great test in patience. 
>> Rose: What is the patience? Because you have to wait to do it? 
>> Yeah, I was a kid like, you know, as soon as I knew what i wanted to do and it was something that could be done i was constantly asking my mom will you take me to la to audition me for commercials. 
>> Rose: She didn't want to be that kind of mom. 
>> I am glad she didn't do that because I had a very normal childhood but constantly like when will I get to do this? And even when I was in elementary school I went to public school, I wasn't in art school at all, and the kids who did really well in school got to be in a play, i did very badly in school, because I just -- I mean, I did great once guy to the juilliard but in the public school system I never really found my place. 
>> Rose: And were you acting at that time? 
>> Not really. The only time I would be acting is with the school plays but usually I was in the back because I never got good grades. It wasn't until junior high that there was a drama club and that is when I started to excel in that. 
>> Rose: How did you get to juilliard? 
>> I mean, I did romeo and juliet. It was a professional production and equity productn of it. 
>> Rose: In san francisco. 
>> In san francisco,d the guy was playing romeo had gotten to juilliard, the had gone to juilliard and going there and i thought, you know, we were there, and he was very talented, I thought, wow, maybe if he got in I could get in and i auditioned and the office only school I awe additioned for at the time and I was very lucky. 
>> Rose: A famous audition, what did you do. 
>> I did seascapes with sharks and damageser, and my pace was 
-- it was probably unlike any version they had ever seen before because when I look at it I see the words as very sensual, the way she speaks, give me my romeo, I mean she shall die, take him and cut him into little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine and all the world will be love with night and never pay any attention to the garish sun, it is building to this almost climax, and also it is about this girl who has just been married, and always been a girl and now she is a woman, she is married and when the sun goes away, the night will be here and so will romeo and she will be a woman. So for me it was about a girl's passage to womanhood through sex, you know, and I did the monologue, you know, I started, I was like running around the room and at the end I was like on the floor and I was calling up to the sky, ad I sat up, and I kind of like looked at my teachers, and it was like, you know, that scene in flash dance where they are like sitting there, like what just happened? And michael kohn he used to run the program kind of looked at me and smiled and said, did you have fun, jessica? 

[00:19:27]


>> I said, yes. And thank you very much. And then that's all they asked for. 
>> Rose: And your thought at that moment was I am not going to make it. 
>> I thought oh that was way too bold, and but then I got called back and when I got called back that's when I started to think okay then when I went to the call back all they did is ask me questions, they didn't ask me to do any other monologues which i had been told from my friend who went to juilliard he had done eight monologues in order to get in, and once I went and they interviewed me that's when i thought, I have a good shot at this because they are not asking to see anything else. 
>> Rose: And they gave you the robin williams scholarship. 
>> Yes, which made it possible for me to go to school,in williams is an alumni at juilliard, never met him and he very generously gave me a scholarship. 
>> Rose: So you fraud in 2003, you headed to new york or what do you do? 
>> I stayed in new york, I got right before, two weeks before graduation, I got offered a holding deal with john wells, which was incredible, I remember the very first group, at juilliard to have a long as showcase and john levy went to the showcases, working with john wells and I went in and did a scene for john wells and like 18 people who wrote for west wing, and then I got a call that they were offering me a holding teal which was fantastic because i could still live in new york and do theatre and do a play and fly back and forth to appear on the tv shows and that was the very first time I had ever been in front of a camera. 
>> Rose: What brought you to al pacino? 
>> I was, I guess martha keller had seen me in the play that i did with david and she told al pacino about me and they were great friends. 
>> And I think they appeared in, about a race car driver. 
>> Yes. And I was in -- I was actually in australia and g a call from my agent that said al pacino asked you to audition for a production and I hadn't really been familiar with the play, so I said okay, that is really by star, I never met al pacino, and I was just playing like little day players on tv, and I read the play and I thought, are you kidding me? It is salame and i auditioned for parsons. Many times when I audition it is for things, I feel like a lot of the times it is someone daring me, like with this one, my first meeting was with the person before al pacino ever showed up and we sat down and we talked for a bit, and then she said, why should I know you? And i was like, well, I don't know, why you should know me but i went to juilliard and all of these things and I was expecting to read and then estelle goes, okay, let me see you dance. I said, what? You want to see me dance? I am shy. 

[00:22:24]


>> Rose: But you studied ballet. 
>> Yes, I studied ballet but that dance and salame is a different kind of dancing. 
>> And I looked at her and I was so embarrassed. 
>> I knew she was like, show me what you have got, let's see if you have the guts to play this part so I just stood up. 
>> Rose: And let it go. 
>> And just started dancing, no music, nothing, parsons sitting in the room and she mild at me afterwards, probably the same way michael kohn smiled at me like, did you have fun, jessica, you put yourself out there and i got called back and met al in the change back. 
>> Rose: Changed you meeting him. 
>> Completely, completely, he is such a -- I am a shy person and I used to be really self conscious and insecure and had difficulty like really standing up and speaking for myself, and he is a great cheerleader my very first edition, callback at I started reading from the play and as I was acting I could hear, oh, wow. Oh, my god. Like I could hear him in the audience. Saying all of these things, that made me feel like, yes! I am doin great! And working with him on that play and making -- it was my first movie, still has not come out, making that movie he has been such a great teacher for me for film -- 
>> Rose: Wild salame. 
>> Rose: Which has never come out. 
>> It hasn't come out yet, we are waiting and hoping. 
>> Rose: But how did it change you as an actress? 
>> Well, he thought me a couple of things, I used to be afraid of the camera, and think like okay I have to pretend it is not there. And he said, completely open-minded he said most people are afraid of the camera but in film, you have to be by matt with the camera. Because more than your scene partner the camera sees into your eyes, it sees into your soul, it is part of you, and like your arm is part of you, once you accept it, you forget the arm is there. But with the camera, once you accept that it has a direct line to your soul, you can forget it, but you have to be more open to it than anything else. 

[00:24:43]


>> Rose: Can you do that or just learn to do that because you know that is where you have to go. 
>> I think it gave me permission to be open to it. By saying that to me, then i didn't feel like there are all of these different schools schools of acting and some of it is like we have to really think you are in the environment, you know and you have to not see the camera and not see the audience and really try to pretend you are in the room, and I think maybe I thought that is what i was supposed to do and by him giving me permission to say, no, no, no your camera is your partner just as much as the other actor once he said that to me it just changed me and for tree of life so much of that. 
>> Rose:. 
>> I think terrence mali called al pacino because I was additioning for it, and I had four auditions and I never really worked much, and it was, you know, a big film and I think he just wanted to make sure i wasn't a crazy person. And I was okay with to work with. 
>> And what was the audition? 
>> The very first audition for tree of life was just doing -- wasn't there. It was things like showing up and putting the baby to sheep, shipping. 
>> Singing it a lullaby, looking at someone with love and respect all of these things of just being, because in this movie you are not really allowed to act, you are just supposed to be, and then there was a piece of dialogue, and because I am such a theatre nerd, I recognized it from a medieval play, and we were just to speak that dialogue, so they could hear our voice. After that tape got sent in, i got a call that said, we would love to meet you, and this is before the movie had financing so I flew myself to texas, I had no, hardly any money and had an audition there. 
>> Rose: You have described him as like a silent film director. 
>> Yeah. I think he is the last living silent film director, I read a great book on clara bell, and it was talking about, you know, when the actress is working on silent films, the sets were so loud, the directors were always talking, they were talking to the actors, people were banging into things, it was kind of chaotic. 

[00:27:02]


>> Rose: Lots of movement. 
>> Yes lots of movement and the camera moved constantly and then once that came to be, everything had to be so quiet the camera became stationary and everyone had to work around that. I was actually on tree of life when I was reading about claire bow and I thought that is exactly what our set is, it is a very loud set, terry is constantly talking with us, the camera is always moving, we are always finding each other, and i realized that I think he is the last silent film director, when you watch his movies, it is very rare that the characters speak dialogue, and the voiceovers to me are like the cards, the cards you see in silent films. 
>> Rose: Did he you to the metropolitan museum to see raphael's madonna? 
>> Yes,. 
>> Rose: Looking for what? 
>> You know, he didn't specify, but I found that when, when you start staring at the madonna, something really interesting with their fingers and their eyes. It was very rare to see the madonna staring straight into the viewer, like kind of a direct gays, always had something that was indirect, where usually the eyes were downcast, and the fingers were always like there was like reaching upward, almost as if the heart opening and the eyes downcast. And one of the very first shots of me in his film is shocking, because he, you know there is a painting of madonna looking like this. And one of the very firstshots in the film an I had no idea when he was shooting it, it looks to me just like that painting, and I am sitting at the table and kind of going like this smiling down and I felt like it was the same energy. I think that is what he was having me do, also he asked me to watch a lot of lauren bacall films for her voice. 
>> Yes nowadays we speak very fast because we are afraid someone is going to cut us off and lauren bacall, like she just took her time and there was this even tone to the way she spoke and I have learned, you know, she had a great vocal coach that taught her that. But there was a very direct very easy way of speaking. 

[00:29:19]


>> Rose: Are you a student of film? 
>> Oh, yes. I love movies so much. I have always been, you know, so fascinated by film makers and actors and stories. I knew I wanted to do this when I was seven years old and I had to wait before I became an adult to really be able to do it. That's a lot of time to read and watch movies. And I remember we changed schools when I was in fifth grade and they asked me like what is the last book you read and I said like a carol burnett's biography, and the counselor looked at me like that is very strange, I read carol burnett, I read barbra streisand, you know. 
>> Rose: But was there ever an instinct after you got out of high school, not to go to juilliard, but to head to los angeles and say, I am 18 years old and going to go down there and I am going to find my way. 
>> Yes. 
>> -- Into movies? 
>> I spent one year in los angeles. 
>> Rose: So you did do that. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Rose: Before juilliard. 
>> Before juilliard and I was living in los angeles when i auditioned for juilliard, and i had many people after I got in tell me in la, you shouldn't go to juilliard because you will be too old when you get out of school to be an actor, to be an actress and I remember hearing that and I thought that is really upsetting, and then i though but I don't want to spend my life acting in, you know, nothing wrong with, because I do love a lot -- there are a lot of great tv shows but at the time, people were talking to in la were trying to get me on these tv shows is like, you know, like young people hanging out and all of these -- but nothing really -- I just had a love for something else that was not modern, that was -- 
>> Rose: So if someone came out of high school today, who had talent and admired you -- 
>> go to school. 
>> Go to juilliard, yale, somewhere. 
>> Two somewhere, even if it is not acting. 

[00:31:21]


>> Rose: Liberal arts. 
>> Yes you have to learn about life, you can't be an actor not having an experienced life, every part I get to me it is like a course I am taking, when I did the debt, I learned so much about the medical -- not fun but I learned so much about the medical experiments during the holocaust and men gehl and the survivors and every part i play, I have to .. Immerse myself and study that world in order to understand those women and when you go to school, when you have, you know, this capacity to learn and, you know, this thirst to learn, I think it makes you a better actor. 
>> Rose: Are you surprised by what has happened to you or do you think it is simply if I work really hard at this and I have had an opportunity and the opportunity paid off? 
>> I am surprised the way it happened and also, I didn't expect so much attention, especially so fast. I think, though I have always been a person that I do the work when no one is watching and always been like that, even when I was playing a dead body in, will, a on a. 
>> La on a tv show I was at my house doing play readings of ms. Julie and ask my friends to come over and read the play aloud. 
>> I was constantly, at one time I was adapting hamlet which i will never make but I was constantly trying to remind myself every day, I am an actor, I am this kind of actor, I need to challenge myself in these stories, even -- 
>> Rose: And do you love every part of it, the editing, the directing? All of the things that go together to make the movies? 
>> Yes. 
>> Rose: And to create performing on stage, whether it is a playwright or director or whoever it might be? 
>> Yes, I love every bit of it, I don't think I will ever be a director unless it is -- 
>> Rose: You don't want to be captain bigelow? 
>> I could never be kathryn big flow, she is too wonderful to even think of being r but one day I would love to be a teacher, I would love toork at juilliard some day, you know when I have a family and after i have settled down a bit and do some theatre. 

[00:33:35]


>> Rose: If you were teaching a master class about acting what would you want the students to know that you have learned? 
>> The most important thing i think is to prep before you arrive. 
>> Rose: Really? 
>> Absolutely. If it is someone who doesn't want to play themselves as the character, like in zero dark 30 I am not playing her as a cia agent because then I would be crying throughout the whole movie. 
>> Rose: No, I can't watch this. 
>> Please stop. It is so mean. Yeah, no. It is always to me the prep is about understanding the world that you are in and really understanding the character, understanding your similarities and your differences, it is a lot of homework. That is absolutely what I would stress to people. 
>> Rose: And the idea of being able to execute it once you understand it, but can you explain that or is that simply doing it that you learn the things that are necessary to be good? 
>> Yeah. I think, you know, it is about 
-- I said this once and it is about, I guess not having a sense of vanity as an actor, or even a sense of van at this/narcissism. 
>> When I was working with sean penn on tree of life once we were talking about acting and he didn't know how shy I was but at that point I was still painfully shy, but I was trying to hide it, and he said, that a person who is self-conscious .. Is just aznar cystic as someone who who talks about themselves all the time, because you are so self an stociald, and there is something about being an actor where this is -- I mean this is me, you know, defining what he said, something for me about being an actor that was nudity or, you know, doing scenes, I can't be concerned about how I looked when I am playing a character, i have to completely give myself over to the woman or the man or whatever it is I am playing, and, yes, have, you know, emotional through lines myself but there has to be an absence of self at the same time. 

[00:35:39]


>> When they say he is like a cha meal I don't know do you take that as a compliment? 
>> I think, you know what i think ..? Except for meryl streep, people are used to allowing themselves to be different faces. Tom hardy, you know, these great actors coming forward, butwith women, and I started to even see it now, where I will get a part and the director in the very beginning when I sign on, okay with the look we are going for and talk about it but once we are there and we are rehearsing it they get really nervous about me looking different than I look now because there is something, they feel like, okay, I want to buy what I see, you know, and you are going to sell the film, you are go to go out and do the interviews and magazine covers i want you to look like the character, so I find that with women I get more of a pushback to do that, so I don't know, i take it as a great compliment that they, some people may call me a chameleon but I tnk more actresses are, if they were given, would be, if they were given a chance. 
>> Rose: And do the people who are with you think about your , view that as a positive thing? 
>> I view it as a positive thing. I mean yes, it doesn't make me super famous but I don't want to be super famous. I never wanted to be an actor for money or game, there was just something in me I wasn't able to express, emotion, i don't know what it is, when i was a child that this is the way I learn about myself and this is the way I learn about other people. 
>> Rose: What is amazing about this, you have never imagined doing anything else? 
>> Never. 
>> Rose: If I said to you it is not, if not acting what would it be because you have no idea because you have thought nothing about acting. 
>> My nightmare is something would happen and I couldn't do this anymore. 

[00:37:41]


>> Rose: Something physically. >> 
>> or I guess I could teach, i would love that but my whole life I have wanted to be, to express myself, that is what makes me feel part of something bigger than myself. Is when I am acting. 
>> Rose: Let me talk about these characters you played and what you became in them, the debt for example. You were a massad agent along with two men. 
>> Yes. 
>> Rose: What will you have to become? What was the thing that you had to transform yourself into so that people saw and felt they were watching a mass sad agent at work? 
>> Right, well I had, where i trained. 
>> Rose: A physical thing. 
>> Sean penn told me about that, that's what he does. 
>> Well, yes, it is really intense form of fighting and i am a pacifist in real life so it is very intense. I trained in and I never spoke ken in german before and there was a lot of german to be said so I took a beginner's course in berlitz language and had a coach who taught me the lines, I read so much about the holocaust, the survivors of the holocaust, i found a story that I created for my character, and then also got to work with helen mirren and worked on different mannerisms we would share and the accent but for me also i think a lot about energy when i am acting. I really think in terms of that, I don't know, maybe it is because I grew up in northern california, think think where does the energy live in a person? And for me rachel singer has survivor skills, her whole family has been killed, why does she deserve to be alive? And so for her I thought a lot about scar tissue, that she is just this walking scar tissue and that helped me a lot. 
>> Rose: And there is a scene, though, where he is in a chair. 
>> Uh-huh. 
>> Rose: I mean that has to be a tough scene for you to film. 
>> Oh, yes. 
>> Rose: Where is your head? 

[00:39:43]


>> Well, during all of those scenes, the doctors becomes a fertility doctor so she has to be a patient and shot all of that stuff for a week in chronological order and even though you know, we are acting he is not performing an examination on me, it is still really embarrassing and humiliating and you put yourself there. 
>> Ros SO YOU HAVE TO Identify with the humiliation. 
>> Exactly, so much so that when we finally filmed the attack when rachel comes, you know, he is finally able to attack him, i think I was a little too excited about that scene, and the very first take when I jammed the needle at him, he is so sweet, he stopped and goes, that really hurt! 
>> Because I was like so pent up and ready to fight. 
>> Rose: Because your head had been through the whole experience. Here is a clip from take shelter. Take a look at this. 
>> Don't you think you you me that? Don't you think you may respect me must have at least to consider what I have to say? 
>> I didn't want you worrying about it. 
>> We I am worried, cur us the curtis, how are you paying for all of that? 
>> I got a home improvement loan from the bank. 
>> And you did that without talking to me? You know that -- do you want us to run out of movie for a tornado shelter? 
>> I am doing it for us. I know you don't understand. 
>> You are right, I don't understand. I don't understand half the stuff you have been doing lately. I don't understand you putting red outback. I don't understand you staying up all night that in that stupid tornado shelter. You don't come to bed half the time, you don't tell me when you leave and where you are going, explain that to me. Please. Tell me something. That helps me understand way you are being like this. 

[00:41:55]


>> The great michael shannon. 
>> Rose: Yeah. Amazing actor. 
>> Oh, my gosh. We did -- we made that movie for no known, worked four six day weeks and we would get sometimes three takes per scene and working with mike, that is a master class right there, because you just -- you can never take your eye off the ball. He is constantly doing something, and if you are not present -- 
>> Rose: And why did you take that role? 
>> To work with mike shannon. 
>> Rose: That's what i thought, yeah. 
>> Most of the films I do it is always about working, who I am working with and also is the character something I have never done before. 
>> Rose: So I can taking? Away, a new experience and with I will learn something are the person I am working with. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Like we talked about it being a master class for me, I have no control over what the final product is. I don't know what they are going to do in the editing room or whether they will like the film. The only thing I have control over is if I leave this experience, I am walkin away with something and that is how i want every filming experience to be, every play, everything I do. 
>> Rose: Based on what you said earlier, are you happiest getting inside the character or the actual filming of the material? 
>> You mean like the recourse or the film something. 
>> Rose: The preparation -- 
>> no, I am always happiest in filming because there is a freedom in that. You do all of the work before, which sometimes it is really difficult because you have to go to dark places and learn things about humanity that you didn't know or these horrible things, create secrets for your character, once I do that, i have this kind of book, this is who I am, and I don't have to think about it anymore I just show up and now it is in me and it is like there is the intimacy between the actors that I find so incredible, just being able to lack at someone and have it mean so much, it is very rare even in, you know, walking down street that we really look at someone, and there is something about filming that like I said it makes me feel a part of something bigger. 

[00:44:03]


>> Rose: You also say it is a combination of twin lines, one is fear of failure and the other is extreme confidence. And especially if you have prepared and you know who you are. 
>> Uh-huh. 
>> Yeah. I mean, lake even if we go back to the audition for juilliard, i mean, yes, I have fear of failure, I always hike when i sign on to something, am I going to be okay with this. 
>> Rose:. >> 
>> Rose: You are taking a chance and you know you can nail it? 
>> Or you have tohink somewhere that I have got this, even if you don't have it, and they always wrestle with each other because if you are too confident, you end up just not being good because your ego is driving everything, but also if you are too fareful you never take chances so you always have to kind of like -- 
>> Rose: You have said also about fear that if in fact you feel some fear about doing a role, that is good, because you know you should do it. 
>> Yes. 
>> Rose: If you find that fear that is a reason for me to do it. 
>> Yes. Because if it is scary that means I don't know if I can do it which means I haven't done it before, it also means if I throw myself into the lion's den, you know, I may die, I may get eaten but also I will have to rise to the challenge, and in doing so, sometimes I found actually i have always found that you learn more from failure than you do from success. So if I am going to risk failure I will have to throw myself out there and I won't be good enough, that's fine becausely learn more. 
>> Rose: Correia la miss, you said about him his performance in schindler's list made you realize acting is more about being in films, it is about playing complicated, very human characters. 
>> Uh-huh. Yeah, you look at that performance in schindler's list, and he is playing it like a love stick puppy which is so unexpected and I remember seeing the film and I have whenever seen acting like that, I think i saw schindler's list and english patient at the same time and both of those performances, they ha many continue addictions, english patient is a sweeping romance he is very unlikeable at times and, you know, he has this tough exterior. And I found that well that is something I am really interested in, a character that has continue dick shuns and can be unlikeable but you have to find the thread of humanity and compassion within them. 

[00:46:28]


>> Rose: Someone said to me about acting that it has to look like you have just had the thought, so that what happened there, you are looking at it as a spontaneous experience, you have to feel it as a spontaneous experience even though, in your head, and in everything you thought about you have practiced it. 
>> Yeah. The difference for me, though, is I don't know what my thoughts are going to be. So I know what the lines are, i know where my character is coming from, but not until I am in the scene with the person and I see how they are talking to me and the temperature, what exactly is going on in this room, are they rude? Are they listening to me? Is he shutting me off? Not looking in the eye. I don't know how I am going to be within it, so for me the thought is always spontaneous, because it depends on, you know, the actor I am with. 
>> Rose: And what about the character in help? What did you have to do there? 
>> Well, first of all I had to fight really hard to get that part. 
>> Rose: They didn't think of you as this sort of -- 
>> oh, no. 
>> Rose: Sex spot. 
>> Blonde bombshell. 
>> No, no. 
>> Rose: What is it to fight to get a part? 
>> Well, you just go in many times, you feel like, that was 
-- I went in and I audition and I am hike before I audition i went and bought a dress, because I don't dress like sylvia foot, okay she has to be a little bit vulgar so I bought what i thought a vulgar dress was, i showed up, I got the boys, I did all of, the voice did all of that, audition and felt it went really well, I felt like the director really liked me octavio was there, I heard I was on the list and still auditioning and someone, it was offered so someone else and she turned it down and I kept hearing, no they really like you, then way don't they cast me if they really like me, and then I was filming texas killing fields and we were doing all night shoots. 
>> Rose: Sam worthington. 
>> Yes. A real tough cop. And we were filling night assistance in the swamp in louisiana, and I got a call that said, okay, they love you, but they just want you to come in and test for it. 

[00:48:42]


>> Rose: Were you insulted? 
>> I was just like, well, I just thought well obviously they don't think I am physically right for this character. And I was so exhausted so i called my agent and I said I am not going to do it. Which it is funny because al pacino told me the same thing happened to him in the godfather, you know what? They obviously don't want me, there is going to be some point where I have some shred of self respt, I have gone in and done the thing and I said I wanted to do it, but then at the last minute I thought okay you know what? I believe in this, I love the director, I understand, you know, there is a lot of people involved in this decision, i will go in and let them do me up like celia foot and see what happens and I am so glad I did that because I loved playing that character. 
>> Rose:. 
>> You loved it? 
>> Oh, I loved it, it is very rare that I -- maybe because i love such complicated women, and usually it lead to a lot of tense and dramatic situations, it is very rare I get to do something that has a lot of lightness in it, and celia foot we are talking about energy is all heart, you know, it is all hear, and, it is all here, and to get to like, you know, play on my light side and goofy side, be able to gain weight, and be that blonde, funny woman, it was great. I did learn a lot, I mean, i walk out of the trailer in that red dress with the blonde hair, and I have never seen guys lack at me like this. They would drop theird when I walked in and they were like 
-- 
>> Rose: Oh, my god -- 
>> I would go in after shooting and go back into the trailer and in my cutoff jeans and hair in a ponytail and a look of disappointment on every man's face when they realized it wasn't true. 
>> Rose: So all of this stuff that has happened to you, all of these movies, everybody, we had a golden glove nomination. 
>> This morning. 
>> Rose: This morning. 

[00:50:43]


>> Yesterday. 
>> Rose: Exactly. So things are happening,nd you have also become a favorite cover photo, look at this, tell me when you see this. 
>> That -- this is a really exciting shoot for me to do. It is the art issue for w magazine so I got to work with four artists, and put myself basically in their hand, which is what I feel like I do as an actress, I love to go to the film maker and basically say here I am, I trust you, do with me what you will. 
>> Rose: That's what you say to a director? 
>> I don't really say that, but, you know, that is what is in my head. 
>> Rose: See where he or she wants to take this. 
>> Yeah. If I ever feel in is unsafe place or somebody is not respecting me but I definitely feel for me acting is a giving over of self, and so with this 
-- 
>> Rose:. 
>> That to me though looks the most like myself, because there is this stripped down openness to that. But like this one right here, she kept telling me, thomas kept telling me, she had these pictures of michelle 5 in scarface, michelle pfeiffer in scarface. 
>> Worked by skype. 
>> Rose: Jaffray. 
>> She doesn't like to fly. And then yes, so they took photos of me .. With her directing the photograph, and then she painted from there. 
>> Rose: And this? 
>> This is -- that is george. Which was so much fun. Yeah, he is like working with -- it is like being around him is like being in a cartoon, and we just like laughed the whole time. 
>> Rose: And this is t magazine, a newly minted star in the old hollywood mold. 
>> Do you think that, an old hollywood mold? I mean are you a throwback to something? 
>> You know, I never really thought I was, but when I first started my careern la, I don't think people knew what to do with me, because I didn't look of the time, like I don't think I look incredibly modern and maybe that is why I get cast in so many period films. Also that could come from the fact that I love movies. I love claire bo, you know, all of these fantastic actresses from other times. 

[00:53:07]


>> Rose: Do you worry about any of this stuff that -- there is so much exposure. 
>> Uh-huh. 
>> Rose: That there is a risk that I will be -- people will say, oh I have seen this. 
>> Yeah. Absolutely. I think that. But I hope that by challenging myself to not repeat myself i can kind of avoid that. Also, I don't talk about my love life in the press at all. You know, I have never photographed anyone with an o investment with a boyfriend or anything and I think because of that if a tabloid decides to write a story about me, the only thing they will be able to write about is what I am wearing or my work, because I don't really play into or allow that kind of attention, so I think that also keeps me more private. When I walk outside, I will tell you right now, most people don't come up to me. It is very rare, maybe someone recognizes me but they never talk to me about it. So I am able to forget -- 
>> Rose: That is going to change. 
>> Maybe. 
>> Rose: It really will. Much success to you. This has been a wonderful conversation for me. 
>> Yes. Me too. I love your show so much. 
>> Rose: And I haven't even mentioned you are still -- and you have to go right now to the theatre, you are starring every night in the heiress. 
>> Yes. 
>> Rose: With david stray lorne and dan stevens. 
>> Yes. And .. Judy ivy too. 
>> Incredible. 
>> Rose: And there is also this one philly close with this which you are doing that is intriguing to me, momma is one but the other film in which there are two stories. 
>> Yes. The disappearance of eleanor rigby. It is basically -- I love this concept. It is a husband and wife that separate, one film follows his point of view, and one film follows her point of view, so it is james mcel invoice and myself and there are a couple of scenes that go into both films but they are written differently and shot differently so it is his perspective of what happened and her perspective of what happened which I find that really exciting, it is the first time film maker, and I got to work with the incredible isabel, who plays my mother in the film, and that for me was a huge dream. 

[00:55:23]

>> Announcer: The following program is made possible in part by the mpt new initiative fund founded by irene and edward h. Kaplan. >> Narrator: Scallops of sand, endless meanders of marsh and tidal creek. If the shoreline of the chesapeake bay could be unraveled it would stretch from the east to west coast and back. The chesapeake is the country's largest estuary, whealtwater mixes with fresh. 2 miles long, three miles across at its narrowest, nearly 30 at its widest. Yet for hundreds of square miles it is knee-deep.

Romance clings to the private coves, the watery sunsets, the smell in the breeze. There is, perhaps, a tendency to long for what has been lost of its heritage. But soaring above, we see how much of it remains, and the incredible beauty held in its embrace. Anyone who has ever hauled a catch from its depths, loafed the small towns that ring it, beheld the marshes blazing in the sun, or skimmed the surface, knows it's more than just a place on the map. Experience the treasured chesapeake, her famous landmarks, natural wonders, cities, towns, and preserves that still look as glorious and untouched as they did a thousand years ago, all from an exhilarating vantage point. [Captioned by Maryland public television] dawn over the susquehanna river, headwaters of the chesapeake bay. The chesapeake is the drowned valley of the susquehanna, engorged by the melting waters of glaciers ten thousand years ago at the end of the last ice

age. Named for the native susquehannocks who lived along the riverbanks, its headwaters begin far to the north, flowing down through pennsylvania and new york state, into the chesapeake bay and out to sea. Conowingo is native susquehannock for "at the rapids." Here, at those rapids, a hydroelectric plant harnesses the surging momentum of the river. The rocky bottom and canyon-like walls of the river little resemble the wide, pan-flat, mud-bottomed bay broadening on the horizon. Justond the town of havre de grace, "harbor of grace," where highway and railroad span the widening river, the chesapeake bay is born. 

[00:06:03]


A new day brings a flurry of activity and the inevitable feeling of possibilities up and down the bay. Standing majestic in morning light, calvert cliffs dominate the southern maryland shoreline for 30 miles. Formed over 15 million years ago, when southern maryland was awash in a shallow sea, these cliffs teem with fossils. South of the cliffs, homes with water's view bask in the sun. We are drawn to places like solomons island, where land meets the great estuary. 

[00:08:06]


The calvert marine museum, home of the drum point lighthouse, symbolizes a once-booming fish village, with fleets of schooners & sloops centered 'round the hauling and shucking of oyster, that has become a popular point of departure for those in search of adventure and favorable winds. Tranquility seems to define life on the bay, but appearances deceive. Every day, nature's rhythms and human rituals play out. Smith island is located 12 miles out in the bay. Her quintessential fishing villages cling to the few patches of ground above sea level. Come sunrise on any given morning, the towns of tylerton, ewell, and rhodes point are deserted. 

[00:10:07]


Everyone is out crabbing. Smith island fishermen, a fiercely independent breed, heed the call of the water and chart the very same courses of their forbearers, doing what 13 generations before have done since the first settlement at jamestown in 1607. For hard-working watermen, the bay has always held the promise of plentiful rewards. Pound nets jut from the shore like arrows pointing towards a bountiful catch. 

[00:12:10]


Watermen can still earn a living by fishing, crabbing, and oystering... But it is becoming increasingoy challenging. Dredgers, pound netters, purse netters, hand tongers, crabbers...Fishermen of all kinds casting their fortunes in chesapeake waters. Holds heavy with the harvest; rockfish, bluefish, crabs, oysters, whatever the day's catch, return home... ...To towns like crisfield, rock hall, chestertown, solomons, tilghman, and scores of others. 

[00:14:17]


There are reasons why these places were settled long ago. Proximity to the bay meant, of course, pleasant living. But also fruitful labor, and sustenance. Deep and safe harbor. Upriver, and protected, yet connected by navigable waterways, enabling vital trade. On the banks of the chester river, chestertown was a thriving port of entry for early maryland settlers and boom town of colonial commerce. George washington gave chestertown his stamp of approval with the founding of washington college in 1782. First college established in the new nation. Locals who live by the waters

[00:26:23]


The only thing you have to do now is get up and go the phone and make a pledge. It's really easy to do. And after you've done it, sit back and enjoy the rest of chesapeake bay by air. >> Narrator: Baltimore...City on the bay, broad shouldered, blue collar, offbeat, idiosyncratic, port of entry, cultural center. Home of the star spangled banner. Locust point, the first port of baltimore; tobao shipping out, sugar from the caribbean shipping in. City of neighborhoods: Fells point, federal hill, bolton hill, cherry hill, canton. 

[00:29:28]


Outside baltimore, where the patapsco river meets the bay, sparrows point. A once-sprawling complex of steelmaking and shipbuilding. IN THE MID-1950s, THE LARGEST Steel mill in the world. Producing steel for the golden gate bridge, and cables for the george washington bridge. The chesapeake draws life from the rivers that feed it. More than 150 rivers flow into this immense transition zone from fresh to saltwater. Only the columbia and the mississippi send more water out to sea. 

[00:31:40]


From the north comes the susquehanna, sassafras, chester and elk. From the east; wicomico, choptank, nanticoke, pocomoke. And the west; the patapsco, potomac, patuxent and york, the rappahannock, the james. These are the rivers of colonial history, alive with fish, fowl, and crustacean. In springtime, pulsating with fish moving upstream from saltwater to spawn. Few places anywhere on the bay are as haunting, and striking, as the blackwater national wildlife refuge. Swirling geometry, jagged, irregular, green-gold marshscape, etched in sharp relief against brackish waters. 

[00:34:09]


Admiring the smooth reflections in the bows and guts, it's easy to overlook, that down below, the blackwater is alive with birds, animals, insects and fish. The blackwater is a chief wintering area along the atlantic flyway. In the fall, these lands become a spectacle of canada geese, snow geese, tundra swan, ducks. In winter, the bald eagle nests. As a national wildlife refuge, the blackwater symbolizes the commitment to preserve the irreplaceable landscapes we treasure for future generations. The voyages of captain john smith charting the chesapeake waterways are legendary. Having established the english settlement at jamestown, john smith's chesapeake adventures opened his eyes to a new world of lush forests, water teeming with life, native americans living along the banks. His maps and writings of "this very goodly bay" strongly influenced european settlement of the region. 

[00:36:11]


Settled on high ground above a peaceful tidewater bay, historic st. Mary's cjty. First settlement and new capital of the fledgling maryland colony. Outlines and forms speak of a once bustling city: The jesuit church, courthouse, and small tobacco and corn plantations. Reminders of maryland's very first years, when men and women took a daring risk: Hewing a new life from a new land. From the founding of the colony, until today, agriculture has sustained the local economy. The farm fields of chesapeake country are rich, fertile, and paint the landscape with striking hues. Tobacco, sweet corn, melons, soybean, soak up the dense nutrients in the soil producing abundant yields. 

[00:39:48]


The linear views from the surface of the earth, of water, marsh, or simple field of hay, acquire shape, form, perspective, rising into the air. Tilghman island typifies the meeting place between farmland and watershed common on the eastern shore. Fishing boats, for pleasure and work, line up. A stone's throw from farm fields that stretch out to island's end. In the winter, foraging grounds for canada geese. A world apart...Blissfully so. 

[00:41:55]


Tides; inexorable and never ending. Waves; rhythmic, pounding. Currents; saltwater moving up the bay, freshwater moving down. Violent wind; tropical storm, hurricane. All keep the chesapeake shoreline in tenuous ebb and flow. Holland island, nesting home for hundreds of brown pelicans, was once a thriving community... Hundreds of residents, a general store, school, church, and a fleet of schooners and skipjacks. But the chesapeake encroaches, almost at will. Decades of erosion from wind and tide, and the ravages of hurricane isabel in 2003, the island slips into memory. Sharps island lighthouse stands near the entrance to the choptank river, warning seafarers of the shoals off poplar island. The towering, cast iron, concrete-filled hulk, proved no match for the mighty force of winter ice that thrust sharps island lighthou into a precarious 20-degree 

[00:43:57]


list. Prime real estate high atop the cliffs at calvert county comes with spectacular views. But these edges, where land and water meet, are on the move. Every now and then, eroding earth tumbles down to the shore. The cliff top is receding. Breakwaters and riprap slow, but cannot stop the process. The forces of nature are continually at work, shifting the shoreline, reshaping islands, creeks, rivulets, marshes. A long-term, barely perceptible transformation. 

[00:46:04]


We, in turn, have left our own indelible human imprints on the landscape. Linear patterns sliced into marsh, reminiscent of england's mysterious crop circles, or a child's stick figures, ARE THE REMAINS OF THE 1950s, When these marshlands were the site for chemical testing. In 1942, the navy designated bloodsworth island an impact zone for naval bombardment. By 1967, an estimated 230,000 rounds were fired at the island from surface ships. Unexploded ordnance remains. The island is off-limits, and can only be viewed from the air. 

[00:48:22]


The upper bay, an island, and a restoration success story, literally take shape. Hart-miller island was headed for total submersion, but extensive dredging of the baltimore harbor produces the perfect by-product. The dredgings are pumped onto perimeter dikes, raising the island's elevations, and the hopes for its future. Today, this little known gem is a maryland state park, accessible only by boat, with beaches, mudflats, and vital habitat for shorebirds and waterfowl. >> What an amazing program.

Thank you. >> Narrator: Straightpile, screwpile, cast iron, or brick...Beacons of light. Blackistone island lighthouse, up the potomac and within view of st. Clement's island, where the maryland colony began. During the revolutionary war, the british controlled the island, blockading the potomac passageway. In the civil war, confederates destroyed the lantern and lens to prevent it aiding the union forces. At one time, 74 lighthouses illuminated chesapeake waters, warning sailors, steamers, and fishing fleets away from treacherous currents, shoals, shallows. At the very tip of southern maryland, down where the potomac empties into the bay, point lookout lighthouse stands. 

[01:00:54]


This spit of land was the site of an infamous civil war prison, where 4,000 confederate soldiers perished and whose remains were interred here. More than 30 lighthouses still stand in the chesapeake. Some retired as relics of a past age. Others still shine forth as important aids to navigation. Perhaps most emblematic of them all, undoubtedly the most photographed, thomas point lighthouse warns ships of a sandbar extending out from shore near the sailing mecca of annapolis. 

[01:02:54]


Brave thomas point light somehow survived the assault of 23 foot waves crashing upon it from tropical storm agnes in 1972. Eminently navigable, the bay has always been a superhighway; freighters, steamers, tugs, and tows. Water is a way of commerce and means of transport. 

[01:05:27]


The chesapeake bay skipjack, iconic in form, symbol of the bay's boat building heritage. Skipjack nathan of dorchester is an exquisite example of the form. Built as a light, inexpensive craft for oyster dredging the shallows, hundreds of skipjacks once thrived he true to form, skipjack nathan cuts through the choptank river almost without effort. The schooner sultana is an exact replica of colonial merchant vessels that once patrolled the north american coast, but now serves as a classroom on the water. Annapolis, celebrated as the sailing capital of america. State capital of maryland. General washington resigned his command of the continental army here, when annapolis was the temporary capital 

[01:07:29]


of the united states. High on a hill, the maryland state house is the oldest legislative building in continuous use in the nation. Waterfront streets are steeped in colonial history. Safe harbor and launch point for recreational vesss of all kinds. Proud home of the united states naval academy. Here, aboard sailboats, in the classroom, and on athletic fields, in "four years by the bay," the midshipmen ideals of duty, honor and loyalty take shape. Completed in 1952, the first of towering twin spans of the chesapeake bay bridge, enabled easy migration to the eastern shore.

So, we "getaway" to places quaint, picturesque, like historic st. Michaels, on the miles river. The chesapeake bay maritime museum, and hooper straight lighthouse, mark land where once there were seafood packing houses, docks, and workboats. It's a place where a seafaring past meets the sailors... And pleasure boaters of the present. The back bays of st. Michaels, sculpted with protected coves, and easy water access, are fashionable getaway spots. Highway 50, and the choptank river fishing pier, lead the way inambridge, one of the oldest cities in maryland. Like any other waterfront town, life in cambridge is measured not by how much, or how fast, but the tides, the wind, and the waves. 

[01:11:55]


The sun retreats to the western horizon, casting long shadows over the nanticoke. A river system of serene splendor. Individual, curvaceous, meandering. For a long time, the nanticoke remained undeveloped, its shorelines thick with forest, its waters one of the most productive for fisherme and pound netters. A place that inspires hope that chesapeake country will always look just as it does today. >> Rhea: We have just seen 

[01:13:56]

[laughter] 
[woof] captioning made possible by the u.S. Department of education oh, I don't know about this, cleo. Are you sure it's safe? Have I ever steered you wrong? Well, come to think of it-- never mind. Just go. Go on, t-bone. It'll be fun. Ok... If you say so. Whoa! Yippee! You were right. That was fun. See? There's nothing to be afraid of. 

[00:02:23]


[Gasps] 
[gasps] wh-wh-what about that? Oh! It's a monster! And he's at emily's school! I'm coming, emily! Whoa! Whoa! Wow. This balloon is big. Yeah, I hope we can fill it with air in time for the carnival, hmm. Needs more air. You know, jetta, mr. Rodriguez says we're a team and that we're all supposed to help make the fall carnival happen tonight. I am helping. I'm making sure that everyone gets everything done. 
[Dog barking] hey, clifford. It's ok. It's just a balloon to help people find the fall carnival tonight. Hmm? We're trying to fill it with air, but it's really big. 
[Woof] great job, clifford! How about if you tie it off now, jetta? Fine. I will. There. Perfect. Aah! 
[Laughing] whew. That was the last basket of pumpkins. Good thing. I don't think I can lift another thing. I know what you mean. I'm really tired, too... But you still need to put this last basket up there on top of the sign. What?! No way! We can't do that. We can't, but clifford can. Can't you, boy? 

[00:04:37]


[Woof] great job. Looks good, clifford. It was my idea. All right, team, we have to clean this merry-go-round. Emily elizabeth, you wash. Charley, you dry. Whew. Luckily this is our last job of the day, because I am too tired to do another thing. Jetta will never be too tired of telling us what to do, that is. Hey, jetta. How about if you dry and I'll give the orders for a while? I don't think so, charley. If you're part of the team, you should do part of the work. Making sure the work gets done is part of the work. 
[Barking] look, guys. Clifford's washing the merry-go-round. 
Emily: Pretty good, huh? Hmm, not bad, but I'm in kind of a hurry to get home. I think he should go a little faster. 
Jetta: Hurry up, clifford. Faster! Uh, jetta, don't you think that's a little too fast? No, I do--oh! Someone please get me a towel! Ew, dog slobber. This is all your fault! My fault? Yes. You brought that dog. Clifford has been a big help today. He slobbered all over me. Girls, please, we're supposed to be working as a team, not arguing. Don't forget, if things go well tonight, you will all be rewarded with an ice-cream party after the carnival. 

[00:06:51]


[Slurping] 
[woof] why don't you kids finish up here then go home and get ready for the carnival? Ok, mr. Rodriguez. See ya tonight! Thanks for your help. See you tonight. Wow! Yeah! 
T-Bone: And there's that big balloon we were afraid of, clifford. 
Cleo: Nothing to be afraid of now, big guy. That's right, cleo. 
[Humming] 
T-Bone: Neat trick, clifford. Wow! Ferris wheel, here I come! Jetta, would you mind doing one more little job tonight? Of course, mr. Rodriguez. Anything you want. We're borrowing a tractor for the hayride later tonight, could you please meet the driver at the back gate and guide him over to the pumpkin patch area? Well, can't he find it himself? Jetta, you've done a very good job of telling others what to do today. Now it's your turn to do something. That's teamwork. But what if he's late? There's all these rides and a ferris wheel. Please be a team player, jetta. Oh, ok. Where's that silly tractor? I'm missing all the fun. I really want to ride that ferris wheel. Where is he? I know. I'll just go and take one little tiny ride, and then I'll come right back. Ferris wheel, here I come. Ok, step right up. Good luck, honey. All right! Yeah! 

[00:09:57]


[Laughing] that's her 15th ride tonight. I want a hayride! Come on, please, mom. Can't we go on the ride? I don't believe this. The tractor was supposed to be here an hour ago. What do you think happened, mr. Rodriguez? It's what didn't happen that I'm more concerned about, charley. Jetta. Yes, mr. Rodriguez? Jetta, did you wait for the tractor at the back gate as I asked you to? Uh, well, yeah. I--i waited. And it never showed up? Well, I'm not exactly sure. I mean it was taking so long, and I wanted to ride the ferris wheel, and I was gonna go back. Jetta, you were a member of this carnival team, and all these people were counting on you to do your part. Now we have no tractor to pull the hay wagon. I know. I'm sorry. I guess I'm not a very good team player after all. Well, there's nothing we can do about it now. I guess we'll just have to cancel the hayride. Mr. Rodriguez, I have an idea. 
[Kids laughing and cheering] jetta's sure doing a great job, huh, charley? 
[Laughing] yup, I think she's finally got this teamwork thing figured out. Congratulations to you all for making this the best birdwell island fall carnival ever. Ice-cream sundaes for everyone! 
[Kids cheering] no, clifford! You have to eat over here. Look at that, clifford. A really big sundae for a really big part of the team. 

[00:12:05]


[Woof] that's clifford... My big red dog. 
Emily: Clifford! It's story time! You want to hear a speckle story, don't you? [Woof woof] I thought so. He's your favorite. Today's story is speckle and the rainy day. One day speckle went walking in the rain. He walked past darnell trying to stay dry. Speckle invited darnell to join him under his umbrella. Then speckle saw luna, and he invited her to join them under the umbrella, too. As they walked by the brook, they spied ravi and reba, but there was no more room under speckle's umbrella. So speckle invited everyone to climb in, and they all floated downstream in their umbrella boat, happy and laughing together. The end. That was a great story. Isn't reading fun? 
[Woof] hmm. Ferry's gonna be late today, pedro. I don't think so, victor. It's gonna be right on time. I hope it's on time, pedro. I can't wait to see my cousin laura. And laura's bringing along her big dog rex. 

[00:14:48]


[Woof woof woof] bigger than clifford? Bigger than clifford? 
Laura: Gee, rex, you get bigger every day. 
[Woof woof woof] aren't these binoculars great? Cousin emily's gonna love 'em. She says your buddy clifford's grown since the last time we saw him. Remember how tiny and cute he was? 
[Growling] come on, rex. Swing me. Ok, squirt. Here we go. Wahoo! Hey! Cut it out. 
[Laughing] the little guy always loved water. I wonder if he's outgrown that. Oh, my, it's clifford. Look, here he comes! Whoa! Emily was right. Clifford really has grown. 
[Woof] whoa! Here it comes! Here it comes! Well, what do you know, victor. Right on time. Hmm. Laura! Laura! Emily! 

[00:17:08]


[Woof woof] laura, I'm so glad you're here. I brought you a present, emily. Wow. These are great. We're gonna have so much fun. I have everything all planned out. And this was for clifford, but... I didn't know he'd changed so much. Yeah, he got a lot bigger, but he's still lots of fun. Hey, how're ya doin'... Uh, squirt? I'm great, rex. Clifford, you haven't changed a bit. Come on, laura. Let's body surf. That's ok, emily. I'm ok here. Ok. So, rex, what do you wanna do first? Hey, what do you say, squirt? Let's race to the beach! No fair. Wait up! Looks like I can still beat ya, squirt! Oh! Hey, I won! Finally! 
[Panting] yeah, great race. Oh! Want to race again? I don't want to tire you out, so let's find something else to do, ok? Sure, rex. See you later, aunt caroline! Come on, laura. Let's go over to the park and play some catch. Then I want to show you the great climbing tree in my backyard. Sure, but... I just want to look at these stickers first. You like looking at stickers? Yeah. I collect them. I didn't know that. I'll only be a minute. It's ok. Take your time. Our dogs sure are having fun. They're playing catch. They used to do that all the time, remember? Here you go, squirt. 

[00:19:44]


[Barking] good catch, clifford. Ok, I'm ready! Throw me a good one. I never miss! Ok. Here goes. Whoa! Whoa! , Maybe this isn't such a great game for us anymore. Let's play something else. Great idea, squirt. Come on up, laura. You can see the dunes from here. No, thanks. I'm doing my scrapbook. Hey, squirt. Remember when I used to swing you around on the rope? I don't think that's gonna work anymore, but maybe I can swing you now. Hmm. That might be fun. Why not? Ok, let 'er rip! Rex! Whoo! Clifford! Stop! Oh! Rex! Clifford! Are you ok, rex? Clifford, you're too big to roughhouse like that with rex now. You're not puppies anymore. You need to find some new stuff to do that you both like. That's what a good host does when a friend comes to visit. 

[00:22:18]


[Whimpers] maybe I need to be a better host, too, clifford. Hey, laura, is rex ok? Yeah. Actually, I think he was having fun. But you're not having much fun, are you? Well, it's ok. Can I look at your scrapbook? Really? You want to? It's just, you know, a bunch of stis. You might be bored. These are neat! That's my favorite page. I really like birds. Hey, wanna go look at some real birds? Really? Real birds? Sure! The island's filled with them, and I have a camera. You could even take pictures and make your own bird stickers. Great! Mm-hmm. You find the birds with the binoculars, and I'll take their picture with the camera! My camera's upstairs. Let's go! Ah, listen, squirt-- you're not really a squirt anymore, are you? Not really. I'm more like a tidal wave now. Yeah, kinda. I guess we can't really play the same games we used to, huh? Nope, but we could try something new. Well, I'm game if you are, squir-- I mean, clifford. 
Emily: Clifford, rex, we're going to look for birds out on the dunes. Wanna come? 
[Rex and clifford barking] hey, sounds good to me. Well, what are we waiting for? 
[Woof woof woof] it sure was fun having cousin laura and rex visit, wasn't it? Laura's changed a lot, but I stl really like her. I guess I've probably changed a lot, too. Of course, no one's changed as much as you. But I know one thing that'll never change-- I'll always love you, clifford, my big red dog. 

[00:25:02]


[Growling] clifford and I know that playing is a lot more fun when we share with our friends. That's why clifford's big idea for today is sharing. It's mine! No, it's mine! No, it's mine! Mine! I say it's mine! Whoa! What's going on, t-bone? I found this toy first, but cleo thinks it belongs to her. Now wait! I found it, and it's mine! Maybe instead of fighting over that toy, we can all share mine. Well, ok. Great! Here you go, cleo! Catch, big guy!

Internatnally. We were breaking news out of connecticut. We're following this school shooting. Police told us a number of people have been shot at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut, about 60 miles north of new york. First calls coming into police around 9:40 local time this morning. Children were being evacuated, the schools in the area all on lockdown. Now, we have learned that the shooter is dead. We are also hearing multiple local reports of fatalities. I want to go to our cnn's jason carroll for the very latest. First of all, outline if you will how many people we know are dead, who has been killed, and who has been injured. 
>> Well, first of all, let's go back to the beginning. We started to receive reports at about 9:40 a.M. That's when police, suzanne, reported that a shooter was in the, quote, main office of the school. At that point we had also heard a report that a person in one room had numerous gunshot wounds. This coming to us from one of our affiliates there. Our susan candiotti has confirmed through one of her sources that someone has been shot, the alleged gunman involved in the shooting at the school, and that two weapons were recovered from that particular gunman. We are also getting information in coming from the mayor, the mayor of danbury, connecticut who said that according to him three people taken to danbury hospital. The nature of their injuries at this point unknown. We did -- as we dipped into local affiliate coverage there, as you see some of the pictures, we did hear reports that one teacher was shot in the foot. That was according to one reporter there. Also, another report that a child had an injury to the face and another child with an injury to the hand. A father actually had called into the cnn newsroom earlier today, suzanne, as all was this was developing saying that he saw one child taken away with, quote, serious injuries. I can also tell you that a press conference is scheduled for just about an hour from now. That will be connecticut state police. At that point hopefully we can get more details confirmed, some more information about the alleged shooter in this and more details about all of those hurt. Suzanne. 

[00:02:23]


>> You had mentioned earlier that there were local media reports of multiple fatalities. Where are these reports coming from? 
>> Are these police officers or officials on the ground saying they're a potential for multiple fatalities? Is this coming from the hospitals? Where do we suspect this information is coming from. 
>> One is coming to us from one of the local papers there, the hartford current and another from wabc. The only details they give at this point is that, quote, multiple fatalities. We are still waiting to confirm that particular report. What cnn can confirm at this point is that at least three people taken to local hospitals, danbury hospital, with, quote, serious injuries. 
>> Jason, we want to listen in and dip in if we can to our affiliate wsfb and the latest reporting they have here. 
>> For a parent to receive not to go there and wait for that information. We know that a message did go out to parents giving them some information. Hopefuif you are a parent in that area you received that message. The superintendent did immediately put all schools in newtown on lockdown. We heard some private schools in that area went on lockdown as well. In addition to that, our new haven bureau chief is reporting that many neighboring towns also went into a heightened state of security at their schools as well upon hearing this and, of course, one of the big things that we are waiting to hear and that police are working on right now is what possibl motive could be behind this shooting at this school? We know at least one person other than the gunman has been shot, and the gunman is dead at this point. 
>> And as our sister station in new york city is saying, at least three people were injured and two children and one adult. All three have been taken it to danbury hospital, but they say that they're looking for a car. A maroon or red-colored vehicle with the back window blown out. That is go that wcbs out of new york city is reporting. We're trying to give you the information coming in from so many different sources choosing the ones we know to be the most reliable with the social press and our sisters stations wcbs who say law enforcement officials have confirmed this to them. 

[00:04:40]


>> It to give you an idea how chaotic of the scene it is that is just to the rear of firehouse used as a staging area, probably about a quarter-mile down the driveway from that school. To give you an idea, when robert arrived on the scene near that firehouse where he reported live earlier this morning, he reported that police officers came out of the woods escorting a gentleman telling people he had nothing to do with this. That's the kind of response we're talking about where anyone found in this krar was at least questioned by police and that they want to talk to anyone there. Police also just as we are working right now to try to get a handle on exactly what has happened there. It looks like the helicopter pictures are having freeze-up. That's a shot of the firehouse where this took place. You can look at bin point news tracker to see what that scene looks like. The firehouse is just above that label that says dickinson drive in the middle of the map. You can see that firehouse, and that's where robert has been going live and reporting live this morning. Sigh that long driveway. There's the firehouse and the white building there and the long driveway into the school. That's where police have been swarming. 
>> Police are organizing to have a news conference. That time may be more fluid. They're going about two miles away, and they realize that the public is certainly wanting to know as much as possible, especially parents. A reverse 911 call went out to the residents of newtown informing them of this school shooting at sandy hook elementary. The danbury times is reporting that students started to hear the gunshots during the morning announcements. 
>> Cbs is now reporting that at least one child at the school has died as a result of this shooting at an elementary school, sandy hook lltary school. At least one child at at that that school has died in this shooting. So, obviously, we had feared that that would be the news that we would be getting, that there was more casualties. We know the gunman is dead. Cbs news is confirming at least one child dead as well. 

[00:06:46]


>> Absolutely heart-breaking. Let's go live to robert on the scene. Robert. 
>> There is a lot of tenseness here and a lot of confusion. Parents just showed up here, of course, after they started getting information that there was some sort of shooting incident here at sandy hook elementary school. You can see all the emergency vehicles and parents mixed in together. Of course, the police try to secure the scene over at the school. We do know that there have been at least several people shot. Parents are getting information from emergency officials that one of those people sh may be the principal. We're trying to confirm that. State police are staging an area about two miles from here where they will be doing a news conference to get out some official information. Lieutenant paul vance will be the one leading that in the next 20 to 30 minutes. Of course, we will be at that news conference, but right now over at the school parents just confused. We're hearing that. They're very tense. As we were showing up, a lot of parents walked out with their children, very young children, third, fourth graders. They were, of course, very emotional. A lot were crying. One parent telling us that his child told him that someone walked into the classroom and shot the teacher. That's just some of the information. We asked that parent how your child is doing. He was running up the street saying, I don't know at that the point. They're still trying to figure out that. There's just a lot of information that's coming out. Again, the news conference will be happening about two miles from here. We have a crew ere. We will be getting that information very shortly. Hopefully to shed some light, lieutenant paul ve telling us this is one of the worst shooting incidents we've seen in the state in a long time. Right now newtown police here trying to work with the parents. It seems that state police are the ones that are actually handling the investigation. We've seen federal agents here including from the atf. There's a lot of heavy weaponry that's being used to go into there. We also are hearing reports that at least one of the gunman, if there are just -- if there is one maybe more was shot and killed. We don't know if that was self-inflicted or he was shot during the initial response. Excuse me. We're live right now. You can see some of the ambulances leaving the area. They're coming out of the school. We know that several people were injured in this, and right now we're just trying to figure out who. She said at this point they don't have details on who is shot, but there are some reports that there have been at least two fatalities, maybe more. Again, lieutenant paul vance telling us it's one of the worst shootings they've seen in a long time. That news conference is supposed to happen momentarily about two miles from here. We have a crew there and bring that to you live. We're live right now, channel 3 eyewitness news. 

[00:09:56]


>> Thank you, robert. This picture so telling as the children are crying. We have an eyewitness who was there at the school, and joining us on the phone line. We're just speaking, so if you could identify yourself, sir, or ma'am. 
>> It's liz. Liz, what can you tell us? 
>> I was bringing my son, devin, to school when all the police cars and emergency vehicles were driving by. So my gut told me that they were headed to the school, and we drove down and confirmed that they were headed to the school. They were surrounding a dark suv or van with a tooele on top, and there was a strange burning smell and we left. We went home. On the way we learned that there was a shooting at the school. The school puts out a blast, so I didn't bring my son to his school, the high school. We just went home where friends who have children in the school asked us to come to a friend's house that's next door to the school and see p if we could find out anything, if their children were okay. That's where we met lynn and have been helping him. 
>> Liz, about exactly --

[00:14:26]


>>> We're calling this breaking news story a school shooting that took place at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. We'rablying in the managing editor of cnn.Com and just spoke with an eyewitness inside of the school. I have to warn our viewers, i understand that some of the details about what she actually witnessed is pretty gruesome. Meredith, what she convey to you? 
>> Hi, suzanne. She coed to me that she was in a meeting this morning. She said it was 9:30, 9:35. There were about seven people in the room, and it was a meeting regarding one of her kids. She has children at the school. She volunteers at the school as well. She heard -- she described a pop, pop, pop in the hall. They all heard it. There were about seven people in the meeting room. They heard that sound in the hall. They -- she said three people went out in the hall, the principal, the vice president and the school psychologist, and to hear her describe it she said three people went out in the hall. Only one person came back, which was the vice principal she said, who was shot in the leg or the foot. She came crawling back. She said that she cowers under the table during that moment, and she called 911, as did the otpeople in the room. She said she never w the shooter. She said she was under the table. That the shooting happened in the hallway, and to hear her describe it, she said there must have been 100 rounds. I asked her to clarify that, really, truly 100 rounds? She said at least. 
>> When the vice principal came crawling back, what up happened aat that point? What did she say? How did the vice principal manage toove or escape? Did she describe what was the situation as he was crawling back? 

[00:16:30]


>> She described -- she said that -- she said that there was confusion. There was yelling understandably. She said there was yelling until the hallway, and she couldn't -- she couldn't tell for a while if it was the police or the shooter. When I talked to her, she was still inside the school. The school is on lockdown, so she couldn't tell -- she didn't know if the shooter was dead yet or still there. 
>> What did the vice principal look like when she saw him return? 
>> I didn't -- I didn't hear her describe that. She said -- you know, she said, listen, this is a nice town. This is not a nice school. These are the kinds of things that don't happen there. She noted this was not so high-powered meeting. It was about my -- about one o my children who is in second grade there. You know, she's tearful. She's -- you know, just understandably panicked. She said they marched at some point -- I don't have the length of time, but she said at some point aafter the shooting they marched us out in the hallway right past the two bodies laying in the hallway in a pool of blood. 
>> When she talked about the two bodies, is that of the principal and the school psychologist when she said those two had not returned? Are these the two individuals she was talking about? 
>> That's right, that's right. 
>> And did she say or describe in any way what their conditions looked like when she passed them in the hallway? 
>> No, she did not. She did not. She -- we had a short conversation. She's understandably emotional. Thoue are pretty much the gist of -- that's the gist of our conversation. You know, she was wondering how can the -- how could someone get in? It's a locked school. You have to be buzzed in. 
>> Sure. Meredith, I'm sorry. Were there any kids in the hallway, any children in the hallway as they had moved past the two bodies? 

[00:18:37]


>> She said, yes. She said the children -- she said there was some children still right there in the school right now. Some children had to be walked past that pool of blood. Past the bodies. 
>> How long was she in that room when she heard those gunshots before there was silence? 
>> Well, she said she was there -- she said she got there at 9:00 -- she said the meeting started at 9:00, 9:30. She said that she feels like it was right at the start of the meeting, so she said around 9:30, 9:35 they started to hear the pop, pop, pop in the hall. It sounds like she knew what it was. I asked her, I said, a lot of people don't know that's what they're hearing, gunshots. We all knew something was fired in the hall, and three people went out and only one person came back. So that meeting started at 9:30, and she's stilled locked down in the school. 
>> Does she have any idea how long a time that was when she was hearing all of that popping noise, all that gunfire? 
>> No. No. She said it went -- it went -- it went quickly, and then she said alternatively, you know, it was 100 rounds that went on seemingly forever. 
>> Was there anyone treating the principal and the psychologist when they were in the hallway? 
>> She didn't mention that. 
>> Did she see anybody who might have been coming to their aid, or were they just escorted, walked past the two bodies? 
>> I believe, suzanne, she said that she saw a stretcher or someone coming to their aid. I think she mentioned some kind of assistance, but again, she was -- her main focus at this point was really to try to tell the story of they were there in that room, seven people, and what happened and how she went under the table and called 911. Three people out, and only one came back. That was the gist of the story. 

[00:20:51]


>> Did she describe at all, meredith, what it was like, the scene? Whether or not it was calm or chaotic when they were ushered out of the room and out of the school? 
>> No, she didn't describe it as eichaotic. When I asked her what it was like, she said they're just trying -- I asked if there were any messages going over the loud speaker, if there's -- of what's being sa she said there's nothing like that happening inside the school right now. She said everyone is still on lockdown. So it's -- so it sounds like they're keeping people, you know, where they are. She said there are still children in classrooms here. 
>> Meredith artley, thank you so much. I appreciate it. 
>> Thanks, suzanne. 
>> We're going to try to get in touch with some people including the woman you spoke to who experienced just a harrowing experience, those seven people inside of a room hearing the gunfire and then having to walk past those who were shot in the hallway. I want to go back to our aaffiliate, wfsb, for more details. 
>> I wonder if that person was involved. That person was taken to a police car. We do not know where that person is at this point, and again, we do not know if there was one shooter or more shooters. That will all being sorted out, I think. They were trying to secure this area. They were allowing us a lot closer, but now as they've secured the area, they're expanding the zone as this investigation begins. Of course, we have this other information that they're trying to track a van, and they may have an area over in danbury that they have that van. So we obviously have a crew over there as well, but I think the main information right now is coming from a news conference within the next half hour. Cara. 
>> Thank you, robert. 
>> Robert, we appreciate it. Obviously, we'll stay on there and bring you that information as soon as that press conference begins. We'll take that liv from newtown. Sandy hook elementary school in newtown, a k to 4 school with about 600 students, the scene of a shooting this morning. One child confirmed dead, the gunman dead as well. At least one other person was shot, although police say that they do believe that there may be other victims involved in this. At this point the school is completely surrounded by pice officers who responded to that area from all around the state of connecticut. 9:41 this morning, about three hours ago, that call came in reporting that shooting and from that time all around the state of connecticut, state police s.W.A.T. Teams and other police resources heading there to the elementary school. You can see the ambulances there. An enormous response to that school, and we did hear reports wcbs reporting that the firefighters were helping to escort children out of the school. They were telling those children to cover their eyes and run as they went by the school office. Obviously an ominous warning here. This is a picture from the newtown bee showing children escorted out by state troopers. You can see the huge glut the vehicles that came in there as people came trying to get information. 

[00:24:07]


>> Very chaotic and horrifying scene for the people who have children in that school. Representative john fray is serving his seventh term in the connecticut house of representatives, the minority whip. He said his niece and nephew go to that school, and she witnessed first graders running from the school crying. She among other people took those children, and people have been assembling at the firehouse. Here we see the pictures of adults and presumably teachers taking away distraught children and walking them to a safer place. Robert told us that many children have reunited with families, but they are remaining at the firehouse because they're unable to leave this very active scene wherere's a possibility they're looking for a second gunman. 
>> We have on the phone jessica norton. She's with the group survivors of homicide. They're active in the state of connecticut. Jessica, can you give us some idea just from your own personal experience and dealing with your group what these families are dealing with? 
>> They're absolutely terrified right now, especially at the fact a lot of them don't even know what is going on with their children and whether or not they're safe. 
>> We lost our affiliate there. We've been following this breaking news story, this school shooting that took place at sandy hook elementary school in newtown connecticut. Cnn confirms that at least two have die, including the shooter. This took place in the morning about 9:40 at this elementary school. We're getting multiple reports of multiple fatalities. That has not been independently confirmed, but we expect a news conference fro local police to outline and try to sort out a the lot the details and conflicts stories. We get stories from people inside of the building, eyewitnesses and people who heard the shooting. One eyewitness we just spoke to saying that they heard 100 rounds, and they saw at least two people who had been shot and who were in the hallway bleeding. We're going to take a quick break, and we'll be right back with more details. Diarrhea, gas, bloating? Yeah.

>>> Following this breaking news story. We have new details. This is a story we're following at sandy hook elementary school out of newtown, connecticut where a gunman opened fire on this elementary school early this morning at 9:40 local time. We are learning that three people are dead from this shootincluding the gunman itself. It's unclear whether he shot himself or he was killed, but we do know and we have from eyewitnesses their accounts and this is from parents and people inside of the school who tell the story of hearing at least 100 rounds of gunfire inside the school this morning. Outside of an office, we have now learned and confirmed that both the principal and the school psychologt have been killed. That they were shot inside of the school, and we have also learned as well a source with knowledge of the investigation that the shooter's body is inside a school classroom. That is the very latest here. There's still a lot of unanswered questions about those who were injured. We have reports, local reports of multiple fatalities. We need to clear that up and find out just whether or not that involved students. We know that there are at least a couple of students who have been injured and taken to local hospitals. A teacher who was shot in the foot, a child who was -- has an injury to the face and another child who has an injury to a hand. Those three, who have been taken to danbury hospital. We also know from an eyewitness who said inside of the school at the time of the shooting that the vice principal was shot in the foot and came crawling back to the office. This is just unbelievable as we hear more of these details, and we'll be getting more information from a local news conference that's going to take place very shortly. We also heard just a few moments ago from a little girl who was inside of the school when the shooting started. 

[00:31:07]


>> Third grade, aalexis. You told measure you were sitting in class this morning, and you saw a lot of police. Tell me how you found out what was going on. 
>> Well, we found like there was all these people, and we found it was because it was like near the window in our classroom. And like we saw a police officer and we heard them on the roof and in our building. 
>> Was everybody crying, scared, wanting their parents to come get them? 
>> Yeah, they are. Some people even got a stomach ache. 
>> Did you hear any gunshots or anything like that? 
>> Well, police officers, they were right out the door trying to find the guy. 
>> We want to go to news 12, our affiliate news 12 in connecticut for the aerial shot and some of the details that they're getting. 
>> We have helicopters flying above my house continuously. 
>> Tell us what happened just shortly at !9:30 this morning. Were you in your home or what were you doing at the time? 
>> I'm on the phone. 
>> Okay. I'm sorry. 
>> That's okay. Go ahead. Anyway, can you ask that again. I got sidetracked here. 
>> Sure. No problem. At about 9:30 this morning when this was all -- emergency responders were getting word of this, what was happening at your house? How did you know there was a problem? 
>> I was taking the dogs out to go to the bathroom, and i thought I heard a noise. They started going crazy, so i put them back in the house because I was on my way to the gym. When I was getting in my car, i heard sirens going off continuously. Car after car after car. Some of them were flying up past my house and coming back around again and going to the school. This house is three houses away from the school. Three houses away from the firehouse. 

[00:33:07]


>> Okay. 
>> So then I seen a bunch of children with a couple of adults running up the road. They were going towards treadwell park, which is up from us. As I was getting back in my car again, because I'm trying to figure out what's going, I seen five children running up through our back fields. 
>> In other words, through your backyard children are running? 
>> Yeah. Because our back adjacent, the further field is adjacent to the end of the school property. 
>> Were they just running by themselves? 
>> Yeah. I didn't see any adults. 
>> We should point out these are kids, kindergarten through fourth grade. These are young children. 
>> Little children running through your backyard. It's our understanding what we're reading on the wire and from various sources that the children were told to immediately get out of the building. 
>> Yep. And by god, those poor little guy were running. I want to say they were in fourth grade, because they weren't tiny. 
>> I want to interrupt. We have a report. This is from abc news, the network news, that they have confirmed through federal and local officials more than a dozen people including children were shot and killed in this school. 
>> We have not gotten that number at this point. Nothing like that. We've gotten reports of the school principal and of the school psychologist and of the apparent shooter, but this escalates this particular horrific event even further. I mean, after you saw the children running through your backyard, colin, what else did you see from that point? 
>> I stopped -- 
>> I want to bring by phone a security expert rye tired police officer lou polumbo. Why are we hearing conflicting reports, so many different reports from those who are injured and those killed from various affiliates and networks and people who are on the ground? I assume it's a fluid and chaotic situation. Well, the problem suzanne is the fact that you have people at the site, investigators conducting different tasks. In other words, some people are in there trying to make an accounting for who has been shot. Other people are interviewing people. Anytime you have any type of incident, even something far more simple than this, it's difficult to get the same stories straight out of two people. This is nothing inconsistent. The problem simply he stated is they put the pieces of this together as we speak, and that's what has some inconsistencies in reporting. 

[00:35:44]


>> With all of your years of experience, what is taking place on the ground now? What are they trying to do? What are the priorities? What is most important? 
>> The priority right now is to identify anybody that's been injured to get them treated. What they're doing and they do this in a somewhat simultaneous fashion and they respond, they build out a perimeter and employ containment and start to conduct an investigation. They have to facilitate entry. They have to identify who the shooter is, determine if there are explosives. Tie in whether or not this could possibly occur in another school, which is why the school districts have been closed. The area has been closed. There's a number of tasks that they're doing. But the most important one is trying to get aid to those injured or possibly fatalities. 
>> Is it important -- we've heard various reports from people inside the building that there's children in the building and children have been evacuated and adults are still in the building, that the body of the shooter is in a classroom. Should these children have been moved? Should people be out of the building, on or is it best at this point for everybody to stay put inside of the school? 
>> I think the most important thing is that everyone follow the instructions of the law enforcement agency that's in charge. There are reasons that children may ory not be moved. This is a crime scene. They're trying to figure out what happened. Some of the children detained at the school may not be able to have some type of facilitation to get them off the property and into a safe environment. You can't second-guess what they're doing there at this point. What you have to realize is this is an immense undertaking, and it's particularly sensitive because it involves children. They're trying to make as few mistakes as possible and impossible not to make some. There's a method to the madden. Most of all this is a crime scene. They have to determine how many shots were fired and where they were directed. They're trying to recover any casings, examine walls and other materials that have projectiles lodged in them. They're trying to determine what firearms were used. It's a broad undertaking.

>>> Sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut a school shooting that took place this morning. First calls getting in about 9:30 local time. What we're watching here, this is news 12 connecticut. This is rob reporting. You see aerial shots overlooking the school. Cnn can independently confirm that the shooter is dead and at least two employees of the school have been killed. We want to dip into the raw coverage from our affiliate. We can't confirm the raw live reporting that they are doing, but we want to get a good look on the ground and get a sense of what they're learning. 
>> It seems as if that scene has quieted down now. That is the vehicle that they seem to be interested in, that black honda. It was taped off very early on in the whole incident, and you can see a police dog taken over to the car. This is footage from earlier today. I know what's going on. They're looking for a scent, and there is a report from another television station in connecticut that two gunmen were involved, and one was led away in handcuffs. 
>> So the early report of two gunmen and then now with -- the abc affiliate reporting that that -- that other second gunman taken away in handcuffs. At this point all the information we've received is that the shooter -- the fatality was an adult. There are no reports of -- >>but there are additional reports from other stations, other news organizations saying as many as 20 children may have been shot. 
>> I'm talking about the gunman, though. 
>> This has gotten so much worse as we've been covering it since we've been on a couple of hours. 
>> Let's go to jay carney at the white house briefing. He's talking about the shooting. 
>> We'll begin to investigate this incident. As I said, the president will receive regular updates as the day progresses. We'll take your questions. 

[00:43:14]


>> Jay, one follow-up on that. Can you relay to us any of the president's reactions or thoughts? Obviously, all of shootings are tragic. We'reearing particularly heinous numbers where children are involved. 
>> I would rather not relay reactions at this point, because I don't have any confirmation to give to you about what exactly has happened there or potential victims. At this point I'd rather just inform you that the president has been informed about the shooting, was informed at 10:30 and is being given regular updates as more information is available. 
>> Will we hear from him today? 
>> We'll have to keep you updated as more information becomes available. 
>> Reporter: Two other topics. In the abc news interview the president was asked about the legalization of marijuana in a couple of states where voters have sounded off on that and essentially said that it's not a high priority for him, no pun intended, to go after recreational users. Obviously, this is a serious issue. States rights versus federal rights. I'm wondering if there's any concern -- 
>> they were looking for apparently another shooter. We don't know how many people were involved. 
>> President obama has been informed of the shooting by his staff. Happened about 10:30 or so this morning. It is typical that at a scene like this, a situation that the president would be informed rather quickly. That he would be getting regular updates from his staff, and at some point depending on how serious the situation is, he said certainly the president would release a statement and even perhaps come out publicly to address what has taken place in things of this nature. A national tragedy of this nature. I want to dip back into news 12 connecticut, our affiliate, to listen to some of the things they're hearing. 

[00:45:16]


>> Taken to danbury hospital. The shooter for the most part has been confirmed. The apparent shooter is dead, an adult. Two handguns, two 9 millimeter guns recovered. Students sent running from this school. We heard colleen poundstone, who lives three houses away saying children were running in the fields, which essentially is her backyard. One little boy saying I just want to go home. Such a disturbing scene, but unfolding so quickly this morning. As though students are making their way to the sandy hook volunteer fire department, which is not very far from the school. 
>> No. You've been seeing it. We'll point it again. It's just to the right of that facility, which is the school, is the volunteer fire department, which is where the all the kids were led, those that didn't flee on their own. They were marched over there in line. We actually had a picture earlier of that, of the kids armed on each other's shoulders walking in a line. That's where they were taken and that's where parents went to meet their kids and take them home. We thought everything was going good. As the story unfolded it sounded like the shooter was shot and then possibly one other person. Now this horrible mounting death toll involving so many children and adults. It does give one pause. 
>> Yes. But federal authorities, as we heard earlier from the assistant fire chief. Now emergency responders are so carefully choreographed today. So he -- though he said my knowledge on this is limited, but I will tell you that fbi and secret service will be involved in this. At what point I'm not clear. 

[00:47:18]


>> The fbi has been on the scene. 
>> The local authorities hand this over, and maybe atf as well are part of this. 
>> There have been s.W.A.T. Teams. We've seen them. 
>> Police dogs. 
>> There is an unconfirmed report that an entire classroom of kids is unaccounted for outside the school. 
>> But that may be the kids fleeing through the woods. 
>> That ran on their own. 
>> Right. 
>> The sad, I think, probably one of the realities from something like this is connecticut school children now will be taking on a whole new kind of -- it won't be just the fire drill from this point forward. A sad reality, but it very much may be part of their school year, training for an evacuation in the event of something as horrific as this. 
>> Cbs news -- this is the network reporting 27 dead. 27 dead. Columbine had 15 the producer said, 15 including the shooter. 
>> This will take us to the worst school shooting in the history of the united states. On a quiet friday, very pretty, chilly, late fall day. Most people go into their friday morning with somewhat more light-hearted thinking here we are, a weekend, a holiday weekend, shopping, santa claus, the final night of hanukkah. Coming up this weekend, and then to have a horrific shooting like this take place with such young children. 
>> Cnn cannot independently confirm what you've heard on the aaffiliates. They have gotten second-hand as well what they are hearing in terms of the death toll. I want to bring in susan candiotti following and talking to law enforcement officials on the very latest. I understand we've lost the connection. We're going to get back to susan in a moment. Let's dip back into our affiliate, news 12. 
>> Chopper 12 will be back live any minute now, because I'm guessing they fueled up at the danbury airport, which is nearby there. In just about 10 minutes we will have for you live the news conference from a park not that far. It's that woman we spoke with -- 

[00:49:39]


>> colleen poundstone. 
>> She's going to run up to that park. 
>> She wanted them on the road, because just running through the woods with emergency police. We saw a photograph earlier of police combing through the woods in that area. She was the wife of a military man, and she had many briefings on terrorism preparedness. 
>> We'll bring in susan candiotti speaking with law enforcement officials. Susan, what have we learned this morning? 
>> Reporter: Some heart-breaking news from a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation that close to 20 people have been killed at the school shooting and among them at least 10 are children, suzanne. This is new information coming to you from a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation. We do know that the suspected shooter's body was discovered in a classroom, but we do not know how the suspected shooter died, whether it was by his own hand or by police or in some other way. That information we're still waiting for, and there is a news conference coming up to be held by the connecticut state police. We know that the governor's office has been monitoring this situation throughout. They are in close contact with police as well, but this is, of course, terrible news about the identity of those who are killed, both adults and children. At least 10 of them are children. 
>> That is just devastating to hear. Susan, do we have a sense in this press conference that is going to occur in about ten minutes or so whether or not that number could be even higher? 
>> Reporter: I am hearing that that may be the case. We also have according to another source that school principal was among those killed as well. Yes. As a matter of fact, here at the site we very recently saw federal, local officials as well, law enforcement officials with guns at their side searching -- continuing to search the area around the school. They appear to be looking at various cars. We don't know whether they are searching for someone specifically, but we know from earlier information we had that protectively they continued to look through the area to make sure that everyone connected to the shooting was found. Still no kind of motive has been revealed at this time. 

[00:52:12]


>> Susan, is there any sense from those who you're speaking with whether or not those who were tragically killed, if this took place in one particular part of the school? Could it have been one classroom or something where they believe the gunman went from class to class? 
>> Reporter: We just don't know. It's too early. Of course, those are among the details that we hope to learn as well as who the shooter was, what the connection was, if any, between the shooter and the school. Those are among so many questions that we all have right now. 
>> Do we have any sense of whether or not the parents of these children have been notified about their children? 
>> Reporter: No information about that either. We do know that when a lot of children were let out of the school, and I'm sure you've seen the pictures of them in a line with hands on each other's shoulder of the child in front of them that one of the staging areas is a nearby firehouse. We have also seen some children and parents in the vicinity of the school also walking about not on the school site. In any case we are sure as they have done in so many cases prior to this trying to get counseling available for children as soon as possible. 
>> I can only imagine the fear and concern when people hear these numbers. Is there any sense of a process or some sort of way of getting information to people, to parents and to children about the state of their loved ones in that school? 
>> Well, I don't know exactly what kind of process they have set up or system that they set up here for the children. Of course, the police were on the scene very quickly. They have been making sure that they were shuttling the children to a safe location, and I'm sure among many things they are doing is to get as much information to the parents as is possible, but we don't have any of those details yet either. We arrived on the scene a short time ago, so we try to continue to get that information for you. 

[00:54:25]


>> Do you have any sense on the scene whether or not parents are ware of the number of people and casualties and the fact that ten children have been killed? 
>> Reporter: I do not, suzanne. This is brand-new information, so I haven't had a chance to sample any opinions or find out from anyone in the area whether that information is widely available as of yet. 
>> Susan, finally, can you give us a sense of what it is like? We're looking at live pictures, of course. We see a lot of the emergency personnel and have seen pictures with children and worried parents. We see focus on one particular vehicle that has been cordoned off. Give us a sense of what it is like there close to the school and close to those officials who will soon speak with us about some of the details they've just learned. 
>> Well, you can imagine it's just -- it's been described in the immediate aftermath as chaos, and now there is just utter sadness and shock that you see on the faces of people who clearly and understandably are shaken by what has happened here, not to mention as you indicated, suzanne, what these children who may have witnessed this and certainly would have heard it and have been quickly hurried out of that school as soon as it was safe to do so, what they will be going through. The trauma that has been heaped upon them as well as this community. So all of that will be played out, of course, in these few short hours. There is still a lot of police activity in the area as we continue to see federal, state and local law enforcement authorities walking about not only around the school but also some surrounding businesses around the area. They're checking cars and looking around. You get a sense that they are checking to make sure and some of my sources have told me that the area is secure. 
>> All right. Susan candiotti, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Of course, we are following this breaking news story, sandy hook elementary school out of newtown, connecticut, not far from new york. We have just learned really devastating news that 20 people killed in this school shooting, including 10 children. We're going to take a quick break. We're waiting for a police briefing that will happen very shortly. designed you? 1-800-345-2550 Schwab Bank was built with all the value

>>> We'll go to news 12 connecticut our afill he yat to learn more about the school shooting we're falling in newtown connecticut. Nonfirmedeople killed in the school shooting. Let's listen in. 
>> That clearly is now where they were staging. You could see a number of ambulances. We saw stretchers. We actually saw someone taken away on a stretcher from that area. This is the woods and probably that woman we spoke with lives right in that area. 
>> Uh-huh. 
>> She said she was adjacent to the playing fields. 
>> You can see the wide space. Hat might be her home. 
>> And she kind of echoed the reality that you try and help children today, but they're so reluctant. 
>> She was wise. She said you don't have to come in the house, but get on the main roads. Those kids did not want to remain. We have an update on the president being informed. A white house spokesperson says that the president feeling enormous sympathy for the families of the children, and then when asked about gun control policies, the spokesperson says there is, I am sure, will be rather a day for discussion of the usual washington policy debates, but i don't think today is that day. 
>> No. This is a tragedy of historic proportion, a national tragedy now as we learn that the death toll is 27. Of the 27, 18 children. We know that they're very young children because sandy hook elementary is a school that has kindergarten through fourth graders. So virtually babies attend very -- so young attend an elementary school that is not even k through 8. It's k through 4 at this school. So horrific, horrific news that we are all learning. The shooter -- this is the -- there were reports of two, but -- one or two suspects. One is dead, one taken away in handcuffs. The one we're assuming with the ties to new jersey whose home the feds are in e process of raiding we assume that is the deceased gunman. We don't know at this point. 

[01:02:08]


>> We don't know. That is the other facility we were telling you about. The volunteer firehouse. You can see all the vehicles there in the top there above the building. You can see a fire truck taken out of the building. In the middle of your screen is where all the ambulances gathered. We want to reiterate this was shot a couple of hours ago now. This is where the children were taken following the shooting. They were led by staff members probably through the woods there that you see in the bottom of your screen to that as a staging area. Then eventually parents came to lead their children away. At some point in this video we did see an ambulance taking away someone on a stretcher. Lots of vehicles there. That's also where the media gathered, and we're told that about a half hour ago all the media were asked to leave that area. That's the school. Sandy hook elementary. I don't know if you heard it. We're told that all of the news 12s ARE WATCHING THIS NOW. If you just are joining us, that school consists of 600 students from kindergarten through fourth grade. Shortly after the school day began, one report says during the announcements that were being made over the loud speaker system the shots began ringing out. Before all was said and done, 18 children and 9 adults were killed. 
>> I can only imagine at in the point if the reports that we received -- 
>> we bring in susan candiotti. What are you learning on the ground? 
>> Reporter: We're getting ready for a nupz conference to start anytime now here in connecticut. We are a short distance away from where the school is located, and there is still a crime scene there, very active crime scene at this time. We know that there are multiple people dead, at least 20, and among them at least, at least 10 of those dead are children in this horrific shooting. The other information is that the shooter was discovered in a classroom. We don't know whether he took his own life or was killed by police or in some other way. Still waiting to get that information as well. It is a heart-breaking scene here as children were led through the school one hand on the shoulder of the child in front of them as they are led away from here, taken to a local firehouse. Many of them meeting already with their parents who were notified. Many of them had signed up and learned about this tragedy by text, that there was a shooting at the school or e-mail notified to about what had happened here. Many of those parents, of course, showing up quickly to comfort their cildren and be with their children as police continue to look around this scene. 

[01:05:05]


>> Susan, are there still children inside of the school? 
>> Reporter: We don't believe so, but I don't have any official confirmation on that. This happened at about 9:40 or so eastern time. Police rather quickly responding to the scene of multiple gun the shots and injuries. Immediately as soon as it was safe for them to do so children -- first the school was locked down, which is usually the case. Once it was save to lead the children out of the school, that's exactly what happened. We have local police, state police, as well as federal law enforcement on the scene here, including the fbi and atf. They're canvassing the area to make sure there was only one shooter, suspected shooter involved in this terrible massacre as well as whether there was anyone else involved. To that end they've been walking down the street looking at various cars. One car is corn doned off and taped off and they're looking around the area as well to make sure they have -- that there's only one suspect involved in this case. 
>> All right. Susan, we're going to get to you and certainly going to take that press conference as soon as it happens, but I want our viewers to listen to this because this was just moments ago. Our cnn digital managing editor meredith artley spoke with us and talked to a woman who has a second grader inside of that school who was there, who witnessed the shooting. I want you to listen to this. 
>> She was in a meeting in morning. There were about seven people in the room. It was a meeting regarding one of her kids. She has children at the school. She volunteers at the school as well. She heard -- she described a pop, pop, pop in the hall. They all heard it. There were about seven people mountain meeting room. They heard that sound in the hall, and they -- she said three people went out into the hall, the principal, the vice principal and school psychologist. To hear her describe it, she said three people went out into the hall, and only one -- only one person came back, which was the vice principal, she said, who was shot in the leg or the foot. He came crawling back. She said that she ered under the table during that moment, and she called 911, as did the other people in the room. She said she never saw the shooter, that she was under the table. That the shooting happened in the hallway, and to hear her describe it, she said that there must have been 100 rounds. I asked her to clarify that, really, truly, 100 rounds? She said at least. 

[01:07:54]


>> When the vice principal came crawling back, what happened at that point? What did she say? How did the vice principal manage to move or escape? Did she describe what was the situation as he was crawling back? 
>> She described -- she said that -- she said that there was confusion, there was yelling understandably. She said there was yelling in the hallway, and she couldn't tell for a while if it was the police or the shooter. When I talked to her, she was still inside the school. The school is on lockdown, so she couldn't tell -- she didn't know if the shooter was dead yet or still there. 
>> What did the vice principal look like when she saw him return? 
>> I didn't hear her describe that. She said -- you know, she said, listen, this is a nice town. This is a nice school. These are the kinds of things that don't happen there. She noted this was not some high-powered meeting. It was about one of my children who is in second grade there. And she's tearful. She's understandably panicked, and she said they marched at some point -- I don't have the length of time, but she said at some point after the shooting they marched us out in the hallway right past the two bodies laying in the hallway in a pool of blood. 
>> Unbelievable. Seven people in an office there and experiencing something as tragic as that. I want to bring in susan candiotti. Susan has been reporting it could be as many as 20 people who have been killed in this school shooting. Of them 10 and we're talking about little children, k through fourth grade who were marched out of that school. Susan, what do we know? What do we expect to lin the moments ahead from this news conference? 

[01:10:02]


>> Reporter: We hope to get more details about how this happened, if they have a precise number about how many are dead, as you id. We have our source with knowledge of the investigation saying there are at least 20 dead or close to 20 dead, and at least 10 of them being children in this grade school as you mentioned grades kindergarten through the fourth grade. We know they found at least two guns with the shooter, according to another source with knowledge of the investigation. Two weapons. We don't know how the shooter died, whether he took his own life or whether someone else killed him. As soon as it was safe, as you heard, for children to leave the school, the children were led out of the school to a nearby firehouse that's being used as a staging area for children and parents that rushed to the site as soon as they could, just a terrible, heart-breaking information. The shock for these children and parents and this entire community are going through now to try to understand how this could have happened, if a motive has been discovered for why this happened, whether there was any connection between the suspected shooter in this case and the school itself that led that person to the school this morning. These are all some of the many questions that we all have. 
>> All right. We're going to take a quick break here and try to get answers to those questions as soon as we get to that news conference expected momentarily. to and... Social Security are just numbers in a budget. Well, we worked hard for those benefits. We earned them. And if Washington tries to cram decisions about the future... of these programs into a last minute budget deal... we'll all pay the price.

>>> Following this breaking news story at sandy hook elementary school. Cnn is confirming 20 people have died in that shooting incident. Le I'll go to wabc, our affiliate there. They're talking about conditions of some brought to danbury hospital. We want to remind people, we are hearing many different numbers in terms of fatalities. This is raw information coming in. Cnn can only confirm 20 fatalities at this time. Let's listen in. 
>> Liz and dave, you've been raising a lot of issues about the whole issue of security since columbine and the fact of the matter is we have received this letter that the principal of the school, done hashbrung, who was appointed in 2010, sent to parents earlier in year and I'm going to read it to you, at least the first part. Deamembers, our district is implementing a security system in all elementary schools as part of the ongoing efforts to ensure student safety. As usual exterior doors are locked during the day. Every visitor will be required to ring the doorbell at the front entrance and the office staff will use a visual monitoring system to allow entry. Then this is highlighted here. Viewers will be required to report to directly to the office and sign in. If our office staff does not recognize you, it goes on to say you will be requireto show ifk with a picture i.D. Please understand with nearly 700 students and over 1,000 parents representing 500 sandy hook families, most parenting will be asked to show identification. A little later on it says, there may be a short delay until someone can view you on the handset and allow you to come in electronically. Of course, we have been talking about the possibility of a parent being involved here, but clearly there are security measures that are in place, that were in place this year so it would be very strict for any visitors getting into the school. 

[01:16:18]


>> Very strict. Do we know why they were implemented? 
>> We don't know why. We just have this letter, but clearly, as a number of elementary schools have done and a number of high schools as well, we're all parents. They've taken this very seriously. Most of them when you do go into the school now, you have to sign in. I remember when our son was in elementary school, we had to go in, sign in, sign out when you left. So clearly, you know, schools have been addressing this. This school did as well. I think that's important to mention here, but you know if you're dealing with a parent, who knows. 
>> So true. Thank you. Nick, I would think that most elementary schools in this country when they think of security, they think of maybe a parental custody case, things like that. Not something as violent as this. Before we get to that point, we're learning more about the shooter from abc news. They tell crisco mow that one shooter was 24 years old armed with four weapons and wearing a bulletproof vest. Police are continuing to investigate the possibility of an additional shooter, and state police have confirmed to abc news this afternoon that the two shooters were initially believed to be involved in this shooting. Right now we're learning that the one shooter, 24 years old and wearing a bulletproof vest as well as armed with four weapons. 
>> That's just outrageous, but to go to the report on the letter from the school, I mean, look, it's reasonable what they did. They addressed the security issues. They took excellent precautions. 
>> You've been listening it to wabc there. I want to, again, remind our viewers, this is raw reporting. This is reporting from various networks. Cnn cannot independently confirm some of those facts that you're hearing there. We're waiting for a press conference. You'll hear from police officials directly about what the ultimate fatality count is, those ined and how many suspects and who is involved. We'll expect the news conference to happen very shortly. cold.

>>> sandy hook elementary school is the site in newtown, connecticut of a massive shooting. At least 20 people killed. Of those killed 10 children. Just a few minutes ago we heard from a little girl early this morning who was actually inside of the school when that shooting started. 
>> Alexis, you told me you were sitting in class this morning and saw a lot of miss. Tell me how you found out what was going on? 
>> Well, we found there was all these people, and we found out we were right near the window in our classroom. We saw like police officers and we heard them on the roof and in our building. 
>> Reporter: Was everybody crying, scared, wanting their parents to come get them? 
>> Yeah, they were. And then some people were even like -- they kind of got a stomachache. 
>> Reporter: Did you hear any gunshots or anything like that? 
>> Police officers, they were there kind of, because there were police officers right out the door trying to find the guy. 
>> Joining us by phone is security expert retired nassau county, new york police officer lou palumbo. We were speaking earlier today about how the whole morning unfolded and worst nightmares coming true here when you listen to the suspected number of fatalities, at least 20 killed, of those 10 children. How does this even compare, I he mean, to what we've experienced in the past? It's just unbelievable. 
>> You're asking me, suzanne, how this compares to prior incidents? 
>> Yes. 
>> I think it's escalated. When you look at a death toll with children to this magnitude, I don't know how much worse it's going to get. I will tell you unequivocally with this death toll we've surpassed prior incidents, of which approximately seven in the last couple of years. I certainly hope we don't have a repeat of this or anything that outdoes this, so to speak. 

[01:23:25]


>> I can't even imagine what happens next. As a law enforcement expert, can you explain to us where do you begin? Where do you start here in terms of the children, their safety, the parents, identifying the dead? What happens now? 
>> What they're doing right now is to -- not to be trite about it, but they're putting the pieces of this together on many levels, as you just alluded to. They're trying to figure out who is dead. They're trying to figure out notifications. They're trying to run a crime scene and create a profile on the individual who perpetrated this. They're tracking down these firearms that were in his possession to determine how he was capable of obtaining them. Suzanne, you know, I have to say this to you. I think we have to gain some sensibility in our culture. This is the seventh or eighth incident involving firearms, and I support the second amendment. I don't think that that's what this is about. It quite apparent that people are able to obtain firearms when they are not in the right state of mind. I think we need to how would you say impose part of the vetting process similar to one we go through this law enforcement to include minnesota multiphase zwick he screening test. 
>> We have to get back to you. I hear your point. We'll go directly it to wabc and dip in on some news that they're learning. 
>> Come from a scene and hug each other so early on in their investigation. So clearly a very telling moment. You can -- one can only imagine the carnage inside that school that you are looking at down there. Dan rice in news chopper 7. Thanks for the update. It's 1:25 in the afternoon. We're continuing to follow the tragic story out of newtown, connecticut that started around 9:30 this morning. A gunman walking into sandy hook elementary school. From what we know now, the latest, 27 people have been killed, mostly children. 

[01:25:46]


>> The gunman believed to be in HIS 20s. He had at least two guns on him. They were recovered aat the scene. He was wearing all black according to our sources and a bulletproof vest. 
>> Most of the children -- the school was evacuated. Those children were taken to a nearby firehouse early this morning. Most of the parents being able to pick up their children there, but now this wait, this agonizing wait for those parents who have not been able to locate their children. As many as 18 children may be dead. Other schools in the area, monroe school district remains on lockdown at this hour. Danbury hospital where three of the victims were taken to also on lockdown at this hour with an abundance of caution. Investigators -- dan rice showed us this minivan a short time ago. It'u a second car in the parking lot that investigators have cordoned off and are paying particularly close attention to. You can see the officers there. We understand the fbi, atf, and local police all now converging in this -- onto this one little town in fairfield county, connecticut. 
>> Initially there was some concerns or questions if there was more than one person involved primarily because people were running from the school and they had to question whether some of the people running were involved and the chaos of the moment. They are pursuing every lead to confirm whether it was one person or more. At this point we know of the one person, but they're not going to end their investigation with that. They're going to continue looking. We've been seeing a lot of activity all along surrounding that. To answer many questions, they set up a space near the school where the governor and other law enforcement officials are expected to brief reporters when they have enough information i guess that they can really give us something to go on. As we stated al morning and afternoon long, the information comes in and it gets updated and changesmore clarity comes to what occurred in this hour fiing situation. 

[01:27:55]


>> We should tell you that president obama has been briefed not only by homeland security but also by fbi director bob muller and the president has also spoken with connecticut governor dana malloy to discuss the incident. Also express his condolences. We are waiting for the governor as well as state police to hold a news conference, which is expected to happen. It was supposed to happen around 1:00 this afternoon, but obviously they're continuing to try and gather more information on this. We want to go right now to eyewitness news reporter marcus solis. He's outside the firehouse where many parents are going to pick up their children. Marcus, what's the late heest from there right now? 
>> Reporter: Well, liz, we're at washington avenue here. This is the final point where parents can come to. They have to walk up to that hill to get up to the firehouse and pick up their children. So many people are ditching their cars and going up there. Certainly less now. We know that there are several parents who are still waiting word that children are unaccounted for. We see some making it back down the hill with their children certainly relieved after what's been an incredibly emotional morning. We just spoke with a parent and his fourth grade son who describes some of the aos that was going on inside of that school on lockdown and police were trying to apprehend the shooter and bring this to an end. Let's hear a little bit of what they had to say. 
>> I was in the gym at the time. So the teachers -- he we heard lots of bangs, and we thought that it was the custodian knocking stuff down. We heard screaming. And so went onto -- we went to the wall, and we sat down. Then the police came in. It's like, is he in here? Then he ran out. Then somebody yelled get to a safe place, so we went to the closet in the gym and we sat there for a little while. Thenhe police like were knocking on the door, and they're like, we're evacuating people, we're evacuating people. We ran out. They're police at every door leading us down this way, this way. Quick, quick, come on. We ran down to the firehouse. There's a man that pinned down to the ground with handcuffs on, and we thought that was the victim. 

[01:30:23]


>> One of the eyewitnesses there, just a little boy describing what he heard and saw during the shooting. I want to go to another affiliate for more. 
>> My son was in the gym when it happened. He heard the gunshots. It's going to be one of those things when they're trying to understand what happened. When we tell them what happened in detail, it's going to make it much worse. 
>> Did they give you any information? Was it an adult? 
>> I don't know what happened outside of that. I haven't had any information other than what people are speculating. We're gathering around here. 
>> Listening to parents after parents as they tell the tale of what their children had been through that morning after witnessing an unimaginable tragedy in a quaint town. This is newtown, connecticut. We're looking at the parents who are bringing their children home throughout the morning this has been happening and afternoon as well. A number of parents are still going to this firehouse that we're looking at. Their children are there. Hundreds were evacuated to that facility. 
>> Actually, we just saw that gentleman that had been spoken to earlier standing there with with the green shirt and the while baseball cap. You can see the proximity now from there through the woods over here to the elementary school. That's the path that the children took from the school the to the firehouse when they took cover. You just look the at those parents when we were looking over at the firehouse and elm prasing their children. Not sure at that moment if they realized how lucky they were that they were still able to hold onit to their children after what transpired here. 
>> The shooter as opposed to -- the information we have in regard to the shooter, 20 years old. Killed. Apparently had two guns, and with ties to the school. Not sure what those ties are. Whether they have children at the school or went to that school, but we are waiting the details in regards to that shooter. The second person taken into custody, a man wearing a black jacket and camouflage pants escorted out of the woods by police personnel and handcuffed and taken to the police station possibly with charges against that person. We're awaiting word. 

[01:32:48]


>> Yes, we are. We're also awaiting lou young. We're going to talk to him right now. He has been on the scene, and we'll see what he has, what he's gathered since we last talked to him. Lou. 
>> Rob, we're here on riverside drive he leading up to the school. You see folks come being back here, and now the faces of the people coming back. Early on they were filled with relief because they realized that their loved ones had made it through this horror, but now the depth of the tragedy jus being there in proximity to it is affecting them. We've seen some very, very grief-stricken and affected and tear-streaked faces down the road here. I spoke with maureen care he rinz who was a nurse at danbury hospital who rushed to the scene when she heard about the shooting. He she arrived when the lightly injured people were removed and want upped to do so if they could help others. There were 20 children inside that she was not able to help. All of them dead, and she describes being present when the parents were given the awful news. She is just shattered. Listen. 
>> Reporter: I see you've been crying. 
>> Yes. 
>> Reporter: Is it because of what you saw? 
>> No, they wouldn't let us in the building. One of the cops, you know, the worse thing he'd seen in his entire career, but it was when they told all these parents waiting for children to come out. They thought that they were, you know, still alive. There's 20 parents that were just told that their children are dead. It was awful. 
>> You were unable to do anything? 
>> Right. We kneat one point they asked the ambulances to leave, that they didn't need them, and we knew that that wasn't a go sign. 
>> Reporter: She was crying. Her teenage son was also crying, just having witnessed that outpouring of grief and disbelief, the parents hearing their worst nightmares come true, that their children had been killed. The latest nbers from cbs news, 26 dead total, 18 of them children. A short time ago I'm told that police found two adults alive in the ing in a closet. They stayed hidden and did not move and police found them in the last hour or so. That is a situation here that how desperate the situation was. People hid. People tried to save themselves. People were saved. People witnessed terrible tragedy and terrible loss. This is going to be with this community for a very long . We're liin newtown, connecticut. 

[01:35:34]


>> Have you heard anything about a second suspect being taken into custody in the woods just away from the school there shortly after the incident? 
>> What did you hear? How did you first hear about it? 
>> I got a -- they have a -- it's an alert through the school. Your parents sign up for it. I just got a message saying from the superintendent that there was up an unconfirmed shooting and everybody is in lockdown. 
>> What did you think? 
>> I was like, oh, my gosh. Then I had no idea that it was he school. I'm like -- it just seemed so unreal. My heart is in a million pieces right now for parents and the children and for everybody because it's -- who would ever think in a small town and people -- you know, I mean, the school is locked. 
>> We're going to affiliate wcbs for more information, what they're learning on the ground as well. Let's listen in. 
>> That is what that woman was going through. She showed up ready to do her job, but there was nothing she could do. The people that were able to be helped removed from the scene. She watched in horror and is going home to try and process that. 
>> You're absolutely right, lou. You're absolutely right. That is the worst thing that can happen when you set up the triage to do the first aid, and it's simply he beyond that. We have seen it. 
>> Lou, we understand that there is grief counselors -- there are grief counselors at that firehouse now to deal with this unimaginable tragedy. 
>> Reporter: Yeah. I mean, I'll always hear that grief counselors. I'm not sure what you can say to a parent in a situation like that. I don't know what that's like. I hope I never have to find out firsthand, but there are professionals who are standing by trying to walk these people through the initial processes of this crushing grief that they must be feeling, and especially at this time of year, especially children, especially the location, the incon gruts of it all is staggering. 

[01:38:03]


>> Lou young, thanks so much. Mystery, mystery, who is this 20-something-year-old pearl with ties to the school who would perpetrate such an act. 
>> The numbers cbs news has confirmed, at least 26 are dead, at least 18 of them are children. We're hearing of those parents who went to reunite with their children at the firehouse and were told their children were killed. 20 parents were at the firehouse to get that information, 18 children killed, mothers, fathers there. We saw so many reunite, embrace as their children ran to them as we look at video from earlier as parents were taking their children away from the firehouse. They had been evacuated from the school under state police protection after those gunshots were fired just after 9:30 this morning. We're looking at pictures of parents and their children as they are headed home. Maybe some of them not knowing the severity of the situation. Others knowing this. This was a little earlier on the scene just outside the firehouse. So the latest information we have in regard to those involved with this shooting. We have a 20-year-old shooter that we know died at the scene, and a second suspect is in custody. Not sure of the involvement with the shooting, but we also got word that a man did comeut of the woods in hdcuffed escorted by police wearing camouflage and looking into one parent's eyes and said I did not do it. That person is at a police station being questioned at this house and possibly facing charges. 
>> That was according to a witness on the scene who actually saw the police, he says, taking this person out and claiming his innocence, professing his innocence. 
>> Twomi-automatic handguns were retrieved from the scene. We heard from some witnesses that said that they heard dozens of rounds, possibly 100 rounds being fired inside that school. There are several buildings inside that school, some children were in the gym. They could hear the gunfire. Others were in their classrooms, and we heard a story of two young girls, possibly first graders, who saw the gunman go into their classroom and shoot their teacher. 

[01:40:32]


>> Stay tuned for the very latest. 
>> Good afternoon, everyone. My name is roy occhiogrosso. I work for governor malloy. As you can imagine, the governor is horrified by what's happened. He is meeting with the families right now. His chief concern is to get the families the information they need as quickly as possible. That's why he's not here. I'm going to introduce lieutenant paul vance from the state police who will talk a little bit about what's known so far. We understand you are all interested in information. We'd like to get you that information as quickly as possible, but the governor's chief concern is making sure that the families have information as quickly as possible and that's why he is now. This is lieutenant paul vance from the state police. 
>> Good afternoon. I will give you some very basic and brief information as we know it now. We will set up regular press briefings as appropriate. Just after 9:30 this morning newtown police received a 911 call for an emergency at the elementary school. Newtown pd upon obtaining information as to the situation contacted to the connecticut state police andequested assistance. On and off duty troopers responded to the school, and request newtown police immediately upon arrival entered the school and began a complete active shooter's search of the building. That included checking every door, every crack, every crevice, every portion of the school. Our main objective was to evacuate as quickly and efficiently as possible any and all students and faculty in the school. The entire school was searched. That was accomplished. A staging area was set up. The student and staff were put into that staging area, and soon thereafter the children and staff were reunited with parents and loved ones. There were several fatalities at the scene, both students and staff. There's no information relative to that that's being released at this time until we have made complete and proper notification. The shooter is deceased inside the building. There's a great dealf work that is undertaken immediately upon locating the shooter, and that is there's a great deal of search warrant activity, there's a great deal of law enforcement activity both in and out of state to ensure we cover all the bases relative to that specific individual. Suffice it to say the scene is secure. The state police major crime squad and newtown police department, danbury state's attorney and many agencies are working together to answer all the questions surrounding exactly what happened. We will keep you briefed and informed on a regular basis and put everything out via our website with these press conferences. I'll turn it back over to him right now. 

[01:43:39]


>> The governor took a call from president obama a little while calling to express his condolences and on behalf of the nation and to assist the families and assist in the investigation. We will get you information as soon as we can get the families the information. That's where the governor is. At some point later today the governor will be here, and we will set up regular briefings. Thank you. 
>> Just getting the very latest update there. A word from lieutenant paul vance as well as roadway ochogrossi. He's a spokeman for the governor office. 
>> We'll come back for another briefing as quickly as we can. 
>> Reporter: You can say the public is not in danger? 
>> That's correct. 
>> Reporter: Everything here, all the briefings here? 
>> Right here. 
>> A final word. The public is not in danger, that the site has been secured. We want to go over just some of the things we have learned. Not a lot of detail here. Certainly there are various and mixed conflicting reports on the number of fatalities from various networks. N can only confirm that as many as 20 people have been killed in this school shootin of those -- okay. I've got a cnn producer on the phone I'm told with some information. David, what can you tell us? 
>> Hi, suzanne. I'm right out in front of the elementary school right now. This wooded areas that basically surrounds the school, and parents are walking in and out of this firehouse used as a makeshift shelter in which they're tending those injured and ushering those away by way of ambulances. There's about four ambulances on the scene here. I've spoken to a number of the parents, and apparently what transpired was that earlier this morning many of them received an automatedschool from the school superintendent indicating there was a shooting. It wasn't clear which school at that point shooting occurred, so many of them panic stricken ran to their nearest schools where some of the loved ones are held. Several have since emerged. Some are almost inconsolable how upset they were. One woman came walking up the street screaming why, why? Not indicating what happened. Others were clutching their children and taking them away from the school as fast as they could. That's the scene here. One of heavy security. We've got atf, fbi, several law enforcement officers that are basically clad in tactical gear with weapons drawn and wielding assault rifles and all the while you have parents streaming in and out of this area clutching their children and basically just trying to get away from the scene. It's a media circus in which many of the reporters here trying to get a sense of what has happened. But most parents are just essentially looking to get as far away from the scene as possible. We heard that the governor is meeting with the families, the parents of those whose children have been killed. Have you gotten a sense of where the governor, where parents are on the scene where you are and whether or not you've seen some parents who have received the devastating news? 

[01:47:21]


>> Reporter: We have. Most of the parents that are stricken with some of that devastating news, that more fatal news are holed up in that firehouse. There are at least several dozen people inside, several parents on occasion you'll see people coming out and sort of almost inconsolable as I mentioned before. It seems that that firehouse continues to be sort of the safehouse as authorities in the region really start to try to pin down this area. Well, it doesn't seem to be as active a scene as it did earlier. They're still going house to house, still checking buildings. It's not clear this is an entirely secure scene. That said you have parents like I mentioned before really trying to get as far away as possible. 
>> David, what are those parents saying. They were alerted there was a shooting that took place. Are these parents satisfied that they got information in a timely way? Are they despondent or confused? 
>> I think you hit it on the head there. Despondent would be the operative word right now. It's clearly one of a parent's most feared prospects here, of getting news of this sort, particularly while they're at work, that their children are in harm's way. Most of the parents, the few that we actually got a chance to speak to, were just relieved that their children were all right. The resounding feeling that one really gets from being down here is sort of a sense of not knowing what transpired and what may continue to be transpiring. It's not clear this is an entirely secure scene. At the same time it's one of those things that it really, really can't be put into words how terrible this must be for some family members. So as their sort of wiping tears away from their eyes talking into cell phones with family members and friends recanting a seen they witnessed inside the firehouse and talking with children who had to be huddled into classrooms as accomplice and teachers huddled them towards the back of the room as this shooting took place. It's just -- it's a scene of shock, dismay and it's not clear what's going to happen next. 

[01:49:39]


>> David, it's kind of hard sometimes to gauge, you know, what kids are going through and what they're feeling at the time. We've seen some children who have described what they saw. What do you get from some of the children who have left with their parents? 
>> Reporter: I talked to one parent with a child. For obvious reasons those parents don't want to have their children speaking particularly after an incident like this, but in many of the -- it seems at least from what this child was saying that many of the children here don't really have a good sense of what transpired today. It was scary. It was frightening for many of them. And this little girl I spoke to was saying that many, many people in her classroom were crying as they were huddled into the back room of this school building. She was in a third grade class, actually, as police barged in. And teachers just tried to in a sense get a good sense of what was happening and tried to protect them. What is confusing for them, and probably understandably so. What really happens next for them, I'm sure the parts are going to go home and try to explain as best they can. You talk to parents here and they really say their heart goes out to those who may still be holed up in the firehouse trying to come to terms with what has happened. 
>> David, there have been so many different reports about how many people have been injured or killed. I would imagine that would be very,frustrating for people on the ground who just don't understand the magnitude, they don't know just how significant this is. Is there a sense that people just want more information? 
>> I think that's the driving thing here. Everybody is looking for more information. You have all these different groups working together, you have fbi that is here, the atf, state and local police. And you know there is a sense of trying to get a handle on the situation. At the same time, it is not clear who this person was, if there was just one person, whether that theres still a danger out there. I understand there is -- authorities will be holding a press conference in short order to maybe answer some of those questions. But, you know, a scene like this is really probably leaves more unanswered questions than we could ever get. How a shooting could occur inside an elementary school is just -- you know, it is just one of those things that -- you cover these stories, it's -- you are always left with those questions of why this took place. And there is really no sense of answers that could really ever satisfy that question it seems. But many people here on the ground, particularly authorities, are trying to secure the area, make sure that there is not another individual around, and essentially work to console those family members who may have lost people today. 

[01:52:36]


>> I know it's hard and you never really get over the kind of shock and the kind of emotion that people experience in this kind of episode. I covered columbine and you really don't think these kinds of things will take place, and then they take place time and time again. David, really quickly if you can, paint a picture if you will of the community, who are they, what are they like. 
>> Well, this town is, I'd say, probably an hour's drive north of new york city and sort of a sleepy new england town. And you have, you know, it's really pretty suburban town in which, you know, tonight's wooded areas surrounding this school, and the thing you hear from parents and from community members is that how could this happen here? How could this happen in this sleepy little town where, you know, it's filled with just sort of these picturesque scenes of what you would imagine of a new england town, antique shops along roadways and ironically a cemetery, an old cemetery dating BACK TO THE 1800s SITS ON A Roadway overlooking -- overlooking the school itself. So the question of why and why here is omnipresent. 
>> David, thank you very much. Really appreciate your reporting and obviously you've been talking to a lot of families and it is just devastating for that community and for all of us to see what haspired today. Meredith artily spoke with us earlier and she actually talked with a witness who was inside of the school. 
>> She was in a meeting this morning, she said around 9:30, 9:35. And she -- there were about seven people in the room, and it was a meeting regarding one of her kids, she has children at the school. And she volunteers at the school as well. And she heard -- she described it as pop, pop, pop in the hall and they all heard it. Seven people in meeting room. They heard that sound in the hall. And they -- she said three people went out into the hall, the principal, the vice principal and the school psychologist. And to hear her describe it, she said three people went out into the hall and only one -- only one person came back, which was the vice principal, she said, who was shot in the leg or the foot who came crawling back. 5p AND SHE SAID THAT SHE COWHERED Under the table during that moment and called 911 as did the other people in the room. She said she never saw the shooter, that she was, you know, she was under the table, that the shooting happened in the hallway, and to hear her describe it, she said there was -- there must have been a hundred rounds. And I asked her to clarify that, I said really truly, a hundred rounds and she said at least. 

[01:55:37]


>> When the vice principal came crawling back, what happened at that point? What did she say? How did the vice principal manage to move or escape, can you -- did she describe what was the situation as he was crawling back? 
>> She described -- she said that -- she said there was confusion, there was yelling and understandably, she said there was yelling in the hallway, and she couldn't tell for a while if it was the police or the shooter. I talked to her, she was still inside the school, the school is on lockdown. So she couldn't tell -- she didn't know if the shooter was dead yet or still there. 
>> What did the vice principal look like when she saw him return? 
>> I didn't hear her describe that. She said, you know, she said, listen, this is a nice town, this is a nice school, these are the kind of things that don't happen there, she noted this was not some high powered meeting, it was, you know, about my -- about one of my children who was in second grade there. And she, you know, she was tearful. Just understandably panicked. And she said they marched at some point, I don't have the length of time, but she said some point after the shooting they marched us out in the hallway, right past the two bodies laying in the hallway in a pool of blood. 
>> Cnn has learned at least 20 people have been killed, ten of them children. Want to bring in our john king out of washington, who has more information. John, what are you learning? 
>> Reporter: Suzanne, I've been speaking to a federal law enforcement official here in washington who is getting information directly from the scene. State police on the scene, fbi officials on the scene, in connecticut, this so cautioning that as you know in these situations the numbers almost always change. But the official tells us he's now seeing consistent reporting from the scene that there are morfatalities, most are children. And expect the numbers to ge, but he is now seeing consistent reports of the death toll being closer to 30 than to 20. He's hearing a number consistent, he says 26, 27, but doesn't trust that yet. Said he believes the number will be closer to 30 than 20. Also says that from reporting from the scene from law enforcement officials there, both state and federal, suzanne, that the shooter is dead, would not give any details on how the shooter was -- whether the shooter killed himself or killed by police at the scene but says the shooter has a direct connection to the school, would not describe for me at this early point of the investigation what that connection is. 

[01:58:17]


>> So he wasn't able to say whether or not that connection was a parent or a -- or an employee of the school at the time? 
>> Reporter: He knows that information, has that information from the scene, but was not willing to discuss it at this point, says it is very sensitive at the moment, wants to defer of the release of the most sensitive information to the authorities on the scene, because, as you know, we're hearing from other correspondents that they're going to houses, known houses, friends, associates and the like, as the investigation unfolds. There are some things they want to keep private at the moment. 
>> Lieutenant paul vance said he was actually -- they didn't give the numbers, the fatality numbers there, still in the process of notifying some of the families. Your authorities are saying they're not putting out those exact numbers until they get a real handle on being able to reach some of those parents and let them know what is going on. 
>> Reporter: That's exactly right. They also want to go through every last nook and cranny of the school unfortunately to make sure that there is no other fatalities inside and also no other people who might be hiding inside. And they say the governor of connecticut and state police on the scene have urged everyone not to give a firm fatality number just yet until they make sure that all of the families have been specifically notified. And all of the families have received official word. But, again, the source I'm speaking to has for several hours been getting reports directly from the scene, and he says consistently those reports say the number of dead, closer to 30 than to 20, and sadly most of them are children. 
>> And, john, does he have a sense of when we might be able to learn exactly what that number, that final number is going to be? Does he have a sense this might be hours away we'll learn this news? 
>> He believes it will be sometime this afternoon. He believes they are settled pretty closely on a number at the scene, but they want to do two things. Number one, have the governor

Sweep of that school to make sure they have looked everywhere. 
>> All right, thank you very much, john, appreciate it. Witnesses and parents, they're starting to talk about how this is all unfolding. Their own periences, really, the emotions just pouring out and you can't believe the kind of tragedy they're feeling. These are some of the folks this is what they're telling us. I want to bring them in. 
>> You've been crying. 
>> Yes. 
>> Is it because of what you saw? 
>> No, they wouldn't even let us in the building. All I can say is that one of the cops that, you know, the worst thing he had ever seen in his entire career, but it was when they told the parents, all the parents were waiting for their children to come out, they thought they were, you know, still alive. And there is 20 parents that were just told their children are dead. It was awful. 
>> And you were unable to do anything. 
>> Right. We knew at one point they asked the ambulances to leave, that they didn't need them and we knew that wasn't a good sign. 
>>> I'm wolf blitzer in washington. We're continuing our breaking news coverage of a dramatic, horrific story, unfortunately, unfolding in connecticut right now. In newtown, connecticut, at a small elementary school. The sandy hook elementary school. For those of you who arjust tuning in, we are now getting numbers, our own john king reporting, quoting law enforcement sources as saying at least 20, but perhaps closer to 30 individuals, many of them children, have been killed in this incident. Individual suspect, a 20-year-old, is -- the suspect, the shooter is a 20-year-old. Law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation telling our susan candiotti, that suspect, we believe, is dead right now. You just heard police at a small briefing, didn't provide a lot of information, but they did tell us the area now appears to be secure, but this has been a horrific, horrific mass killing at an elementary school in connecticut. A school for kids from kindergarten through fourth grade. We're watching all of this unfold. Lisa procachini is on the phone right now. She's a parent of an 8-year-old at the school, the sandy hook elementary school. Your 8-year-old is fine, I take it, lisa. Tell us what happened. Walk us through what you saw and what you heard. 

[00:02:38]


>> Well, I had a call from one of the teachers who was with my daughter at the time. And locked themselves in a bathroom. They kept my child calm, and told her it was just some hammering going on. And this is all what my daughter told me what happened. Next thing you know, the police came in and they, I gu knocked on the door and let the students -- my daughter and her teacher out and as my daughter is walking out, she did see blood and glass. And that's what her -- as much as she saw, that's what she saw. And I got a call from a teacher who was wonderful enough to give me a call and let me know my daughter was safe. 
>> And she's home with you right now. 
>> Yes. 
>> And how is she dealing with this? I assume this has been a pretty traumatic experience for her. 
>> I don't really think she gets it right now. I don't -- I don't think she understands how serious things are. I'm kind of even numb to the fact of what has gone on. I'm just in a state of shock, still. So, you know, I think time will tell. I just don't know how I'm going to handle having her know all the, you know, the whole situation. So -- 
>> your little 8-year-old has been a student at this school, sandy hook elementary school, what, since kindergarten. So you presumably knew a lot of the teachers and the principal as well, right? 
>> Yes, I did. She was -- 
>> tell us about the principal. 
>> She was a wonderful, beautiful person. She's pretty new with the school. And you couldn't ask for a better principal. She's very warm, and personable. And she is always making you feel comfortable about your child at the school. 

[00:04:45]


>> Did you -- in your wildest imagination, and I know this is a tough situation, lisa, could you ever imagine a mass shooting in connecticut in your small town, not far away from danbury? Did it ever cross your mind something like this could happen? 
>> Well, no. But, however, it is happening so much that, you know, it is those towns that you would least suspect it happening that it is happening to. And why is it happening so much and what are we going to do in the future for other schools? How are we going to stop this? 
>> What do you think? What do we need to do? 
>> I wish I knew the answer to that. You know, just having the principals, teachers, more aware, more equipped perhaps with things. I don't -- you know, I'd like to see something like that take place. 
>> It is a horrific -- 
>> the children to be safe. 
>> Lisa, thank god your little girl, your 8-year-old girl is okay, with you, at home, lisa joining us on the phone. Good luck dealing with all of this, obviously. A horrific, horrific situation. Just a little while ago, one of the young students at the school spoke out and said this. 
>> I was in the gym at the time. And so the teacher -- we hear lots of bangs and we thought that it was the custodian knocking stuff down. We heard screaming. And so we -- we went to the wall, and we sat down and then a police came in and is like, is he in here, and he ran out, and our teacher, when somebody yelled get to a safe place, so we went to the closet in the gym and we sat there for a little while. And then the police were knocking on the door and they're, like, we're evacuating people, we're evacuating people. So we ran out, there is police at every door, they're leading us down this way, down this way, quick, quick, come on. And we ran down to the firehouse, and there was a man pinned down to the ground with handcuffs on. And we thought that was the victim. We really didn't get a good glance at him because he was -- there was a car blocking it. Plus we were running really quick. So then we got to the firehouse and we sat in our classes and we were all really happy that we were all alive. 

[00:07:36]


>> Hard to believe this could happen in newtown, connecticut, not far from danbury, connecticut, a small elementary school, a few hundred kids in there, kindergarten through fourth grade. The police chief spoke to reporters a little while ago and said this. 
>> I will give you some very basic and brief information as we know it now. And we will set up regular press briefings as appropriate. Just after 9:30 this morning, newtown police received a 911 call for an emergency at th elementary school. Newtown pd upon obtaining information as to the status of the situation contacted the connecticut state police and requested assistance from state police and surrounding police departments. On and off troopers responded to the school and with newtown police immediately upon arrival entered the school and began a complete, active shooter search of the building. That included checking every door, every crack, every crevice, every portion of that school. Our main objective was to evacuate as quickly and as efficiently as possible any and all students and faculty in the school. The entire school was searched. That was accomplished, a staging area was set up, students and staff were put into that staging area. And soon there after the children were -- and staff were reunited with parents and loved ones. There were several fatalities at the scene. Both students and staff. There is no information relative to that that is being released at this time until we made complete and proper notification. The shooter is deceased inside the building. There is a great deal of work that is undertaken immediately upon locating the shooter and that is there is a great deal of search warrant activity, great deal of law enforcement activity, in and out of state, to be sure we cover all the bases relative to that specific individual. Suffice it to say the scene is secure. The state police major crimes squad and newtown police department, danbury state attorney and many agencies are working together to answer all the questions surrounding exactly what happened. As mr. Occhiogrosso said, we'll keep you briefed, we'll keep you informed on a regular basis, we'll put everything out via our website and with the press conferences. 

[00:09:54]


>> That was the police chief in newtown, connecticut. Law enforcement source close to the investigation tells our own susan candiotti that the suspect who is deceased is a 20-year-old. We don't know the precis connection, the relationship he may have had with the small elementary school. We are working that. Susan candiotti will be joining us momentarily. She's with us right now. You're on the scene, susan. Update us on what you know. 
>> Reporter: Well, wolf, the latest information we have now, and I didn't hear your earlier reports just now, but is that the death toll is now rising. Earlier we had heard that it was about 20 people, now we're hearing the number of fatalities of adults and children is closer to 30. And 18 to 20 of those dead are children, wolf. We're hearing also that the dead shooter in this case, already DEAD, IS SOMEONE IN HIS 20s, WE Do know according to the state police, they announced the news conference, that the search warrant is being executed at that suspected shooter's home. The shooter has been identified to me by a source as ryan lanza, IN HIS 20s, APPARENTLY, WE'RE Told, from the source, from this area however that has not been confirmed by the state police who did say that a search warrant is being executed at this time. Just a horrific day here in newtown, connecticut, athis as this community is coming to grips with this terrible massacre, wolf. 
>> So ryan lanza, you know the spelling of his last name, susan? 
>> Ryan. It is ryan. I don't know whether you said brian, but ryan lanza with an r, EXACTLY IN HIS 20s. We're still trying to find out more information, get confirmed information about what connection he may have if any to the school, and we do know that would be standard operating procedure, that police would be actively searching his home for any clues as to what may have allegedly led him to this. We do know, according to another source, that at least two weapons were recovered from his body, which was discovered in a classroom. We do not know whether he took his own life or whether he was shot by police or in some other way. Those two weapons described to me as a glock and a six haur and we don't know the caliber of weapons, but we heard multiple shots were fired. Eyewitnesses talk about that as well. And they are still conducting searches throughout the school. You heard authorities say they're satisfied that there are no other victims inside that school. We do not know the numbers of those wounded. 

[00:12:37]


>> They say the area is now secure. Though the horrific scene obviously needs to be investigated thoroughly. Just to recap, closer to 30 confirmed dead now, susan, based on your reporting. 18 to 20 of them children. We don't know how many individuals, children, adults, were injured. We do know that several were taken to nearby hospitals, especially in danbury, connecticut. Is all that correct, susan? 
>> Reporter: That's correct. That's correct. And, of course, counseling services are already being made available to the surviving children and adults who have gone through this terrible experience as they try to wrap their arms around what happened. Imagine all these young children as well as adults who heard gunfire, who were hurried out of the school, just as soon as police said it was safe for them to do so. While police conducted a thorough search of that school. They said they're satisfied that that school has been cleared. However, they still need all the additional information to try to find out what led to the shooting, precisely who this shooter is and what may have led to this. Wolf? 
>> And where this shooter got those two weapons that were used in this mass murder at this elementary school. Susan, stand by for a second. I want our viewers to listen to what a nurse who rushed to the scene to help, what she just said. 
>> I see you've been crying. 
>> Yes. 
>> Is it because of what you saw? 
>> No, they wouldn't even let us in the building. All I can say is that one of the cops said, you know, the worst thing he had ever seen in his entire career. But it was when they told the parents, all these parents were waiting for their children to come out, they thought that they were, you know, still alive. And those 20 parents that were just told that their children are dead. It was awful. 
>> And you were unable to do anything. 
>> Right. We knew at one point they asked the ambulances to leave, that they didn't need them, and we knew that wasn't a good sign. 

[00:14:47]


>> Alexis, you told me you were sitting in class this morning, and you saw a lot of police. Tell me how you found out what was going on. 
>> Well, we found, like, there was all these people, and we found because it was right near the window in our classroom, and, like, we saw, like, police officers and we heard them on the roof and in our building. 
>> Was everybody crying, scared, wanting their parents to come get them? 
>> Yeah. They were. And then some people were even, like, they kind of felt they got a stomach ache. 
>> Did you hear any gunshots or anything like that? 
>> Well, the police officers, like, they were -- they were kind of, because they were police officers, like right out the door trying to find the guy. 
>> What a horrific scene indeed, just to recap. The shooter in this case, the suspected gunman identified now as ryan lanza. IN HIS 20s. That according to a law enforcement source who told that to cnn, the shooter died at the scene. We don't know the circumstances on how he died. We're working those details as well. We do know that the president of the united states, president obama, has been briefed on what is going on right now. He wants to get a firmer grasp on what is going on before he speaks out publicly according to our white house correspondent brianna keilar. But he will be making a statement, jessica yellin, our chief white house correspondent, does tell us. I think based on our reporting the president wants to wait until the governor of connecticut has actually spoken up on this issue, the white house anxious to get information, the president has been fully briefed on what we know right now. And, remember, a lot of times in a situation like this, a developing situation, some of the initial information proves to be inaccurate, so we want to be as precise as we possibly can be. Based on our reporting from susan candiotti, though, who is now on the scene in newtown, connecticut, close to 30 people are dead. Of them, 18 to 20 children at that sandy hook elementary school. Susan candiotti is still with us. Susan, parents who have rushed to that school, especially those parents who are getting the awful news about their kids, do you know where they are, how this is being handled? 

[00:17:11]


>> Reporter: Well, I know that when the children were first led from the school, and this was after police said they had searched every crack and crevice, they said, of the school, to make sure that it was safe to evacuate the children, they were led, some of them in lines and maybe you've seen pictures or videotape of this, with the small children, we're talking about kindergarten to fourth grade, placing one child on the shoulders in front of them and being led to a nearby firehouse which is used as a staging area where they had adults who had already begun to try to comfort these children, and use that space as some place for parents to go to be reconnected, reunited with their children. We know that some of the parents told us they found out about this, the news media, but others quickly got information via their text phone, or e-mails, something that they could sign up for to receive immediate messages from the school, which is common place these days. We also know, wolf, that after the school was cleared, police and investigators continue to look through the area, to make sure that, in fact, there might not be a second shooter involved. They had isolated one car in particular, but were continuing to walk down the street and search and look at other vehicles, other buildings in that area. Also, according to a source, we know that someone else was being questioned, who was not being called a suspect at this time, but someone else is being questioned in connection with this investigation. That's all we have on that for now. However, the state police do say that they have an active search, we presume they mean a search warrant being conducted at the home of the dead shooter. Wolf? 
>> And the dead shooter came in not only with two weapons, but also with armor, I take it, right? Is that the information you're getting, this ryan lanza, in his 20s, WHO IS DEAD, BUT HE CAME IN With not only weapons, but with armor? Is that rit? 

[00:19:17]


>> Reporter: Well, there are reports to that extent. I don't have that confirmed information, but some people are reporting that at this time. We're calling those unconfirmed reports right now. 
>> Stand by. I brie anner keeler our white house correspondent. The president will make a statement to the american people. What do you know? What is going on over there? 
>> He's been receiving regular updates from his homeland security team, specifically this morning. He was first briefed of the situation in connecticut at 10:30 a.M., His homeland security adviser john brennan alerted him as to the developments. And he since has been receiving regular updates according to the white house spokesman jay carney. We do know, wolf, he's expected to address this, to actually come out before the cameras, perhaps, and give some sort of statement to speak to this. He's been in touch with the governor of connecticut. He's been in touch with his fbi director. The white house has been waiting to get a firmer grasp on the facts. As you know, it is a very fluid situation and the president certainly wants to know he has a firm grasp on the facts of the case, what is going on before he addresses the nation, wolf. 
>> It looks like this may be the worst mass killing at a school in u.S. History, based on the information I'm getting over here. Columbine high school, littleton, colorado, back in 1999, dylan klebold and eric harris killed 12 fellow students and oer before committing suicide in the school library. In this case, john king reporting close to 30, we believe, are now dead. And 18 to 20 of them chldren, if those numbers hold up. This looks like it could be the worst mass killing in american history, something no one anticipated would be happening at any point, but listen to the white house press secretary jay carney speak about this, just a little while ago. 

[00:21:26]


>> The president was notified by his homeland security adviser, john brennan, of the shooting in newtown, connecticut, at a school. The president is receiving regular updates as more information becomes available about this incident. And as the day proceeds, if we get more information and as we get more information, we'll certainly provide it to you. Do not have anything to confirm for you at this point. The fbi is supporting state law enforcement, which has the lead as well as local law enforcement as they respond to and begin to investigate this incident. And as I said, the president will receive regular updates as the day progresses. 
>> Jay carney, the white house press secretary, the president going to have to deal with this mass killing in newtown, connecticut, sandy hook elementary school. Other presidents have dealt with tragedies like this one. This president certainly is getting ready to deal with it in in an address to the bmerican people. Give us a perspective on what is going on behind the scenes over there at the white house. 
>> Reporter: It is something the president has already dealt with in -- I don't want to say in a similar situation, wolf, because obviously every tragedy is different, but following the shooting of congresswoman giffords, and following the terrible shooting at the movie theater in colorado, these were points in time where president obama, as other presidents before him, had to step in and give a unified message and certainly a voice of sympathy and understanding for the people who are affected by a shooting like this. You covered virginia tech. I was there as well. That was something where we saw then governor caine and president george bush come in as voices because in a tragedy like this, obviously, there are a lot of questions that are raised. There are a lot of concerns that are raised in that sort of -- that's one of the roles of the president in a situation like this, to try to speak to that and be a unifying voice. Behind the scenes, we know, wolf, president obama is being regularly updated on this. You know, prior to this morning, obviously the concerns were very much surrounding something very different, trying to figure out a deal or trying to figure out where to go with the issue of the fiscal cliff. At this point, obviously, president obama's attentions have been changed, unexpectedly, to how to deal with this shooting in connecticut and exactly grasping -- this is something his team around him is working on, the details of the investigation, obviously. Some of the information will be something that the white house, that the president and his advisers are privy to before members of the public are, wolf. 

[00:24:27]


>> And the president will be making a statement. We don't know exactly when or where. Some place in the white house he'll be speaking out. Are they preparing for that already? We know he wants to -- he wants to hear from the governor first, the governor of connecticut. 
>> Reporter: Let me tell you that, because I reported that, that he was waiting to hear from the governor. I'm now told by the same senior administration official that i spoke with before that he may not be waiting for the governor to speak first because he's had this phone conversation with governor malloy. It is entirely possible that president obama comes out and makes a statement before the governor. I think that may be an indication that perhaps the timeline could be moved up, but beyond what it was before, but at this point, it is very fluid. It doesn't appear to be set and it is certainly not public as to when the president will make a statement, wolf. 
>> We'll stand by, have coverage obviously of that. And we have been told by the governors aid, one of the governor's aids that he is meeting with families, trying to console them. He's on the scene. At some point the governor, dannel malloy will be speaking as well. David arioso is on the scene. From your advantage point, david, tell us what you're seeing. 
>> I'm right outside the firehouse being used as a makeshift shelter for which family members, including parents and children, are holed up. You do see parents [alking back and forth on a wooded stretch that leads up toward the school, oftentimes clutching their children, clutching each other, talking on cell phones and almost all the while they're teary eyed. Most people won't speak with us, we did get a chance to speak to one little girl, an 8-year-old, third grader, who was inside the school when all this transpired. Police essentially barged in, the teachers barged in and ordered them to hide in the classroom. They were all crying as police and authorities tried to figure out what the situation was, what the crisis was. And essentially their parents were informed by an automated phone call that there had been a shooting at a school. They didn't indicate which school, and so many of the parents here in the region frantically flocked to the schools where they had children attending. This particular parent I spoke to was frantic, arrived here at the school and fortunately found her daughter unharmed. So when we met up with her, she was clutching her, throwing this oversized coat around her as they walked up the road and away from the school. And it is really one of those scenes, wolf, that you really just can't put your finger on and ask enough questions as to why all this transpired. The community here is still very much in shock. There are questions not only of what actually transpired in terms of the details, but why someone would do this. A lot of tears here in this town, sort of the sleepy new england town, about an hour north of new york city. 

[00:27:28]


>> About 60 miles or so, not far away from new york city as well, much closer to danbury, connecticut. David, hold on for a moment. Mary snow is in newtown as well, outside the suspect's home, what are you seeing over there, mary? 
>> We're being kept far back from the suspect's home. The police have cordoned off this area. There are multiple law enforcement vehicles lined up and residents, wolf, are being kept away from their homes as well and looking at a car, a line of vehicles lined up of residents who are told they cannot go to their homes because police tape has been put up. And there are more than a dozen law enforcement vehicles here. 
>> The suspect, mary, now deceased, died at the scene, we don't know the circumstances surrounding that, ryan lanza, in HIS 20s. Are you getting any information at all if he had a direct connection to the sandy hook elementary school, where this mass killing took place? 
>> Not as yet. And I have to tell you, wolf, we approached some of the residents here. They're so shaken to the core as you can imagine. One woman filling up with tears saying there are so many small children in this area, that she couldn't really bring herself to talk to us when I asked her about the lanzas and their connection. We don't have any information just yet from here about any connection to the school. 
>> Mary, we're going to check back with you. Mary snow is not far away from the suspect's home in newtown, connecticut. RYAN LANZA IN HIS 20s, DIED AT The scene. One of our cnn executives, meredith artily, has been on the scene as well and she spoke with an eyewitness. Listen to this. 
>> She conveyed to me that she was in a meeting this morning, said it was around 9:30, 9:35, and she -- there were about seven people in the room, and it was a meeting regarding one of her kids, she has children at the school. And she volunteers at the school as well. And she heard -- she described it as a pop, pop, pop in the hall. And they all heard it. There was seven people in the meeting room. They heard the sound in the hall. And they -- she said three people went out into the hall, the principal, the vice principal and the school psychologist. And to hear her describe it, she said three people went out into the hall, and only one -- only one person came back, the vice principal, she said, who was shot in the leg or the foot, who came crawling back. And she said that she cowered under the table during that moment, and called 911. As did the other people in the room. She said she never saw the shooter, that she was, you know she was under the table, that the shooting happened in the hallway. And to hear her describe it, she said there must have been 100 rounds. And I asked her to clarify that, I said, really, truly, 100 rounds, she said at least. 

[00:30:44]


>> When the vice principal came crawling back, what happened at that point? What dd she say? How did the vice principal manage to move or escape? Did she describe what was the situation as he was crawling back? 
>> She described -- she said that -- she said there was confusion there was yelling and understandably, she said there was yelling in the hallway, and she couldn't -- she couldn't tell for a while if it was the police or the shooter it. When I talked to her, she was still inside the school, the school was on lockdown she didn't know if the shooter was dead yet or still there. 
>> What did the vice principal look like? When she saw him return? 
>> I didn't -- I didn't hear her describe that. She said, you know, she said, listen, this is a nice town, this is a nice school, these are the kind of things that don't happen there. She noted this was not some high powered meeting. It was, you know, about my -- about one of my children who was in second grade there. And she -- she was tearful, she's, you know, just understandably panicked, and she said they marched, at some point, I don't have the length of time, but she said at some point after the shooting they marched us out in the hallway, right past the two bodies, laying in the hallway in a pool of blood. 
>> When she talked about the two bodies, is that of the principal and the school psychologist when she said those two had not returned? Are those the two individuals that she -- 
>> that's right. That's right. 
>> And did she say or describe in any way what their conditions looked like when she passed in the hallway? 
>> No, she did not. She did not. She -- we had a short conversation, she is understandably emotional. Those are pretty much the gist of -- that's the gist of our conversation. 

[00:32:53]


>> That conversation, meredith artley, the managing editor of cnn.Com had. We're standing by, we're now told about an hour or so from now the governor of connecticut, dannel malloy, will be making a statement, and answering reporters'questions. We'll, of course, have live coverage of that. We're also getting more information on what has happened, just to update our viewers who may just be tuning in now at the bottom of the hour. Cnn now has been told by law enforcement authorities close to 30 people have been killed, killed in this mass shooting incident in connecticut at the sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. That's not far away from danbury, 60 miles outside of new york city. Of those 30, nearly 30 killed, we're told 18 to 20f them are children. We don't know how many people have been injured. We'r getting more information coming in from eyewitnesses and law enforcement authorities, but right now want to bring in ronald stevens, the executive director of the national school safety center, who deals with school safety all over the country. Puts out protocols, what should be done. When you heard about this, ronald, what did you think? 
>> This was truly tragic that someone would attack the most innocent of all children, particularly with these youngsters being in grades k through 4. A lot of the violence we deal with is with those at the high school level, but truly a tragic and difficult situation for everyone in connecticut. 
>> So what do we do about this kind of -- your job is to make sure our schools, whether little elementary schools, like this one, or middle schools, or high schools, they are safe for parents to drop off their kids, not have to worry about these kinds of incidents. What do you do in the aftermath of this horrific mass murder? 
>> Well, in the aftermath we need to go back and take a look at what did unfold. When you have shooters who are committed to come on to a campus with high powered semiautomatic weapons, there is not a whole lot that can be done when this staff is unarmed and when they attack children who are so young. And oftentimes our elementary schools are the last of the schools to ever get an arms school resource officer or someone like that. This is a tragic reminder of how vulnerable our children continue to be. And, you know, there are just limitations on what the school can do. They need to have good safe, school plans in place. Adequate supervision, but when you have someone who is deranged and comes on the campus like this, it is truly tragic. 

[00:35:39]


>> This is a small school, a kindergarten through fourth grade, less than 600 students attend this sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. Ronald, hold on for a moment. John king is getting more information for us. What are you learning, john? 
>> Reporter: Wolf, I want to pass on some information. This is from a second federal law enforcement source I spoke to in washington, d.C., Getting information from fbi officials on the scene, other federal and state authorities on the scene. This source now saying that 27 is the new, but still preliminary number. They are working off now. They believe 27 killed in this school shooting. They call that number new but preliminary, but there could be additional information. In a breaking news tragedy like this, often the numbers change as the day goes on and mo information becomes available. Of the 27 this source said at least 18, at least 18 of the dead are children at the school today. This source going on to say that information from the scene is the shooter you've been talking about with other reporters was born in 1988, believe he's 24 years ole. That's information from the scene. They believe that is reliable information. And that the shooter who is dead at the scene is, quote, not a stranger to the school, not a stranger to the school. This official said. He also said the shootings, quote, happened relatively quickly and in the same concentrated area of the school. He was not running the halls, meaning not running the halls firing the weapon. So the source, again, I want to reiterate say happened relatively quickly and in the same concentrated area of the school, and, again, this source saying 27 is the number now operating on. You mentioned. We'll hear from the governor shortly, he's asked state police at the scene and others at the scene not to release the firm number until he can speak to all of the families involved, but we're getting at roughly consistent in that area, this source saying 27 is the number they believe. A federal official, a second source I spoke to earlier said he was hearing 26 or 27 and certainly said they are convinced from the reports they're getting from the scene that the number of dead, wolf, closer to 30 than to 20. 
>> Any word at all on injuries? We know local hospitals have received injured students and others. 

[00:37:43]


>> Reporter: I was told by one of the first source earlier that several people were wounded and taken to local hospitals because they were so focused on trying to get the number of fatalities and trying to deal with making sure that they had doubled, triple checked that school, both for evidence and to make sure there were no other bodies, no other people hiding, that in my conversations with the sources, that was their urgent concern. The source I did speak to earlier, this is a little more than an hour ago, the first source said that several people were wounded, did not have any information on the severity of those injuries. 
>> Awaiting word from the governor of connecticut, dannel malloy, also awaiting word from the president of the united states, both, we're told, will be making statements soon. We'll get more information from both the president and the governor. John, stand by. I know you're working your sources, getting more information as well. Brooke baldwin is joining us from the cnn center right now. Brooke, what a horrific, horrific moment. At the beginning, I'm sure like you, when we first heard word of what was going on, we thought, you know, another incident, but then the horrific numbers start coming in and you think of these little kids, kindergarten, first grade, second grade, third grade, fourth grade in a small elementary school like this, and you say, how could this happen? 
>> Exactly. My heart is heavy today and i think many people around cnn, around the nation, around the world, are feeling for these parents, the parents, of course, of the survivors, but I'm thinking particularly of these parents who are sitting in this firehouse, near this school, wondering if one of their children is one of those who is no longer with us. As we continue to watch these pictures and pray and think about this community, this sleepy new england community here in connecticut, I want to bring in victor blackwell, who has been sort of combing through some of the day, as this has been a very fluid story. We have been hearing from little ones, adults, parents, police, it is horrific. 
>> And it is a national tragedy. But as you look at the children, and their parents, you realize this is also a very personal tragedy. A small town, a relatively small school, and these children were just going to school on a normal day. Their parents got a robocall, an automated call there had been a shooting. 

[00:39:58]


>> At a school. 
>> At a school. And then you imagine the feelings, the rush to the school. So we put together from these parents, from the children, from law enforcement this horrific morning in newtown. 
>> When I was getting in my car, I heard sirens going off continuously, car after car after car, some of them were flying up past my house and coming back around again and going to the school. This house is three houses away from the school. 
>> Just after 9:30 this morning newtown police received a 911 call for an emergency at the elementary school. Newtown pd upon obtaining information as to the status of the situation contacted the connecticut state police and requested assistance from state police and surrounding local police departments. 
>> We saw a police officer and we heard them on the roof and in our building. 
>> Did you hear any gunshots or anything like that? 
>> Well, police officers, like, they were kind of, because they're police officers, like, right out the door, like trying to find the guy. 
>> It was shocking. I got the call at work this morning and I can't believe a small town like this would ever have anything like this happen. And to be in an elementary school, it's unheard of. 
>> Doesn't even seem real. It just does not seem like it is even possible. It is like you read it in the paper, see it in the news and you think, my god, that poor fa and then you have something happen so close to home, it's, like, I think I'm still in shock. 
>> I can tell you that first of all, obviously, our hearts and prayers go out to the victims of this terrible incident. Very tragic. Our police are currently working closely with the newtown police department, we have mutual aid agreements in place. Along with the state police that have taken a lead in this investigation. 
>> The scene is secure. The state police major crimes squad and newtown police department, danbury state attorney and many agencies are working together to answer all the questions surrounding exactly what happened. 
>> Was everybody crying, scared, wanting their parents to come get them? 

[00:42:00]


>> Yeah. They were. And then some people were even, like, they kind of felt they got a stomach ache. 
>> A stomach ache. That just puts into context, we're not talking aurora. This is not ft. Hood. This is not virginia tech. This is k through 4, 5 through 9, maybe, and you imagine! That without being maudlin that though that mother of alexis, she said her heart was in a million pieces, when she heard about the shooting, and even up to this moment of all this happening, she doesn't -- she said it doesn't seem real there are still all the parents who will go home today, and possibly, because it is the holiday season, already have the house decorated for the holidays. 
>> The gifts for the kids. 
>> The gifts for the kids not coming home. If that number holds, 27 from john king's sources, that would make this the second deadliest mass shooting and would have been the second deadliest just with the 18 children who were killed today. 
>> It is horrendous. I was -- I covered the -- a couple of itty-bitty kids killed in the amish shooting, but there is no comparison. There is absolutely no comparison as you point out, we're talking kids as young as kindergartners. Wolf blitzer, you have a daughter, I can't begin to imagine. My heart is bleeding for these families right now. 
>> So sad. Everyone around the country, dare I say around the world, our hearts are so filled with sadness right now. And it is only going to get worse as we get more details and just imagine, brooke, once we start seeing the pictures of these dead little kids, it is going to be an awful, awful scene for people in connecticut all over the world, that we will all have to endure and learn some painful lessons from what has just happened. We just got this comment from a young kid who was there on the scene, witnessed what was going on, and said this. 
>> There was, like, police officers, like, down on the roof and there was also in the hallways. 

[00:44:06]


>> What were they kelling you guys? 
>> They didn't really tell us anything. Just keep in the classroom. 
>> They removed you. 
>> They moved them to the firehouse. That's where all the parents and everybody came. 
>> Were all the kids brave like you were? 
>> Some of them were, like, a little scared. But we had to go through it. 
>> How did you know they were scared? 
>> Everybody was, like, crying and stuff. 
>> Ronald stevens is with us, the executive director of the national school safety center. Ronald, we know there are some schools in urban areas, but elsewhere, that have metal detectors at the doorways. Are we going to be seeing more of this now? Should we see more of this now? 
>> It's possible we might see more. But even with metal detectors, things happen so quickly, you can think of the situation at red lake, minnesota, where they had officers and metal detectors at the door and yet the shooter still came in. It is one of those tragedies that is just simply unfathomable, and I don't know of any school in america that would be prepared to handle an assault-like incident that we have been hearing about this morning. 
>> So does that mean we just throw up our hands and say there is nothing we can do? 
>> I don't think it means that. When we start looking into this matter and doing the investigation, I think we're going to find, I will predict we'll find that there were a number of warning signs, in advance, most of the shootings like this reflect that there generally are more than one -- is more than one person involved, and that there were some signals perhaps along the way, but once again, we have such incredible freedom in this country, and yet that comes with enormous responsibility and to even fathom this kind of tragedy visited upon young children of this nature is stunning. 

[00:46:10]


>> It looks like now based on the latest information we're getting, john king reporting 27 dead, 18 or so of them children this mass shooting in newtown, connecticut. We just got this reaction in from a father and a son who were on the scene, the father obviously was rushing there and panicked. Watch this. We don't have it yet. But we're going to get it ready for our viewers. More reaction coming in, ronald stevens still with us, the executive director of the national school safety center. Ronald, is there any advice you want to give to parents who are watching right now? Because kids are in school all over the country. 
>> Well, I would just encourage parents to tell their children that they love them, spend some time with them, try to offer some form of comfort, and just realize how precious they are. I know from my own perspective this morning I saw three of my grandchildren between the same ages, 5 to 9 or 10, in school go away. It is a parent's and administrator's worst nightmare. The administrators say they never thought it would happen here, who experienced this. And parents just don't think it could happen in their communities. But this is a vivid reminder of where our society is today. 
>> We're now told the president will be in the white house in the west wing, he'll go into the press briefing room at 3:15, less than a half an hour from now. 3:15 p.M. Eastern and deliver a statement on this mass killing in connecticut. Listen to this clip. We just got it in, a father and son at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. 
>> It was terrifying. I'm still terrified. I think I'm in shock about it all. I still don't know everything that happened. I know there were some people missing, they have been taken to the hospital. I don't know if everyone has been accounted for. It is terrifying. You know, the -- you rush over here, and you can't get to where you need to go and you have to park down here and walk. I'm glad my son is okay. He seems to be handling it actually pretty good right now. I know my son's teachers have been okay as well. But I've heard other teachers are not okay. 

[00:48:42]


>> Once again, the preliminary reports coming in right now, 27 dead, that number potentially could change. 18 to 20, we're told, children. Others, teachers and others at the small sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. The president of the united states will be speaking on this issue at 3:15 p.M. Eastern from the white house press briefing room. We'll have live coverage of that. We're also awaiting remarks from the governor of connecticut, dannel malloy. Much more coming up. We're following the breaking news, a horrific, horrific story, one of the largest mass killings in a school in the united states, in u.S. History, the story is unfolding right now. running hard, try running four. Fortunately we've got ink. It gives us 5x the rewards on our internet, phone charges and cable, plus at office supply stores. Rewards we put right back into our business. This is the only thing we've ever wanted to do and ink helps us do it. Make your mark with ink from chase. 

[00:51:12]


>>> You are looking at images that we are now multiple hours into this horrific, horrific crime that has happened in this small sleepy new england town of newtown, connecticut. At this elementary school, the call came in to 911 around 9:30 this morning, a gunman walked into this school. The latest number we have, and, again, these are loose numbers, these are preliminary numbers, because let me stress this, police, law enforcement, they want to get the information to the victims' families first, the numbers could change. We're hearing closer t killed at the school. As far as children, little children, kindergarten through fourth gde, somewhere between 18 and 20 children. There is a firehouse, a makeshift shelter for a lot of these families who some of whom have their children, some of whom do not. We were hearing from john king, from some of his federal law enforcement sources, that the SHOOTER, THIS -- IN HIS 20s, Ryan lanza, let me quote this federal law enforcement officer, saying ryan lanza not a stranger to the school, saying that the shootings, quote, happened relatively quickly and in the same concentrated area of the school. He was not running in the halls. We're getting new information. We also know that the president of the united states has spoken with the head of the fbi. He has spoken with the governor of connecticut. He may be speaking shortly. Want to take you to our chief white house correspondent jessica yellin standing by. Jessica, do we have any idea if and when the president will speak? 
>> Hi, brooke, yes. President obama is going to speak at 3:15 p.M. Eastern time. That's about 25 minutes from now. He will come to the press briefing room in the white house and address cameras. And, you know, this is one of the times when the president is really able to really touch a chord. You know he spoke very movingly after the shootings around gabby giffords, the attack on gabby giffords and so many people on her staff, when he said at that time, remember, it is part of our nature to demand an explanation. He said at that time, bad things happen. We have to guard against simple explanations in the aftermath. Already today, the white house press secretary jay carney made clear that this is not a time to talk about political and policy responses, but think about the families and how they are reacting, how they feel in the aftermath and I expect that's what the president will address, both the federal response, federal help, the law rcement, and how the nation will come together to help those families heal. Brooke? 

[00:53:56]


>> Jessica yellin, we'll wait and watch for the president to speak there from the white house briefing room in just about 25 minutes from now. And, wolf blitzer, back to you, but something else that jay carney said earlier today, vis-a-vis the president, the president has two young daughters, he's sympathetic to these parents who, I'm sure, are just absolutely reeling right now. 
>> Yeah. He says those two young daughters of his, sasha and malia, to school every day like millions of other parents do every day, they don't expect what has happened in connecticut to unfold. It is a shocking, shocking story that we're watching. Once again, 3:15, 20 minutes or so from now, 3:15 p.M. Eastern, the president will be in the briefing room, making a statement to the nation. Joining us now on the phone is rabbi praver, a rabbi in the area in connecticut. You're at the firehouse where parents have been brought. Is that right? Tell us what is going on there. 
>> Okay, we're all gathered here at the firehouse. First, we were speaking with the teachersfind out the students who were absent, not absent, and there is another room wher there are parents whose children were taken to the hospital after the shooting. And they're waiting for the governor to return to provide further information about their condition. 
>> Has the governor been inside that firehouse with you, speaking to parents? 
>> Yes. The governor was with us and is coming back at 3:00. 
>> These are parents who may have lost their children, who may have been killed in this incident. Is that what you're -- 
>> yes, that's what I'm saying. Their children were taken to a hospital, and there is a certain amount of children taken to the some of them already, I think, might, well, i don't think they know conclusively, but many of them suspect, you know, that their children were victims, but we're just holding out hope that the injured will, you know, be okay. 

[00:56:16]


>> Rabbi praver, stand by for a moment. Mary snow is outside the suspect's home, we're told, ryan lanza. Mary, tell us what you're learning. 
>> Well, wolf, it is an active crime scene and there is more than a dozen law enforcement vehicles here. We're being kept back from the home. It is cordoned off. We did see an ambulance leave this scene about 15 minutes ago. And neighbors have been told to -- that they can't go back into their homes. One neighbor I spoke with said that around 11:00, police came and told her to evacuate right away. She said she was back an hour later, where police escorted her to her home, but she was told again to leave and there is no indication of when these residents are going to be allowed back into their home, in terms of what people are saying about the lanzas, I only found one neighbor so far who knows of the family. She did not want to be named but the only thing she would tell me is that there were two brothers, and she described them as troubled. But didn't want to go any further than that. But that is the scene. And it is a beautiful new england town, very quiet road. The houses are set apart from one another. And right now there is yellow police tape, but it is blocking anyone from going through. And the law enforcement vehicles and police are standing guard preventing anybody from getting any further to the house. 
>> Newtown, connecticut, is a population of under2,000 people. It is located in fairfield county, 45 miles southwest of hartford, about 80 miles northeast of new york city. Mary, we'll get back to you. The suspect -- the suspected GUNMAN, RYAN LANZA, IN HIS 20s, Hed at the scene. We don't know the circumstances. We'll be getting more information on that. Joing us now, steve hardy, former police detective, who worked, unfortunately, these kinds of homicides over the years. Walk us through what police are going through right now, steve. 

[00:58:27]


>> Well, first of all, wolf, they certainly already have tended to the wounded, get the injured out of there, secure that area, locate as many witnesses as possible. That school is goingo be closed down for probably a lengthy period of time, while they conduct their investigation. They're going to put the pieces together, in chronological order, see how this happened, was he killed in self-inflicted gunshot or did the teachers and the principal fight back, disarming and possibly killing him? 
>> Now they will go ahead and try to figure out why this happened, why a gunman in his 20s, WENT INTO THIS PARTICULAR School, with weapons, and started killing kids. 
>> Yeah, unfortunately this is the platform that people like this are seeking out, educational institutions, soft targets. If you want to commit a crime like this. Unfortunately we don't have in place right now the mechanism to protect our young and our loved ones. 
>> What should we be doing, steve, as someone who used to work in law enforcement, what should we be doing? 
>> Matter of fact, wolf, back at virginia tech, I re-created virginia tech and how to take that back. We have to educate the teachers. We all -- all of our institutions have plans for something like this, however when it happens, it is beyond comprehension. We have to train our teachers to be able to direct the children, especially at this age, direct them and tell them what to do because they can't act on their own. They defenseless against something like this. It is the adults that have to pick up this process. Our education system, law enforcement, and it has got to go beyond the education department to the president's office becausethe institutions and just imagine what is being planted in people's heads and why they're doing this. 
>> Steve hardy, stand by. We'll continue this conversation. Let me welcome our viewers here in the united states and around the world. We're following breaking news in the united states. I'm wolf blitzer in washington. A horrific mass killing at a small elementary school in newtown, connecticut. Not long ago. And unfolded in the 9:00 a.M. Eastern hour. And now we're beginning to get information that close to 30 people have been killed in this mass killing. In this mass shooting incident, about 18 to 20 of them, we're told, children. Children in this elementary school, kindergarten through fourth grade, under 600 children in this school, outside of danbury, connecticut, newtown, connecticut, small town population under 2,000. A little while ago, and we're going to be hearing from the president of the united states within the next 15 minutes, he'll be making a statement to the nation from the west wing of the white house, the press briefing room there. We'll also be hearing from the governor of connecticut, presumably getting more details. But a little while ago we heard this from the police chief in newtown. 

[01:01:17]


>> I will give you some very basic and brief information as we know it now. And we will set up regular press briefings as appropriate. Just after 9:30 this morning, newtown police received a 911 call for an emergency at the elementary school. Newtown pd upon obtaining information as to the status of the situation contacted the connecticut state police and requested assistance from state police and surrounding local police departments. On and off duty troopers responded to the school and with newtown police immediately upon arrival entered the school and began a complete active shooter search of the building. That included checking every door, every crack, every crevice, every portion of that school. Our main objective was to evacuate as quickly and as efficiently as possible any and all students and faculty in the school. The entire school was searched. That was accomplished. A staging area was set up. The students and staff were put into that staging area and soon thereafter the children and staff were reunited with parents and loved ones. There were several fatalities at the scene. Both students and staff. There is no information relative to that that is being released at this time until we made complete and proper notification. The shooter is deceased inside the building. There is a great deal of work that is undertaken immediately upon locating the shooter and that is there is a great deal of search warrant activity, a great deal of law enforcement activity both in and out of state to ensure we cover all the bases relative to that specific individual. Suffice it to say the scene is secure. The state police major crimes squad and newtown police department, danbury state attorney and many agencies are working together to answer all the questions surrounding exactly what happened. As mr. Occhiogrosso said, we'll keep you briefed, we'll keep you informed on a regular basis. We'll put everything out via our website and with these press conferences. 

[01:03:18]


>> The gunman has been identified as ryan lanza in his 20s. Someone from the town of newtown, mary snow, is now joining us. Mary is outside the suspect's home there. We're getting the first images now from that home. Mary, update our viewers on what you have learned as we await the president of the united states. 
>> Wolf, we are on the road where the lanza home is located and as you can probably see there are police lines behind me. Police are keeping residents out, reporters out. There are more than a dozen law enforcement vehicles here. We did see an ambulance leaving the scene about 15 minutes ago. And what we can tell you from neighbors is this, they say that about 11:00, one neighbor told us police came and told her that they had to evacuate right away, left their home, some people have been able to be escorted back to their homes, but then leaving again. This is an active crime scene, unclear when residents will be able to return to their homes. In terms of what people are saying about ryan lanza, talked to several people here who live in the area, they said they were unfamiliar with the -- 
>> we just lost our connection with mary snow. But we'll reconnect with her. David arioso, one of our cnn producers, is also on the scene. David, where exactly are you in newtown? 
>> Wolf, I'm standing directly in front of the firehouse right now. And that's been essentially used as sort of a makeshift holding place. For a lot of these families and children and parents who essentially just are trying to cope with what has transpired, i can count probably at least half a dozen emergency vehicles. So it is still very active scene down here. Helicopters flying overhead, fbi, atf and local and state officials are all on scene as is the media here, as families walk out. Many people tried to speak with them, but many are just inconsolable. You see people walking out, parents clutching their children, tears in their eyes, speaking on cell phones and just trying to convey the gravity of the situation here. And I had an opportunity to speak with a local teacher, not a teacher at the elementary school where the shooting took place, but in the nearby school system and she said the people move here, often for the schools, so you have people coming from in and around the state, for the quality of the education that students get in this area. And so it became such a shock when you see something like this transpire. It is -- it leaves you at a loss for words, both what she said and in my own reporting here, just not something that you're accustomed to, to be reporting on, on this many fatalities of children at that age at an elementary school. Wolf? 

[01:06:13]


>> We're getting this horrific information from a source close to the investigation, david, i want to be precise with our viewers, the suspect in this CASE, RYAN LANZA, IN HIS 20s, From newtown, connecticut, we're told that the suspect's mother was a teacher at this small school, of sandy hook elementary school. And she, we're told by this source, has been shot and killed in this incident. What a horrific, horrific development. All of a sudden, we're beginning to get a connection between ryan lanza, the shooter in this case, he himself died at the scene. We don't know precisely the circumstances, how he died, but we know he's dead. Ryan lanza went into this school, started shooting children and adults, close to 30 people have been killed. We're told maybe 18 or 20 of them children. And nowe're told that ryan lanza's mother, a teacher at this elementary school, was shot and killed herself. David, I want you to hold on for a second, because you're outside that firehouse, inside the firehouse, trying to comfort these families as r shaul praver, has a small congregation in newtown, connecticut, rabbi, are you succeeding, are you able to comfort some of the parents who are inside, some of whom may have lost their children? 
>> Very much in shock. It is very, very difficult. Some of them do not know the condition of their children at the moment. We're awaiting -- it is terrible anxiety. Some of them, we hope, will survive. They're at hospitals and the governor will come back and provide us more specific information at 3:00 or around then on their condition. It is very hard to console parents in this situation, but we're trying and members of our congregation, psychologists, social workers, have come immediately to try to help. 

[01:08:23]


>> Rabbi, what do you say to parents who may have already been told that their little daughter or little son was killed? 
>> There is no theological answer to this. Yhave to hug them and just be with them and cry with them. 
>> Are any of these families members of your congregation in newtown? 
>> We're awaiting for the news on one child, noah, that's his name, and he's a first grader. And his classroom was near the principal's office, so we're worried about that. And we're awaiting to see if he survived the attack. 
>> How many parents, rabbi, are inside that firehouse being consoled right now, awaiting word on the fate of their little children? 
>> I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question. 
>> I said, how many parents, how many family members are inside that firehouse where you are right now? 
>> I would say at least 30 adults are here, so you have parents and then their parents are with them, supporting them. So there is at least 30, perhaps even more there. Hard to know exactly, you know, who is awaiting the news and who is there as a friend, so it is hard to give a precise number. But the room is pretty full. 
>> And they're getting the information directly from governor malloy? 
>> I don't really know how that all works. I just know that the governor briefed us all. And said that he was going to tell us as soon as he found anything out and that he said he would be back, you know, around 3:00. So I don't know if it is specifically the governor that is providing any information or not. 
>> Rabbi praver of congregation of israel out of newtown, connecticut, he's in that firehouse, he's trying to console some of these parents who may have lost children in this mass shooting today at the sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. Rabbi, we'll continue our conversation. What a painful conversation it is. I'm sure it must be so painful for you to be with these family members, with these parents of children who may have been killed in this mass murder. That's what we have to call it. Susan candiotti is on the scene for us as well. Susan, are youetting more information on what happened? 

[01:10:57]


>> Yes, wolf. I have some new information to report now from two law enforcement sources that among the dead is the mother of the shooter in this case. The mother of the shooter is also dead. She is a teacher at the school. Now, we don't have confirmed whether she was found dead at the school, or at some other location. But two sources tell us that she, too, is among the dead. Also some additional new information to report to you, wolf, is that the shooter, ryan lanza, is 24 years old, 24 years old. To remind our viewers. He was found dead at the scene, in a classroom. And additionally he was found with at least two weapons. I am hearing there may be even more weapons that were found. And also as we have previously reported, another person is being questioned by police in connection with this shooting, but we have no additional information on that at this time to report. Wolf? 
>> Is the working assumption, and I know this information is preliminary, subject to change, is the working assumption there among law enforcement, susan, that ryan lanza, after opening fire, killing all these people, took his own life? 
>> Reporter: That is the working assumption here. But we don't have that confirmed information that he took his own life. But that certainly is the working theory here. And so they have a lot of pieces to put together. We also know, for example, that authorities have been executing a search warrant at ryan lanza's home. And they have been doing that for quite some tim now. We have no information yet about what kind of information they have found. For example, had they found any additional weapons at the house. It is very likely if he had a computer there, they certainly would have seized that and the hard drive and would be hard at work examining that. So common that so many of us have computers these days. And so we're waiting for another update, we hope to get more information. Of course, in the coming minutes, hours, we'll have to see. And as you know, the governor will also be holding a news conference, scheduled in less than an hour from now, expected to happen around 3:30 or so, wolf. 

[01:13:17]


>> And in the next few minutes we'll be hearing from president obama at the white house as well. But, susan, quickly, I want to be precise on this, is it your information that the shooter, ryan lanza, went to the school and among others actually shot his own mother there, that she is a teacher at this school, and u're now reporting she was shot and killed. I assume he must have shot her, but correct me if I am wrong. 
>> Reporter: You know, the only information we have now is that his mother is a teacher at the school. And she was -- she has been found dead. Interestingly we don't have our law enforcement sources telling us that she is among the dead at the school. Only that she is dead. 
>> What a horrific story. Susan, I know you'll be working your sources, getting more information. Mary snow is work her source. She's outside the suspect's home in newtown, connecticut. We'll check back with her. David ariosto, our producer on thscene, we'll check back with him. I want to go to our chief white house correspondent jessica yellin in the white house briefing room right now, awaiting the president. Set the scene over there. Momentarily he'll be walking out, making a statement, jessica. 
>> That's right, wolf. We just got the two-minute warning here in the white house for the president to enter the press briefing room here and address this shooting. Tragically we have all too much experience of the president speaking to the nation after shooting rampages such as this one. And in these instances he generally -- he often tries to bring it to a personal level, talk about that it is like as a father, to relate to what -- to the experience that parents are feeling across the country right now, watching this story unfold, and try to tell a story from inside that school, usually tries to find a story of heroism if he can, to reassure the nation that there are positive stories of american resilience, but this is such a grim day, it is a hard one for the president, no doubt, and for the white house here, wolf. The president found out about this at 10:30 this morning from his director of homeland security. He's received updates throughout the day. He spoke to the fbi director, to the connecticut governor, and has been briefed consistently. The white house has admonished us not to talk about policy and gun control issues today. This is a day for grieving and concern for the families of those involved. And I expect the president to come out here and make some brief remarks, wolf, much more personal in nature. Wolf?

>> We just have gotten word, releas from the white house, that the president has ordered all flags flying at half-staff at the white house, all u.S. Institutions, public grounds, all over the country. There you see the flag over the white house flying at half-staff right now in his order. He says I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length UNTIL DECEMBER 18th, 2012, SAME Length of time at all u.S. Embassies. Here is the president. 
>> I offered governor malloy my condolences on behalf of the nation. And made it clear he will have every single resource that he needs to investigate this heinous crime, care for the victims, counsel their families. We have endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. And each time I learn the news, I react not as a president, but as anybody else would, as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there is not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well. For as blessed as they are to have their childrene tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early. And there are no words that will ease their pain. As a country we have been through this too many times. Whether it is an elementary school in newtown, or a shopping mall in oregon, or a temple in wisconsin, or a movie theater in aurora or a street corner in chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. This evening michelle and I will do what I know every parent in america will do, which is hug our children a little tighter, and we'll tell them that we love them, and we'll remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in connecticut who cannot do that tonight and they need all of us right now. In the hard days to come, the community needs us to be at our best as americans, and I will do everything in my power as president to help. Because while nothing can fill the space of a lost child or loved one, all of us can extend the hand to those in need, to remind them that we are there for them, that we are praying for them, that the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories, but also in ours. May god bless the memory of the victims and in the words of scripture, heal the broken-hearted and bind up their wounds. 

[01:20:23]


>> Very, very emotional moment for the president of the united states. Dare I say for all of america. Much of the world right now. You don't often see the president of the united states showing such emotion, wiping away tears as he speaks of these little kids, 5 to 10-year-old kids, the majority of the victims who were killed in this mass shooting in connecticut today. Got to tell you, I covered a lot of presidents, I haven't seen a president emerge as emotionally charged and this is a president who has two daughters, he sends to school every day, like millions of other parents all over the country, how much they can identify with what is going on right now, this insanity that has occurred in this small elementary school in connecticut. Today, ohn king is joining with us more information. We have covered presidents, not often -- dare I say, I don't remember a time I've seen a president start literally crying like that in the middle of a major statement. 
>> As the president himself noted, wolf, I think he was addressing the nation more as a father than as a president. And I can -- I've been texting my teenage daughter all afternoon. I get what the president says about hugging your children a little tighter tonight. This is incomprehensible and that's one reason the president was so sad, as he delivered that statement there. As we get more information, wolf, it becomes more incomprehensible. I'm told by federal law enforcement source that most of those killed were killed in the classroom of the alleged shooter's mother who was a teacher at the school, nancy lanza. And that he went into that classroom and, again this is according to police at the scene, reporting back to federal law enforcement officials here, shot and killed his mother and then shot and killed students and this source saying most of those killed were killed in that classroom and she was a kindergarten teacher at the school, wolf. That is again the incomprehensible information we're getting as more and more details of the investigation emerge. 
>> We're getting this information, john, as well, from our justice producer, terry frieden, let me be precise in what he has learned, senior law enforcement official familiar with the investigation, he tells us, says a brother of the shooter, the alleged shooter, was found dead in the residential location, near searched in hoboken, new jersey, across the river from new york city. In addition, the mother of the alleged shooter was found dead in the elementary school. The father who was divorced from lanza's mother lives elsewhere in connecticut. The official said. The official declined to provide further details. So, john, now we're learning not only was the mother found dead, as you've been reporting inside the small elementary school, the sandy hook elementary school, and many of the children were who were killed were in her classroom, she was a teacher at this school, but the brother of the alleged shooter was found dead in a residential location in hoboken, n jersey. This has been obviously very, very off, even more awful than you can imagine. 

[01:23:24]


>> And you were speaking, wolf, I'msorry, a short time ago to the school security expert who predicted something similar to this, said as more details emerge, you're likely to find a profile of somebody who was having a very troubled issues in his or her family life. Now we know the shooter, of course, 24-year-old, I believe, young man, ryan lanza, according to polat the scene and you have from terry frieden's reporting, a brother killed, his mother was a teacher at the school, and is believed that she was the primary target, according to federal law enforcement officials and he shot her and then shot children in her classroom at the school, most of the deaths I'm told by the law enforcement source occurred there in that one concentrated area of the school. And the police will try to put this together. And obviously there will be detailed investigation into what thing or what things may have been the trigger here for this horrific event. And that is part of the investigative detail that we'll try to put together, and it is always the big question, the president just asked it quite poignantly and I think parents around the country as well as all those law enforcement officials were showing on our screens at the scene today will be asking very short question, why. 
>> We don't know. We have no idea, though i suspect we'll learn a lot more in the coming minutes, hours and certainly days. John, stand by. Jessica yellin is our chief white house correspondent. You were in the briefing room when the president delivered the powerful, very emotional statement. We saw him repeatedly pausing, trying to control himself, wiping away tears as he spoke to the american people. 
>> Wolf, I've simply never seen the president that emotional. Publicly he's never cried like that in my presence. He was consistently wiping away tears as you say. Beautiful little kids, he called them, and pointed out, again, as he always does, during these instances, but it seemed to really hit home for him here, the white house, and for so many of his aides that we saw actually holding hands and crying by the side, that he is a parent who can now go home and hug his children tonight, but these families cannot. Obviously this is not a story about the white house. But when he speaks as the consolar in chief, it is sort of representative of what so many people around the country are experiencing tonight and this is, in a way, one of those stories that wrenches everybody out of the moment, out of the stories that we have been covering, and reminds us all that whatever partisan politics we have been going through in reporting on, this is a time to just pause and appreciate our families, appreciate what we do have, comfort those who are struggling right now and going through loss. President obama is clearly struggling to do that himself right now because he is clearly shaken by this. Personally. And I would point out that he did make a veiled reference to trying to take some action in the wake of this. He said whatever our politics, we have to do something to make sure these tragedies stop. We will have to follow up on another time to see exactly what that means for him, wolf. 

[01:26:31]


>> And there is no doubt that the president is emotionally moved. I supposee's anxious to go to connecticut, console the parents. We're awaiting word from the governor of connecticut, dannel malloy, speaking momentarily. Let's take this quick break. We'll resume the breaking news coverage right after this. Alka-Seltzer Truth.

>>> horrific pictures coming in from connecticut, from a small elementary school. Sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut, where a shooter, ryan lanza, 24 years old, went into that school, and started killing people. We are now told according to law enforcement authorities the suspected gunman shot his mother, a teacher, at the school, and then opened fire on children in that classroom and others inside, we're told, close to 30 people have been confirmed killed. Maybe 18 or 20 of them children. We're also told that the mother of ryan lanza, nancy lanza, was shot and killed in this classroom as well as earlier the brother of ryan lanza in a residential area of hoboken, new jersey. What can we say? This kind of situation is powerful and awful and we just saw the present of the united states make a -- deliver a statement to the american people in which he choked up. He had to pause on several occasions. He started crying, wiping back tears, speaking as a parent who sends his two little girls, his daughters to school every single day. This is a story that millions and millions of people all over the united states will appreciate. We want to welcome our viewers here in the united states, and around the world. Let's get some perspective on what is going on here. Dr. Drew is joining us from los angeles right now. Dr. Drew, what can we say? How do you consoleents who are going through a tragedy, a crisis like this at that firehouse. We heard from that rabbi who is there, meeting with these parents, they have been told that their 5-year-old, 6-year-old, 7-year-old has been killed. 
>> Wolf, there are no words. There are no words. It is simply the worst experience imaginable. There is no way to console. We just have to be present while people grieve. We are in a new world today. We have crossed over to a world where somebody feels justified in acting out their rage by killing children at close range. I spent a lot of time in the media trying to figure out why random acts of violence occur, why a kid in oregon seems disconnected from reality for a while and does senseless things. This is something different. This is sinister. This is somebody purposefully planning, going, killing his family, and killing small children. That's the world we live in right now. We live in a world where people feel justified in pushing somebody on a subway tracks and killing small children. This has got to change. This has got to change. We all have to be aware of this. Our culture is sick. There are sick amongst us. And we have to begin to address this. 

[01:32:17]


>> It looks, dr. Drew, like as if what happened was this individual, ryan lanza, 24 years old, was at hoboken, and, you know, this is -- it looks like the pieces of the puzzle are beginning to come together, shot and killed his brother. Then drove, what, about 80 miles from hoboken, to newtown, connecticut, went inside the small elementary school, and shot his mother and then opened fire on children. This is something -- you can imagine driving from hoboken to newtown, connecticut, thinking about what he's about to do. He was well armed. He had assault weapons. He had a lot of ammunition. And, you know, he's obviously dead. We're not going to get his side of the story, unless he leaves some sort of evidence, a note or something to give us an indication. 
>> Really doesn't matter. This sort of purposeful, goal-directed, rageful action, people talk about it as evil, this is truly in that zone. This is psychopathy. There must have been evidence that this was a problematic person long before, and I'm saying now, we have to help people help them. We have to prevent people from doing these things. We have to break down parents' denials who don't want to admit their kid may be -- have tendencies in this direction. We must take action before something horrible like this happens. This is not like an oregon, where the kid seems out of context, doesn't seem understandable. That's what you call a psychotic episode. There may have been something of that nature going on here. We'll learn as we go along, but the purposeful, goal-directed nature of these actions suggest something far worse, far more sinister, and far more chronic. In other words, far more potentially predictable. Listen, I was thinking about this, wolf, just sitting here in the chair waiting to talk to you, when we're treating -- when we operate a hospital or in a treatment environment, we try to operate like a healthy family, in order to decrease the tendencies for the most vulnerable amongst us, the ones we're trying to treat from acting out. It is time for our government and our culture to act like a healthy family. Divisiveness is starting to have its effect amongst the most vulnerable amongst us and it is time to stop. We have to lead our way out of this, and we need our leaders to behave in a healthy manner. 

[01:34:42]


>> We're awaiting, dr. Drew, the governor of connecticut, dannel malloy, he's been inside that firehouse meeting with parents whose kids were killed today. First graders, second-graders, third graders and he's about to make a statement there, he's walking up to the microphone. Momentarily we're told we'll hear what he has to say. But what I'm interested in you telling us, maybe you'll tell us after we hear from the governor, what do parents tell their children tonight because this is -- these kinds of incidents, how do you explain what happened here? 
>> Right. Feel free to interrupt me if the governor starts speaking. The fact is we have to begin to operate healthy within our families, within our communities, within our states, within our government. We have to start in our families and helping kids understand that they're loved, they're in a stable environment, we're committed to them, and we have to be committed to them, we have to be parents, and that they are safe. Sometimes you may pick -- depending on the age of the child, maybe that child will want to take action, take self-defense classes, want to do something where they can feel like they're in control of their environment. But fundamentally, the safety and security and the commitment to the family needs to be reassured. It is the holiday season. We need to let the kids have their holiday season. But I'm telling you, we need to operate on the macro level as well as on the individual family level. We, as parents, need to take a page from our leaders -- 
>> hold on. 
>> Let's see what they have to say. 
>> Earlier today a tragedy of unspeakable terms played itself out in this community. Lieutenant governor and I have been spoken to and in an attempt we might be prepared for something like this playing itself out in our state. You can never be prepared for this kind of incident. What has happened and what has transpired at that school building will leave a mark on this community and every family impacted. I only ask that all of our fellow citizens here in the united states and around the world who have already offered their assistance remember all of the victims in their prayers. To all of you in the media, we will do our best to keep you as informed as we can. After I'm done speaking, a representative of the state police will speak to you and give you some additional information. Earlier today, a number of our citizens, beautiful children, had their life taken away from them. As well as adults whose responsibility it was to educate and supervise those children. The perpetrator of the crime is dead. As is an individual who the perpetrator lived with. With that, I'm going to turn it over to paul vance, who will answer or will give you some additional information and then later in the day perhaps we'll speak again. Again, I think on behalf of the people of the state of connecticut, we extend our condolences as I have at the firehouse to the parents of these children, as well as the adults that are there. I want to thank the president, who has been on the phone with us today, for his statement released to you a little while ago as well as the statements he made to me earlier -- much earlier today, as the hours raced by. And with that, I should also say that there are a number of public officials including the first select woman who has been on site throughout the day, we have state representatives, state senator, other select people who are here. We have the superintendent of the school who has done relative to that, that's the reason we have not identified him as of yet, search warrants, examination of areas of resident's employment and any ancillary things that may be attached to the identity and the individual. The scene has been secured. Major crime units have responded and are working with several agencies to process this scene. It is not a simplistic scene as you can certainly understand. We need to establish identity, we need to document the entire scene, and simply stated we need to answer every single question surrounding exactly how and why this incident occurred. As the governor said, we will be here through the night, certainly through the weekend and we're not even putting a time stamp on this as to when we will complete this project. We'll work with the medical examiner's office, we have to establish positive identification, and, again, a great deal of work that needs to be done here at the school. We'll take some very -- again, very brief questions but understand this is an active ongoing case and there are many things we cannot and will not discuss at this time. Yes, sir. 

[01:42:26]


[ Inaudible ] 
>> there is a secondary crime scene here in newtown. That is, in fact, correct. There is an adult deceased at that location. I can't discuss any further information on that at this time. There is assistance being lended to us by new jersey. I don't have the details on that. So I can't answer that. I'm sorry. Yes, ma'am. >>. 
[ Inaudible ] 
-- the children were in one classroom and in one space? 
>> I can simply state that the information that we have right now that we want to publicize that the shootings took place in one section of the school, in two rooms. That's as much as we want to go in right now as far as location. Our personnel are documenting that entire scene and we'll have literally everything mapped out in a final report, and we'll report the answers to those questions. Right now I don't have any more details than that. You had a question, sir. Someone -- right now there is one shooter, but, again, we're still looking at every ancillary fact and circumstance related to the deceased shooter at the scene. Yes, sir. 
[ Inaudible ] 
>> I don't have that information, I'm sorry. 
[ Inaudible ] 
>> to be determined. I don't have the answer to that question either. The next step will be the medical examiner's office will assist us in answering a lot of those questions, manner and cause of death of all of the deceased. That's it. 26 deceased. 
>> Lieutenant, once again, the children -- 
>> I'm sorry, one injury. One person was injured, yes. 
>> One classroom? 
>> I'm sorry? 
>> Were the children in one classroom? 
>> One section, one area of the school. That's the best I can do on that answer. I don't know specifically how many rooms are involved. I was told that there were two, but in one section of the school building. 
>> The adults -- 
>> everyone was in that same section of the building. 
>> Was that kindergarten. 
>> That is to be determined. A section of the building is as far as we want to go. 

[01:44:31]


[ Inaudible ] 
>> that's to be determined once more examinations are complete. 
>> -- The shooter as well. 
>> Excuse me? 
>> Does 26 include the shooter? 26. 
>> Just at the school? 
>> That's at the school itself. There is one more as we said, a secondary crime scene, a deceased adult at a secondary crime scene. Yes, ma'am. 
[ Inaudible ] to be determined. That's something our investigators are going to have to look at thoroughly and completely and that will take some time to try and answer that question. 
[ Inaudible ] we haven't established any of that, ma'am. We have not made any positive identifications. We're working on that. There is preliminary identifications made, but we have, as I said, a great deal of work. That's one thing we have to do is establish positive identification on all the deceased and that's a time consuming process. 
>> Do we know the ages of the victims? The ages, the age range? 
>> I don't know. It is a k through 4 elementary school. Okay. 
>> When police went into the school, were there school shots being fired at that time? 
>> That I don't know. I don't know the time sequence. That will be something we will provide. What I would like to do is -- no, we did not. What I would like to do then is tell you this is a briefing. We'll be back in 60 minutes. Myself and the lieutenant from newtown will be back in 60 minutes, see if there is any more details. I have? Some of the questions you posed. I'll try to get answers to provide you with information. That will be just about 20 to 5:00, quarter to 5:00. 
>> You say that's 20 children, 6 adults and the shooter, correct? 20 children, 6 adults in the facility, plus the shooter, that's 27, and then a secondary scene with an additional adult victim at that secondary scene. 28. 
>> Okay. 28. 
>> About 20 of, quarter to 5:00. 
>> Do you have an age range? 
>> I do not. I do not. One thing I would like to say is that we have been meeting with all of the family members, it is a very, very difficult scene for the family members, for all the responding, first responders, it is a tragedy. It is a tragic scene. I would -- we have been asked by the family members to ask the members of the press to respect their privacy, and to please leave them alone at this time. They're going through a tremendous amount of grief which I'm sure you can appreciate. I would -- I've been asked to ask you that, personally, by the family members. All right? I'll be back in 60 minutes with the lieutenant and we'll answer any additional questions we can. I don't know. 

[01:47:09]


>> The police chief in newtown, connecticut, updating us, giving us the latest information, the latest numbers and these are awful, awful numbers, 26 people killed, you add the shooter, 27,4eke p!Q one location, at the elementary school in newtown, connecticut, the sandy hook elementary school. He said one other individual was killed at a different location. We suspect that is the location of hoboken, new jersey, where the brother of this suspected shooter, ryan lanza, has been found, so altogether 27 on the scene, 26 there, plus the shooter. Another person will be 28 dead people as a result of what has happened. 20 of those 26 who were killed, children, according to the police chief there in connecticut. We also heard from dannel malloy, the governor of connecticut, earlier from the president of the united states who held back tears as he spoke, not only as the president of the united states, but as a parent, as a father of two girls himself, he appreciates as so many millions of people do the tragedy, the enormity of what has happened. Dr. Drew pinsky has been listening and watching. Dr. Drew, what can we say? I don't think there is anything we can say that can console the parents who have lost a first grader or second-grader or third-grader. 20 children were killed, another six adults including a teacher, one of those teachers being the mother of this suspected shooter. 
>> Yeah, when you say it, wolf, it just takes your breath away. I feel -- I'm afraid I'll lose my lunch thinking about how awful it would just be to be one of those parents. There is nothing that can be donerom here to help those people other than to say our prayers and to keep them in our thoughts. It is the people close to them that are going to get them through this. Not us. But each of us has been affected by this experience. Frankly, wolf, I'm sorry, I'm still disappointed by our leaders. I genuinely appreciate president obama's display of emotion, that was a very big step forward. But they -- they have to do what each of us, what I will have to do as a head of a household tonight in my family, we need that from our leaders, today, that things are going to be okay, that we are going to get along, that we are going to model healthy behavior going forward, and that this has -- this will stop. We have had a year of unconscionable violence that is ending in a violent episode that, in my opinion, puts us in a new place. Close range violence against children. Somebody willfully, in a goal-directed fashion, thought this was an okay behavior. It is okay to push someone on a we must require people to get help if they have any tendency towards violence or to be disconnected from reality. There is such a thing as healthy and not healthy. You know, wolf, I was explaining to somebody earlier that these days no one would allow someone in the workplace or at school if they were having chest pain and shortness of breath or had an infectious illness. They would have to take care of their medical condition. Get a letter from a doctor in order to come back. We need the same sort of attention to our mental health and we need to each of us redouble our efforts to have healthy families to which we are committed and then again on a macro level, we need our leaders to show us the way. Show us the way to a healthier future where this kind of thing is not okay and not contemplated. 

[01:50:54]


>> Because what we see -- see these horrific crimes unfolding, whether at the movie theater or here, immediately law enforcement over the years has always said to be careful of copy cats. How big of a problem do you, dr. Drew, think copy-cats are in these kinds of mass killings? 
>> Wolf, I am sorry to say i think it is a major issue. And it's a major issue today especially. I was riding on an elevator yesterday night here in cnn los angeles with a security guard who looked at me and said, you know, in a very sort of, you know, sorrowful voice, there's going to be copy-cats. I looked at him. It was a guard I didn't know. And I said really, are we there? That's how bad we've gotten? Not only was he right, he was right and we've crossed over with a copy-cat into something truly evil, something unimaginable, where children are killed at close range. I can't even say the words. The president of the united states is brought to tears by this. All of us are brought to tears by it. Each of us has to pay attention today, pay attention to our families, pay attention to our communities and start to say no more of this. We have to focus on our health. If somebody is aware of someone right now who's struggling, do not be afraid to enlist the help of law enforcement or mental health professionals. They are not there to be punitive, they are there to help. People in authority are there to help. You need -- they are your friend. You need to use them. Do not let this happen in your community. 
>> And, dr. Drew, as we take a look at what you say there are signs, in this shooter's life what you're suggesting is in recent months or years there may have been signs of evil intent that were obvious to people who knew him, maybe close family members and others, and this could have been prevented if folks would have done something, is that what you're suggesting? 
>> I'm suspicious of that. Of course I don't know this case. Again, as I said, wolf, I spent a lot of time in the media trying to help people. It's important to make sense of all these things. Part of leading us out is to say what happened, how do we make sense of this. That's good leadership. So we're trying to understand this today as quickly as we can. I have no direct knowledge, but my suspicion is this is somebody who has been struggling for a while and for whom probably there was a certain amount of denial on behalf of his parents or family or even his community and that these people who have hists of lack of empathy for others, aggression, criminality of any type, they need to be addressed in a cohesive, thorough and a manner without denial. You don't pretend that things are different than you wish they were. You really go after these things, because if you don't, horrible things can happen. 

[01:53:52]


>> We have the picture now of the principal of the sandy hook elementary school that we want to show our viewers. Susan candiotti is on the scene for us as well. Susan, a heart-breaking, heart-wrenching story unfolding. What a tragedy. There she is, the principal at this school, dawn hochsprung was killed, she was also a psychologist at this small elementary school, kindergarten through fourth grade. As the president of the united states said, 5-year-old to 10-year-old children. 20 of them killed now according to the police chief in newtown, connecticut. 26 people killed altogether plus the shooter, that makes 27. And another person at a different -- at a different location. We expect in hoboken, new jersey. I want to show our viewers some of the images of what has happened. 
>> Car after car after car, some of them were flying up past my house and coming back around again and going to the school. This house is three houses away from the school. 
>> When we first arrived there, there was not a lot of security to guard and there were three children that came out. One of them was -- had a very bloody face. 
>> We immediately jumped in the car and headed down here, so this is troubling. It was really kind of may hem in the room with the kids and the teachers, trying to identify your kid, making sure they were safe, find out what the situation was. It started with the neighbors and the rest of their friends at school and that sort of thing. 
>> What did your daughter say to you? 
>> They were immediately crying. Petrified of what happened and what did it mean. They're both older than some of the other kids in the school, so understanding what happened. My son was in the gym when it happened, so I think that he heard the gunshots. 

[01:56:01]


>> We saw police officers and we heard them on the roof and in our building. 
>> Did you hear any gunshots or anything like that? 
>> Well, police officers, like they were kind of -- there were police officers right out the door trying to find the guy. 
>> It was shocking. I got the call at work this morning and I can't believe a small town like this would ever have anything like this happen. And to be in an elementary school, that's unheard of. 
>> It doesn't even seem real. It just does not seem like it's even possible. It's like you read it in the paper or see it in the news. You're like oh, my god, that poor family. And then you have something happen so close to home, it's like I think I'm still in shock. 
>> I can tell you that, first of all, obviously our hearts and prayers go out to the victims of this terrible incident, very tragic. Our police are currently working closely with the newtown police department. We have mutual aid agreements in place that allow us to provide assets they may not have, along with the state police who have taken the lead in this investigation. 
>> It's terrifying. I'm still terrified. I think I'm still in shock about it all. 
>> Was everybody crying, scared, wanting their parents to come get them? 
>> Yeah, they were. And some people were even like -- they got a stomach ache. 
>> They wouldn't even let us in the building. All I can say is one of the cops said it's the worst thing he'd ever seen in his entire career, but it was when they told the parents. All these parents were waiting for their children to come out. They thought that they were still alive. There's 20 parents that were just told that their children are dead. It was awful. 
>>> The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. 

[01:58:11]


>> When we first arrived there, there was not a lot of security to guard, and there were three children that came out. One of them was -- had a very bloody face. It was a very violent scene. There were two other ones that they were, you know, they were in the arms of a state trooper. They did not move. Their face was very pale. It was very tragic. 
>> Terror at an elementary school in connecticut. A gunman opens fire. 20 children, six adults dead. The shooter dead as well. I want to welcome our viewers in the united states and around the world. I'm wolf blitzer in the situation room. We're continuing the breaking news coverage of a horrific story here in the united states. Let's bring in our national correspondent, susan candiotti. She's on the scene. Susan, update our viewers what we know right now. What happened around 9:30 a.M. Eastern this morning at that small elementary school in newtown, connecticut. 
>> Reporter: It's a school, wolf, that has the grades kindergarten through the fourth grade. A place that is supposed to be for learning and for fun for these young children ended up being a place of pure carnage. At 9:30 or so this morning, shots rang out as at least one gunman entered that school and that gunman is dead. As police have been telling us now, 20 children dead, 18 of them dead at the scene. And in addition to that, six adults are also dead, including the principal of the school. We understand that yet another adult was found dead at another location that police are not officially disclosing as of yet.

George thought the best way to spend a relaxing afternoon was a visit with Professor Wiseman. (gibbering excitedly) (chattering impatiently) (George chattering) Wiseman: Yes... no. Maybe. Green. Thursday. Gravitational pull. You're welcome. Oh... oh, hi, guys. Hi. (chatters "Hello") (chiming) Just a minute, I have to respond to this urgent message from Dr. Hasslein. Uh, should we come back another time? You seem busy. Oh, no. I am dizzier-- I mean, busier-- than usual, but it's administrative duties. Huh? Office work. Answering questions, filing, copying. (chattering curiously) (phone ringing) Apatosaurus? Herbivorous. (sighs) Boy, I'm overseeing five exhibits: two opening here and two more opening in Cleveland. (chattering curiously) Oh. (chuckles) I mean four exhibits. Two plus two still equals four, even when you're distracted. (sighs) I think all of this work is getting to you. Uh-huh. (hooting) George is right. You need to relax. We'll help. We're very relaxing guys. How about Saturday? (hooting excitedly) George is right. Oh, where is the schedule? (chattering) I had a pen. (chattering) Oh, there it is. Thank you. (chattering) Saturday... relax. (hooting excitedly) (sighs) Let's see. Professor Wiseman needs our help. 

[00:04:02]


Hmm. Let's think of some relaxing things to do tomorrow. (chattering) (chattering in confusion) Ah. (hooting excitedly) Uh-huh, that's fun, but she needs to relax. You know, something peaceful. (sighs) (chattering excitedly) (George gibbering loudly) Um, George? (George sighs) (grunting) (sighs) Aha! A picnic. That's relaxing. Perfect. (hooting happily) Narrator: So, the next morning, the Man with the Yellow Hat packed a picnic lunch. George: Aha. (chattering excitedly) I think we have all the ingredients it takes to relax one professor. (hooting happily) Ooh. (chattering happily) Man: That's very generous, George, but I brought enough for everyone. Oh, thank you. I'm fully prepared for a day of total relaxation. It's good to be away from work for a while, isn't it? Yes... I wore blue, which is a scientifically proven relaxing color. Plus, I practiced reclining at a 45 degree angle, a very relaxing position. Man: Well, this is all going perfectly. Uh-huh. Well... (swallows) Well, what? (chuckling) Feel relaxed yet? Well, actually, I was trying to remember 

[00:06:02]


if I faxed the specifications of Jupiter's moons to the director of... Don't think about anything. We'll do all the thinking for you. (sighs) I think you'd like a pickle. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. (grunting) Huh. (grunting) (chattering) (grunting) (grunting) (sighs) Here. Let me try. No, no, no. You just... (straining): relax. Wiseman: What we need to solve this is something that will help you grip. Uh... aha. I think this is rubber. (chitters curiously) (grunting) (chatters happily) (sighs) Don't give it to her. She shouldn't have to work. I'll just show George how to do it. (chatters "Yeah") Turn it like this. (chatters "Okay") (grunting) (chatters triumphantly) (splattering) (chatters "Hey") Huh? (Man sighs, George gasps) Hmm. Uh-oh. (chatters "Sorry") So, we know pickles aren't relaxing. At least not flying pickles. This is sure to relax you. Well, honestly, I'm just as happy sitting on the ground. But what could be more relaxing than hanging from a tree? (chuckling) Uh-huh. Watch, you just lie back and let your troubles melt away. (chattering softly) Oh, thanks, George. 

[00:08:03]


(chatters "You're welcome") (chattering excitedly) Uh, George... Whoa, whoa! (groaning) Oh, let me help. (grunting) Ooh, he's too heavy. (panting) (sighs) (worried chattering) Don't worry. I'm sure I can find a way to solve the problem. Oh, no, you relax. I'll work it out. (grunting) Hmm... if we only had a big stick we could use as a lever. Oh. Man: Almost there, George. Ah. Perfect. Uh, you're not gonna get me out the way you get candy out of a pi??ata, are you? No, we'll use the bat as a lever. Ah. (grunting) Whoa. (groaning) Oh, are you hurt? No, I, uh... I landed on my hat. (grunting) Oh, no, only an hour left to squeeze in some real relaxation. Now, we're not gonna create any more work for Professor Wiseman, right? Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on! (grunting) Feed the ducks. (chattering excitedly) (hooting happily) (ducks quacking) You, too. Fun, relaxation, ducks! Okay. Here I go. (quacking) (chattering happily) George, careful. (chattering excitedly) (grunts) Uh-oh. 

[00:10:04]


(quacking) Uh... No problem, we're still feeding them, right? It's fun, huh, right? Ducks! But your hat is waddling away. (quacks) Man: Oh! My hat. Uh-oh. We can solve this problem. You shouldn't. I-I should. Okay, how? (gasping): Aha. We can use the kite string to fish the hat out of the water. I just need a hook. Aha. Perfect choice. Okay. Want to toss it, George? Uh-huh! (disappointed whimpering) Hmm, we need more weight. Huh. Okay, try again. (chattering) (ducks quacking) (yells excitedly) (grunting) (gasps) Aha! See that branch? Uh-huh. Wiseman: We can use it to lift the hat. We can? (chatters "We can?") Hmm. (chattering) Man: Fantastic. (chatters "All right!") Oh, thank you. 

[00:12:06]


Thank you. Oh, this wasn't what I planned. All you did was solve problems for us. Please, accept my apology. Apology? For what? I had a very relaxing day. Huh? Relaxing? Exactly. Hands-on problem solving. Not like work, where I just answer questions and shuffle pape (sighs) Well, then, you're welcome. Well, see you. (chattering) Oh, okay. (sighs) Wow. Who knew relaxing could be so exhausting? Ah... whew. (chuckles) Come on, George, I think it's time for a nap. Girl: George is a monkey. He learned how to use different tools to solve problems. Go! Girl: Owen's dad is giving us challenges. It's a box with an opening in the top and there's Ping-Pong balls and we're going to reach in with some of these tools that I made and see how many balls you can get out of the box, okay? It's called bobbing for Ping-Pong balls. (giggles) Girl: Owen first used the grabbers. (giggling) Boy: You got one! The grabber could only pick up one at a time. Man: Three... two... one. 30 seconds. I got three! Then Jay used the spoon on a stick. (squeals happily) I got two! The spoon on a stick could grab as many as you could try. 30 seconds. Jay got six. I'm going to use the tape. (boys giggling) 

[00:14:06]


Man: Three... two... one. 30 seconds. Nine, ten, 11. She was using the thing that I used, but-but tape... And I'm so sad that I lost. Girl: The tape could stick to the Ping-Pong balls. I like tools because they really sometimes help you with stuff. (George chattering excitedly, Charkie barking) Narrator: George liked playing with Charkie because she could run faster than anyone,and she was the best flipper, too. (barking excitedly) Ooh... ah... Thanks for dog- sitting Charkie while I go to the museum, George. Uh-huh. Here's her leash and her favorite toys. She loves to play fetch. (chatters "Okay") (barking excitedly) (grunts) (chuckling): Charkie never gets tired of running and chasing. Uh-uh. Whew. (horn honking) Hi. I've got a package for you from Mabel's. Oh, I'll take it here. (sniffs) (barks) Bye, everyone. Have a nice dog-- I mean, have a nice day. (chatters "Bye!") (squealing) Charkie, please. If this falls, it'll break. (barking) She knows what it is. She can smell it. Oh. (sniffs) Huh? See? Bath oils in my favorite glass bottles. Oh, Charkie just loves their aroma. Don't you, girl? (barking) Charkie didn't want to break anything. She just wanted a whiff. (sniffs) George still couldn't smell it. I'd better hide these really well. If she gets her paws on them, I'll have bath oil all over the place. 

[00:16:08]


(Charkie whimpering) (growls) Oh. Charkie even smelled it through the door. (sniffs) That dog had one powerful nose. (gasps) Oh, no, he didn't deliver my second package. If the deliveryman returns, could you set the package inside for me? Ooh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Thanks, George, I'll be back soon. (chattering happily) Aha! (chattering happily) (Charkie barking, vehicle approaching) (vehicle braking) (vehicle door opens and closes) (barks) Delivery guy: Hey, there. I forgot to deliver the lady's other package. Is she still there? Uh-uh. (grunts) Youcan accept it? Uh-huh. Oh, thanks. Can you sign right here? Uh-uh. (chatters "Bye-bye") (barking) (chattering) (barks) Narrator: This must have been more of that easy-to-break stuff. (sniffs) George couldn't smell it. (chattering) But Charkie sure seemed to. Aah! (Charkie barking, George yelling) Charkie was the fastest runner, but she couldn't resist a puddle. (panting) Aha. Aah! (barking) (yelling) (barking) There was no chance George could outrun Charkie... 

[00:18:11]


so he had to find a way to protect that box fast. (barking) (taunting) (barks) (birds cooing) (chattering nervously) (barking) (chatters inquisitively) Aha. Ah. This bell would ring if anyone bothered the box. (barks) Now that the box was safe... Whew. ...George had to figure out how to get it back to Aunt Margret's place. (pigeons cooing) (barking) Hmm. What was the right size and shape to carry that box-- and Charkie-proof, too? (gasps) (hooting excitedly) (barking) (screaming) Oh. Oh. (chatters "Oh, no!") (barking) Charkie still couldn't resist a puddle. (hooting happily) (barking) Now, where could I have put those bowling balls? (panting) (barking) (hooting excitedly) 

[00:20:13]


(barking) Look, Hundley, with this new carrier's see-through walls you won't miss any part of your trip! (panting) (chatters curiously) Hiya, George! (elevator bell rings) How ya doin'? (hooting happily) (barking) (whimpers and sniffs) (barking) (elevator bell dings) Whew! (barking) (screeching) (hooting happily) (barking) (grunting) (barking) (gibbering anxiously) (sniffing) (chatters "Hey!") (whimpering) (barks) (chattering) (sniffing and whimpering) (barking) (whimpers and barks) (barking) (hooting happily) (chatters "There") (hooting happily) (growling) (gasps) (barking) (screams) (barking) George: Uh-oh! (screams) 

[00:22:14]


Aha! Good thing Charkie never got tired of chasing her toys. (chatters curiously) (gasps) (chatters "Oh, no!") With all these boxes, how would George ever find the right one? Aha! Uh-huh. George picked out all the boxes that looked like his. But which box was his? They all looked the same. (whining) What else was special about his box? (Charkie sniffing) The smell! (chatters happily) If anything could find the right box, it was Charkie's nose! (chattering) (barking) (chattering) (barking) (sniffing) (barking) (hooting happily) (barking) (chatters "Hi") (chattering) Hey, George! Wow! Thanks for straightening out all of my boxes! (gibbering happily) (growling) (barking) You need a lift? Uh-huh, uh-huh! Hop on! After all, I'm a deliveryman! Ooh, uh-huh. (barking) (chatters "Thank you") 

[00:24:16]


(barking) (whimpering) (chattering) (barking) Have a nice day. (Charkie barking) Hi, George! Did my package arrive? Ooh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh! (chatters happily) George was proud to give Aunt Margret her package, safe and sound. Well, I see you took good care of it. Thank you. (barking) Oh, easy girl. After I left, I remembered what was in this box. You didn't have to protect this one from Charkie. (chatters curiously) These are the new dog toys I ordered for her. Oh. (whimpering) (sighing) (barking) This was the greatest ending to the greatest game Charkie had ever played! (chatters "Whoa!") All thanks to George. (laughing) (barking) Girl: Mm-hmm. Girl: George is a monkey. He figured out how to fit the box in the drawer to hide it from Charkie. (barking) Girl: Today we are trying to ship a lot of stuff to Angelina, and Angelina's a teacher in the peace corps, and we're going to send it off to Mozambique. Which is in Africa. Man: We need to see if we can get all of this stuff into those four boxes. How are we going to do this? We put the biggest things on the bottom. They're big, rectangle objects so they have the corners and it's easier to get them in. Let's try doing it like this. There's, like, a triangle, and these are all rectangle stuff, so they won't really fit. 

[00:26:17]


Girl: We took everything out so we could start again. Well, we sort of slanted it, 'cause it gave us more room to put everything in. Girl: We put the binders in like this. Boy: This is a triangle. Girl: Then we put them in a rectangle shape and they fit better in the square box. And we did it. Yeah. We did it! But first we tried to go like this, but then we wouldn't be able to close it. So then we tried this way. Yay. Yes! (whoops) Girl: The most important thing I learned today is how to fit sizes in and shapes. Hooray! Hooray! Announcer: This holiday season... Kids: Santa!

[whistle blows] 
>> ?????? the dinosaur train ?????? 
[roaring] 
[captioning made possible by the jim henson company] 
>> hmm. Shiny, this looks lovely. 
>> I love this time of year. The days are shortest, nights are longest. 
>> And the sun is never too high in the sky. 
>> And don't forget, it can be cold out during winter solstice, too. 
>> Yeah! It's the best! 
>> ?????? La la loo ?????? 

[00:02:00]


>> ho ho ho! You kids make any cold winter solstice a whole lot warmer. 
>> You know what makes me feel all warm inside? Snow. 
>> Like the snow we saw last year at the north pole? 
>> Yeah. It came whirling and swirling down, and we made a snowosaur. 
>> So much beautiful, twinkly snow. 
>> I've got it! I know my winter wish. This year, I want to see it snow again. 
>> That's quite a wish, don. 
>> Yeah. I mean, for that, you'd have to take the dinosaur train to the north pole. Heh. 
>> Can we, dad? Can we please take the train to the north pole? 
>> Don could get his winter wish! 
>> But it gets so cold up there. 
>> Yes, but we'll all be together. 
>> Hmm. We're going to the north pole, aren't we? 
>> [Cheering] 
[giggling] 
>> off to the north pole, eh, pteranodon family? 
>> Yeah, to see snow. 
>> It's don's winter wish, and we're making it come true. 
>> Maybe a little more true than you planned, shiny. You never know. Sometimes they get a blizzard up there. 
>> A blizzard? Oh, no. Not a blizzard! Wait. What's a blizzard? 
>> A blizzard is a heavy snowstorm that comes along with very strong winds. 
>> Ooh! 
>> Looks like I'm really, really gonna get my winter wish. 
>> That's great, don, but doesn't a blizzard sound kind of scary? 
>> Well, shiny, right now, it's just a weather warning, not definitely a blizzard. 
>> Oh, that's good. 
>> But we'll know for sure in good time because it's time tunnel time. Time tunnel approaching! 
>> Ooh. See? I knew it. C-cold. 

[00:04:02]


>> Awk! Up here the sun barely rises above the horizon in the winter. 
>> And there's snow on the ground but not a lot. 
>> And none coming down from the sky. 
>> What are we looking for, eh? 
>> Travis troodon! 
>> Hey, you guys. Great to see you back at the good old north pole. 
>> We're here to see snow, travis. There's supposed to be a buzzard. 
>> Don means blizzard. 
>> Yeah. That's what they're predicting, which reminds me. I got to finish my game before the blizzard hits. 
>> Are you playing knock the frozen gourd around? 
>> Yeah, what else? Best game in the world. Have a fun visit, pteranodon clan. Maybe I'll catch you later. 
>> Awk! Come on. Let's go down to the frozen pond! 
>> [Giggling] 
>> ahh. Still no snow falling. Oh, well. No winter wish. Unh! 
>> Unh! 
>> [Gasp] hi, there. Need some help? 
>> Oh, hi. That would bereat. I'm moving it to help shore up my nest over there in that patch. 
>> I'm don, don pteranodon. 
>> I'm soren saurornitholestes. Pleased to meet you. 
>> Wow! Are those your eggs? 
>> Yep. All 4. Looks like I'm in for an instant family. 
>> I have two sisters and a brother. We're here hoping my winter wish comes truei want to see some snow, but there, uh, isn't very much. 
>> Oh, there will be, don. We're expecting a real blizzard. 
>> I keep hearing that but not seeing it. Oh! Is that a snowflake? 
>> More than one, don. I think you're about to get your wish. 
>> Yahoo! Wait. If there's a blizzard with lots of snow, won't your eggs get cold? 
>> Nope. We saurornitholestes are warm-blooded. 
>> Warm-whated? 
>> Warm-blooded. It means our bodies make heat, which I use to keep my eggs warm in their nest. 
>> I wonder if I'm warm-blood. 
>> Oh. I don't know. Oh, but i must say, my feathers help keep me warm, too. 

[00:06:07]


>> Wowthat's great! Do you mind if I touch your feathers so I can feel what warm-blooded feels like? That is really soft and warm. Ooh! Look, soren. The snow's sticking. We can make snowballs and snow forts, and this is gonna be best winter solstice ev. Whee! Look at me! ?????? La la loo ?????? boy,t's really coming down. So is this the blizzard? 
>> This is nothing, don. We could get several feet of snow. 
>> Several feet? It is a blizzard! 
>> Don, honey! 
>> The blizzard's coming. Brr. 
>> Time to head back to the station. 
>> Coming. I got to go. There's room at the station if you want to get away from the blizzard. 
>> Thanks, but I'll stay here and keep my eggs warm. Dont worry about me. I'm used to the cold. 
>> Ok. See you after the storm. Maybe we can build a snowosaur with pebbles for teeth. 
>> Sounds fun. Bye, don. Stay warm! 
>> Quite a blizzard, eh, mr. Conductor? 
>> Oh, ho! I'll say. The track down the line is snowed in, so here's the news. The dinosaur train will have to stay here for the night and dig out in the morning. 
>> Really? 
>> Wow! What an adventure! 
>> After you, pteranodon clan. Oh! That's better. 
>> It's much warmer in here. 
>> You can thank this baby. North pole station's one of the few with an indoor fireplace. 
>> Good thing, too. Blizzards are pretty, but they're also pretty cold. 
>> Scooch over, buddy. My tail's frozen. 
>> Yeah. It's a real doozy out there. Ooh, ooh. Remind anybody of a song? 
>> "Dinosaur holiday in the snow"! 
>> ?????? It's the season for train rides and snowing the reason everybody's going to the great big dinosaur holiday in the snow ho ho ho... ?????? 
>> hey, don. You love to sing. Don't you want to join in? 

[00:08:07]


>> [Sigh] I feel bad. My winter wish was for snow, and it came true. 
>> Oh. Isn't that a good thing? 
>> But I caused a blizzard. Now the train is snowed in, and my new friend soren saurornitholestes has to sit on her eggs in the snowstorm. 
>> Trust your old dad, kiddo. None of this is your fault. 
>> It's not? 
>> No. Wishes are about hoping things come true, not making them come true. Plus none of us can cause snowstorms. They're part of nature, and so are big blizzards. 
>> I guess you're right. Thanks, dad, but I'm still worried about soren out there in the cold. 
>> Ahem. Couldn't help but overhear, gents. Don, you say your friend soren is a saurornitholestes? Well, they're warm-blooded creatures just like all birds and mammals and some of us dinosaurs, including me. 
>> You're warm-blooded? 
>> Yep! All of us troodons are. As a warm-blooded animal, soren uses that heat to keep those eggs of hers snuggly warm. 
>> Oh, ok. I'm glad I don't have to worry about soren and her eggs. 
>> Um, mr. Conductor, are pteranodons warm-blooded? 
>> Good question, tiny. Actually pteranodons are not warm-blooded like birds and mammals. They need to get some help from the sun to warm up. 
>> Yes! I knew I was cold-blooded. 
>> Whoa! 
>> Time for a winter solstice feast! 
>> Oh, boy! Food! 
>> Give her, travis. 
>> ?????? And tonight the snowflakes are gently gonna fall 
>> we'll dance together we're gonna shake a feather we're gonna have a ball it's the season for train rides and snowing the reason everybody's going to the great big dinosaur holiday in the snow the great big dinosaur holiday in the snow ?????? 

[00:10:10]


[cheering] 
>> yay! It finally stopped snowing, eh? 
>> And here's the special work train righ time. 
>> [Indistinct chatter] 
>> whoa! What's that thing, mr. Conductor? 
>> A snowplow blade for the dinosaur train. It will help us clear the track as we roll on home. 
>> Whoa! Cool! 
>> We should be ready to plow our way out of here any minute, folks. 
>> Um, dad, do I have time to say good-bye to my friend soren? 
>> Uh, ok, but don't be too long. 
>> I won't. Come on, guys. We can all say good-bye. 
>> [Giggling] 
>> awk! 
>> Bbbbblll! Hi, don! 
>> Oh, there you are. Hi, soren. Meet my brother and sisters--buddy, tiny, and shiny. 
>> Hello! 
>> Hi. I loved your singing last night. The music warmed my heart, which helped keep my little ones warm, too. 
>> Little ones? You mean your eggs? 
>> Nope. I mean, my little ones. 
>> [Squeaking] 
>> aw. 
>> They're so cute. 
>> And you stayed warm after all. 
>> Of course. Creatures living in cold climates know how to survive no matter how chilly the weather gets. 
[Train whistle blows] 
>> phew. It's time to head home, kids. Heh. The passenger coach is nice and warm. 
>> Come back and visit, don. We can build that snowosaur of yours. 
>> That would be fun, soren. We will one day. Bye! 
>> Bye, soren! Bye, babies! Happy winter solstice! 
>> Stay warm. 
>> Hey, dad. Turns out warm-blooded soren was warm enough to hatch all her eggs last night. 
>> Really? That's great, don. 
>> You know what else is great? We're at the north pole, and my winter wish came true. This was the best solstice day ever. Thanks, dad. 

[00:12:12]


>> Ok, don. Now let's make my wish come true. Let's get out of the cold! Ha ha ha! 
[Whistle blows?? 
>> bye! 
>> Bye-bye! 
>> All right. Hey. Come back soon, eh? 
>> Hi, there. I'm dr. Scott the paleontologist, and this is saurornitholestes, a little theropod that lived in north america, including way up north in the arctic. How did such a small dinosaur survive the cold weather? Well, some paleontologists like me think that saurornitholestes and its relatives were warm-blooded. Warm-blooded animals like birds and mammals have to eat plenty of food to stay warm and to stay active, but one of the great things about being warm-blooded is that you can be active not just during the day but at night, as well. Most animals, like fish, reptiles, and insects are cold-blooded. They depend on the sun to warm them up every day, so most of them aren't active at night. Cold-blooded animals don't have to eat that much or that often. Some, like crocodiles, can go for months without eating, but you and i and all humans have to eat more often because we are warm-blooded. Here are some warm-blooded animals alive today that live in a very cold place, penguins. They stay warm by eating a lot of fish, and like saurornitholestes, penguins are covered with feathers, which helps them hold on to their body heat. Brr. When I'm in really cold weather, I wish I had a covering of feathers. Ok. Keep watching for more dinosaur discoveries. 
>> Hello, folks. It's me the conductor. Today the family visits the north pole to see a light show in the sky called aurora borealis, so come on along with me on the dinosaur train! All aboard! 

[00:14:20]


>> Happy, winter solstice day, everyone. 
>> Yay! Winter solstice day! Wait. What's winter solstice day again? 
>> Winter solstice is the shortest day of the year. That means it's also the longest night of the year. 
>> Correct, mrs. P, and it marks the beginning of winter. 
>> Yay! 
>> You know, mr. And mrs. P, I've got an idea for a special solstice treat for your kids. 
[Whispering] 
>> [giggling] 
>> awk! Kids, since we're up in the north pole area and it is solstice day, the conductor has a fantastic idea. 
>> Ahem. I thought it would be fun for us to go to the festival of lights! 
>> What's the festival of lights? 
>> I was anticipating that question, miss tiny. Let me put it this way. What are your favorite colors? 
>> Blue! 
>> Green! And I also like blue. 
>> Red, orange, and yellow! And green. 
>> Anything shiny! 
>> Well, you'll see all of those colors are at the festival of lights in the night sky. 
>> Wow! Really? 
>> You know, the lights in the night sky have another name, too. They're called aurora borealis. 
>> Aurora who? 
>> Aurora borealis isn't a who but a what. It's a very colorful effect that sometimes happens in the sky. Observe. We all know that the sun gives off lots of light and heat, but it also shoots out little, tiny particles that travel superfast through space toward the earth. 
>> Whoa! Amazing! 
>> It is amazing, buddy. The tiny pbrticles are so small, they don't hurt anything. In fact, you can't see them. 
>> So how do we know they're even there? 
>> Well, when they hit other particles in the earth's atmosphere, they glow, and that produces lights! 
>> Awk! It looks like the best light show ever! And it's made by the sun? 

[00:16:20]


>> Indeed it is. It happens all winter, but it's particularly beautiful at solstice time and way up north. 
>> All those colors are in the sky? 
>> Awk! It must be so cool to see! 
>> What a great solstice present to see the aurora bore--um, what? What is it called again? 
>> Aurora borealis. 
>> Aurora borealis. 
>> I want to see it right now! 
>> You know what? So do i! Next stop, aurora borealis station. 
>> [Cheering] yay! 
>> Wow. It's already dark. 
> Sure, buddy. It's solstice time, the shortest day of the year. Up here, it's pretty much nighttime all the time. 
>> So where are the lights? 
>> Hello? Festival of lights? We're here! 
[Echoing] 
>> maybe we came on the wrong day. 
>> Or maybe we're early. 
>> You're right, buddy. We are early. The aurora borealis will come out later tonight. 
>> Ok. No problem. We just have to wait until it gets a little later. 
>> Right. The festival of lights is definitely worth waiting for. 
>> Hey, everyone.

>> [Cheering] 
>> hi, there. I'm dr. Scott the paleontologist. Do you know where you can see the greatest light show ever? Up in the sky. Nature regularly puts on an amazing light show in the north called the aurora borealis and another in the south called the aurora australis. These colorful light shows happen when particles from the sun mix with the magnetic field high above the earth. The aurora borealis has been around for millions and millions of years, so dinosaurs saw these light shows, too. Today, the best places to see the aurora borealis are up north in states like minnesota and alaska and in countries like canada. That's why we call this spectalar light show the northern lights, and down in australia and new zealand, they get to watch the southern lights. No question, the aurora is one of the most amazing shows on earth. Ok. Remember, get outside, get into nature, and make your own discoveries. 
>> You're going to the north pole in mid-winter! 
>> Yeah! We're gonna see snow! 
>> Whatever that is! 
>> You know how rain sometimes falls from the clouds? 
>> Yeah! 
>> When the air gets cold enough, the rain freezes and turns into snowflakes! 
>> When it snows, I'm gonna do a snow dance! ?????? Da da da da da da da ?????? snow! 

[00:26:35]

You lost a baby; you miscarried. Mm-hmm. It's been a rough road back. He was working really hard when I was pregnant. He was taking good care of us. But once we lost the baby, you know, things just fell off. Mr. Goodlett, what has changed since she lost the baby? What's different and how are you different? Announcer: She's the judge who gives rules on the law and life. She's intense with common sense. She's Judge Lynn Toler. OnDivorce Court, where real couples deal with real life. When Lauren and Raheem met at a party four years ago, they felt an instant love connection, and their relationship was great until she miscarried their first baby six months ago. Now their relationship has become unmoored, and they aren't sure if they can rekindle thing feeling. It's been some rough times, but in the last six months things have just deteriorated to a place where I don't even know what to do with him anymore. If we can't reconcile things, I don't know how we're gonna move forward in this relationship My girl, she's always going through these mood swings, and I want to make sure that we can get past this. Over the last few months, things have been rough. Announcer: Both Lauren and Raheem say they still love each other with all their hearts, but will love be enough to get them to the altar? Today onDivorce Court Before Your Vows. Bailiff: All rise! Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge Lynn Toler presiding. You may be seated. This is the case of Lauren Piselli v. Raheem Goodlett. The two of you have been engaged for four years. You're here because you don't know whether or not you should get married, and you would like my opinion on the matter. You have a marriage license, and you have given me 

[00:02:02]


your permission to tear it up if I feel that the marriage is ill-advised. But before we've done that, I've given you compatibility tests, which were interesting. And I also want to talk to you a little bit about your relationship. So I'm gonna start with you, Ms. Piselli, and why don't you tell me a little bit about your relationship and why you're worried about whether or not you should marry? Okay, well, um, my goody bear and I, we've been together for four years. Goody bear? My goody bear. All right. That's my bear. And I love him with all of my heart, Your Honor, absolutely. But he's always been... one of the biggest issues is that he's been, uh, challenged in the world of employment, shall we say? Um, you know, the work is there. Sometimes it's steady, sometimes it pays well, sometimes it's not there at all. Like, early on in our relationship, he was working as a dishwasher in a restaurant. It wasn't the most glamorous job, but it was steady and he was making all right money and it was good. So I called over there one day 'cause I was supposed to run some errands for him in the afternoon. I wanted to check in with him, make sure everything was all right. I called the place up and the guy on the line tell me, "Oh, Goody, he hasn't been here in two weeks." And he'd been getting up every day and coming home like he'd been at work. Mr. Goodlett, were you going out and pretending that you were at work and you had actually quit? Yeah, I had quit. Um, the thing was I felt like the job was very demeaning. Demeaning. It was a job. I'd stay for all hours of the night. Everybody else from the kitchen, from the whole restaurant is gone. I'd be there till 4:00 in the morning washing dishes. Right. You know, I'd get these blisters on my hands. He's so delicate. And I just felt like I wasn't making enough money. Yeah, yeah. It's not about demeaning, it's about the money. It may not be what you wanted, but until you get what you want, it's what you have, so you deal with that so you cantinue to get better, right? I'm a ambitious person anyway. So I'm always gonna go out there and look for more and seek more, so that's what I did. But don't give up what you have before y you seek more. But anyway, Ms. Piselli, go forward. 

[00:04:02]


What else is the problem? You want to talk about degrading? Okay, so right now he is selling incense. You know, like you walk through New York City and there are guys on the corner selling their incense and their and their CDs? That's my boo. Incense, soap and CDs? Yeah, whatever's on the table that day, you know? You selling incense, soap and CDs? Yeah, you know, I got the incense. I'm out there hustling my frankincense. And you know, I got my soaps, my black soaps. You know, you got some nice skin. That black soap will work wonders on you. Oh, so this is for women of color? This is for women of color. Soap for women of color? Yeah, I work uptown in Harlem. Uh-huh. And then CDs? Mix tapes, you know. I got Teddy Pendergrass, Luther Vandross, stuff you might like. Mr. Goodlett, I will tell you this. At least you got some people who actually can carry a tune and got a melody. Yeah, yeah. You know, Teddy and all that, not hippity-rippity-rop. Yeah. I'll give you props for good taste in music, Mr. Goodlett. Thank you. Now listen, he's getting his hustle on, right? Mm-hmm. And some men are meant to work for themselves. Right. Maybe he's that guy. Does he bring home money from his hustle? He does, he does. He's certainly going to always claim perhaps a little bit more than what he actually brings home. Well, how much does he bring home any given week? I always bring home my quota. He says he always tries to make his quota: $100 a day. Every day he's supposed to be bringing home a $100 from his hustle. And does he? Not every day, no. Yes, I do. No, you don't! Do you work? Yes, ma'am, I do, I do. And what do you do? I am the office manager at a holistic wellness center. Okay, that's a good job. It's a respectable title. I'm only working part-time, I admit. Your Honor, she don't make no money there. She don't make no money. When you say "No money," how much is no money? I mean, she brings home these little punk checks for $250. I make at least $500, $600 a week going out there with my hustle. She's always knocking me for my hustle, but yet she's bringing home less money than me. How you gonna knock him for his hustle 

[00:06:02]


if he's bringing home more money? Okay, my co-workers, people I work with at my office, they saw my babe on the corner with his hustle, they come to me, like, "What, is he homs? "What's going on? "Why is he out there on the street like that? What's he doing?" How am I supposed to show him respect? I don't think you should be embarrassed by that, you know? You show him respect 'cause daddy came home with some money. Thank you. That's what you get respect for. You don't have to worry about what your friends think. Announcer : WhenDivorce Court Before Your Vows continues, can Lauren recover and save her relationship with Raheem? You know, we used to have tons of sex and all of that. Now she's like, she just, she lays around, she's wearing these frumpy clothes. It wasn't like that before, you know? And I feel it's because of the loss of our baby, you know? Gallery: Aw...

ANNOUNCER: Divorce court: Before Your Vows is back with the case of Lauren Piselli, who says she's having second thoughts about marrying her boyfriend of four years, because he doesn't have a steady job. But are the couple's divergent backgrounds the real cause of their growing estrangement? Does your family not like her, and why don't they like her? Mr. Goodlett, why don't you tell me what it is about Ms. Piselli that has you concerned, with respect to the option of marriage? Well, um, you know, we used to have tons of sex and all of that, Now she's like, she's... she just... She lays around, she's wearing these frumpy clothes. Like, she doesn't initiate any contact. It's just... it's all one-sided on that, and... Mm-hmm. ...it wasn't like that before. You know? And I... and I feel it's because of the loss of our baby. You know? (gallery murmurs sadly) Now, you lost a baby. Mm-hmm. How long ago? (choked up): It was about six months ago. Six months ago. You miscarried. Mm-hmm. And since then, the intimacy has-has decreased. There have been issues, yeah. Yeah. Uh, have you... is it emotional issues as well? I mean, is it just not an intimacy thing, it's just you feel... Well, you know... ...badly? Uh, it's been a rough road back. Right. You know, um... I didn't even think that I could get pregnant, so... You were surprised and happy. I was surprised that it even happened. Right. Um, and he was working really hard when I was pregnant. He was taking good care of us. But once we lost the baby, you know, things just fell off. And, um, you know, I haven't felt like the sexiest woman in the world or whatever... Right. ...money's tight and we always have these isss, and then he's out all the time since I miscarried. Uh-huh. Righ Like, he used to go out and it was cool, but now he's out almost every night. Mr. Goodlett, wh changed... since she lost the baby? What's different, and how are you different? Just her moods, you know. You know, I-I've changed a lot, too, 'cause, uh, you know, that really hurt me a lot. But I was able to get past it... Mm-hmm. ...I guess a little quicker than her. And I try to encourage her, Itry to be compassionate, understanding... 

[00:11:30]


He tells me to get over it. To get over it. Do you tell her to get over it? "Baby, we gotta get over this. We gotta get over this." It's been months, Your Honor. I-I... you know, I want her to get back on track. Try to do things for her that might make her happy. You know, like... Such as? Like, I bought her, you know, a little lingerie, bustier, with the edible panties and stuff like that. Well, that was for you. No, that was for us. (gallery laughs) That was for us. Edible? You know, I'm a big guy, I like my candy. You know? Okay, all right. So I, you know, I... I try to... I try to... get her nice things that... Nice? Edible? You know, to get the spark back. I'm classy. Do I look like I'm gonna be wearing stuff that's gonna melt underneath my clothes? I... you... Uh, no. You're not supposed to look like anything. You're just supposed to be with me. I think you were just hungry, my love. (laughs) I was. Well, uh, before I get to... to part I want to get to, I want... You both have trouble with your families, respectively. Why don't you start me out, Mr. Goodlett? Does your family not like her, and why don't they like her? I don't think it's the fact that they don't like her. They just... They call me "Snow Bunny." They really don't know her... They call me "Snow Bunny." (laughing) Do they call her Snow Bunny? Yeah, they call her Snow Bunny, but... And he giggles, he giggles. I spoke to them about it, you know. It was kind of funny. She looked like a snow bunny. I mean, you know... On a particular day she looked... Yeah, on a particular day. What, did she have a bunch of white fur on or something? Yeah, she had on a parka or something. Yeah. Like she came from the mountain. Okay, she looked like a snow bunny. Yeah. That's not it. Was it a term of endearment? No, ma'am. No. No, ma'am, they do not like me. No way? No, it wasn't. No, it wasn't. Okay, you weren't even gonna go it like that. No, no, they do not like me. But it was funny at the time. Uh-huh. And she... she blew up off of that. Okay. Does your family like him? Not particularly, no. What don't they like about him? Well, uh, you know, I come from a very old-school Italian background. They believe in working very hard, and they also don't believe in mixed-race relationships, so that's an issue, um, that we have. But I think that, you know, my people would probably get over the fact that, you know, we're mixed, if he were a little more respectable in terms of his employment. And maybe being around the house, instead of me going over to my family's home and crying into my coffee about 

[00:13:30]


"He was out last night. "I feel like he doesn't want to talk to me. "Where is he? Why can't I get a hold of you?" You know? If I had... didn't have to bring that to my family... Family, yeah... ...they might... Let me say this... But these are things that... No, no, no, no. Let me... let me say this. A key to in-law wrangling. Don't go to your in-laws and tell them what you don't ke about your man. Because that's all they see. Because when something good happens, boy, he really threw down last night in bed, you don't call Mama and tell her that. (laughs) Yes. All she gets is the bad stuff. Your Honor, a deadbeat. The good stuff, they don't hear, so they get a really negative picture. Don't go like that. Announcer: WhenDivorce Court: Before Your Vows continues, what does Lauren say to have Judge Lynn singing her praises? Mrs. Piselli... just when I had lost hope for all of humanity, you show up here and knock it out of the park. Should you marry someone if your family doesn't approve of them? Call: ...to vote now, and see if America agrees with your opinion. You'll also receive some valuable offers. Alka-Seltzer Truth. I have a cold, and I took nyquil, but I'm still "stubbed" up.

But is her nagging really what's bringing this relationship down? I've never understood the blowing up the phone part. If he doesn't answer at 12:01, why call him at 12:05, 12:07, 12:10, 12:15? I don't understand that. Here's the time in the Before Your Vowssession that I ask the stupidest question in the world. But I'm gonna do it anyway just 'cause. I'm gonna look at you and give you 60 seconds to give me the best and hardest sell on why you two should marry and what it is about him that makes him the guy you want to commit your life to. Sell it like a job. Go. I love Goody with all my heart. And out of every man I've ever been with, I know that underneath all his hustle and his swag, he is nothing but one giant heart. When I'm in his arms, I feel like the whole world could tumb down around us and we'd still be able to hang onto each other. And that means more to me than pretty much anything else. Like, beyond the money, beyond the baby, beyond everything, you know, we have a connection, and we have from the get. We have from the get. (applause) Mrs. Piselli, just when I had lost hope for all of humanity, you show up here and knock it out of the park. God bless you. Now, wait a minute, the bar has been set high.

She's the light of my life because, you know, the way I met her was on my birthday and that's my Boo-Boo. You know, we go out, we do things. Um, she's just a great person to be around. She's very understanding, for the most part. You know, I didn't really expect her to have anybody... Don't drift. Don't drift. Stay on task. I didn't really expect to have anybody come into my life and love me the way that she has, you know. She-she underst-- for the most part, she does understand my hustle. She understands that I want to get up and make our situation better. You know, and I really respect that, you know. She's a really good girl, you know. She tries her best at home. And, uh, I love her to death. (chuckles) I'm a give you a B-minus. B-minus? Okay? (laughter) Which etter than most people do. Okay. You know what I mean? It was better than most people do.

ANNOUNCER: Divorce Court: Before Your Vows returns with the case of Lauren Piselli and Raheem Goodlett, who have been dating for four years and have come before Judge Lynn to see if they should marry. What does he need to change in order for you to say "I do"? Well, he could start by answering his phone. I do answer my phone, all the time. You do not answer your phone. He's got... Are you owing his phone up? Your Honor, she calls all the time. Are you blowing his phone up? She's blowing my phone up... When he's out till 4:00 in the morning and I don't hear boo-peep from him, yes, I am blowing up his phone. He's got three of them, all pay-as-you-go. I never understood the blowing up the phone part. If he doesn't answer at 12:01, why call him at 12:05, 12:07, 12:10, 12:15? I dounderstand that. What you nto do is when he can't-- Talk to him when he gets back, not when you're angry, and say, "Look, I thought-- I didn't know where you were, "it concerned me. "I thought it was disrespectful. "Can we make a way that you can call me, tell you where you are and work something out?" That's what you do. And then, as a man of honor and respect, what would you say in response to a request like that? I'm fine with it. Like I tell her, I don't have a problem answering my phone. Yes, you do. It's just, sometimes I can't answer my phone. And I always tell you, I will call you back when the opportunity's right. You don't have to blow my phone up. Maybe I'm busy doing something at the... But what are you doing? Yeah, at 4:00 a.m., what are you busy with? You know, I could, I could be talking to somebody I'm trying to make a sale to or whatever. At 4:00 a.m.? No, not at 4:00 a.m. You know, at 4:00 a.m., I'm probably sleep at my mother's house or something. Oh, yeah, that's it, that's it. "Oh, Boo-Boo, I'm sorry." Three nights a week, you come home at 4:00 in the morning. "Oh, Boo-Boo, I fell asleep on my boy's couch. We were watching a movie." "Oh, Boo, I had to help my mom." Mr. Goodlett, what do you expect to change when you get married? are you looking to accomplish by saying "I do"? Well, first thing I'm looking to accomplish is spend the rest of my life with her. You know, um... (gallery aahing) Uh, I really feel like the problems that we're going 

[00:27:33]

(laughter) I like you people a lot. I see what you like in him and I see what you like in her. I respect your hustle. Thank you. I wouldn't be comfortable with it on an ongoing basis, just 'cause that's the kind-- you know, I'm not a secure individual. But I respect your hustle. I think you could do more than what you're doing with your hustle. I think you're a capable guy. Don't get comfortable with the corner. That's all I'm asking. Please. You take what you've got-- and you've got a lot-- and move forward with it. Uh, you got to respect his hustle, 'cause he's hustling more than you. Money is what money is. It doesn't come tagged with "But he got it on the corner." It still pays the bills just like anything else. I know, I know. You need to get-- if you're not comfortable with your particular position, you need to get further employed. Period. All right, okay. Don't I say that all the time? You got to come to the table with it. You can't just point across and say, "I'm uncomfortable." You have to do something about it yourself. And J'm telling you to do all this. I'm telling you to love each other. I'm telling you to work harder. I'm telling you to have a conversation. I'm telling you to answer the phone. I'm telling you to don blow up his phone, because it'll help you out when you do ultimately get married, which I really hope you do. Good luck to both of you. Thank you. This matter is adjourned. Thank you. (applause) Bailiff: All rise! Parties may leave the courtroom. So... So she says it's a good idea. So that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go ahead with this, we're gonna get married.

Ng in a boat. We're holding out for some moderate to extreme 
>>> obama anoehner are face-to-face. They troo to stave off the fiscal cliff. 
>> Susan rice out of the running. The president's u.N. Ambassador gives up on her hopes to be next secretary of state. 
>> And bullets fly as the camera rolls. Video captures the moment shots ring out aboard a train. Good morning. Welcome to "early start" this friday morning. I'm christine romans. 
>> I'm john berman. It is 5:00 a.M. In the east. 
>> We have breaking news this morning. It's a big development in the fight against syria and a new level of u.S. Involvement. We just learned within the past few hours the defense secretary leon panetta signed an order sending two patriot missile batteries to turkey. That's to assist that nation in defending against any pollible military action by syria. This move was expected as the civil war in syria destabilizes the assad regime with each passing day. In addition to this, 400 u.S. Troops are going to turkey. They will be deployed to operate the missile batteries. Cnn's nick payton walsh has the development. 
>> Reporter: Good morning. 400 personnel will be accompanying the batteries. Let me give you history. Over the past two months, we saw sporadic exchanges of fire across the border. Syrian military firing into turkey causing often destruction and death. Turkey often responding. That brought about this request to nato for patriot missile batteries. They're supposed to be there. This particular type better at taking out missiles in the sky rather than taking down aircraft. But this move part of a nato response. Also supplied by germany and holland whose parliament last week approved their contributions. The u.S., Though, of course, putting a number of people on the ground. Many observers saying that now nato has physical troops and presence in the area that it risks somehow being dragged into this particular conflict. Everybody is stressing these are purely there to defend turkey, a staunch nato member. John? 

[00:02:25]


>> They still come as the u.S. Offered diplomatic recognition to the rebels in syria and with 400 u.S. Troops there, it does give the u.S. Some skin in this game. 
>> Reporter: Absolutely. I don't think the troops will be involved. Skin in the game, certainly. The obama administration though many say caught between two different sides here. At the same time, the day before they gave some kind of lower level diplomatic recognition to the syrian government. The dayore that they were a terror group, one of the more hard line parts of the rebel front responsible for many victories, considered islamic hard-liners. To many degrees they're heroes because they've been taking out so many regime outposts. The u.S. Response in the past, 48 hours. Significantly more complicated. And now as you say, skin in the game. 
>> Nick peyton walsh, watching all the developments going on. Thank you. 
>>> And now the fiscal cliff. There is little progress and a whole lot of frank. Here's what we mean. In 18 days we go ov the edge triggering tax hikes and sweeping cuts. Last night president obama called john boehner and asked him to meet again at the white house. They spent a little less than an hour ago. Was it a good talk? Was it a productive talk? Afterward, both side said they called their discussion frank and said the lines of communication remain open. That to be frank doesn't seem to get us anywhere closer to a deal though. Dana bash joins us from washington. Speaker boehner plans to go home to ohio today. 
>> Reporter: That's right. He is on his way if not there already. And, you know, you talked about the word frank that was used by both parties, by the white house and by the speaker's office. Just like they did over the weekend they put out identical statements, really one sentence statements. Diplomatic terms, frank means not so good. And that's the same word that the speaker used a couple days ago to describe their meeting on sunday which we understand from sources was pretty tense. Juhe fact that they only met for 50 minutes is indicative of the fact that the meeting didn't produce very much. Now I understand from democratic sources earlier in the day yesterday that they were going to try to invite the speaker over to the white house to get things moving before he went home to ohio to perhaps put a few of the spending cuts that the speaker has been demanding on the table to try to, you know, cut a -- break this deadlock. Doesn't seem like they got very far. 

[00:04:56]


>> We've had dead locks before in washington and they've, you know, with much pain been resolved. You talked to two former senate majority leaders from opposite sides of the aisle on how to make a deal. What did they say? 
>> Talk. I mean it's as simple as that. Just keep talking. You're right, these were two people who were on opposite sides of the aisle leading the senate for six years together. Trent lott the republican, tom daschle the democrat. Here'shat they said about the art of doing something really really tough. 
>> There will come a moment when the speaker is going to have to, you know, make a decision on that and the president is going to have to make a decision on what he's going to do in return . But they need to do it in concert. You have to have the winds and the brass come together. 
>> Hold hands and jump off the cliff together? 
>> Yeah. It will be more fun on the way down. At least you have company. 
>> And I have to tell you, just in the halls of congress talking to lawmakers all day long every day, there is really a lot of angst and not a lot of optimism that they're really going to get this deal done. And that really is a big, big difference between what i covered those two men in the last decade and what's going on now. Used to be you used to stand in the hallways and wait to see when the deal would get done and what would it look like? And now it's will the deal get done? And it really is a different kind of atmosphere. 
>> Reminds me kind of the government shutdown in '96. Will it happen? It will never happen and then it happened and then got resolved. Dana bash, thank you. 
>> To be frank, not very good news. 
>>> The other mammoth news, of course, in washington, the stunner from ambassador susan rice. She'll meet today with the president afr taking herself out of the running to be the next secretary of state n a letter to the president, rice said, the confirmation process would be lengthy, disruptive and costly to you and our most pressing national and international priorities. That tradeoff is simply not worth it to our country. President obama talked about her decision last night. 

[00:07:06]


>> I hadn't made a decision about who would be my next secretary of state. There's no doubt that susan was qualified. There are other people who are qualified as well. Her interest is in serving me but most importantly in serving the country. And she's done an outstanding job. She will continue to be one of the top members of my national security team. 
>> Rice drew heavy criticism from republicans over her statements after the attack on the u.S. Mission in benghazi in libya when she said the violence started over anger about an anti-muslim film. The attack now known to be terror, killed u.S. Ambassador to libya chris stevens and three other americans. In five minutes we're going to talk about now who is in the running to be the next secretary of state. I think the short list is down to essentially one. 
>> There will be a funeral service in st. Louis today for dallas cowboys football player jerry brown. He died in a suspected drunk driving accident on saturday. His teammate and friend josh brent was behind the wheel. Police releasing this new video of the wreck as well as 911 calls they received in the moments after it happened. 
>> I don't know. I just drove past it. It's like it just happened. The car was up side down and there was smoke everywhere. 
>> Josh brent is free on $500,000 bail. He's facing intoxication manslaughter charges. 
>> Philadelphia police are searching for two young men involved in a shooting aboard an elevated train. This incident caught on tape. Video captured a confrontation between a few young men who were arguing over a baseball game. That's when one of the suspects as he was leaving turned and fired a gun, a handgun into the train. Wow. Look at that. Two people were wounded in this attack. 
>> Celebrations on the streets of pyongyang, north koreans clinking beer mugs and dancing onidewalks following the country's first successful launch into space. Even the supreme leader got into the act. The north korean government releasing this photo of the launch as leaders in washington, tokyo and seoul all call for punishment insisting that successful deployment moves north koreans one step closer to being able to launch nuclear weapons across the pacific. 

[00:09:20]


>> So the basketball game between bloomington south and arlington high would be a disservice to blowouts. The two girls took the field and when it was over, bloomington high came out on top 107 to 2. 
>> Must have been something wrong with that scoreboard. 
>> That's a difference of 105 points. Aim assured here. The arlington girls could only manage two free throws the entire contest. Now as you can imagine, the bloomington coach, the coach that scored 107 is taking a lot of heat online for piling on. Some people calling for him to be fired. 
>> You're the sports guy. If you're winning and team is good, do you keep scoring the points? 
>> I'm a dad, if my kids were ever on the side, it would break my heart. That's all I can say. I guess I just took sides. 
>>> In the 8:00 a.M. Of "starting poinwe're going to talk to the arlington team. She's going to talk about what it's like tose a game by 105 points. 
>>> A message angers some people. It's an interesting story and it's coming up. ] mark.

>>> The attack over benghazi leads to a shocker. Susan rice is taking herself out of the running. She'll not succeed secretary of state hillary clinton. She explained in a letter to president obama saying the confirmation process would be lengthy, disruptive and costly to you and our most pressing national and international priorities. That tradeoff is simply not worth it to our country. Those words from susan rice. Foreign affairs reporter is in washington with the latest. Susan rice meeting with the president today. 
>> That's right, john. They'll be meeting with the president and her -- president obama said and her aides tell me that ambassador rice will stay at the u.N. And that she'll continue to be a very close adviser to the president and the president's cabinet. You know, some of the aides said she was up for the fight with the senate. She was u for defending her possible candidacy but they did the math, john. They saw that these attacks had stopped benghazi, they morphed into other areas. They felt it detracted from the more successful work she did have at the u.N. Such as getting really tough sanctions on iran and really fighting for action in libya, u.S. Military action to get rid of muammar qaddafi. Let's take a listen to what ambassador rice said yesterday about why she resigned. 
>> I??withdrew my name because i think it's the right thing for the country. I think it's the right thing for the president. And putting those things together, that makes it the right thing for me and my family. 
>> So she'll stay on the team, john, and some people say that she could have a future role in the administration, a different role later on. 
>> They've been fairly explicit e could end up as onal security adviser one day and then perhaps this four-year term get another shot at being secretary of state. As foro will be the next secretary of state, the short list seems to be essentially down to one person. 

[00:15:35]


>> That's right. One person who the senate has said would be easily confirmed. It's their colleague senator john kerry. The chairman of the senate foreign relations committee. Senator kerry is seen as someone who's really has a lot of stature in the world. He's been doing foreign policy for many decades. If you remember, he was one of president obama's kind of mentors during the debate process, prepping him for debates. And he's seen as someone who has relationships, john, around the whole world with world leaders, someone that really could be very effective in u.S. Diplomacy. 
>> He made it clear he wanted this job for a long, long time. 
>> No secret. 
>> You know, massachusetts, that's where senator john kerry serves. He would have to give up his seat there. There is a lot of talk about who would succeed him. What would happen up there? 
>> That is one of the considerations in whether they would tap senator kerry for the post. The front-runner for that seat is scott brown. He's a former senator from massachusetts who just won his re-election. So I think that the administration was loathe to give up the senate seat. But they did pick up a couple seats for the past election. So if they do pick senator kerry, they feel they can live without it. He made no secret he wants the and practically the entire senate said he'd be easily confirmed and excellent choice. Certainly president obama would love to get that behind him. 
>> That's right. There would be a special election in massachusetts, 145 days after kerry gives up his seat and scott brown easily the front-runner in that race. Thank you very much. 
>>> It is 17 minutes after the hour this friday morning. Let's get you up to date with the morning's top stories. President obama, house speaker john boehner going face-to-face behind closed doors of the white house again. With 18 days remaining before america goes over the fiscal cliff, there is still no sign of a deal. Both sides calling yesterday's talks frank and insisting the lines of communication remain open. 
>>> A man fatally shot himself inside a clerk's office at the federal courthouse in birmingham, alabama. The u.S. Marshal service says he worked in the building and slipped a gun past security because he used an employee entrance, not a public one. Visitors have to pass through metal detectors. Police say no one in the courthouse was threatened. 

[00:17:51]


>>> So the university of miami has apologized for a text mess an gaffe sent over to emergency notification network. It warned of a blackan on campus and what he was wearing. That text raised eyebrows as there are many black men on campus. The complete text should have said that was the description of a man wanted for stealing a student's laptop. It was a game of hot potato thursday night. The eagles had a punt blocked by their own teammate. They lost at home to the bengals. They drop to 4-10. Cincinnati keeps play-off hopes alive by improving to 8-6. 
>> That was awful. Look out for the bengals. They can play some football. 
>>> All right. It is 18 minutes after the hour now. Time for "early read." We're revealing the story in the chicago sun times where one lawmaker is proposing fines as $1,000 and six months in jail for pigeon feeders. He said he's tired of seeing parts of town being seen from a movie from "the birds." He said bird droppings a quarter inch thick in some spots. There are cull pretties that feed the birds three or four pounds of bread four times a day. One of these feeders is known as the pigeon lady. 
>>> All right. Get back here with my driveway. Police arrested a man accused of stealing someone's driveway. Brick by brick. The neighbor called deputies reporting two people with truck removing the bricks. About 300 square feet of them are gone and a few days later they came back for more. Police found 40 to 50 bricks in the bed of the guy's truck. I once did a story about the landscaping that kept disappearing from people's houses. They would put brand new landscaping in, like a 200 tree and the next day it is gone. 
>> That is fairly aggressive though, stealing someone's driveway.

>> Stock futures are up a little bit. Worries of the fiscal cliff are still around despite upbeat data yesterday. Mildly positive data in the u.S. The s&p 500 snapped a six-day winning streak yesterday. In part because still concerned about progress in the fiscal cliff. If congress fails to reach a deal on the fiscal cliff, more than two million long term unemployed americans will see the federal jobless benefits DISAPPEAR COME JANUARY 1st. Long term employed, those out of work for 40 weeks or more currently make up 40% of the unemployed population. Many will lose federal benefits. They serve as a life line to many of the people that have been out of work for so long. And of all the fiscal cliff issues, there's one that many middle class americans will certainly feel right away. That's the payroll tax holiday. Comes directly from your paycheck and funds social security. For the first two years they've been paying a rate of 4.2%. In 2013, that rate is set to go back up. Someone making $50,000 a year will see $19 less in their take-home pay per week. Payroll tax cut, a small piece of a fiscal cliff puzzle would have a direct, direct effect on your paycheck, folks. 
>> But this is the payroll tax cut. It wasn't really part of the fiscal cliff issues. This is happening independently. 
>> It is. But the president would like to continue the payroll tax holiday. And you're hearing some mumbling around from some people on the right that they don't want to raise taxes on anybody. So there's some soul searching going on the payroll tax cut and whether that would stay or go. Two months ago, I would have told you no way it comes back. Now, they're talking about it again. I'm on the edge. 

[00:26:06]


>> In their frank discussions. 
>> Yeah, in their frank discussions with open lines of communication. 
>> Which have been very frank, frankly.

This move was expected as syrian civil war destabilizes the assad regime with each passing day. 400 u.S. Troops are going to be deployed to operate these missile batteries. Turkey, of course, borders syria and thousands of rebels and refugees from syria have fled to turkey for safety.

>>> President obama and house speaker john boehner meeting for nearly an hour yesterday evening in a fiscal cliff showdown. With 18 days remaining before we go over the edge, both sides are saying that "lines of communication remain open." Most of us have been stressing over the thousands of extra dollars you may have to fork over to uncle sam next year. Along with sequestration come sweeping spending cuts, too. Here's cnn pentagon correspondent chris lawrence. 
>> Reporter: To hear the pentagon tell it -- 
>> sequestration, therefore, if it were allowed to happen, would introduce senseless chaos. 
>> Reporter: The fiscal cliff -- 
>> sequestration will have a chaotic infect on the force. Is akin to armageddon. 
>> What I worry about is being blindsided by a huge cut because they don't have the strength or the courage or the guts to do what they have to do. 
>> Happy holidays. 
>> Reporter: The cliff would cut $500 billion in defense spending but spread out over the next ten years. Would these cuts really be that bad? 
>> Absolutely not. 
>> Reporter: Analyst ben freeman says the pentagon can survive on a smler budget. 
>> Sequestration happens, it will drop a little bit. It's certainly not catastrophic or doomsday or any of other sort hyperbole. 
>> Reporter: Perhaps the navy has to buy less advanced fighter jets. Or the pentagon would have to cut the number of soldiers and marines back to the levels before 9/11. 
>> Sequestration would risk hollowing out our force. 
>> Reporter: Pentagon officials say going over the cliff would actually leave them a trillion dollars in the hole because it comes on top of cuts they have already budgeted for. 
>> We've put in place $487 billion in savings over the next ten years. 
>> Reporter: Are these cuts the same sort of budget cuts that you and I think of when we think of cutting our budget? 

[00:33:11]


>> I call them phantom cuts. It's not a real saving. 
>> Reporter: Freeman says the pentagon is counting money that it was projecting to spend as savings. Which he says, isn't the same as simply spending less. 
>> But this is the way d.C. Does math. It's unfortunate that you and i can't do our taxes like. That but it's the way they seem to do business here. 
>> Reporter: A senior defense official admits that everyone at the pentagon from the secretary on down is on autopilot to defend their budget. Even though he feels that they need people to go in and challenge their costs, he argues that's better done over time, not forced on them by the fiscal cliff. Chris lawrence, cnn, the pentagon. 
>>> Ambassador susan rice meets with president obama today after making a stunning announcement. She's out of the running to succeed outgoing secretary of state hillary clinton. Few republicans criticized her over statements she made after the attack on the u.S. Mission in benghazi. The attack known to be terror killed the u.S. Ambassador to america, chris stevens. She made television interviews and said it appeared to come from an andy islam film. 
>> The mall outside portland whe a gunman killed two people on tuesday, a third person krit ukly hurt. The gunman jacob roberts took his own life. His motive is still not clear. Roberts' aunt raised him after his mother died and calls herself his mom. She says he lost his way after an injury. 
>> Jake was going to be a warrior. He was going to be a hero. And he was going to join the marines. And then he broke his foot and he couldn't be a marine because he got five pins in his foot. So he couldn't be a marine anymorement and then he lost purpose. He lost, like -- that is what he was going to do. 

[00:35:15]


>> There will be a candlelight vigil tonight outside the mall. 
>>> Dramatic dash cam video of a police chase in south carolina that had a deadly ending. Deputies pursuing this mustang earlier this month after it had been reported stolen. They say the driver 27-year-old brian madden lost control after trying to take a curve at 26 miles ahour. He was ejected and his passenger had to be airlifted to the hospital. 
>>> So there is nothing like a good political fight. But this one turned into a brawl on the floor of ukraine's parliament. The scuffle apparently broke out after members of the opposition party accused two of their members of planning to defect to the ruling party. That's dramatic. 
>> Here we don't talk to each other in washington. 
>>> It's not clear whether it's diet, medicine, or genetics, japanese are still the healthiest people on the planet. The top four healthiest countries for men are japan followed by singapore, swins land and spain. The u.S. Is tied with norway for 29th place. Japan tops the list for women, followed by south korea, spain, and singapore. U.S. Women finished 33rd in the tie with astona. 
>> We have to get ahead of astonia. 
>> All right. Barbara streisand talking romance and politics with piers morgan. The hollywood icon says she's never been in love with a republican and never could be. She's a big president obama supporter and says the one thing that makes her proudest is his support for women and barbara streisand has a particular woman in mind to sed the president. 
>> Well, we're one of the last countries to ever think of having a woman be president. But I think that's possible now. But it wasn't years ago. 
>> Do you think hillary is likely to run? 

[00:37:18]


>> I don't know but I hope after a four-year rest that she would run because she would be a great woman president. 
>> Piers asked barbara streisand to name the greatest actor she's ever seen. Her answer, marlon brando. Good pick. 
>> I would say so.

>>> It is 32 degrees in atlanta. Lucky for them, it will get to 59 later in the day. In the state of kentucky, more than 86,000 children are growing up without their parents. One of the main reasons many have been orphaned, prescription drug overdose. Every 19 minutes in the u.S. Someone dies that way. And so many of those cases there are children left behind. Cnn's sanjay gupta takes us to a community in kentucky that is witness to this devastation. 
>> Reporter: If this town could talk, it would describe a simple, idyllic life. A proud people. It would also whisper a sobering story about an epidemic that is tearing apart family --

>> My grandpa, he just set me down and told me that he was gone. 
>> Reporter: When avery was 7, his father overdosed on oxy could the in. His mother was in and out of his life. 
>> The hardest part of growing up without a dad is, like, not having that model family that you always see. 
>> Reporter: He's lucky enough to live with his great grandparents. In this town, that model family is being redefined. 
>> This is happening in rockcastle county every week. It is happening in eastern kentucky every day. It's leaving our communities in shreds and we're left behind to pick up the pieces from that. 
>> Reporter: Karen kelly is the executive director of operation unite, a community coalition devoted to preventing overdose deaths in kentucky. In fact, kentucky is the fourth most medicated state in the nation. It has the sixth highest rate of overdose deaths. And one county alone -- 
>> half of the kids haveo parent in the home whatsoever. So now we're seeing many raised by great grandparents because we've lost an entire generation of young people. And, you know, the kids are really the ones paying the biggest price.

>> Reporter: Dr. Sanjay gupta, cnn, reporting. 
>> I asked him before why are doctors prescing all of the very heavy, heavy medicatns so frequently? There are so many prescriptions being written. You have to also wonder why are we taking all these drugs? Why are doctors prescribing all the drugs?

President obama and john boehner did meet for 50 minutes yesterday behind closed doors at the white house. Both sides called the talks, john, frank. Both said it was frank. And they said the line of communications remain open 18 days before higher taxes and spending cuts kick in. Frank in washington means nothing happened.

>>> An 85-year-old great grandmother in iowa has finally achieved a personal goal. She earned her ged. Earlier this week lois houselog walked across a community college stage and finally earned her diploma. 
>> It's really exciting for me because it's something I always wanted to do and never really felt like I had the time. I hope that people would be inspired by my story. I don't need it. But it's something I wanted. 
>> Houselog says a lot of kids her age didn't go to high school because there was no school buses and the nearest school is seven miles away. The hardest part of the test is math. I hope she had an awesome graduation party. 
>> I will tell you, as an iowa native, some of the smartest people I know are people who, you now, maybe dropped out of school to work on the farm. Never really got the chance or didn't go to school. Smart, smart, smart. And now she's got the ged to show it. 
>> Good for her. 
>>> Meet cliff the beagle. Cliff is the first bacteria testing dog in the world. He can sniff out a highly contagious bacteria called c-dip. They can spread quickly through hospitals. They kill at least 14,000 americans each year testing for the infections is time consuming. But cliff's sensitive sniffer can detect the toxin in seconds. When he fied patient, cliff just cops a squat. 

[00:50:58]


>> Cliff sounds cool. 
>> He sits down. He sits down. Pete is showing me what that means. 
>> Nice to hear about cliff. Thank you for that. That does sound cool. 
>>> Stormy weather right now in the southwest. 
>> Who is showing people how to cop a squat? 
>> I thought what does that mean? Then pete very helpfully -- our floor manager shows me. 
>> Love you, but -- good morning, guys. Hey, video -- who says it doesn't rain in san diego? Folks who live there yesterday are like yeah, it does. They got a month's worth of rain in -- well, less than a couple hours. This happened. Swift water rescue teams are out. Rush hour was a nightmare. The water in some cars was up and over past the wheel wells. So a dangerous situation there with some thunderstorms being reported across southern california. Also thunderstorms being reported yesterday in las vegas. That was the 25th day they saw thunderstorms this year. The record is 26. So a lot of thunderstorms in vegas. You had record rainfall of a quarter inch in san diego. You had 1.56 inches of rainfall. Yuma, you had record rain as well. The rain in through phoenix. It is snowing through flagstaff, getting into the grand canyon as well. This system will slowly spiral its way into the four corners and bring with it more in the way of some heavy snow. Some of it will be over the san juans of southwest colorado. They'll take that fresh powder, for sure. The south side of the system will have wind as well with winds gusting to 60 miles an hour.

>>> Welcome back. 56 minutes past the hour, christine romans ang with john berman. Taking a look at the top cnn trends on the web this morning. 
>> We're talking baseball. Big moves overnight. Angels sign josh hamilton to a five year, $125 million deal. They stole him away from the texas rangers. Hamilton joins a lineup that has albert pujols in it, they signed him last off-season and the best young player in the game as far as I'm concerned, michael trout coming off one of the best rookie seasons in decades. Here's the thing, the angels need pitching. They already scored a ton of runs. The last thing they need is another big hitter. This may not happen them. 125 million, five years, it's worth it, right? 
>> I would say that is money i would take. 
>> You know what? I'd take half that. 
>> The elderly woman that ruined a 200-year-old jesus fres he could in a church. She is now decided to start selling her own art. 80-year-old put her latest creation on ebay's spanish website. The painting is currently attracting bids of about $1,000. Money from the winning bid will reportedly be donated to a roman catholic charity. So that 15 seconds turned into a full minute. 
>> Best in bloated art. 
>>> All right. Talk about putting people on the spot. A couple of students at byu, they had a little funhis holiday with students staging a fake christmas survey underneath some surprise mistletoe. It came down sort of from the sky. They managed to get a few pecks out of it and one open palmed slap. Check this out. 
>> Is that mistletoe. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Like over the door? 
>> Yeah, I guess so. 
>> No. 
>> Or would you. 
>> Would i? 
>> Yeah? 
>> I've never done it. 
>> But you would do it? 
>> I would do it. 
>> Okay. 
>> Whoa. Hey. 

[00:58:01]


>> Merry christmas. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Well, all right, I'll go for it. 
>> Okay. Great. 
>> Whoa! 
>> I wasn't sure about the kisses. It looks like they were going in for extra. And that one, boom. 
>> I just keep walking. All right. Nobody is safe from late night hosts, not taylor swift or the l.A. Lakers on honest abe. Check outt night's best zingers. 
>> Today's taylor swift's 23rd birthday. Taylor says she wants to spend a quiet evening at home breaking up with someone. 
>> Doctors in pennsylvania are reporting that some therapy dogs can predict death. Have you heard about this? This is unbelievable. The dogs can sense if someone's dying and they won't go into that room if someone is dying in there. In fact, the other night two of the dogs are standing outside the lakers locker room. They wouldn't go in. 
>> Hbo is planning a new movie similar to game change but based on the 2012 election. Yeah, the network said they're not sure who will play mitt romney and then mitt romney was like, hey, I'm not doing anything. 
>> Steven spielberg's movie "lincoln" had the most nominations of any film this year, seven. "Lincoln" was nominated for best director, best actor and best beard without a mustache. 
>> He is nominated for a song he wrote for "magic mike." He spent a lot of time making sure the words all rhyme, all rhyme, all rhyme. 
>> All right, "early start" continues right now. 
>>> Breaking news this morning on the war in syria. The u.S. Now committing missiles and troops to the region. 

[01:00:01]


>>> President obama and speaker boehner face-to-face. Boehner face to face. The president and the speaker trying again in person to stave off that fiscal cliff. 
>>> Susan rice, out of the running. The president's u.N. Ambassador, gives up on the hopes to be the next secretary of state. Good morning, welcome to "early start." I'm christine romans. Zoraida is off this morning. 
>> I'm john berman. 6:00 a.M. In the east. 
>>> We do have breaking news. A major step by the united states concerning the fight against syria. We leaed overnight that leon panetta signed an order sending two patriot missile batteries to turkey to assist. This was expected as the civil war in syria continues. 400 u.S. Troops will be deployed to operate these missile batteries. Just over the border from syria. Nick payton walsh joins us from beirut. What is the latest? 
>> Precisely where the batteries are going to be. Hundreds of u.S. Troops there to assist in the operation. Two from the united states, germany expected shortly to approve two battery of its own with hundreds of germans to assist their operation and also holland contributing to. Let's give you the back story. In the past few months, exchanges of fire, accused of shelling into turkey, causing destruction and death. Turkey firing back. Leading to turkey asking nato, which it's a member to send this kind of assistance. Patriot missiles good at taking out missile shells and usable against aircraft too. A significant move by nato. Now they have substantial hardware on that volatile border and, of course, would you have heard secretary of defense leon panetta's comments that the united states has contingency plans in the event they see the assad regime preponderancing or using chemical weapons. A significant move by the u.S. 

[01:02:04]


>> That's right. Hardware and skin in the game with 400 u.S. Troops. Nick paton walsh, thank you for joining us. 
>>> President obama going face to face in the white house again, and the stakes could not be higher with 18 days to go until we go over that cliff. Trigger massive tax hikes, spending cuts and house set to go home for the holidays today. Yesterday, president obama telephoned spoker boehner, and both sides called the constitution frank and said "the lines of communication remain open." Senior congressional correspondent dana bash joins us live from washington. House members scheduled to break for the holidays today, but they've been told they may have to stay late, yet speaker boehner plans to go home to ohio. They have airports and phones in ohio. But where is the urgency around this? 
>> That is a great question. Really actually is stunning. With regard to the house, they were told that they should come back at a moment's notice, and also told -- I was informed by several republican lawmakers not to make plans for christmas. So you have this meeting yesterday. It was done at the last minute by the president to try to jump start things, but as you said, both sides said that the meeting was frank, which in washington speak, mostly dip lo speak means it didn't go that well. I spoke to a democratic source who said there was no new information, new no offers on the table. Just a discussion of what each side has to do to reach agreement which is very surprising, given the fact it's not a secret what both sides need to do. Republicans need to give more on revenue. Democrats need to ge more on spending cuts and that's what they have to do. 
>> You own a small business in america, you are trying to figure out how you will do your payroll in the beginning of the year, software changes that take more than a couple of weeks. For some, they are assuming we are going over the cliff. They won't be able to get it together in time for the first paychecks in january. You talk to two former senate majority leaders from opposite sides of the aisle who know how to tuesdayle and make a deal. Tell us about that. 

[01:04:20]


>> Trent lott, and tom daschle, they have tussled over many things. Balanced budget in 1996, welfare reform, you name it. But they admit things are very different now. Politicians is a lot more divisive. Both men predict there will be a deal, just a matter of when. 
>> I feel hopeful at least that they will come to an agreement. There is an argument you don't want to make it too early, because that gives people that may not be too happy more time to undermine it. So the tempo and timing is important. 
>> I've heard people say in the last couple of days, republicans and democrats, that the time has come to put our country ahead of our party and that's really what it's going to take. Putting the country ahead of the party. 
>> Putting the country ahead of the party, again, for democrats that means biting the bullet, saying, okay, we're going to cut entitlement spending. For republicans it means biting the bullet. What people on the fill say frankly privately they say it will happen anyway to give into the president on the wealth increases, maybe not up to prebush era percentages of 36%, but everybody has a really good idea of what they need to do to come to compromise. A question of where they are on the deadline what people can swallow politically. 
>> I just got an e-mail from a political strategist, watches washington for business. He calls this the most incompetent, dysfunctional, gridlocked, constipated congress ever. And no chance that the fiscal cliff deal can be completed by christmas. Prospects are fading for a framework by new year's eve. People who have been watching this for business, who have been upbeat until now, say it's just a mess. 
>> It really is a mess. All sides dug in. And I laugh there, but it obviously is not funny it would be funny if it wasn't so serious. If it was a movie, you wouldn't believe it. 

[01:06:26]


>> Ha ha, not funny. Ha ha, just unbelievable. 
>>> In the next half hour, we'll talk about the fiscal cliff infighting within the republican party when we are joined by tony perkins, president of the family research council. 
>>> Other big news from washington, the stun forever ambassador susan rice. She'll meet with the president today after taking herself out of the running to be the next secretary of state in a letter to the president, rice said the confirmation process would be lengthy, disruptive and costly to you and to our most pressing national priorities and that tradeoff is simply not worth it to our country. 
>> I made a decision about who would be our next secretary of state. Susan is qualified. Her interest is in serving me, but most importantly to serving the country. She will continue to be one of the top members of my national security team. 
>> Rice true heavy criticism over her statements on attack of the u.S. Mission in benghazi. She said the attack, you will remember, killed u.S. Ambassador to libya chris stevens and three other americans. 
>>> Signs of process. A nuclear arms talks between the united nations and iran. Inspectors from the u.N. International atomic energy agency are asking for access to the suspect parshan military site southeast of tehran. No word on if they are making progress there. More meetings expected to take place in mid-january. 
>>> A hearsay brought the remains of jenni rivera to a mort wear in long beach, california, last night. Fans lined up outside to pay their respects. The remains were identified through dna testing. The spanish singer and possibly six other people were killed when a private plane crashed in mexico. The company that owns the jet is a defendant in two other lawsuits. Could be a year before we have the results. 

[01:08:31]


>>> And police say 23-year-old nicholas wieme, taking pictures on a hotel's famous onion shaped rooftop dome, when he became wedged in the chimney it took firefighters hours to get him, but he was pronounced dead 45 minutes after they were able to free him. 
>> Awful. 
>>> Not exactly political statesmanship. A political fight turned into a brawl. Pushing, shoving, punches. It started after members of the opposition party accused two of their members of planning to defect to the ruling party. I guess the good news, it's intra-party bickering, not partisanship here in the ukraine, like we have here in the u.S. 
>> Wow. At least they are talking. 
>> Yeah. 
>>> If you believe the doomsday scenario in the mayan calendar, have you a chance to squeeze in the vacation of a lifetime. People are flocking to the yucatan peninsula, not so much to witness the end of the year, but to take in the rituals of the mayan end of the cycle of time. 
>> Judging by the number of hotels being built and tour operators being created, we can tell there is a lot of expectation. A few hotels in town are giving discounts, because it's the end of the world. 
>> Good advertising for the mayan ruins. 
>> It turns out to be a great business strategy. 
>> Look at the beautiful pictures. Some pretty beautiful stuff down there. Even if the world ends on the 21st, IT WOULD GO OUT WITH THE Party to end all parties. 
>> That is the good news. If the world ends, I think it's good to go out with a party. 
>> But don't spend all of your retirement money. 
>> Good advice. 
>>> Coming up, surveillance video captures the moment shots ring out on a train. Chilling, chilling stuff. done! "Are you a cool mom?" I'm gonna find out.

>>> Breaking news right now out of california. A powerful earthquake hit off the coast. Hearing it was a 6.4 magnitude earthquake. About 137 miles south/southwest of san clemente island, california. And 140 miles south of st. Nicholas, california. On baja california. Rob marciano joins us. 
>> At this point, 25 minutes ago, two reports of earthquakes. One a 6.4 as you mentioned. Another a 6.1. Both just off the coastline by about 100 miles or so. The smaller one, a little bit closer to the coast. These are strong enough and certainly close enough to be felt in not only baja california, but san diego area, likely the islands off l.A. And also l.A. Proper here, likely no damage with this. And also no tsunami warnings have been issued with this. Typically anything below a seven sun likely to trigger that. An active area where the pacific plate bumps into the north american plate. Nothing new for folks who live in southern cal. Anything over a 6 is enough to wake up the masses and I'm sure our viewers have felt it. A 6.4 magnitude quake and 6. 100 to 150 miles. Off the california and mexico border here just about 25 minutes ago. We'll replay the reports to up. 
>> If you felt this, felt something, can you tweet us @earlystartcnn. Tweet what you are seeing and if you felt anything. Thanks, rob. 

[01:15:33]


>> All right. 
>>> Other news, washington is still abuzz this morning from the diplomatic shocker, u.S. Ambassador to the united nations, susan rice, taking herself out of the running. Will not succeed secretary of state hillary clinton. She explained it in a letter to president obama. She said, the confirmation process would be lengthy, disruptive and costly to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities. That tradeoff is simply not worth it to our country she said. We have the latest from washington. And susan rice is going to meet with the president today. 
>> She is going to meet with the president today, john. She spoke with him yesterday before she sent that letter, obviously, a very disappointing day for susan rice. Really, her whole life had helped to be secretary of state. I talked to some of her aides yesterday. They said she has been thinking about it for several weeks. She was up, she ultimately she could be confirmed. After things started piling on beyond benghazi, they did the math and they think susan rice had a very good record at the u.N. She was instrumental in passing sanctions on iran, on pushing for u.S. Action in libya, and a lot of other things and they feel this was not only a distraction for the president, but a distraction for her work at the u.N. Let's listen to what susan rice said yesterday about why she withdrew her name from consideration. 
>> I didn't want to see a confirmation process that was very prolonged, very politicized, very distracting and very disruptive. Because there are so many things we need to get done as a country. 
>> And, john, the president said and rice's aides said she will go back to the u.N., Continue her work. A lot going on as you know. Not just on syria, the ongoing crisis there. But efforts to get some sanctions against north korea and a lot of other hotspots, john. 

[01:17:34]


>> And they've made clear at the white house, she has a role moving forward, maybe one day as national security adviser and maybe secretary of state down the line. The next secretary of state? That could come in the next couple of days, and there seems to be a short list right now of one person. 
>> Senator john kerry, who has made no secret that he wants the job, and his colleagues in the senate made no secret that he would be easily confirmed. As this was going on with susan rice, a lot of people floated john kerry's name that he would be a suitable candidate. He has a lot of world stature, a lot of relationships with world leaders and is seen as someone who can do delicate diplomacy and has in many years of the obama administration been going out as of a kind of quasienvoy in areas of afghanistan, pakistan, stirra at one point, so certainly he has the chops for the job. Over the next couple of days, we could see a nomination. 
>> All right, elise labott, thank you very much. 
>>> Police in philadelphia searching for two young men involved in a shooting on an elevated train. This confrontation was over a basketball game. One of the suspects as he was leaving, turned, fired a handgun into the train. Two people are wounded there. 
>>> The lawsuits are starting to snowball from the spinal meningitis outbreak. The boston area pharmacy is facing at least 50 federal lawsuits in 9 states. 37 people died and more than 500 sickened after gettingsteroid injections. The company that prepared them is said to have been negligent. 
>>> A disabled vet received aboard a delta flight last year, christian brown lost both legs in afghanistan. On the flight, he was clumsily wheeled to the back of the plane, humiliated according to a fellow vet. When others tried to have brown moved to first class, the crew refused to allow him to move up to first class. They said they had to keep the aisles clear and get the plane going. And in a statement, delta saidith investigating the incident and holds service members in high regard. But clearly another military member on that flight wrote a sort of scathing, scathing play-by-play of what happened and said it was just unforgivable.

>> A shame. 
>>> Just one more way the fiscal cliff could cost up what happens to your paycheck if there is no deal in washington. clean toothpaste. But they have to use special care in keeping the denture clean. Dentures are very different to real teeth. They're about 10 times softer and may have surface pores where bacter can multiply. Polident is designed to clean dentures daily. Its unique micro-clean formula kills 99.9% of odor causing bacteria and helps dissolve stains, cleaning in a better way than brushing with toothpaste. That's why I recommend using polident.

>>> That is new york city, folks. Sitting right in the middle of the now. Lovely lights of new york. The financial capital of the world. We're lucky because christine is minding your, mine, all of our business this morning. 
>> Minding your business. Stock futures up slightly this morning, worries about the fiscal cliff persist. They undermine any kind of small gains we get. S & p 500, snapped a six-day winning streak because of those concerns about the fiscal cliff and despite modestly updated business data. Congress failed to reach a deal on the cliff? 2 million long life term unemployment americans will see jobless benefits disappear the first week of january. Another million will lose them the next week. Those who are out of work 40 weeks or longer, that make up 40% of the unemployed population. As you might expect, federal jobless benefits, a crucial lifeline for those who have been out of work 40 weeks or more and are waiting for the economy to start create enough jobs to absorb them back in call it the payroll tax cliff. Of all of the tax issues being negotiated, one many middle class families will feel. The payroll tax holiday. Money that comes directly from the paycheck it funds payrolls and social security. The last two years, workers paying a rate of 4.2% of their earnings, up to 110,000 or so into payroll taxes. In 2013, the rate will go up to 6.2% on wages up to $113,000. Take a look at this someone saying $50,000 will see $19 per less in take home pay per week. Only a small piece of the fiscal cliff puzzle. Year end, all of the things changing, but could affect your paycheck immediately. The one thing you need to know about your money today? Have you noticed, have you noticed, everyone, gas prices falling 22 straight days now and many think they will continue to go down the rest of the year. According to the automobile association, the average price for a gallon of unleaded falling to $3.29. A 4.2% decline since november 23rd. Good news for you hitting the road for the holidays. 

[01:26:25]


>> We complain, complain, complain, complain, when gas prices go up and never say thank you when they go down. 
>> Still higher than they were last year at this time. 
>> So you're still complaining. 
>>> Does the republican party have a brand problem? Coming up, we'll talk about that when we are joined by tony perkins, president of the family research council and talking about the future of the gop and MUCH, MUCH MORE.carols in background ] Aunt Sally's singing again. It's a tradition, honey.

>>> And econ 101 as the fiscal cliff looms. President obama and speaker boehner meet. 
>>> Show of force. The u.S. Says it will send missiles and troops, but not to the rebels. 
>>> Tough call for susan rice. President obama's u.N. Ambassador said she took herself out of running to be the next secretary of state. Welcome back to "early start." I'm john berman. 
>> I'm christine romans in for zoraida sambolin. A lot going on. 
>>> Leon panetta signed an order sending two patriot missile batteries to turkey to assist that nation in protecting itself from military action by syria. In addition, 400 u.S. Troops will be deployed to operate the missile batteries. Turkey borders syria. Thousands of refugees have fled to turkey for safety. Al qaeda remains the most significant threat facing america today erin burnett sat down with the defenscretary in kandahar. 
>> You can reach a point where you so significantly weaken al qaeda that, you know, although there may still be a few people around, they won't be able to conduct the operations that they have conducted in the past and they certainly won't be able to plan the kind of attacks that america had happen to it on 9/11 and that's our goal to make sure it doesn't happen again. 
>> You talk about al qaeda and where it is -- 
>> panetta went on to te erin we have to go after the group in yemen and somalia. 
>>> President obama and speaker boehner met again behind closed doors this week. With the house set to skip down for the holidays today, no sign of a deal. Here is what both sides are saying, calling yesterday's talks frank and insisting the lines of communication remain open. John. 

[01:32:15]


>> Despite secretary boehner and other leaders taking a hard line, others are saying that the latest infighting is going strong since the election last month, many are saying the party has a branding problem. We want to bring in tony perkins, president of the family research council to talk about the future of the republican party. No deal, a stalemate, and the speaker taking a hardline on taxes. Have you been up on capitol hill this week. What are you hearing from people inside the party? 
>> I'm hearing that unless there is spending cuts -- are spending cuts, there won't be revenue increasing, measures taken or supported by republicans. 
>> You don't think there's a deal any time soon? 
>> The american people, a wall street journal poll shows 2/3 of the people say, yeah, we could use more taxes, but they need to be coupled with spending cuts. I think people realize that we've come to a point if we continue to kick the can of fiscal responsibility down the road, we're going to end up kicking the can as a country. 
>> Can I ask you, would you be willing to deal with new revenue, tax increases? 
>> I think most americans would. I don't think they are totally opposed to closing loopholes if you will. Bottomline, it's a tax increase. 
>> What about the top two -- two tax rates? 
>> I think when you look at that, you have to realize that includes a lot of small businesses, in fact, the bulk of small businesses which are -- small business is the biggest employer in this country. So I think that's problematic for the economy. It's selling well for the president to go around, let's get the top wage earners. Those are small businesses that employee people. 
>> Let's talk about the republican party in general. Senator jim demint to leave to go become head of the heritage foundation. A lot of republicans didn't shed many tears when he left. Demint a tea party favorite. Some say a hne conservative. Is there a division between tea party members and other republicans? 

[01:34:25]


>> There was cheering on both sides. Conservatives think him more effective at the heritage foundation and the establishment cheering, at least for the short term, that he's out of their hair. He did challenge the establishment, which is -- look, you look at the last two presidential elections, republicans put forth moderate candidates, and they lost. Moderates, the graroots and the base of the party, if they are going to be successful, they have to return to the founding principles, not retreat. 
>> Conservatives lose too. Todd akin lose, murdoch lose in indiana. Conservatives lose too. 
>> No question, a bad cycle for republicans and you mentioned todd akin and richard murdoch, we're prepared for some of the tough issues and how to talk about the issues successfully. Other candidates have successfully talked about them. 
>> Let's talk about the solution of certain issues. 51% of americans support gay marriage, 6 of 10 young people support gay marriage. Ballot box, three states approved gay marriage, other states allow it. Is there an evolution in this country right now? 
>> Over 40 states that have marriage defined in their state laws as a union between a man and a woman. 30 have gone to an effort of placing it into their constitution. Four states voted on it this time, which traditional marriage did not prevail. I hardly think that what we saw in this election is a -- is a consensus, as some have described on same-sex marriage. Look, 40 years ago, and coming up next month, will be 40 years of roe versus wade, those under 29 hailed that as a great decision by the court. That same age category, 18 to 29 tonight, are more pro legal than their parents. 

[01:36:37]


>> Have you been in the news dealing with ups because of the boy scouts. Ups are pulling their funding for the boy scouts because they will not allow gay members to help run the boy scouts or inside the boy scouts. Why did the family research council do this? 
>> The boy scouts for over 100 years, as part of their moral code, has challenged boys to be straight and upstanding citizens. 
>> Straight? What do you mean by that? 
>> Their code is morley straight, they not engage in sexual behavior that they keep themselves morley conditioned and mentally sharp and that's their code. They have had this policy long running for good reason and to have an organization say, look, we won't give you money unless you change your longstanding policy to come in line with our values. And I had a conversation, we had a private conversation with ups and said, wait a minute, why are you doing this? This is a long-term policy that the boy scouts have had. Why are you taking your money away? We have a right to you give money to those who reflect our values. 
>> The company isn't interested in true diversity but in strong arming anyone who disagrees with their extreme agenda, including a century old youth development program, whose only crime is instilling character into millions of american boys. Some people could suggest that not allowing gay members, how does not allowing gay members instill character into boys? 
>> Look, when you look at who charters boy scout troops, over 2/3 are chartered by churches, that's where they host their meetings, the values that run parallel to the boy scouts. What have you is you have a few corporations, major corporation who's are saying, look, unless you abandon a century old value set, we're not going to give you money. And the -- some things don't change with time. The boy scouts are one that have laid down a marker and said we will continue with what's worked for our boys and continue to produce young men who make good citizens. 

[01:38:45]


>> Tony perkins, thank you for coming in. Appreciate it. 
>>> Police in malaysia have made a dent in the illegal trade of elephant tusks. They seized a shipment worth $20 million. It was headed to china, where elephant tusks are in high demand. Poachers slaughter thousands of elephants in order to get the tusks. 
>>> Salvation army workers in oklahoma found a wedding ring in one of their red kettles, but they don't know if the ring is really a generous donation or if it slipped off someone's finger, someone could be really upset right now that they don't know where the ring is. They are giving the owner 90 days to come forward. After that it's considered a donation.

Says that the north koreans might not have control of that in the moment. Kim jung un got into the act. This photo of the launch, as leaders call for punishment, insisting that north koreans have moved a step closer to be able to launch nuclear weapons across the ocean. 
>>> Eagles fumble the ball four times, one interception, and the worst part of all? This. They had a punt blocked by their own player. All this in a 34-13 loss at home. Eagles lost to 4-2 and cincinnati kept their playoff hopes alive. I know are you not a big football fan, but you are not supposed to block your own punts.

=======================================================

Familia, esposas, compa??eros de trabajo del pistolero para encontrar mayores pistas, por eso entendemos que el gobernador de connecticut decia que recibian ayuda de parte del estado 
>>> es una constante, nada es al azar, tiene un tiempo de preparacion, las mentes criminales involucradas calculan hasta el ultimo detalle, cuando no es que suicidian o saben que van a morir, se dice que llevaba un chaleco antibala pero sabia que podia morir en ese lugar, todos en esta masacre esta calculado, el estudio de las mentes criminales es aterrador, son personas desequilibra, es una persona que tiene un plan, un plan criminal, sabe lo que quiere hacer, sabe como lo va a hacer. 
>>> Lo que no esta claro, si el pistolero murio en un enfrentamiento con la policia, o se suicido ahi. 
>>> Llevaba un chaleco antibalas, las pistolas automaticas, aunque no se dio la especificacion. 4 pistolas hablaban. 
>>> Son pistolas de repeticion, y demuestra que tea cargadores, multiples cargadores que estaba utilizando. 

[00:02:08]


>>> Y sobre el debate de armas es valido preguntar si aquellos que defienden la segunda enmienda cuantas armas puedes tener, puedes tener una o 20? 
>>> Y que tipo de armas, lo discutiamos con la persona que defiende este tipo, decia que los rifles automaticos se utilizan para ir de caceria, pero nadie sale de caceria con un r 15, es un arma militar, como se utilizo en la masacre de colorado, es una arma que esta pensada para la guerra, que sea facil llevar. 
>>> Y hecha para matar, no para defenderse. 
>>> Vamos a ver, nos llegan imagenes de la casa de la madre, y nos van a disculpar que no hay... Al decir la casa de la madre, no estoy seguro si los padres an juntos. Toda esta informacion se va a ir consolidando, y la vamos alimentando permanentemente, el perfil era desconocido, lo estamos conociendo a traves de de estos hechos, ya identicamos una casa donde se dice que murio una persona adulta que se presume que es el padre. 
>>> Dificil con esta perspectiva, tenemos una vision aerea, pero aparentemente la casa donde vivia la madre, y veremos si... 
>>> Es la misma casa, si corresponde a la casa. 
>>> Esta es la del padre. 
>>> Parece distinta. 

[00:04:09]


>>> Quizas por el color. 
>>> La perspectiva es diferente. Esta es la casa de la madre, y la otra es la casa del padre. Conoceremos su historia mas adelante. A ver si vivian juntos. Y el auto que aparece en frente sugiere que es un carro, tal vez una patrulla policial, en algunos momentos le vamos a presentar el discurso del presidente obama se lo vamos a traducir no literalmente, porque queremos que vean la emocion que expreso el presidente como yo nunca antes lo habia visto. 
>>> Murieron ni??os de 5 a 10 a??os. 
>>> Trata de contenerse, pero esta claro que... 
>>> Tenian toda su vida por delante. Estaban pensando en tener ni??os incluso. Y entre los muertos hubo tambien maestros. Nuestros corazones estan rotos por todos los familiares de estos ni??os. Y sigue usando esta misma frase, nuestros corazones estan rotos. Y los padres de estos ni??os saben que la inocencia se ha perdido, y que los han perdido. Y esta es la frase. Como pais vivimos esto demasiadas veces, en oregon, wisconsin, o en aurora colorado. O en las calles de nuestros vecindarios. Pero nuestros hijos son nuestros hijos. Y nos vamos a tener que unir para tomar medidas significativas. 

[00:06:44]


>>> Esa es la otra frase. 
>>> Esa es la parte mas personal. Dijo que se iban a reunir con sus hijos, iban a abrazarlas, y decirles que las quieren. Y esta noche habra muchas familias en connecticut que no podran hacer lo mismo, y nst an todo nuestro apoyo y ayuda. Y hare todo lo que pueda compresidente para ayudar a estas familias. Es imposible remplazar el lugar de un ni??o muerto o perdido, y hay que hacer lo posible para hacerles saber que estamos con ellos. Y recordarles que la memoria de los ni??os estara en la nuestra. 
>>> Impacta mucho el tono y la carga emotiva del discurso. El presidente de los estados unidos tiene que estar preparado para lo peor, tiene el cargo de mayor responsabilidad, y esta recibiendo todo tipo de malas noticias, por lo que sucede en el mundo, la economica, en fin, pero lo de hoy toco las fibras mas intimas, como lo hizo con todos los que vivimos en este pais, como padres, como persona que vivimos en esta gran nacion, pero sentimos que somos mas vulnerables todos, y los que tenemos hijos sentimos que hoy somos tan vulnerables como los que perdieron a sus hijos. 
>>> Cuando ocurrio la masacre en 1999 muchos pensaron que era un hecho aislado, y luego esta pelicula que sirvio para plantear el debate. 

[00:08:58]


>>> Pero mas no para cambiar nada. Y luego nos damos cuenta que si nosotros hubieramos ido a la premier de batman donde mataron a 12. O si nuestros hijos hubieran ido a esa escuela y no hubiera sido en connecticut. 
>>> Es la escuela de todos. Es el recorrido de todos, como padres todas las ma??anas sacamos a ntre hijos, y a la hora que nos enteramos es el momento en el que vamos en camino al colegio, muchos padres recibian esa angustia, solo pensar en esto que tenian a sus hijos espes devastador. 
>>> Cuando llegas a hablar como le explicas. Hay que decirles nos decia una sicologa que ellos estan bien, pero sabemos que eso nos pudo haber ocurrido a cualquiera. 
>>> Y tener que escuchar lo que vamos a ver ahora. Una ni??a que debia llegar a contarle lo que hizo en el colegio, los juegos que realizo, hoy es testigo de una masacre. La vamos a escuchar. 
>>> (Hablan en ingles). 
>>> Estaba junto a la ventana, y vio muchos policias. Y estaba muy asustada. 
>>> Que sentia dolor en el estomago. 

[00:11:00]


>>> Que me parece u expresion tan tierna. En lugar decir que tiene miedo, era la reaccion fisica el miedo. 
>>> Lo que te digo, es dificil imaginar lo que pasaba en ese colegio en esas horas, porque como deciamos, lantablemente nos hemos acostumbrado a este tipo de acontecimientos, y sabemos que nos va a tocar un cubrimiento de este tipo, pero nio se imagino que podria llegar a una escuela de ni??os entre 5 y 10 a??os. En los ultimos 20 a??os son 23 tragedias similares, hay mas tragedias por a??o. En este a??o llevamos tres. Aca hay un problema de fondo que hay de discutir, y escucho cuando estan estos cubrimientos a las personas que defienden el porte de arma que tienen una posicion valida que estan resguardados de decir que no es el momento del debate, que es el momento de las victimas, pero tambien queremos hablar con dana sanchez, porvavoz de una organizacion, y hablamos sobre esta discusion, se??ora sanchez, regresamos con u para hablar de este tema, y lo vuelvo a plantear, lo ultimo que deciamos, como romper ese muro que hay en el congreso? 
>>> Yo creo que tienen que empezar a pensar que no es un problema politico, es un prlema de salud publica, y que no podemos seguir asi, de que a donde vamos? 

[00:13:12]


>>> Para escuchar los argumentos de los que estan en el frente, que son las personas que tienen un desequilibrio mental que pueden hacer esto, y que los americanos tienen derecho a defenderse, y que tienen derecho a comprar, que le responderia usted. 
>>> Son frases publicitarias que llevan repitiendo, pero si te pones a entender que quieren decir, no hace sentido ningun, claro que son las personas, pero las regulaciones afectan a las personas, no afectan a las armas. ??Entiendes? La frase en si no hace sentido ninguno. Lo que estamos tratando de regular es que personas tienen acceso a las armas, y el canal de su distribucion esta roto, y siguen por cuenta de las regulaciones. Todas esas frases que ellos dicen, esos son frases publicitarias. 
>>> Claro, volviendo a algo que dijimos mas temprano, siendo realista, para darle una posibilidad real de avance, porque si se piensa que se va a desmontar la enmienda, eso no va a suceder por lo menos en el corto tiempo, cual seria el primer paso, cuando el 
presidente dijo: Tenemos que tomar medidas significativas, ??que seria eso? 
>>> Un paso significativo es que de inmediato el congreso tome cartas en el asunto en cuanto a las armas de asaltos y los de alta capacidad, de reanudar la probicion de armas de asalto. Seria algo significativo. Como un comienzo. 

[00:15:32]


>>> Para recordar un poco, ??hasta cuando estuvo vigete esta restriccion y por que se levanto? 
>>> Estuvo vigente por 10 a??os y caduco en septiembre del 2004. Porque asi lo decidio el congreso, cuando instituyeron la ley en septiembre de 2004. Para que entonces de aqui a 10 a??os volver con el tema, que realmente mira donde nos llevo. 
>>> Ese seria el primer paso, no permitir que ninguna persona acceda a las armas de asalto y a los cargadores de alta repeticion. 
>>> Los magazines de alta capacidad, lo que tenia eran dos pistolas, pero hay magazines que en dos segundos los cambia y mira ta tragedia. 
>>> Tendremos que seguir con este debate, que significa lo que dice el presidente, que quiere decir para poder ahondar con mas claridad, se??ora sanchez, gracias volvemos con usted mas adelante. 
>>> Vamos a hacer algunas de las correcciones precisas en esta cobertura, el nombre del pistolero ha cambiado, lo identificamos incorrectamente. El nombre real de acuerdo a los ultimos informes es adan lanza. Y si nos pueden mostrar la fotografia que estuvimos presentando, podemos... La foto que le habiamos presentado, por eso hay que irnos con cuidado, pero esto ocurre, era del hermano del pistolero, y si la informacion que nos acaba de llegar escorrecta, ryan lanza podria tambien haber sido asesinado por su hermano. 

[00:18:14]


>>> Por eso reiteramos durante esta trasmision que los datos van a ir cambiando con las horas, cambiando algunos aspectos de esa informacion para actualizarlas, y vamos ir haciendo claridad. Lo cierto es que adan lanza habria disparado, asesino a una persona en la vivienda que veiamos, que se supone que era su padre, habria llegado a la escuela donde trabajaba su madre, alli habia disparado contra su madre, y contra los infantes que estaban en dos salones de clases. 
>>> Otras de las precisiones, el nombre de la madre era nancy lanza, fallecida, aparentemente estaba en el salon de clase, era maestra de la escuela, y despues asesina a los estudiantes, nancy lanza, y el nombre del pistolero no era ryan lanza comoabiamos dicho, se llamaba adan lanza. 
>>> El protagonista de esta historia. El triste protagonista desde el lado del criminal, creo que tambien hay que decir, que los protagonistas inocentes son los ni??os. Los 20 ni??os son los grandes protagonistas, 20 menores que han perdido hoy la vida en esta masacre sin sentido, y tendremos que conocer mayores detalles, pero esto no se da por casualidad, las mentes criminales tienen un plan y lo ejecutan, y pocos planes tan frios y descarnados como el que se fivio hoy en estados unidos. 

[00:20:26]


>>> Estoy buscando las comparaciones entre el numero de crimenes con armas de fuego que ocurre frente a japon. En japon los ciudadanos no tienen derecho a portar armas, y los numeros de delitos de crimenes por arma de fuego, porque las consiguen a traves de la policia o ejercito, son menos que en estados unidos u otros paises. 
>>> Siempre se contraargumentara, y esta discusion tiene dos vias de debate, muchos afirman que en canada hay acceso a las armas, seria bueno que tipo de restricciones hay en canada para acceder a las armas, a que armas se tiene acceso, que estudio se le hace a una persona, que esta en discusion en el debate de fonde de esta situacion que yo diria que marca posiblemente un quiebre, lo de hoy no tiene antecedentes, hablamos de la mayor masacre de una escuela de ni??os, 20 ni??os entre los 5 y 10 a??os fueron asesinados hoy. No tiene antecedentes, conociamos de tragedias similares, y reiteramos la cifra, 23 casos en 20 a??os. 
>>> Se encuentra el congresista luis gutierrez, forma parte del comite de inteligencia. Su primera reaccion, cuando se entero de esto? 
>>> Mi esposa me llamo por el telefono, nosotros estamos cuidando a nuestro nieto que tiene 9??os, esta en cuarto grado, y ella me informo sobre la tragedia, y fui a casa a ver a mi nieto y estar con el y la tragedia nos afecta a todos como seres humanos, y en lo particular y individual como abuelo y padre que soy. 

[00:23:02]


>>> Obviamente tenemos que plantear el tema, el debate que se abre, que se abre y cierra al vaiven de las masacres, no se puede dejar pasar esto, hemos dicho que la enmienda es dificil de cambiar, pero se puede hacer algo para cambiar la actuacion situacion y la facilidad que tienen las personas para acceder? 
>>> Creo que demuestra la voluntad politica en el congreso de estados unidos para demandar un cambio. El hecho dado esta increible tragedia que uno no ve estos sucesos en otros paises industrializados, y cuando ocurren masacres de ni??os son actos de terrorismo, debemos mirar los actos de terrorismo que ocurren por ciudadanos de estados unidos armados y permitidos con leyes que facilitan esos procesos aqui en estados unidos. 
>>> Representante, mencionamos que es un debate dificil en el congreso, usted lo safe, y la capacidad de loby que tiene la asociacion nacional del rifle es grande, atemoriza a muchos politicos, se puede romper esa capacidad de limitar el debate al interior del congreso. 
>>> Cuando llegue al congreso en el 93 pasamos leyes limitando el uso de armas, creo que el congreso de estados unidos tiene que volver a ese debate, y debemos dejar a un lado la influencia de aquellos que quieren utilizar armas y quien va a proteger los ni??os de este pais? 

[00:25:09]


>>> Representante gutierrez, muchas gracias. 
>>> Gracias a usted. 
>>> Y ahora vamos a pasar a nueva jersey, donde esta alex ronda, de nuestra estacion afiliada. Alex, por que estas ahi? 
>>> Buenas tardes. Estamos aqui porque la policia comenzo a investigar donde vivia el pistolero adan lanza, la policia dijo que interrogo a su hermano, pero no esta vinculado, simplemente son entrevistas que se hacen para tratar de conocer mas detalles, es una ciudad que queda al borde del rio hudson, dicen que estan sorprendidos, y la mayoria no han logrado reconocer al pistolero, dijeron que llego vestido de negro para perpetrar este crimen. 
>>> Alex, tu dices que ryan lanza esta vivo? ??Correcto? 
>>> Si, efectivamente, informes de prensa dicen que la policia estaria interrogando a ryan lanza, hermano del pistolero, oficialmente no salio a hablar, aqui estamos a la espera que haya un comunicado oficial, y hay policias de varias ciudades, no solamente de esta ciudad, tambien del estado, y son informaciones preliminares que dirian que la policia estaria entrevistando al hermano del pistolero. 

[00:27:13]


>>> Habian dos reportes que sugerian que ryan lanza habria sido encontrado muerto. Pero la informacion que dices contradice esto. Y explica como el gobernador del ado de connecticut esta recibiendo ayuda por parte del estado de nueva york. 
>>> Por supuesto, es una lluvia de informacion, que tocara ir confirmando, hay un cable que habla que el padre del pistolero estaria muerto, es una informacion que no se pudo confirmar, hablamos con el senador roberto menendez hace minutos despues de la masacre y pidio una ley estricta para el control de armas. 
>>> Obviamente como reiteramos apenas conocemos los detalles, vivia solo, con su hermano, tenian alguna relacion que pueda se??alar que vivian en el mismo lugar? 
>>> Felix, es prematuro decirlo, la policia esta rodeando el edificio, donde aparentemente vivia ryan, pero tambien el pistolero, ya que los registros muestran que tiene registros en un apartamento de ese edificio, no salio nadie a confirmar quienes era la persona que vivia en este lugar. Y simplemente la policia esta acordonando el lugar donde vivia ryan. Y cables periodisticos dijeron que lo estan entrevistando. 
>>> Has tenido oportunidad de hablar con algunos de los vecinos. De pronto adan lanza es uno de los nombres mas gogleados y buscados en internet. 

[00:29:27]


>>> Si, logramos hablar con algunos residentes y personas que trabajan, y le mostramos la fotografia, pero realmente ninguno reconocio al pistolero. 
>>> Alex, muchas gracias, de la estacion oficial canal 41. 
>>> Y esta es una recapitulacion de lo que podemos conocer, 27 muertos, 6 adultos, y el pistolero lanza identificado como el pistorelo, en un principio se hablo como ryan. 
>>> Y en fin, el historial es largo de matanzas, de hechos como este que representaron 23 en los ultimos 20 a??os. 
>>> Mira, encontre la informacion, la pregunta es si en los estados unidos ocurren mas masacres o mas asesinatos que otros pais del primer mundo. En america latina es diferente. Pero vamos a comparar con alemania, japon, para saber cuantos asesinatos hay en la poblacion, seutiliza e siguiente cotigo, por cada 100 mil habitantes en japon hay 1.1 asesinatos. Donde no permiten a las personas hacer esto. En alemania 3.9 por cada 100 mil. En gran breta??a 9.1 por cada 100 mil. En estados unidos hay tres veces mas asesinatos que en alemania. Y 8 veces mas en los estados unidos que en japon. 

[00:32:09]


>>> Son las que alimentan la discusion de lo que hablamos, el alcalde michael bloomberg que con mayor fuerza hablo, dice que hay que acabar con la enmienda, y hace una rese??a historia, dice que la enmiendaonstitucional que permite el porte de armas viene de otra epoca, y de un desarrollo de armas diferentes, que respondia a una historia distinta. 
>>> Hablamos que se pone la segunda enmienda hablamos de una epoca que no se corresponde a lo que es hoy. 
>>> En estos estados unidos del 2012 te toco y me toco, el hijo de un amigo me pregento si le permitia utilizar estos nuevos juegos de videos, y al darme cuenta de los juegos, la idea del juego es matar, y matar con precision, si sumas esta cultura en la que nos acostumbramos, en el que constantemente esten viendo violencia, y es un pais que esta en dos guerras, eso hace todo un clima donde nuestros hijos estan mas expuestos a la violencia y al uso de armas. 
>>> Y se plantea que se vuelve a la discusion, donde la restriccion de armas se da, no predente que restringiendo el numero de armas se va a acabar, lo que si se podria avanzar es evitar que una persona que tiene un desequilibro mental llegue a acceder a un arma. Para volver a la ultima masacre del teatro, d un joven que era claro que tenia un problema, vamos a mirar imagenes, un hombre, un joven que tenia un historial de estudios brillante tenia un problema mental, estaba en tratamiento siquiatrico, y nadie advirtio que fue a comprar armas de fuego, si hubiera un cruce de informacion que permitiera que esta persona tiene problemas siquiatricos, y no puede acceder a armas es posible evitar esta masacre, y lo cierto que se pone mas dificil el camimino de llegar a suna situacion la que vivimos hoy. 

[00:35:19]


>>> Estados unidos sufrio multiples matanzas este a??o, en oakland, un ex ex estudante mato a 7 personas, ninguna universidad catolica, el asesino fue capturado. 
>>> El 20 de un estudiante universitario asesino a 12 personas durante el estreno. La masacre de colorado, estas i ima. Y y y cuanta armas hay en estados unidos? Hay aproximadamente 3000 millones de armas, tenemos cerca de 315 millones, hay casi un arma por cada uno de los habitantes, 38% adolescentehohares ameministerio fiscal y lo volvemos a pensar, si su hijo va a casa de un amigo, la posibilidad es que una de haya unarma. Guety que ptfre y en los accipdentes donde muren ni??os, un menor que lleva un ara, y coriur chulzf y el tema de fondo es las armas de asalto, las armas con posibilidad de repeticion, y tenemos que decir, no es un debate facil. No es un tque se va a solucionar del dia para la ma??ana. 

[00:37:34]


>>> Y s que pofiy la casa blanca esta enfocada en el apismo fiscal, y para el primero de otro se van a recordar beneficios y tambien muchas ofertas. Y es que que el presidenta prohibida y si tenemos dos temas, economico y de migracion, el presidente esta dispuesto gastar parte de su capital politico para enfrentar a la asociacion del rifle y a los republicanos. 
>>> Si tiene oportunidad de hacerlo es ahora, primero por un hecho sin antecedentes, es un problema que llega nuevamente al poder, respaldado en las urnas, y un presidente que no tiene aspiracion de volver al poder. O sea que no deberia tener el temor de perder futuras elecciones. Si tiene capital politico para gastar que es lo que tiene que hacer un ptocoolitico... 
>>> Esta dispuesto el presidente y los republicanos a ponerse a discutir de armas de fuego cuando tienen esta crisis economica que tienen? No estoy seguro que se atreven a hacerlo. 
>>> Si no es ahora dificilmente se planteara nunca. Es un presidente conmovido con lo que sucedio. Y lo que el dijo mas alla del gesto de llorar frente a las camaras. Y una promesa es una promesa, de tomar medidas significativas para que esto no vuelva a suceder, lo minimo que se esp es que planteo las medidas significativas. 

[00:40:17]


>>> Sigo impresionado con las imagenes de obama, en los estados unidos hay cerca de 300 millones de armas, pistolas, rifles. 
>>> Hay mas armas que personas. 
>>> No habia visto a esa gente corriendo... En fin, 300 millones de armas, y en el 38% de los hogares norteamericanos hay un arma. 
>>> Y mas de un arma. Lo comentamos ahora, sorprende que alguien pueda tener un r 15 que es un arma de asalto, se complan las mas sofisticadas armas con extrema facilidad. 
>>> Y en un mes promedio el numero de armas vendidas puede llegar a superar el millon. 
>>> Aca estamos viendo nuevas imagenes. 
>>> Esto es nuevo. Hay una persona que estan buscando, se encontro un vehiculo en el parqueaderoel colegio. Como dijo el representante de policia, los hechos se presentaron hacia las 9 de la ma??ana, la policia llego cuando todavia estaba en desarrollo el tiroteo. Y vamos a ver si nos cumplen, dentro de tres minutos nos prometieron el representante de la policia regresar a hablar con la prensa, los datos que nos dio, estas imagenes son nuevas, son ni??os... 

[00:42:29]


>>> Seria la imagen normal de cualquier colegio, ni??os sentados esperando, y resulta que llegaron y no encontraron a sus hijos, no me puedo imaginar algo mas devastador que esto, no hay nada peor para un padre que perder a un hijo, y si hay algo peor es perderlo en esta circun circunstancia. Y la angustia de lospadres es esa llamada que algo pasa en la escuela. Es la fila de autos y de padres que estan regresando de la escuela donde fueron a recoger a sus hijos. 
>>> Los que por fortuna llevaron a su peque??a ni??a a la casa, lo que no pasa con otras 20 familias. Vamos a conocer datos, y todavia falta mucha informacion que nos estremecera mas de lo que sucedio hasta el momento. Cuando comencemos los rostros de la tragedia, cuando conozcamos la historia y la cara de esos ni??os, como decia el presidente que iban a recogerlos y llevarlos a dormir esta noche. Cuando comencemos a conocer esos rostros le vamos a dar la dimension tragica de esto. 
>>> El diario washington post cuenta la historia sobre como una maestra cuando se entero de los disparos metio a todos los alumnos en un closet y salvo a todos. 
>>> Esas son las historias que vamos a empezar a conocer, los datos de heroismo, uno de los directivos principales del colegio murio, las circunstancias de lo que hace en medio de las tragedias, las historia de heroismo. Porque es una informacion que apenas empezamos a conocer y que nos llevara muchos dias darle su real dimension. Estamos en medio de los hechos por decirlo periodisticamente, uno tras otro con informaciones que cambian, el marco general lo vamos a conocer a lo largo de los dias, pero hoy ocurrio una tragedia de unas dimensiones que no se bian conocido, por mas que circunstancias asi se hayan repetido en el pasado, pero nunca 20 ni??os fueron victimas de una situacion asi. 

[00:45:25]


>>> La poblacion de newtown queda a 80 millas de la ciudad de nueva york, tiene una poblacion de 30 mil personas. Es un pueblo peque??o. Y nadie hubiera esperado que sea el centro de la noticia a nivel mundial. Miramos los principales medios en el mundo. Y por decir algo, el periodico el pais, uno de los principales medios en espa??ol tiene a lo largo de su cabecera, 20 ni??os entre los 27 muertos en una matanza en un colegio de estados unidos. Es la informacion a lo largo y ancho del mundo. Y el video del presidente, las lagrimas del presidente obama ante el terror, el otro titular, y el video repetido una y otra vez cuando hablaba de lo que sucedio hoy, y mas alla de la carga emotiva, este que vemos aqui, hemos tenido demasiadas masacres como esta, tenemos que tomar medidas significativas para que esto no vuelva a suceder. 
>>> La informacion fue cambiando, 20 ni??os, 6 adultos, se reporta que el agresor se suicido en el lugar. Y entonces, hablamos de 20 ni??os, 6 adultos, incluyendo el director y sicologo de la escuela, los reportes es que se metio a la oficina y mato a ellos dos y luego a otros 4 adultos segun lo que dijo el propio presidente. 

[00:47:33]


>>> Una mascara y un vestido de negro fue utilizado por el asesino de la masacre en el teatro de colorado. 
>>> Y luego se va a la seccion del colegio donde estan los dos salones, donde se presenta el acto criminal mas grande de esta larga trayectoria, y va a esa seccion del colegio, y entra donde esta su madre, y comienza a disparar contra los menores que estaban en ese salon. En las redes sociales, esta cobertura la puede seguir a traves de su celular en univision.Com. Las redes sociales estan absolutamente inundadas de comentarios, estos son los momentos donde hay mas rumores que verdad. Asi que u agradece cuando una organizacion confirma los datos. Pero no deja de sorprenderme cuando en el washington post hablan de como ayudar a la comunidad de newtown. 
>>> Es un trabajo a nivel nacional, como esta noche todos los que somos padres de familia, tenemos que explicarles que paso, porque lo peor que se puede hacer es ocultar una realidad, hay que tener tacto y argentino y ense??arles lo que paso para que ellos enfrenten el mundo en el que viven. 

[00:49:34]


>>> Voy a leer algunas ds frases que me llamaron la atencion en twitter. 
Una de ellas dice: Se desperto en un pais que cualquiera puede comprar un arma, algo que debe ser cambiado. Para mi seria facil irnos a algunas de las tiendas en la calle 8 y sin ningun tipo de investigacion. 
>>> Comprar un fusil de asalto. 
>>> Seria mas facil comprar una arma. 
>>> Hay mas restricciones en comprar un medicamento que a la hora de comprar una pistola automatica. 
>>> Bloomberg segun cita antonio 
ca??o, dice: Esto tiene que acabar hoy. 
>>> Y leya un twitt interesante al representante del diario el pais, las muertes que se dan por armas de fuego en estados unidos representan dos guerras de irak. 
>>> Es adan lanza, ryan es el nombre de su hermano, lo confirmamos. Y no sabemos que paso con el. Habia reportes que habia sido uno de los que murio, no sabemos. 
>>> Y empezaremos a conocer, de lo que pasaba al interior, de las circunstancias de todos los personajes que obtienen una notoriedad, y que es tema de discusion, ellos buscan una notoriedad, salir del anonimato, o que se mueve al interior de una mente criminal como la que se conocio hoy. Esto siempre esta planeado hasta ultimo detalle, no se deja nada al azar. Tienen un plan que ejecutan y con la frialdad. 

[00:52:04]


>>> Las redes sociales es un verdadero placer, te llenan de indignacion algunas veces, pero cuando pasan esta cosas quienes se oponen al control de armas dicen que no es el momento, y primero las victimas, las horas de las familias, y no, es este el momento, porque el debate despues se olvida. 
>>> Estamos llegando al final de esta cobertura, en algunos minutos el portavoz de la policia estatal de connecticut habia prometido llegar antes para darnos la ultima informacion, y vamos resumiendo lo que vivimos tragicamente esta ma??ana. Eran las 9:30 cuando se recibio la primera primera al 911. 
>>> En esta escuela piden ayuda urgente. La polia al ver la gravedad de esto despliega su fuerza y llegan en medio del tiroteo segun dijo la policia, se producian los hechos cuando llegan los agentes, y se encuentran con lo que se encuentran, 20 ni??os muertos, 6 adultos. Y la imen mas vivida que tenemos es la del pistolero lanza matando a su padre, sugiere de un hombre con serios problemas mentales, mata a su padre, segun la cronologia, despues va a la escuela, tiene acceso a la escuela, seguramente es el hijo de la maestra, lo dejan pasar, ademas una poblacion peque??a, donde uno de cada 5 habitantes es hispano. Llega el pistolero donde se encuentra su madre, mata a su madre, y despues dispara en contra de los ni??os, esto paso en una seccion de la escuela, y el portavoz decia que ocurrieron en dos salones de clase, y conocemos historias de una maestra que se encierra en su salon y los mete en el closet. Hasta que tiene la tranquilidad que todo paso. 

[00:55:07]


>>> No como originalmente se suponia. Y testigos dicen escuchar dis disparos, la informacion de testigos dicen que iba vestido de negro. Y cuando entra primero a la oficina del director. Donde estaba el sicologoambien de la escuela. En ese principio conocen de un incidente, pero no se conocia la real situacion de los... 20 incidentes como este en los ultimos 20 a??os. Sorprende porque las victimas son ni??os. Es la mayor masacre en una escuela. 
>>> Aqui en estados unidos va a generar un gran debate. El presidente de estados unidos dijo que h que hacer algo significativo, y que hay 300 millones de armas. Y el 38 de los hogares en estados unidos, 38% tienen armas en este momento. 
>>> Ahora vamos nuevamente a la rueda de prensa. 
>>> Tenemos algunos segundos. 
>>> Queremos que la familia puedan tener comunicacion constante. 

[00:57:33]


>>> Y tener acceso al edificio y comezar el proceso de investigacion, tenemos el equipo canino, tambien el helicoptero en el aire, todos los recursos posibles los hemos llamado al sitio desde el momento de la se??al de alarma, hicimos todo lo posible para proteger vidas y propiedades. Hemos tomado el parque, la comunidad esta expresando sus condolencias, nacen todo lo posible para darle apoyo a las victimas. El equipo de manejo de crisis del fbi para ayudarnos con las familias, parientes, y tambien a los socorristas, el personal de emergencia, a toda la gente que hemos descrito en una situacion te te terr el equipo estuvo activo, trabajando, brindando asistencia. Quiero dejar en claro que hubo 18 ni??os muertos en escena, dos llevados a hospitales locales. 6 adultos muertos en la escena del crimen, y el atacante fue declarado muerto en el sitio del suceso. Hay otro lugar que descubrimos a medida que investigamos, especialmente tratamos de investigar los antecedentes, alguien me pregunto sobre la activacion de un equipo explosivo, estamos tratando asegurar... 

[00:59:40]


>>> Son las declaraciones del jefe de policia. 
>>> Seguimos con "primer impacto." Y MAS ADELqNTE TENDREMOS MAS. ??? ??? ??? ???

=======================================================

Local, and certainly the staff of the school. They were there for those children, which is what teachers are all about. And it was most obvious today, most obvious today, what they really are about as teachers. To all of them, I say thanks on behalf of all of us. 
>> And that does it for us. Thank you for watching. Erin burnett "outfront" starts now. 
>>> Breaking news, massacre in newtown, connecticut. I'm ashleigh banfield in for erin burnett. This just in. Listen. . Sandy hook school. Caller thinks someone is shooting in the building. Front glass is broken, unsure why. All units, the individual that i have on the phone is continuing to hear whate believes to be gunfire. Units responding sandy hook school at this time, the shooting appears to have stopped. The school is in lockdown. 
>> That broken glass is the result of the gunman reportedly shooting his way into the school. The unthinkable tragedy has left this very small new england town shattered tonight. 28 people dead. That's including the shooter himself. Most of those killed were students at the school. Very, very young students. There were 20 children killed. Between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. E were also 6 adults shot dead after a heavily armed gunman dressed in black fatigues and a military vest opened fire in the school. 
>> We just told a little boy about his sister now and just to see him, he said who am I going to play with? I have nobody to play with now. Excuse me. 

[00:02:05]


>> The gunman, 20-year-old adam lanza, also died at the scene, from a self-inflicted wound, his mother, nancy lanza found dead at the family home here in newtown as well. She ha had been a teacher at the sandy hook elementary school. The school's principal, dawn hochsprung among those killed. And a friend remembers her tonight as the kind of person you want educating your kids. And the gunman's older brother, ryan lanza, taken in for questioning by police in hoboken in new jersey and handcuffed. Officials did not label him a suspect. The gunman's father also questioned in relation to what happened here today, and tonight, a nation in mourning. Candle-light vigils held in newtown and across the country. Also one just outside the without in washington, d.C. Earlier today, president obama ordered flags half staff nationwide for the victims of the tragedy. In an emotional address, he said this to the nation. 
>> I know there is not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings. Kids of their own. 
>> A extraordinarily emotional president obama earlier today. Obviously, so many questions that are emerging after what happened today. A virtual massacre of little, tinny children, and the weapons that were used, nothing short of terrifying. Susan candiotti following this today. Three different weapons found in different places, very dangerous weapons. 

[00:04:28]


>> Two weapons found on the shooters himself, in the classroom, where he was found dead. One of them is a glock, and the other is a sig sauer, both handguns, a third weapon found in a car, a vehicle, may have been his, outside the school. 
>> Is that the school been parked so erratically, roped off with the crime tape? 
>> Exactly. Closely examining that car. The third weapon a semi automatic known as a bushmaster .223. All of the weapons belonged to his mother. A mother, school teacher at the school and they were registered in the state of connecticut as well. Trying to piece all of this together, why did they have those guns. How did he get them? 
>> Just one area I know will be a huge topic of conversation for days and months to come. Another big question for so many. The names of these children. There are 20 children who died. Six adults who died in the school. Nancy, the mother who died in her residence. When wilthe official identity of victims? 
>> Tomorrow mornin they expect to release the identities. They have been working very diligently to check, double check, and triple check they have all of the right people and that everyone, members of the family have been notified. Expect to hear that in the morning. 
>> So sad to see by exclusion they have made the identities obvious by those who were not reunited with the children. POSITIVE I.D.s, FORENSIC PROJECT That we will be working throughout the night, where the children's bodies still lay. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Susan candiotti, thank you, we appreciate it. 
>> You bet. 
>> And drew griffin working on as much information we can find on the shooter, adam lanza. What have you found out? 

[00:06:29]


>> Actually, this is playing out in almost a sickening routine. A possible mental health issue, the family trying to deal with the mental healthish eaus. Something snaps, guns easily accessible and the shooting happens. Here is what we know. The 20-year-old shooter had an older brother. That brother reportedly told abc news that the shooter, his brother, had a personality disorder. He also mentioned his brother had autism or was autistic. Cnn heard that same information from a man who called himself a friend in newtown where the shooter lived. Already, we're seeing a kind of base for some mental health questions being raised, ashleigh. 
>> Drew, just quickly. What about warning signs. Anybody talking about warning signs? 
>> Not yet. I fully expect we will see that and more detail on that. Right now, also somewhat standard in these cases, ashley, you will find people shocked that this particular person could have been involved in anything like this. Listen to what we heard in there a former classmate and school bus driver who knew the 20-year-old. 
>> He was just a kid. 
>> Just a kid? 
>> Just a kid. 
>> Never anti social? 
>> No. Adam has got a -- no. 
>> Trouble maker? 
>> No, definitely not. 
>> Noticeable? Just kind of blend into the background? 
>> Ye nothing that would warrant any of this. 
>> They are saying he went after his mom and her class of kids. Can you wrap your head around that? 
>> No, I cannot. I don't know who would do anything like this. 
>> So your general sense is what? 
>> This is -- this is unspeakable. When I first heard about it -- I'm still in shock. Excuse me a moment. I need to go. 

[00:08:37]


>> A nice kid. Very politely. She raised very nice boys, to me. That's why I think it's a to even know them and realize who they are and what he did. You cannot understand what happened, that he snapped, what have you, and took such innocent lives. 
>> Ashleigh, I'm convinced in the coming days, maybe even tomorrow, we'll begin hearing there were warning signs, that there were mental health issues, there was a family that didn't know how to handle the situation or where to turn, we have seen it at the shooting at virginia tech, gaby giffords, aurora, colorado, movie theater. I'm sure we'll see that. What we will not see, really, for the families, is any kind of explanation that will make sense of this. Because right now, it's senseless. 
>> And just so unbearably difficugest, especially here on the scene. Thout question, something must have been terribly wrong. Thank you so much. One name you will likely be hearing more of, her name is kaitlin roig. She is being hailed as a hero. She spoke with diane sawyer on "world news tonight" earlier. Have a listen. 
>> In my mind, I'm thinking, as a 6-year-old, 7-year-old, what are your thoughts? And I'm thinking that I have to almost be their parent. Like I have to tell them, so i said to them, I said I need you to know that I love you all very much. And that it's going to be okay. Because I thought that was the last time they were ever going to hear. I thought we were all going to die. You know, I don't know if that's okay. You know, teachers and, you know, I wanted them to know someone loved them and I wanted that to be one of the la things they heard, not the gunfire in the hallway. It is just so horrible. So horrible. 

[00:10:45]


>> Incredibly emotional story. I'm joined by the haskins family, bob and his children, julia and bobby. Bob, I want to ask you about a friend of yours who is a basketball coach here in town, who has two children attending sandy hook. One of those children was a first grader who witnessed something absolutely unbelievable. I want you to recount for me the story if you will. 
>> Absolutely. Just spoke to him an hour or so ago. His young son was in class, and the shooter broke into the classroom, front of his eyes gunned down the teacher, he was astute to take a couple of students and ran out the door behind the back of the shooter and ran out of the school and continued to run for about a half a mile until he hit the main road. A stranger picked up the kids and took them to the newtown police department. Unbeknownst to the parents, when they went to talk to the state troopers and parents, her son was unaccounted for. Go door to door, look in the woods, and for an hour or so, they had no idea where their son was. They called the police department a couple of times, had no record of him being there and finally after about an hour and a half, they called and relieved to find out, indeed, their son had been dropped off at the police department safe and sound. 
>> At that time, they must have thought the worst. 
>> They thought the worst. It was very, very difficult time for them. He said it was the worst hour and a half he's ever experienced in his life. 
>> Police interviewed this first grader. I'm guessing he's 6, 7 years old. 6 years old. They interviewed him since he was there. 
>> What did he tell them, what kind of detail? 
>> THE INTERVIEW, VERi Elementary. They asked what he saw. Described the shooter, his face, expression. They asked what was his recollection of the room. He said I saw a whole bunch of silver bullets on the floor of the classroom, when I got into the hall, I saw a whole bunch of bullets on the floor, and this weren't silver, they were red, unfortunately, covered with blood in the hallway. And at that point, he ran, sprinted out of the school. 

[00:12:58]


>> Did he give a description any further about the sher, the face, did he say anything? Anything like that? 
>> He described what he looked like. But it's a very elementary city description because he's 6 years old. 
>> Julia, you are -- have you a different story. You're in the middle school here in town. You went into lockdown right away as soon as this happened. 
>> Yes. 
>> Did you know what was happening? Everybody has cell phones and might have been text messages, did you know what was going on? 
>> No clue what was going on until the first hour. One of the my teachers said there was a shooting a mile down the road. 
>> Do you have a classmate who had a little brother at the school? 
>> Yes. The boy who I was sitting right next to during the lockdown, his little brother ended up dying. 
>> How did he find that out? 
>> I'm not exactly sure. I haven't talked to him yet today, during the lockdown, he didn't say anything. I didn't even know he had a little brother at sandy hook school until I just found out his brother had died. 
>> He hadn't been concerned at the time about finding out the fate of his little brother while he was in lockdown in your classroom? 
>> It didn't seem like it, no. 
>> Bobby, you were in another school as well. Hand this off to you. You were another school, you went into lockdown. What was the experience for you? 
>> It was a little different. We were in church at the time. Friday school mass and monsignor wise came in, we need to end mass down and go to immediate lockdown. What happened, the teachers went around, locked all the doors and we sat in the pews and just waited and we could hear sirens for about an hour. 
>> Did you like your sister eventually find out what was going on? 
>> Yeah, we -- eventually went back to the school, and then my class was locked down in the basement, and our teachers told us that there had been a shooting and there were fatalities, but I didn't know the seriousness of it until my dad picked me up early from school, and on the car ride home, he told me there are quite a few fatalities? 

[00:15:11]


>> Are you okay? 
>> We went to the vigil tonight at 7:00. It was very emotional. 
>> You are awfully young to digest this. None of us are handling this well. 
>> It didn't really sink in. I was numb up until -- until the vigil and I think I kind of broke down at the vigil, because it was so sad to see everyone there and see -- they had actually 28 candles on the altar to represent the victims. 
>> At the vigil. And pass the mike to your dad. Bob, an incredible moment at the vigil, there was a letter that was read from the pope. 
>> There was a letter that was wrote -- that was written by pope benedict to our community specifically, which was very touching. And very meaningful. It meant a great deal to the whole community, and on top of that, what was really emotional for us, monsignor wise, a wonderful pastor of our church talked about in his homily, the time he spent with the 20 families today, and in particular he mentioned two little angels being one of whom the mother of the victim said she went out recently and got her first commune dress, and the daughter was very, very excited about that. And the other little angel was going to play an angel in our school play at st. Rose next week. A very poignant story and very, very emotional for us to hear and digest. 
>> How is your friend? The basketball coach whose child went through this harrowing ordeal, how is he doing? 
>> I think best way to describe it, traumatized. A wonderful man, wonderful person, wonderful family, and although he's incredibly grateful, you know, that his son is safe, his heart is certainly bleeding for the other children in the classroom, because two of his son's classmates did perish in that saga that I told you, when the gunman came in. Two of the little boys classmate's were killed today. 

[00:17:16]


>> And he witnessed. 
>> He witnessed it. 
>> He witnessed his own teacher being shot. Thank you very much. And our hearts go out to all of you here. The nation is in mourning with everybody here in newtown. I hope are you going to be okay. Hug your kids tight. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> Coming up next, the haskins family touched on the vigil and the very special message that came from halfway around the world. The governor was here, the senators were here. We'll give you a better feel for exactly what it was like inside the church, later on. ?????? ??????

>>> This is a community of 27,000 people. Newtown, connecticut, it is quiet, it is spacious. There are halcyon areas where trees stretch between houses, and yet it's still a close town and people know each other and they needed something, anything, to try to come together after the horrors that they were forced to endure today. The fact that so many of their childin this community will no longer be with them. They gathered at a catholic church, st. Rose of lima. You were there for the vigil tonight. Jason carroll, it was standing room only? 
>> Beyond that. Hundreds of people outside here, ashleigh, who couldn't get inside. They came out here, they wanted something, anything, leaning on each other and they leaned on their faith and they came out today, no question about it. Spoke to a deacon here, explained it, and said when you have a community this close it should come as no surprise, hundreds of people out here, most people knew someone. If it wasn't a parent it was a child. If it wasn't a child, it was a teacher. If it wasn't a teacher, it was an admiadministrator. They came for comforting words from monsignor robert wise. Who read a letter from the pope. 
>> I conhave a my heartfelt grief and the assurance of my personal prayers to the victims and their families. To all of those and the community of newtown and especially the parish of st. Rose of lima, in the aftermath of the senseless tragedy, I ask god our father to console all of those who mourn, and to sustain the entire community with the spiritual strength which triumphs over violence with the power of forgiveness, hope, and reconciling love. 

[00:23:47]


>> And, ashleigh, one of the deacons at the church. He said throughout the day he had received almost 100 people who had come through church doors lookcomfort, looking for answers, many asking why. And I told them sometimes there are no answers, sometimes it's just too soon. Maybe this is one that only god can answer. 
>> Jason, one of the six adults killed was the school's principal, dawn hochsprung. Have you learned more about her? 
>> We are hearing so much about her. 47 years old. Two daughters, three stepdaughters. She has been the principal at sandy hook since june 2010. Constantly twittering, so proud of her school. Twittering about fourth graders just this week. From all accounts, ashleigh, she was a woman who loved her school, loved her students, lovered her jobs, we talked about that close community, no surprise to find a man out here today, who knew her, knew her well. And he wants you to hear what he had to say about her. 
>> Dawn, I had dinner with her last spring, she was exciting, exuberant, and a great educator. It's sad, they lost a leader today at sandy hook. My prayers will be, you know, for our community as well. 
>> Again, as you heard, lost a leader here, and dealing with this loss, dealing with the pain, dealing with the suffering, and this is what this community is going to cope with from this point on. For days, weeks, months, and certainly for the parents of those children, no saying how long they will be dealing with their grief. Ashleigh. 

[00:25:52]


>> And so distressing, jason, to know that principal just this fall implemented a brand new security system where you had to get buzzed in at 9:30 in the morning, and yet this was perpetrated against her school. Jason carroll, reporting live just across town from where i am. Part of the reason I am where i am, is that the media is getting regular updates at this location, not only from the state police, but also from connecticut's governor dan malloy, who has come at regular intervals to brief us, but also spoken with the families who were given the ultimate terrible news they would not be reuniting with their children. He made another stop at the vigil jason reported on. 
>> Good evening, everyone. Monsignor, thank you very much for opening this very beautiful church so that we might in a communal way find solace and one another as a result of the unspeakable having occurred in this community. People's children, brothers, sisters, were taken from them. People's spouses. Those teachers and administrators, were taken from us. Yet we stand in a church and many of us today, in the coming days, will rely upon that which we have been taught and that which we inherently believe that there is faith for a reason and that faith itself is god's gift to all of you. And in these times of troubles and travails, when the unthinkable happens in our very midst, our faith is tested. Not just in the religious sense, not just necessarily our faith in god, but our faith in community, in who we are, in what we collectively offer. And in so many ways, permissible to have those thoughts and those doubts about who we are, what we are, what community represents, but then we turn to understand as we turn around this room and recognize our friends and our neighbors. Those we have done things for, and those who have done things for us. This is a great and beautiful community located in a great and beautiful state in a great and beautiful nation. In the coming days, the coming weeks, I will pray that you all embrace one another. That you lift one another up. That you understand the difficulties that you collectively will undergo. Keep in your prayers the children who last their lives today. Keep in your prayers the adults who lost their lives today. And understand that a test is just that. That which we rise to and answer and respond to. The coming days as many of us prepare to celebrate the birth of christ, understand that that to will bring sorrow as we think about these instances that have happened so close to those days. But that too will pass and be overcome. And all of our prayers and the prayers and hopes of all of the public officials who have assembled today and in the presence of your great collect person, I bring and extend the entire condolences to you, members of this community. May god bless you. My god bless our children who are with us today and those who were taken away. And god bless the adults who lost their lives today. Thank you. 

[00:30:10]


>> I wanted to share with you one of the more poignant stories that I learned today from a nurse named maureen. She wanted to volunteer. When she heard what was going on at the school, she and another nurse raced to the school to help and found themselves surprised that there was nothing for them to do. Sadly, they began to understand that there were no more survivors coming out of the school. They made theiry to the fire station, a staging area for patients to be reunited with their kids, and, of course, it was a staging area where a lot of parents wouldn't be reunited with their children either. The sad story that she told me was the moment that, unfortunately, the authorities had to tell these parents that there were no more survivors. Another witness, who was in the area said that the cries and the wails were overwhelming, that it was one of the more difficult things to have to undergo. O priests who were on the scene as well, at least two grief counselor there to try to handle what was going to happen with these approximately 50 people. You think about it, 20 kids, and they all have parents, so roughly 50 people had to endure that terrible moment, when they were told they would likely never see their children again. Coming up, a woman who works at a daycare here in town tells us that many of her daycare students had graduated to become students at sandy ho elementary. She'll talk to us in a moment.

>>> Live in newtown, connecticut, tonight, in a story that overwhelmed many people as it ban to unfold. A story we've often covered before. Shots may have rung out at a school. But as details rolled in and the magnitude of this horror unfolded, it was astounding, the sheer numbers involved. Here is how the day played out. We are following this report that there has been a shooting at an elementary school, elementary school named sandy hook. 

[00:35:13]


>> The intercom came on at the school, and she heard a scream, and a gunshot. Two gunshots. 
>> Troopers to the school and immediately upon arrival began to the school and began a complete active shooters search of the building. 
>> They had to hide in the closet, and the children were very shaken, crying in the closet. 
>> I saw some of the bullets going past the hall, t a teacher pulled me into her classroom. 
>> The police came in. It's like is he in here? Then he ran out,nd our teacher, and somebody yelled get to a safe place. 
>> I heard the principal shot and killed. I heard -- I heard some kids were shot. A teacher, mrs. Hammonds was shot. 18 children pronounced dead at the school. Two transported to area hospitals and pronounced dead at area hospitals and six pronounced dead at the scene. 
>> We told a little boy about his sister, and it's so hard. Aid I have nobody to play with now. But -- excuse me. 
>> The perpetrator of the crime is dead. As is an individual who the perpetrator lived with. 
>> Ryan lanza being taken into custody today in hoboken. Ryan lanza not charges with anything today. At this point he is being questioned. 
>> There is a related scene that we discovered as we continued our criminal investigation. 
>> I ask god our forther to console those who mourn and sustain the entire community with the strength which triumphs over violence with the power of forgiveness, hope, and reconciling love. 
>> This was the second deadliest school shooting in american history. 20 young children lott lost lost their lives, ages 5 to 10. The rest of the classmates were robbed of innocence after witnessing this tragedy, these parents will forever be mourning. I want to introduce to you michelle babco. She used to work at a daycare and watched many of the children that were in the elementary school at the time of the shooting. How did you find out about the shooting? 

[00:37:38]


>> Earlier this afternoon, i contacted a family and asked if the girls were okay. They were home safe and sound, but to pray for the ones that wunfortunate. 
>> Do you know if any of the kids who attended your daycare were victims of the rampage? 
>> All of them right now home safe and sound with their families. 
>> It must be an enormous relief? 
>> It was. To hear all of the kids I have kept in touch with all these years were home, yes. 
>> Did you have a chance to talk to their parents or f out how they are doi 
>> I did. I said they are very fortate, home, and, you know, to pray for the ones that were not so fortunate in the shooting earlier today. And very, very happy that their little ones are home safe and sound. 
>> You work at the daycare, the little explorers daycare. 
>> Yes. 
>> Are you closed? Are you going to be able to keep working on monday? Is anything changing in terms of your security measures? How will this affect you as you go forward, looking after your little ones? 
>> I worked there several years ago, but it is up and running as of today. 
>> It is running? 
>> It is. 
>> You also have a friend who is a teacher at the school. 
>> Yes. I found out that she was injured earlier today and last time i spoke to the family that keeps in touch with her, she was still in the hospital. 
>> How was she injured? 
>> She was shot in the foot. 
>> Do you know if she was in that meeting whereby the principal and the school psychologist were shot dead? There was a report that three of these teachers in the meeting had emerged into the hallway when the gunshots rang out and only one came back and was injured in the foot or the leg and I'm trying to put together whether it might have been your friend? 
>> It might have been the same person, I'm uncertain of that. I know she was shot in the foot. 

[00:39:42]


>> How are you processing this? 
>> It's hard to hanel this, i had all of these kids since they were three. I keep in touch with the families and just verythankful that they are home on this holiday with their parents, but still praying for the ones that were injured. 
>> And newtown, such a beautiful and quiet community. Everyone who goes through a tragedy says it would never occur that it would happen there. And it certainly doesn't occur that it would happen here. 
>> It could happen anywre. It's small, quaint, and quiet, but it's unfortunate that it did happen. 
>> You and your neighbors going to be okay? 
>> Yes, home with my parents. We'll be okay. 
>> Thank you for talking with us. Good luck to you as well. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Thank you very much. I want to go back to my colleagues, drew griffin. A number of weapons that were recovered at the school. All of them. All three owned by the shooter's mother. Registered. Connecticut has some of the toughest gun laws on the books in this nation. Now there are calls for even stricter gun control. And drew griffin has that part of the story as well. 
>> I can tell you, we know these guns were legally owned because of connecticut's very strict gun control laws. Let me tell you what they are, ashleigh. The two handguns in the state of connecticut require a certificate of possession. A five-year license to obtain and at weapon. It comes with the requirement you go through a training course. A handgun safety course. As for that assault rifle, if that is indeed an operating semi assault rifle. That gun is banned in connecticut, however, if the gun was purchased and in the possession of the mother prior to october of 1993. That gun would have been grand fathered in to her possession. But that would have to be registered to her with the state as well. Very strict gun laws in the state of connecticut. Yes, these guns were all legally owned. 

[00:41:48]


>> And, drew, the shooter in thiscase, adam lanza, he had no criminal record, no one can find anything that he has done wrong. Would that have factored into whether he would have greater access to certain guns in the state? 
>> Being 20 years old, no way he could have purchased a handgun legally, certificate or not. He's too young. He could not have purchased that assault rifle because it's banned unless you have the grandfather clause. Legally speaking, he could not have owned these guns. We'll turn to the fact that they were in the mother's home. Obviously accessible and how were they stored, did the mom know he he was using the guns, training the guns? We'll look at those types of issues. As for connecticut gun laws, ashleigh, to say that the kid could have gone out and bought these guns? The answer is, legally, no. 
>> A glock and sig sauer found on his person in the school after he apparently killed himself an bushmaster .223 found in the vehicle that he had apparently left erratically parked out in front of the school. Drew griffin, thank you for looking into that. Drew griffin reporting live. This particular school, not a large school, somewhat spread out. Sandy hook has a square formation, and the shooter took a certain path through the school. But as they said, the officials said, he wasn't running through the halls and shooting. He was very specific about where he targeted. Have a look at how tom foreman lays this out for us. 9:30, a normal start to the day. Approximately 600 students in class, 50 faculty members. We don't have a complete read on the layout of the school or the timeline, we'll try and piece together all day long as investigators have. Some idea. Day getting underway, a meeting happening up here involving the principal, vice principal, a school psychologist and several other adults in this area, then around 9:40, best we can tell from witnesses, just ten minutes later, the gunman enters the build. How did he do it? The new security system, not sure how he got past that or if it was locked up at that point. Police looked very hard at a car parked in the fire lane. Still there surrounded by tape as best I can tell. Suggested would be that somehow the gunman came right through the front door, into the school. And people throughout this building reported and one fire. 9:41, that's when the calls started coming in to 911. The principal, the vice principal, and the school psychologist, according to witnesses, went out to the hall and toward the gun if fire to see what was happening. Shouting, many shoutings and shots. He came back into the meeting room wounded. All of the shooting happened in a relatively short period of time and the gunman did not roam around, but generally stayed in just two rooms and a hallway right up in here, that's, in fact, where they ultimately found him. 9:45, teachers trying to protect students all throughout the school. Some around the gym mass yum were told to hide in close elts. Others led outside to flee. Not really clear if that happened with teachers or later helped out by law enforcement officials. We know there was a real effort throughout the school to get the kids to some sort of safety. This picture from the newtown bee. And all of the teachers try to do something about it. They didn't know what was going on. It's unclear, at what point in this process the gunman died. They found himself dead in one of the the rooms there. The suggestion? Probably he killed himself. More details as we go on. We know that law enforcement agents arrived at the school, they set up a perimeter of state and local police. They entered immediately to secure rooms to find students and make sure if a gunman was still active, they got him under control. Then they quickly started leading students away from the school, trying to get them out of safety. A horrendous event. Very difficult even for the officers involved. They had to tell many of the children, avert your eyes, close your eyes. They knew they would lead them right past many of the victims. 

[00:47:02]


>> Oh, tom. Such a difficult detail to listen to, that the children had to avert their eyes as they escaped the school. You know, it is not often that the president of the united states sheds a tear in public, and today it happened. You'll see the president's moving tribute to the victims, after the break. 
>>> This evening michelle and i will do what I know everyone parent in america will do. Which is hug our children a little tighter and tell them that we love them, and we'll remind each other how deeply we love one another. There are families in connecticut that cannot do that tonight. And they need all of us right now. And our days to come, that community needs to us be at our best as americans, and I will do everything in my power as president to help. bank. Why they have a raise your rate cd. Tonight our guest, thomas sargent. Nobel laureate in economics, and one of the most cited economists in the world. Professor sargent, can you tell me what cd rates will be in two years? No. If he can't, no one can. That's why ally has a raise your rate cd. Ally bank. Your money needs an ally. 

[00:50:44]


>>> For much of the day, so much confusion about who the shooter who perpetrated this terrible act here in newtown, connecticut, was. There was confusion, because he was using i.D. That didn't belong to him. It belonged to his brother. A brother who is in hoboken, connecticut. And that cnfusion led police right to that brother's front door. He's been arrested now as well. And john berman has details how that played out. 
>> Ashleigh, this street where I'm stanning has been the sight of a huge amount of activity today, anhigh number of questions. Behind me? The apartment brother where the brother of the shooter lives. Ryan lanza. Led to a car in handcuffs. Taken into custody for questioning. Also questioned according to sources telling cnn, two roommates of the brother who lives here, believed to have no connection at all to the suspect. This building behind me, a five-story building with two- and three-bedroom apartments, on the street, hoboken police, jersey city police, bomb squad representatives, although they didn't go into the apartment building, and the fbi had a presence here. The fbi did remove materials from this apartment, including some kind of computer. There are questions about why the brother was taken into custody at all, especially in handcuffs. Onlice officer on the scene did tell me, apparently some kind of confusion that the brother's i.D. May have been found on the shooter's body. That was one police officer telling me that, we're not currently confirming if ryan lanza is still in custody. Is the brother of the shooting suspect in custody. And the son of a woman killed today. Ashleigh. 
>> John berman reporting from hoboken, connecticut. And the lanza's father also question. They aren't suspects, but they have been extensively questioned. It's not often you see a president in tears, but it wasn't but a few hours this news hit the president's desk pretty quickly. He took to the air waives to offer comfort and support to the families of the victims in newtown, connecticut. Here is the address he made today. 

[00:53:18]


>> This afternoon, I spoke with dan malloy and fbi director robert mueller. I made it clear he will have every resource he needs to investigate the heinous crime, care for the victims, council their families. We have endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. Each time I hear the news, i react not as a president, but as anybody else would, as a parent and that was especially true today. I know there is not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today. For the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults who were lost, our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well. For as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early and there are no words that will ease their pain. As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it's an elementary school in newtown or a shopping mall in oregon, or a temple in wisconsin, or a movie threater in aurora, or a street corner in chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this regardless of the politics. This evening, michelle and i will do what I know every parent in america will do, hug our children a little tighter. And we'll tell them that we love them. And we'll remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in connecticut who cannot do that tonight, and they need all of us right now. And in our days to come, that community needs us to be at our best as americans and I will do everything in my power as president to help. Because while nothing can fill the space of the lost child or loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need to remind them that we are there for them, that we are praying for them, that the love they felt for those they lost endurings not just in their memories, but also in ours. May god bless the memories of the victims. And in the words of scripture, heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds. 

[00:57:03]


>> We are indeed a nation in mourning tonight and it is known across the world what happened in america, in newtown, connecticut. There has been reaction from world leaders who have written, who have made statements about this tragedy, and then there is the reaction from people, people from all corners of the world, who now have social media to let us know, to let their friends know, to let everyone know about what's happened. Josh levin with all of the reaction on twitter. 
>> People all over the world are expressing their horror and sorrow about what happened. This is part of the story. The global action. This area where you see that is on social media especially. Some of the tweets getting a lot of attention, one from mayor mike bloomberg in new york. My deepest sympathies with families are affected and my determination to stop this mad science stronger than ever. Let's jump across the pond to david cameron. Prime minister of britain. My thoughts are with those who have been devastated by the connecticut shootings. The death of so many children is truly heartbreaking. Now, this one is very interesting. Deepak chopra says he's observing silence on twitter and facebook for a period in remembrance of those that have been killed. It's an interesting idea. We'll see if it catches on. Talking to you across all platforms. The real tragedy, we keep letting this kind of thing happen over and over and over again. Another one, hold your children tight and thank the lord for them. Absolutely. I am doing that. And I know many of you are as well. The facebook page for the school is getting a pretty good amount of attention as well. People posting messages there. And we have an assignment and ireport to express condolences, thoughts for the victims and the community. 

[00:59:07]


>> Josh, live on the twitter reaction. As we leave you tonight, there is a very large project that lies ahead for the investigators, for the police, for the responders here. This was such a massive crime scene that the processing of it alone is going to take at least throughout the night, which means that those parents who were not reunited with their children, they know that those children's bodies are still in the school tonight, those teachers, those adults who were also shot, the six of them, the bodies are also in the school tonight. Positive identifications have to be done. The coroner's office has a huge task. The investigation of the shots, 100

All that. And a tumor that wasn't a baby. 
>>> Good morning, everyone. I'm lynn berry. As syria's regime appears to be crumbling, leon panetta announced today that 400 u.S. Troops were be deployed to turkey to protect against a potential syrian missile attack. Now, officials say the move is largely a symbolic show of force to signal the u.S. Will support the defense of turkey. Today russia is denying that one of its top diplomats said that president bashar al assad is losing control of his country. Nbc is live for us in cairo. He has the latest. Ayman, good morning to you. 
>> Reporter: Good morning, lynn. A series of rapid developments inside and outside the country. Inside syria, first of all, rebels announced they made very important gains on the outskirts of the city of aleppo and the capital damascus. In aleppo they're reporting to have taken over a military base belonging to the regime and in damascus, they've taken over a military installation on the outside of that country's airport. That also links to the issue of outside support for the syrian regime,ncluding russia which says it will stand by president bashar al assad despite comments yesterday from a senior russian official acknowledging that in fact president ais losing control of that country to the opposition. As you mentioned today, the united states sent a symbolic show of force to turkey and nato member along with the dutch government. They have now deployed patriotic missiles, a defense system that will include 400 american operators to work that system for the turkish government. Lynn? 

[00:02:13]


>> Ayman, thanks so much. 
>>> Back here at home after taking herself out of the running as secretary of state, susan rice is keeping her eye on ball, meeting with the president at the white house today. On twitter last night, rice rallied followers under the hash tag let's go. Saying we have a lot work to do for the american people and the world. And rice was even more specific in a "washington post" oh-ed, listing jobs, the deficit and national security among her top priorities. Nbc's danielle lee as more. 
>> Reporter: United nations ambassador susan rice was seen as president obama's favorite to follow secretary of state hillary clinton. Now she has withdrawn her name from consideration. In an exclusive interview with nbc's brian williams for rock center, rice explained her decision. 
>> I didn't want to see a confirmation process that was very prolonged, very politicized, very distracting and very disruptive, because there are so many things we need to get done as a country. 
>> Reporter: President obama accepted her decision and praised rice during an interview with nbc affiliate kcra. 
>> She's done an outstanding job. I could not be prouder with her. 
>> Reporter: Rice was widely criticized by republicans who accused her of downplaying the september 11th attack at the u.S. Consulate in benghazi. Rice attributed the attacks to an angry mob. Later, it was revealed that u.S. Intelligence knew al qaeda was involved. Rice said she was not given that information. Some republicans said they would block her no, ma'am nation to become secretaryf state. 
>> Today I made the decision it was the best thing for our country, for the american people, that I not continue to be considered by the president. 
>> And rice's announcement makes massachusetts senator john kerry the likely front-runner to be the nation's top diplomat. 

[00:04:13]


>>> There's one week to go before congress is supposed to head home for the holidays. As of right now, there's no deal on that year-end fiscal cliff. Tracie potts has the latest on this. After so-called frank talks during president obama and house speaker john boehner's second face-to-face in a week, people are hoping for good news there. Tracie, good morning. 
>> Reporter: Wish we had some to deliver. From all accounts there is still a stalemate in washington over preventing these tax hikes and spending cuts that are coming at the end of the year. You describe them the aides to both sides describe the discussion yesterday, as frank. Earlier this week they called it tense. None of that apparently really indicating any progress. For just under an hour, the presidentance republican speaker john boehner met in the oval office. The president still refusing not to go up on tax rates for the wealthy, boehner insisting that the president cut more government spending. So the bottom line is they don't seem to have any sort of agreement here. As you noted, the senate breaks next friday in fact, some house members have already started to leave. Lynn? 
>> Tracie potts there for us in washington. Thank you. 
>>> Now here's your "first look" at this morning's dish of scrambled politics. Grover norquist seems to think we might go over the fiscal cliff and taxes will go up in the new year. He says, quote, january 1st is not the end of the fight, it's the beginning of the fight. Former pennsylvania governor ed rendell is not impressed. 
>> We voted for grover norquist. He is in my judgment the wizard of oz. You peel back the curtain and there's nobody there. 
>>> The latest nbc news/"wall street journal" poll says 76% would accept raising taxes on those making more than $250,000 a year. Only 22% find that unacceptable. 
>>> We told you about the sequel to the movie "game change." That will be made about this year's presidential election. On "late night with jimmy fallon" he had reaction to that. 

[00:06:18]


>> Some tv news. Hbo is planning a new movie based on the 2012 election, similar to "game change." The network said they're not sure who will be playing mitt romney. Then mitt romney said, I'm not doing anything. 
>> A new poll found 44% of americans believe santa claus is a democrat. 28% say he's a republican. 
>>> Senators and republicans put their differences aside and exchanged secret santa presents with a $10 limit. 
>>> Utah republican mike lee gave vermont democrat and batman enthusiastic patrick leahy a batman snuggie. I didn't know those existed. Happy holidays. 
>>> Last night filmmaker and michael moore told ed schultz he is determined to change his state's newly enacted right to work law that says private and public workers do not have to pay union fees. Take a listen. 
>> They know people don't support what their doing. That's why they had to rush this thing through before january 1st. Same reason they had voter suppression. Why would you suppress the vote if you thought the majority of americans were conservative? You have to suppress the vote because you know you're in the minority. It's an admission on their part they know the american people don't like the republicans or the conservative philosophy. We're a different country now. And I think a lot of them don't have a clue about that. They think they're going to get away with it and they're not. Everybody is fighting mad in michigan. We're not going to stop. 
>> You can watch ed schultz every weeknight at 8:00 p.M. Right here on msnbc. 
>>> Let's get a check of the weather with nbc meteorologist bill karins. Men often times need help when looking for christmas gifts. Batman snuggie? Just a suggestion. 

[00:08:21]


>> You'd like to see in a batman snuggie. 
>> Yes, take a picture of that. 
>>> We're deal, a storm system in the southwest. It's actually poured overnight in areas that don't get a lot of rain, yuma, arizona, phoenix, arizona. This is the storm system moving across the country over the upcoming weekend. It won't affect you this morning or this afternoon. But eventually this storm will bring rain and gloomy weather to new england come sunday. Right now, though, it's a beautiful picturesque morning, everywhere east of the rockies, high pressure is in control. It's not all that cold out there. Temperatures have warmed up in the midwest. Temperatures should be nice, a beautiful afternoon in so many spots. Really the only spots that are cold. By their standards, it isn't that chilly. New england, some spots in the 20s, TOO.

. 
>> Welcome to a special edition of "first." 
>> We have a special presentation on the life and times of john dickinson, his place in delaware history, and the events leading up to the constitution. 
>> We're going to visit the plantation that is a good example of the lifestyle of that era. 
>> That is all ahead on "first." Captioned by the national captioning institute 
--www.Ncicap.Org-- 
>> this week, we have a special presentation by our video partner in dealing with one of the cornerstones of delaware history, john dickinson. The john dickinson home is where it has been for over 200 years, just south of what is now dover air force base. It is one of delaware's most historic tourist attractions and tells the dickinson story. 
>> The house was built by his father. He was a merchant and farmer. He brought on here to live when he was 8 years old. This was his boyhood home. The house has a variety of antiques including pieces of belonged to the family. 
>> The dickinson story is complicated. That is our story this week. 
>> This is a re-enactment documentary produced by our video partner content delaware. 
>> ?????? 
>> the reason john dickinson is not a household name is only because he refused to sign the declaration of independence. He fulfilled a vitally important role. Had a vision for the country nobody else had yet, a unified people with a constitution that would be amendable so we would never need a revolution again. Dickinson has a message for us that is one of cohesion, unity, peace, civil discourse, not just about our institutions but also how we discourse with one another. These are lessons we can learn today. 

[00:02:40]


>> ?????? 
>> john dickinson was born in talbot county on the eastern shore on november 2, 1732. His father, samuel dickinson, was a wealthy landowner, lawyer, and judge. Samuel was in the third generation of a family of tobacco planters. With the help of slave labor, a prosperous business. Following the death of his first wife, samuel we married and had two sons. In 1740, he and his wife mary moved their family to kent county, delaware. It was here at the plantation that young john grew up. 
>> John dickinson's ancestors came over initially as indentured servants on his father's side. This is a testimony to what could be done in america. A man could come over with nothing having purchased his passage on credit, come over and then work that credit off, and then bought land of his own. Then his son, grandson, and great-grandson were able to accumulate more land and property until john dickinson was born. He inherited a large amount of land. He had multiple dwellings in philadelphia and delaware. 
>> ?????? ?????? 
>> during his boyhood years, he formed a strong attachment to the fields and marshes of the family farm known as home place. In this serene setting, he received early training fr his father. At the proper age, a formal tudor made visits to provide him with the kind of classical education that would serve as a great resource to him in later years. Like other young men of his social standing, he was sent abroad to study law. He sailed to england in 1753. Possessed of a conservative temperament and refined tastes, john use this experience to develop social connections that will last throughout his lifetime. 

[00:05:10]


>> ?????? 
>> dickinson's time in law school was important in a lot of ways. He spent his time over there and entered into the delaware assembly. He started out as just a member of the assembly. Within three months, he had become speaker of the assembly. A very quick rise. At the same time, he began to establish a law practice in philadelphia and made a name for himself kly in philadelphia as a brilliant orator and able barrister. Soon after that, he entered into the pennsylvania assembly and immediately rose to be one of the leaders in it. 
>> It was in philadelphia he met and married mary. Was a quaker. Her father was the speaker of the pennsylvania assembly. His marriage along with the property in pennsylvania at she brought to the union enabled him to strengthen his social and political ties in philadelphia. In 1764, dickinson opposed benjamin franklin and joseph callaway in their attempts to make pennsylvania a royal colony. t+WHILE HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF A Loyal subject of the crown, dickinson was becoming concerned with the british trade and taxation policies. Soon after dickinson advocated for independent trade for the colonies in a pamphlet. The passage of the stamp act ignited the first sparks of the coming revolution as citizens took to the streets to protest taxation without representation. The stamp act to congress convened in formal opposition to the new tax. Dickinson was chosen to draft the declaration of rights and results -- resolves to be sent to the king of england. 

[00:07:26]


>> One of his major contributions was not necessarily with these resolutions, but he began writing pamphlets about how americans should resist the british. In other parts of the colonies, people were getting restless and becoming violent. He was writing to promote a way of resistance that was originated by the quakers. That was civil disobedience. If you do that, there is little the government can do against you. They will not come after you with guns. They will have to change the laws. It was probably a mixture of the civil disobedience along with the violence coming out of boston. The stamp act was repealed. This was a huge moment where americans had one -- won their point without very much bloodshed. 
>> ?????? 
>> shortly after that, the british decided they would pass another act or a series of talks. It was the towns and act. When twere passed, dickinson was immediately alarmed that nobody seemed to care. Americans have been very upset about the stamp act. They seemed completely complacent about the townshend acts. This prompted him to write his most famous piece called "letters from a farmer in pennsylvania." 
>> ?????? 
>> I will not tell the gentleman the meaning of these letters, to convince the people of these colonies that they are at this moment exposed to the most imminent dangers and to persuade them immediately and unanimously to exert themselves in the most firm but peaceable manner for obtaining relief. The cause of liberty is the cause of too much dignity to be sold -- sullied by turbulence and tumult. They should have an animated spirit to action,. Re-, and magnanimity -- action, bravery, and magnanimity. 

[00:09:47]


>> ?????? 
>> they were probably the main reason he is called the penman of the revolution. This is an apt title in some ways. It is true dickinson wrote more for the americacause than any other single founder, but everything he rode -- wrote, he wrote to prevent revolution. 
>> ?????? ?????? [patriotic music] ?????? 
>> at this time, america was rt of britain. There was no nation or sense of naal identity at. The farmers letters where a huge moment in his car and american history. They got americans for the first time united against britain and standing up for their rights as a country for the first time. The people were united. It also started pushing them towards revolution. It was a turning point. 
>> ?????? 
>> another thing he did at almost exactly the same time in 1768 was he published where we considered to be america's first number one hit single. He broke this -- wrote this to a british tune. It was a song in every tavern across the colony's -- colonies. He was america's first political hero with this. 
>> ?????? Brave and free ?????? 

[00:11:47]


>> ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? 
>> he was an american hero. By the time of the first continental congress in the fall of 1774, dickinson wielded more power and influence in america than probably any other single figure. He always counseled diplomacy. I think a key turning point for dickinson and his reputation was in july of 1775. He wrote two crucial documents that seem like they contradict each other. He wrote the olive branch petition. This was a near final effort to appeal to the crown to say we are your subjects, please, we want this to work out. The very next day, congress issued a declaration on taking up arms. Two draft were written. One by thomas jefferson and one by john dickinson. The one they published was aggressive, threatening, and basically said, bring it on. We are ready. We will fight you. Most people have assumed thomas jefferson wrote that draft and dickinson wrote the one that was soft and timid. It was exactly the opposite. Dickinson wrote the angry, fiery, threatening one. His intent was to produce such apprehension in the british that they would not dare come over and try it. He really wanted to avert war anyway he could. 

[00:13:59]


>> ?????? 
[military sounds] 
>> the battles in april of 1775 ended john dickinson's cokes for a peaceful solution. As the smoke cleared, the colonies began their steady march toward independence. 
>> ?????? ?????? ?????? 
>> when we get into the spring of 1776, the only thing stopping the congress from declaring independence is pennsylvania. Dickinson was the one writing the instructions to the delegates. In his instructions, he always said, you are not to do anything but a vote for reconciliation. Not revolution, not separation, nothing like that. It all came down to john dickinson as to whether the country would unite and declare independence. John adams suggested the colony's resisting independence, their governments of to be replaced. It ought to be replaced. He brought about the coup of the pennsylvania assembly. John dickinson saw where things were going. He wrote the instructions on how they could vote about independence. He did not tell them to vote for independence. He told them to vote their consciences. 
>> Dickinson new that independence was inevitable, but he refused to compromise his principles. He publicly declared, "i know that the tide of passions and prejudices of the people at large is strongly in favor of indepeence. I know I have acquired a character and some popularity with them, both of which are show risk by opposing this favorite measure. But I have rather risk both then speak or vote contrary to the dictates of my conscience. In the vote for independence, john dickinson abstained. 

[00:16:31]


>> John dickinson abstained because he did not want this to be anything but unanimous declaration. He believed it was his duty to listen to his countrymen. If they decided something against his opinion, he ought to abstain, not obstructed, and support it the best he could. Dickinson had a lot to lose from independence. He said that does not matter. We can lose our houses. We can lose all of the hair on our heads. It will grow back. What we cannot lose are our rights. We have to fight for those. Within a day or two of not signing the declaration of independence, he took up arms and chased the british in new jersey. 
>> ?????? ?????? ?????? 
>> he was the one who founded the first battalion of philadelphia. Then he resigned his commission in that because the british were coming towards philadelphia. He had to get his family out. Then he joined the delaware militia as a private. He enlisted, which did not happen. Gentlemen did not enlist as private. Then he was promoted to brigadier general with in the delaware militia. He served in three capacities. Only a fraction of congressman 
-- congressmen actually joined the military. 
>> ?????? ?????? 
>> he wrote the original version of the articles of confederation, but they were not implemented the way he wanted them. There was a time when we had no constitution. During this time, dickinson and quakers were persecuted in philadelphia. Because he resisted the declaration and resigned his commission to protect his family, he had 10,000 pounds of his property stolen. He had charges levied against him. He was slandered and libeled. Tories were looting his plantation. While this was happening, the british were burning his house in philadelp because they believed as john adams said that he was the ruler of america. He got it from both sides. 

[00:19:16]


>> Dickinson held fast to his convictions and fell into great disfavor. For a short time, he and his family sought the serenity of his delaware plantation. At home place where the slaves had first been inherited from his father signal, slave labor had been used by the tenants and the dickinson family to do agricultural work and maintain the property. Although the consent's -- dickinson's opponents to mistreatment, they were nonetheless human beings held in bondage. Some chose to run away. Others remained with the family throughout their lifetimes. In 1776, the quakers in philadelphia decreed holding human beings in bondage was an unacceptable practice and all quebecers should free their slaves. 
-- All quakers should free their slaves. Dickinson did that in 1777 when he unconditionally freed all who remained ninth -- nine years later. 
>> Know I do hereby set free and discharge from all further servitude these black man men. 
-- Discharge from all further service to these black men. 
>> ?????? ?????? 
>> it is military service made him popular with the people of delaware who returned him to his political career by executive -- by electing him to the executive council in 1781 and then the council of delaware that same the year -- that same year. In 1787, he attended as a delegate from delaware and ably defended the interests of his home state when the larger states tried to gain power by proposing representation based solely on population, dickinson told james madison at delaware would sooner submit to a foreign rather than be deprived in both branches of inequity of suffrage and the throne under the dominion of larger states. 

[00:21:27]


-- The throne under the dominion of larger states. He fully supported and signed the constitution. He may have been the primary influence encouraging delaware to be the first to ratify this important document in 1787. Shortly after delaware's ratification, the revolutionary pen and wrote a series of letters that appeared in newspapers. They are credited with turning public support for adopting the constitution. 
-- With garnering public support for adopting the constitution. 
>> He was writing to the ordinary person. He thought it was important that everybody who was going to live in the country understand what was going on and should have a say in what was going on. He wrote to the ordinary americans. He wrote in language they could understand. It was a series of letters that george washington said were very well done. He did it anonymously. It took people a long time to figure out it was dickinson who wrote them. Then he went more or less into retirement. 
>> ?????? ?????? ?????? 
>> dickinson was increasingly plagued by ill health. He built a home in wilmington, delaware's largest city, which afforded him access to philadelphia and his home place on the river. John dickinson died in 1808 and is buried in a humble grave at the quaker meeting in wilmington. On learning of his death, thomas jefferson wrote a more terror patriot could not have left us. His name will be consecrated in history as one of degrees where these -- great worthies of the revolution. 

[00:23:29]


>> ?????? 
>> the impact of john dickinson's ideas and scholarship is still being explored. Now fully restored, homeplace offers a living history and glimpse into the complex life of one of america's most significant founders, don dickinson. 
-- John dickinson. 
>> ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? 
>> we will have this video of for you to watch again. We will also have links to the dickinson plantation. Gloria henry explains what visitors will find. 
>> If you visit our plantation, we are a museum. We're open wednesday through saturday. We give guided tours through the house and grounds. We have various reproduction outbuildings to show. You can to them also. 
-- You can also tour them. But the dickinson plantation grounds are not far from the national wildlife refuge. A chance to seek the delaware history of man-made and natural. Here is mark with more. 
>> ?????? 
>> one thing john dickinson never had to think about was the idea of talking on a cell phone while driving. This is the editorial cartoon this month. This is what we call a transition in the business. The state, 1800 tickets handed out. What do you think about that? It is a lot. 

[00:25:50]


>> Some of my friends were caught by them. My thoughts have come full circle. When the states first started introducing the band' -- bans, I thought what is the difference between that and change in the radio -- changing the radio. But texting while driving is insanely dangerous. Any kind of attention they can bring to it, I am all for it, even if it is getting my friends who have -- nabbed by the cops. 
>> You realize you are not paying attention if you are looking to add a phone. 
>> One friend of mine was at a stoplight and pulled out the phone. The cop saw him. He was angry. I was like you are still in the act of driving. Anything could be happening. Get rid of it. The people tickets. I am all for it. 
>> We will transition a little bit. Let's talk about the cartoon about the grinch on ice. 
>> There is this work stoppage. Both sides are at a logjam in terms of what will happen. The nhl is standing out for a couple of specific things. What strikes me is they are so close. Eagles fans are suffering through a bad season. You have got to give the fans something. Come to an agreement. Let's get some hockey. That is my vote. 
>> We are happy the grinch did not steal your sense of humor. Check out his work and let him know about it.

So the responsibility falls to the first responders to those patrol officers and the sector cars and the foot beats. They have the training, and they have the weapons and the equipment they need to adequately respond to a situation like that and they are going to arrive and they are going to form up into teams. They're going to try to gather as much information as they can very quickly and they are going to move to the sound of gunfire. They'll move to the point of contact d they're going to neutralize the threat, and rescue and evacuation is going to wait until they've done that, because those officers are acutely aware that every second that passes by there's lives being lost. So they're going to waste no time in putting an end to the gunfire. 
>> I would imagine covering such a large area is difficult. I mean here you have a school with 700 lives, many small children. 
>>> Absolutely. So once they have neutralized the threat, they're going to win the evacuation process and they're going to create -- they are going to cordoned off thebuilding, they're going to make sure no one else gets into the building, and that's at the point when trained tactical teams will arrive and they will begin the very long and laborious process of going through every inch of that building from top to bottom and then they'll go back and they'll do it over again, and they're going to use explosive -- hazardous materials, experts are going to accompany swat along with to ensure that there is no other threat inside that building, and once we are one 10% sure of that, then we will turn it over to detectives to begin the investigation. 

[00:15:05]


>> So now, chief sullivan, what will take place? You had mentioned over the next couple of hours inside that school and before the investigation. 
>>> Well, I'm sure that they are in the process of doing just that, of doing that search. But now unfortunately they have an extremely large crime seen that's going to take probably days for them to process. 
>> And very quickly here, because you have been through similar situations. The emotional toll not only great for the children and staff but I would imagine it's very difficult for the first responders. 
>>> Well, it certainly is. I was on location at the craft shooting up on roosevelt boulevard and that very unusual and that was one of the few activehooters in which the perpetrator was a female, but it was great emotional toll on the officers from the seventh and eighth districts that responded to the initial scene, and did exactly what they were supposed to do. Today -- what they were supposed to do as I described it today. So that's very true. But it's also emotional toll for the students in this case our active shooters in the workplace for other employees. So that's -- the other part of the process that the government in conjunction with the school board has to now look to the needs of the other students and their families. 
>> Once again chief inspector joeullivan. Philadelphia mayor michael nutter responded to the school shooting say he and other officials are reviewing their own school safety procedures. 
>> Whenever you have these kinds of situations, you certainly review all of your process and procedure but there's no reason to think certainly that just because that happened in newtown today that suddenly there might be something here in philadelphia. 
>> Mayor nutter says that lawmakers need to do the right thing to keep americans safe with residential gun laws. >>> Still to come, how to talk to your kids about the tragedy that unfolded today and why talking about it with other adul can help you explain the events to your children. 
>> She may be one the best on a team but it doesn't matter. "Fox 29"'s meg baker talked to a sixth grade school who is being banned from playing the sport she loves. Row. 

[00:17:14]


>> Reporter: Who says the girls can't play the same sport as boys. The catholic youth association told one girl she can't. 
>> There's a rule in cyo girls can't play. It's only for boys. 
>> Carolyn played football since she was five years old. After playing the last two seasons with the roman squad run by the cyo they say she can't suit up with the rest of her teammates next season. 
>> I felt I wasn't good enough. There was discrimination. It didn't feel good to feel you're not good enough to play with them. 
>> She was angry and upset and didn't understand the unfairness of it. 
>> Reporter: In a statement the cyo says the decision was based on a policy football is a full contact sport designated for boys. 
>> Our first approach is really a plea of common sense is the ru is old. It's archaic it's proven that girls can play sports. 
>> She has had great coaches. I think that is huge because they've taught her to tackle the right way, to block the right way and then that way if you do those things and you use the tools, you're not going to get hurt. 
>> Reporter: Her teammate and neighbor agrees. 
>> She is really good. She can kick my butt sometimes, and I can kick hers sometimes. 
>> Reporter: This selfless 11 year old isn't just fighting for her right to play. She wants other girls to have the same experience she had. 
>> I called them and thanked them and I asked them if she could change the rule so other girls can play. 
>> If you can tackle, if you can block, if you can run it has nothing to do with you're a girl or boy. Football the game figures it out. 
>> My favorite things was probable all the friends I made through it. They're owl my brothers w and that's the best part.

>> They weren't all safe. 
>> Slowly word came out. 
>> This is the worse thing we've experienced here in town. Tragic. 
>> Evil visited this community today. 
>> Reporter: Evil inside this school where precious little children and their teachers were massacred. Others forced into lock down. Many could you we aring in corners and closets at the sound of gunfire. 
>> Heard a lot more gunshots and the ambulance came but then the policemen told to us run out of the building and go to the fire department. 
>> Reporter: Police saying 20 year old adam lanza opened fire. He then turn the gun on himself. Adam's mother was a kindergarten teacher at the school. 
>> Once again that was fox's christine persichette reporting tonight the people of newtown connecticut are gathering at saint rose church mourning for the innocent children who lost their lives today. Our omari fleming joining us once again. Omari? 
>> Reporter: Thomas, there's so much sadness here at saint rose church. There was a vigil held just a little bit earlier. Let's take a listen to some of the sights and sounds that were going on earlier. ???????????? Sleep in heaven piece ???????????? 
>> as you can see right there mariners sang songs and candle burned bright out saint rose as the newtown community grieved the death of 20 children and six faculty members killed at sandy hook elementary school. The pain of the massacre running deep win this small knit community. Pastor says at least six to seven of those victims attended church here at saint rose and we talked to one young lady who knew one of the kindergartners killed. 
>> It is such a small community and for this to happen now is just -- at any point in time is just horrick. There are no words for the tragedy that struck today. 
>> I don't have to know them. And I'm still here for them. I have children. I couldn't fathom that. My heart go out to the families truly to all of them. God bless them. 

[00:33:21]


>> Reporter: And that is the general consensus here in this community as you see very tight knit. People who don't know these victims have come to share their sorrow. They're their love and prayers as well. The doors here at saint rose church remaining open tonight to help counsel people. The pastor saying that the shooting suspect adam lanza actually attended middle school here at saint rose but he was only here for a brief time. 
>>> Reporting live in newtown, connecticut, omari fleming "fox 29 news". 
>> So hard to wrap your head around, omar reach he'll be in connect we can't over the weekend bringing updates throughout the weekend as well. It is hard enough as adults to try to make sense of a senseless tragedy. How do you explain it to your kids. 
>> During the "fox 29" news at 5:00 we asked dr. Argie allen the when dealing with children how do you even begin to process a tragedy like this? 
>>> We're all sort of trying to figure out how to process it, but we know that the healing begins when you start talking. And when you start processing and I always say in order to heal you have to feel. So for any parents that are dealing with watching this or dealing with it first hand, they're going to have to find a way to have the conversations with their children. 
>> What do you say to even start a conversation like this? 
>>> Well, you know, start with open ended questions. 
>> Do you let them watch it? 
>>> No. I would be very careful about letting them watch it especially if they hadn't experienced or even if they had experienced it by vicarious trauma can go on and on. 
>> The younger ones see continue bug coverage they think it's still happening. Right, right. I would sit down with their friends and say let's talk about what happened to you, and then begin to ask open ended questions. Children want to talk about what's going on inside of them. So the goal here for us to stop talking so much, and then ask them how they're feeling. Quite frankly a lot of the children are going to want to protect their parents. They're going to want to not have their parents feel so bad and so the parents have to let the children know they're the parents, it's their job to take care of the kids and that everything -- they'll be in charge of protecting them at least for now. 
>> Do you talk to different ages in different ways? I mean can you talk to, say, a middle schooler that way but when you're talking to a kindergartner which these children who experienced this are that age, how do you do it a little bit differently? 

[00:35:34]


>>> Use language that the children can understand. You also use aids so I would also if you have a third party, great n would be wonder put but if you don't, get some drawing paper and some crayons and have them begin to draw pictures about what happened, because that's going to get them talking about it. Almost like show and tell but a little bit more serious than that. 
>> Do you talk to them about it if they don't know what's going on? Do you bring it up out of the blue? 
>>> Well, you know, if they're to the clear like they weren't in that area, then you might not but quite frankly, a lot of children are watching the news, and we do want our children to be aware of the dangers that are out there. So we would want to have a conversation at some point and say, listen, there's some really bad people out there that do really bad things. 
>> Black and white straight forward. 
>>> Yeah. 
>> Do you enco mourn? 
>>> Oh absolutely. Absolutely. 
>> Even if they're not directly involved because -- 
>>> absolutely. 
>> We become so cold sometimes as a society but to teach them how to mourn. We have to mourn. That's the part that we've been given as a grieving process. If it doesn't happen on the front end it will happen on the back end. So it's really, really important we grieve which means that we'll experience different emotions like anger, like rage, like misunderstanding or confusion, all of that stuff comes up and we've got to talk about it. 
>> Not an easy conversation to have but one that we need to. 
>>> Yeah. Let's talk about it ourselves as adults, too. So we can help them. 
>> Once again dr. Argie allen from drexel university. Our coverage of the tragedy in newtown connecticut continues on our website. From photos, video and the newest information, it's all on myfoxphilly.Com right there on the home page. 
>> Next on fox, what cancer survivors are doing to feel more like themselves again.

>> Reporter: Dr. Mc graph gave them their look back. All part of a program called operation restore. And to derek christie and many cancer patients that's almost as important.

>> The rest never grew back and every day she looked at the mirror she struggled with what she saw. 
>> The time when I really felt like a cancer patient was when all my hair was gone and it was like a daily reminder like, oh, that's what I look like. Don't look in the mirror. 
>> She had a few hats, scarves and wigs but that wasn't how she wanted live to be forever.

>> After running down the hall and bashing at linda's friends she finally found her passed out in the bathroom. They quickly called 911 and linda is now doing just fine. Dogs are gr]at. They really are, scott. 
>> You know if you're walking the dog this weekend, saturday will probably be the best day to do it, because we'll have dry weather. Sunday a different story. Ultimate doppler scanning clear around the heart of the delaware on this friday evening, but take a look towards sections of the midwest and the plains. This is the rainfall that will head our way by sunday. Really changing things around our area. Let's talk about those weather headlines. Dry chilly and quiet for your friday night. It will be another cold one. A nice saturday on tap. We'll see a mixture of sun and clouds. No weather worries tomorrow. Just a few more clouds as we progress throughout the afternoon. Then the unsettled pattern begins on sunday with that wet weather. It was a start this morning. 30 degrees was the low. The afternoon high we made it into the low 50s so 6 degrees above the normal for this time of year which is 45. It's already 28 degrees in millville. We have 34 at the atlantic city airport. 38 in philadelphia as well as dover. And allentown, good evening checking in at 30 degrees. So the forecast for tonight mainly clear. However, I am watching some high clouds already on the increase throughout the overnight hours. 34 degrees in philadelphia for the low. North and west easily dipping into the 20s. So tomorrow we'll see some sunshine. It will kind of be a milky sky out there as we watch those high clouds streaming overhead in advance of that next system. Temperatures topping out in the upper 40s for tomorrow. Now, moving ahead to sunday, clouds will continue to thicken. We'll watch a little waves of energy so that means unsettled wet weather during the day on sunday. Even the first part of sunday could start off as a wintry mix towards sections of the poconos. Temperatures will top out in the low 50s for sunday. So that unsettled pattern does begin for the second part of the weekend. As we go hour by hour during the day tomorrow, once again, we'll find milky skies out there with those high clouds advancing and then some thicker clouds as we move toward tomorrow evening. By sunday morning, take a look at the pink here. That's indicative of a little bit of frozen precipitation toward the poconos. The green indicating the rainfall. So on and off again light showers during the day on sunday so sunday looks to be the wetter of the two weekend days. That stormy pattern continues into next week. So late sunday into early morning that's our first wave of energy. As we move into monday evening and tuesday morning, that's the second wave of energy. Earlier in the week, we were looking at a midweek potential nor'easter but it looks like it will develop well to our north. We'll still see windy conditions and chilly conditions by wednesday. So recapping things tomorrow, the better of the two weekend days as far as the dry weather, milky skies, temperatures top out in the upper 40s. And then as we move into sunday, monday and tuesday a little unsettled but temperatures above average in the 50s. 

[00:52:31]


>> Milky skies much that is a good thing, right? 
>> Sounds delicious.

We will get through it but this is a terrible time for this community and for these families our police personnel and others are doing the utmost to clear this situation as soon as possible, to return these children to their parents or these loved ones to their fellow loved ones as quickly as possible. And we'll work with all of the residents of this community and connecticut to make sure that we do in fact get through this. I was mayor of stanford on 9/11 when our state lost many of its citizens and I lost a number of my fellow citizens and friends. I never thought that in a public career that I would have to face these kinds of circumstances or that they would visit themselves upon this community or the people of connecticut. We'll get through this and our prayers at this time have to go out to the families and so as i began by thanking those who have expressed their desires to be helpful, number one, the way to be helpful is to say a prayer or send a best wish or to be thinking of these individuals who have suffered so might tilley today. Thank you.

>> Thomas, fox news and the associated press are both naming the shooter as 20 year old adam lanza. The connecticut state police have not provided an id as of yet, but in part, fueled by the interests of social media and news gathering it has certainly been a day of confusion. Adam lanza is 20 years old and lived in sandy hook connecticut. His mother is 52 year old nancy lanza a teacher at the school. Nancy lanza and her son adam the suspected shooter are both believed dead. Adam's remains in the school. Earlier in the day his 24 year old brother ryan was named as the shooter by a number of national news organizations. He lives in hoboken, new jersey san college graduate much he's been cleared.

>> The shooter was reportedly armed with two hand guns, we're hearing he committed suicide and then another person was found dead at a second scene. Away from the school. Students who survived the massacre describe exactly what they experienced. Fox's christine persichette live in newtown with more. Have you heard from any of of those kids? 
>> Reporter: We haven't heard from the kids themselves. When we got here we weren't allowed to get close to the school. We are in a park nearby, and where all the police are updating us and the governor. But when we did get into newtown connecticut we stopped at a local diner. And ske with people there, and I got to tell you people are just traumatized by this. Guy at the diner the manager there just said, you know, everybody is in disbelief. He said the name lanza at that point, you know, everybody said was it ripe or adam lanza? Who was the shooter? He knew the name. He sai those kids have been in his diner. They all seemed like normal kids. So it's just shocking when you live in such a small town to hear like something like this had happened it's actually 20 children were shot and killed. 20 children. Many of them in kindergarten so it's just awful here. 
>> I understand christine that troopers have been assigned to each of the families involved? 
>> Reporter: Yes, that's what we're being told. A lot of the families were coming to the school. They set up a place where they can go at a local firehouse, and the families were coming. Many of them being reunited with their children. Unfortunately, many of them have not been because their children were victims in this case and the troopers have set up somebody to be one trooper per family just so they can get the right communication and let them know what's going on. 
>> You know there's been a lot of conflicting information as the story unfolded starting at 9:30 this morning. We had several different names of who the shooter might be. How many children were dea. The numbers continue to grow. As far as the second crime scene, that seems to be the one area we're still not getting a lot of information. Especially. Do we know anything about. Was that crime scene, did that involve the shooter's mom do we know? 

[00:17:05]


>> Reporter: What we're hearing is that it's a house in newtown connecticut. And the house may be owned by the shooter's parents. Whether it's his mother or his father in the house, that's still not clear. The police aren't giving those details out. But as you know the mother was a kindergarten teacher in that school and apparently they said that the shooting was contained to a small section of the school and onef those classrooms was the mother's classroom. So she is presumed dead. We're not sure if she's in the school or at a home. Christine persichette live for us tonight in connecticut. Thank you for keeping us updated. 
>> Reporter: Thank you. 
>> Again, of course, we will continue to post updates on this story on our website. It's myfoxphilly.Com. You can keep checking there between now and "fox 29 news" at 10:00. ???????????? 
>> let's focus in on a little bit of weather. Dry and quiet for now around the heart of the delaware valley. Off to the planes this is the moisture that will move in for a part of the upcoming weekend. Let's spell it out for you with the weather headlines. Dry, chilly for tonight and of course we are talking about those temperatures dropping once again to around freezing in many locations. It was 30 this morning. The afternoon high made it up to 51 degrees. So above average temperatures. Mid 40s right now in philadelphia. It's in the 30s toward allentown , pottstown as well as the poconos. Chilly 34 degrees already in millville. The forecast for tonight, we're looking at temperatures in the city right around 34 degrees. But the outlying colder suburbs temperatures will drop into the 20s. So another clear and cold night. For your saturday, the better of the two weekend days. We'll see some sunshine. It will be filtered sunshine through those high clouds. Thicker clouds will increase late in the day tomorrow. Spelling rainfall as sta on sunday and some of that on sunday north and west could be in the form of a little bit of freezing rain. So hour by hour saturday more clouds increasing from the west. By 11:00 o'clock tomorrow night, we'll be socked in with some thick clouds around the region but look at the clock here. Sunday morning at 6:00 a.M. That pink toward the lehigh valley and the poconos in the form of a little bit of frozen precipitation. Then we'll continuo find that rainfall throughout the day on your sunday. So the bottom line, an unsettled pattern here. The first wave comes into play late sunday into early monday. Then another wave monday late into tuesday morning. That system will intensify by the middle of the week but away from us. So right now that nor'easter scenario will be well away from the philadelphia area. But we will find some of those chilly conditions and windy conditions as we move into the middle part of the week. But it should be dry. Let's recap things for the upcoming weekend. Saturday the better of the two days. Temperatures top out in the upper 40s. There will be a mixture of sun and clouds. If you have outdoor events tomorrow the better of the two days to do that. As we move into your sunday, that's when we get the clouds, the rainfall around. Temperatures in the 50s though through tuesday. So above average, but then turning seasonable as we move into the middle and lat part of next week. Kerry and thomas.

Time. 
>> I'll take you right here. 
>> Do you have anyone who's in the hospital now that survived. 
>> No, sir. One persothat was injured that suffered an injury and did survive, yes. 
>> Can you confirm the body in the house is a mail or -- 
>>> I'm sorry I can't confirm. I know about the secondary scene. I didn't have time to get into detail about that. I'll try to do that for 6:00 o'clock. 
>> What's the shooter identity? Adam lanza, can you confirm. 
>>> I'm not going to confirm the identity of the shooter. We have a tentative identification. We're still working with that we won't confirm the identity and put that out there. We will -- we will identify the shooter at an appropriate time just for our investigatory purposes it's not appropriate to do that right now. 
>> What's happening in hoboken, new jersey, concerning the investigation there. 
>>> Again, it's part and parcel of what we do. I told you initially that we will leave no stone unturned as we're looking at every facet of this investigation. Whether it's the shooter, the victims. We'll look at everything. And we certainly will go in and out of state and work with fellow law enforcement including federal agents if we need to to answer every single question to exactly what transpired here. And we will -- it will be time consuming process. We'll get it done. 
>>> Right now one shooter, yes, sir. 
>> How old are the kids... 
>> It was k threw four. Kindergarten through fourth grade. That's the school. 
(Question from audience). 
>> They were all students of that school. 
>>> I don't know the grade they were in. I'm sorry. I don't know that. 
>> One section, two classrooms. 
>> All kindergarten -- 
>>> I couldn't tell you. I don't know. I didn't find that out. I'm sorry. 
>> Your question? 
(Question from reporter). 
>> Everyone -- that's part of -- that's part of the process and that's why it took us long to get here and that's a very good question. Are there any students unaccounted for? We to ensure we accounted for every single student in that school and that includes maybe someone that was absent for the day because of illness didn't come to school. So that was part of the process that we had to go through and now we have the identification process which is even more difficult. Maybe sometime before we're able to give you that information and probably won't be available until sometime tomorrow. 

[00:02:19]


>> Can you record identify the weapon. 
>>> Did we identify a we were. We have seized weapons y, we have, sir. 
>> What kind of weapons. 
>>> We will not discuss that at this time, sir. 
>>> We've been in contact with all the parents. We no come up here until we've been in contact with all the parents and communicating with them since they arrived here at the scene. They've been fully informed and that's why it took -- why it took so long for us to come up here. 
(Question from the reporter). 
>> That's very, very -- that's a good question. Everyone believes that, you know, it's something that first responders do that law enforcement does but I can tell you we provided counseling for the first responders because this was a very tragic, horrific scene that they encountered. It's not something that we want to see. It's not something we see every day. So that was one -- that's one thing that we have done and the colonel has made that perfectly clear that those people are to be spoken to and receive crisis counseling as required. 
>> (Question from reporter). 
>>> The lieutenant can certainly tell you he's a newtown officer. 
>> Sure. 
(Question from reporter). 
>>> As a person the first thing I thought about was my only children. 
>> Can you say your name, please? 
>>> Lieutenant george sinko. 
>> What's your name, pleases. 
>>> Lieutenant george is that sinko. 
>> Can you tell us the rest of newtown and also... 
(Question from reporter). 
>> This is most definitely the worst thing that we've had experienced here in town. Tragic. Right now, we're concerned about the families of the victims. Our officers are professional and we will deal with this as well. 

[00:04:23]


>> Can you describe the scene, are people getting together and are there counselors for them, what's happening. 
>>> Danbury hospital has offered their crisis intervention counselors. They'll be available at reid inter immediate school which is on wasserman way and they're available right now if need be and they will there be all weekend. 
>> Is there a place where parents are gathering? And what's that scene? Describe that for us. 
>>> The parents certainly have gathered at the local firehouse which is adjacent to the school and we've done our best to coufort them and try to reassure them we've done everything we can. But as mentioned. It's a difficult process to confirm the status of an entire elementary school, and we need to be right when we do that. 
>> Lieutenant -- 
(question from reporter). 
>> The guest is on going. 
>> Are there parents at the firehouse. 
>> There are still parents there, yes. 
>> How many? 
>>> I don't have a number for you. I don't have a number for you. 
>> When did you realize -- how long did it take for to you realize -- 
>>> minutes after our officers were there they realized, you know, what a horrific scene we had there. 
(Question from reporter). 
>>> I don't have the exact timeline on that. Certainly officers responded immediately and as soon as they realized what they had we obviously asked for all the resources we could get. All right? Thank you. 
>> I think we're good. 
>> Thank you. 

[00:06:23]


>> What we'll do we'll come back about just before 6:00 o'clock because I know a lot you around six we'll get back to you with one more briefing. We'll schedule briefings probably tomorrow. So some of you folks look very tired. I'm sure you want to get some rest. We're going to see if we can give you a schedule of briefings for tomorrow. Okay? 
>> We're -- where are you? 
>> You were listening to lieutenant paul wants with the connecticut state police. Tragedy at sandy hook elementary in newtown, connecticut. That is about 60 miles northeast of new york city. 27 people have died including 20 children. We are following the latest developments right now on the "fox 29 news" at 5:00. 
>> The situation, of course, as we've been talking about is just about unfathomable. Parents, students, teachers, everybody just in a state of disbelief this morning from the very beginning as well. The information about who the shooter is has continuously changed. 
>> Has we mentioned sandy hook elementary ask in newtown. That is about 60 miles northeast of new york city. We want to go to fox's rick leventhal who has the details from newtown tonight. 
>> Reporter: A tragedy beyond comprehension. A gunman unloads a barrage of bullets inside sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. 
>> There were several fatality ies at the scene. Both students and staff. 
>> Reporter: Police arrived moments after the 911 call was made just after 9:30 in the morning. Followed by emergency crews and dozens of state police, swat teams and federal agents. 
>> Our main objective was to evacuate as quickly and efficiently as possible any and all students and faculty in the school. 
>> Reporter: Teachers and students filed out of the building holding hands, many in tears. The local superintendent put all schools on lock down shortly after the attack. Frantic parents rushing to the site were redirect to do a they are by firehouse serving as a staging area. 
>> I was really kind ofayhem in the room with all of the kids trying to find your kid. Making sure they're safe and then trying to find out what the situation was, make sure everybody else was safe. 

[00:08:29]


>> Officials confirm the shooter was found dead inside the school. An end tear kindergarten class is said to be unaccounted for. 
>> The scene is secure. State police may your crime squad, newtown police department, danbury state attorney and many agencies are working together to answer all the questions surrounding exactly what happened. 
>> Reporter: The area around the school has been sealed off while police process the crime scene and begin recovering the bodies while two other crime scenes are apparently being processed. One in hoboken new jersey where the suspect lived. The other here in newtown where the suspect's mother lived where another body has reportedly been found. In newtown, connecticut, rick leventhal, fox news. 
>> Meanwhile, it is a chilling sight in the parking lot outside of the newtown elementary sl today. You can see swat members armed with heavy artillery. Skyfox live overthe scene as those teams went in this morning. These were some of the first law enforcement officials that were inside that school. One student told news crews that she could hear the gunshots during her gym class. 
>>> We were just in the middle of gym when we heard some gunshots, and then the power went out and the gym teacher directed us to stay against the wall and everybody started kind of panicking. 
>> Teachers did so much right in the situation. Very emotional president obama addressing the country this afternoon. He was wiping tears from his eyes and offering his condolence s to everybody affected by today's tragedy. 
>>> I know there's not a parent in america who didn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between between the ages of five and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. Our hearts are broken today. There have been multiple conflicting reports all day long about who exactly the gunman is. Fox news has named the shooter as adam lanza earlier his brother was named. Jeff cole trying to sort this all out. Jeff is joke us from the newsroom tonight. What do we know. 

[00:11:08]


>> Reporter: This has been chaos I think throughout the media and throughout social media as well. It's to who the shooter is. Now, as you've just said, fox news and the associated press have named 20 year old adam lanza as the shooter in this case. State police, lieutenant paul vance as you've seen during the briefing here they have not named a shooter. But the ap says it is adam lanza here's why this is important and significant. Earlier in the day news organizations across this country not "fox 29" here but others named ryan j. Lanza the 24 year old brother of adam lanza as the shooter. In fact, his face which was on facebook a posting on facebook was put up on some news organizations but it appears that ryan j. Lanza is not in fact the shooter. That it's his younger brother adam lanza at least according to the ap and fox news. Both boys, both men's mother is nancy j. Lanza. She in fact was a teacher at the school and the reporting is she in fact may be dead a second seen here. But what's happened here is there's been confusion 32 throughout the day. At first law enforcement may have transposed the names at least when they talk to the press or maybe someone in the press missed it but there is there's an adam lanza and ryan j. Land s they're both brothers. They're both from that area. Ryan j. Is a graduate of quinney poe yack university. He apparently lives in hoe coke ben, new jersey. He is in custody now. He's certainly not charged with anything. But law enforcement is talking to him but at this point at least according to fox news and the ap, adam lanza, 20 years old, sandy hook, connecticut, is the believed shooter in this case. 
>> Thomas. 
>> All right. Jeff cole, stay on top of it. Bring us any updates as you get them. 
>> Law enforces are telling the ap is suspect in in custody for questioning. As you heard early reports were that this person was the suspect's brother. Witnesses say they saw police apprehend a man right by the school. 
>>> I was standing here. I just saw a guy in the front seat there they walk out of the woods and they walked him from the woods and said he didn't do it. That's what he said. As he walked by and look at us. So that's all that. Put him in the front seat of the car and that's it. 

[00:13:21]


>> Did they take him out of here 
>>> no. 
>> This investigation is still very early in its stages. Connecticut state police will be on the seen at this school all night long. The state's governor is calling the act unimageable. 
>>> Lieutenant governor and i have been spoken to and in an attempt that we might be prepared for something like this playing itself out in our state. You can never be prepared for this kind of incident. What has happened, what has transpired at that school building will leave a mark on this community and every family impacted. 
>> Again, there's a lot of information and it is still coming into the newsroom. Here's what we know for sure at this point. Right around 9:30 this morning, a gunman walked into a connecticut elementary school, that school's name sandy hook. That gunman opened fire and at this point we know that 27 people are dead. That includes 20 children, 18 died at the school. Two at the hospital. Six adults are dead. As well as the shooter. 
>> Right now "fox 29"'s omari fleming is on his way to newtown, connecticut. He will have a live report tonight on the "fox 29" news at 10:00 and throughout the weekend still ahead, what are swat teams looking for as they first go into a situation like this? Coming up we're talking to the man who trains local crews for insight. We'll also have another live report from the scene. Scott? 
>> Thomas, coming up the whether authority is tracking dry and quiet conditions for your friday evening. It will be a little chilly but i am tracking some big changes for the upcoming weekend that you need to know about. 
>> Scott. As we take a quick break here, we wanting to life to the white house where a candlelight vigil is underway to remember the lives lost in connecticut. Stay with us. We're coming right back. ???????????? 

[00:17:58]


>> we are continuing you to update you on a story that has shocked and touched all of us. A gunman opening fire in a suburban elementary school this morning. The alleged gunman dead as well. 20 of the victims were children at that school. Families in tiny newtown connecticut left trying to make sense of what's happened. 
>> My whole life was my sister was replaying through my head and I was saying to myself, I'm sorry for whatever I did to you, and it was -- it was very, very traumatizing. I was very shaken. 
>> This gruesome attack appears to be the nation's deadliest school shooting in history. Only the attack in virginia tech in 2007 is thought to be worse. Sadly this tragedy could happen anywhere. I want to bring chief inspector joe sullivan head of philadelphia police department's counter terrorism unit. 
>>> Thanks for being with uh-uh hope and pray something like this will never happen but the reality is you guys have to train for the worst. What happens when you first get a call of an active shooter. 
>>> When that call comes in, all available units are dispatched to the scene, and here in philadelphia police department, we have trained our patrol force in how to respond to emergency of this nature, because the fact is, when we have an active shooter scenario, it's genuinely going to be over win 10 minutes so the responsibility falls to the first responders to those patrol officers and in the sector cars and foot beats. They have the training and they have the weapons and the equipment they need to adequately respond to a situation like that and they are going to arrive and they are going to form up into teams, they're going to try to gather as much information as they can very quickly and they are going to move to the sound of gunfire. They'll move to the point of contact and they're going to neutralize the threat, and rescue and evacuation is going to wait until they've done that. Because those officers are acutely aware that as every second that passes by there's lives being lost so they're going to waist no time in putting an end to the gunfire. 
>> Highly train. I would imagine though covering such a large area is difficult. I mean here you have a school with 700 lives, many small children. 

[00:20:06]


>>> Absolutely. So once they have neutralized the threat, you know they're going to begin the evacuation process. They're going to create -- they are going to cordoned off the building. They're going to make sure no one else gets into the building, and at that -- that's at the point when trained tactical teams will arrive and they will begin the very long and laborious process of going through every inch of that building from top to bottom and then they'll go back and they'll do it over again. They're going to use explosive hazardous materials, experts are going to accompany swat along with k9 to ensure that there is no other threat inside that building, and once we are one 10% sure of that then we'll turn it over to detectives to begin the investigation. 
>> So now, chief sullivan, what will take place? You had mentioned this over the next couple of hours and side that school and for the investigation 
>>> well, I'm sure that they are in the process of doing just that. Of doing that search. But now unfortunately they have an extremely large crime scene. That's going to take probably days for them to process. 
>> Very quickly here, because you have have been through similar situations. The emotional toll not only great for the children and staff but I would imagine it's very difficult for the first responders. 
>>> Well, it certainly is. I was on locate at the craft shooting up on roosevelt boulevard. That was very unusual and one of the few active shooters the perpetrator was a female, but it was great emotional toll on the officers from the seventh and eighth district that is responded to the initial scene and did exactly what they were supposed to do. Today -- what they were supposed to do as I described it today. So that's very true. But it's also emotional toll for the students in this case, our active shooter is in workplace for other employees. So that's,, the other part of the process that the government in conjunction with the school board has to now look to the needs of the other students and their families. 

[00:22:08]


>> Really is heartbreaking. Chief inspector joe sullivan head of the philadelphia police department's counter terrorism unit, certainly appreciate your time tonight. 
>>> Thank you. 
>> Chief, thank you still ahead how do you help your children even understand a tragedy like this? We're talking to an expert about what you can do. That's coming up.

We went to diner when we got up here to newtown and it was just silent in there. You can tell everybody is just traumatized by what happened here. This newtown is 60 miles northeast of new york city. And about 9:30 this morning police received a 911 call that gun hasn't had opened fire at sandy hook elementary school. 27 people in all were shot and killed. 20 of them children. Now, just so you know this school is just kindergarten through fourth grade. We're told most of those children were in kindergarten. Now the gunman is being identified as 20 year old adam lanza. Also from this town. And he was also found dead in the school apparently a self inflicted gunshot wound. Now he has ties to this school because his mother was a kindergarten teacher there we're told she is also presumed dead. There are a lot of questions surroundinhis and police are still trying to gather all the details. We will be here tonight and try to give you the rest of them later on. Back to you guys.

[00:30:59]


>> The tiny town of newtown connecticut shattered this morning by the sound of gunfire. A single gunman entering an elementary school and opened fire and killing 26 people. 20 of the victims were children. We do know the gunman was found dead at the school as well. There was another perp also found dead at another location. 
>> This picture was posted on the newtown bees website this morning aft the very first reports of the shooting. It shows some of the students scared and confused. Lined up in the parking lot outside the school. I want to bring in argie allen the director of clinical training at drexel university. Thanks for being with us. 
>>> Good to be here. Not under these circumstances. 
>> My heart is still pounding just listening and hearing all of these details. When dealing with children, though, how do you begin to process a tragedy like this? 
>>> I mean it's hard. We're all sort of trying to figure out how to process it. But we know that the healing begins when you start talking and when you start processing and I always say in order to heal, you have to feel. So for any parents that are dealing with watching this or dealing with it first hand, they're going to have to find a way to have the conversations with their children. 
>> What do you say to even start a conversation like this? 
>>> Well, you know, start with open end questions. 
>> Do you let them watch it? 
>>> No, I would be very careful about letting them watch it especially if they hadn't experienced it or even if they had. Vicarious trauma can go on and on. 
>> They think it's still happening. 
>>> Right. They can get triggered over and over. I would sit down with their friends and say let's talk about what happened to you and then begin to ask open ended questions. Children want to talk about what's going on inside of them. So goal here for to us stop talking so much and then ask them how they're feeling. Quiet frankly a lot of the children are going to want to protect their parents. They're going to want not have their parents feel so bad. And so the parents have to let the children know they're the parents, it's their job to take care of the kids and everything is -- they'll be in charge of protecting them at least for now 
>> do you talk to different ages in different ways? I mean can you talk to say a middle schooler that way when you're talking to a kindergartner, which these children who experienced this are that age, how do you do it a little bit differently. 

[00:33:08]


>>> You use language that the children can understand. You also use aids. I would also if you have a third party that would be wonderful. If you don't get some drawing paper and some crayons haven't them begin to draw pictures about what happened. Because that's going get them talking about it. Almost like show and tell but a little bit more serious than that. 
>> Do you talk to them about it if they don't know what's going on? Do you bring it up out of the blue? 
>>> Well, you know, if they're not cle like they weren't in that area, then you might not. But quiet frankly a lot of children are watching the news, and we do want our children to be aware of the dangers that are out there. So we would want to have a conversation at some point and say, listen, there's some really bad people out there that do really bad thing. 
>> Black and white straight forward. 
>>> Yes. 
>> Do you encourage your children to mourn? Absolutely. Absolutely. 
>> Even if they're not directly involved because. 
>>> Absolute. 
>> We become so cold sometimes as society but to teach them how to mourn. 
>>> We have to mourn. That's part of the gift that we've been given as a grieving process and mourning is a part of that healing process. If it doesn't happen on the front end then it's going to happen on the back end much it's reallymportant that we grieve which means we'll experience different emotions like anger, like rage, like misunderstanding or confusion, all of that stuff comes up, and we've got to talk about it. 
>> Not an easy conversation to have but one that we need to. 
>>> Let's talk about it ourselves as adults, too, so we can help them. 
>> Dr. Argie allen always good to see you. Thanks for coming in. 
>>> Good to see you.

[00:48:34]


>> Hopefully someone will come forward. Claudia, thank you on to scott williams and your weather authority forecast. 
>> Well, thomas, certainly today we saw a lot of sunshine out there. Temperatures climbed into the low 50s. But big changes ahead for a part of your weekend. Ultimate doppler scanning clear for now, but I am tracking moisture to our west. You have to look well to our west toward sections of the planes. This is the storm system that will eventually bring us clouds and also showers by a part of the weekend. Let's run it all down for you looking at those weather headlines. Drive chilly and quiet for your friday night. A pretty nice saturday. A mixture of sun and clouds. But then that unsettled pattern kicks in to gear during the day on sunday. It was a cold 30 degrees this morning but look at the afternoon high. We made it up to 51 degrees. Well above the normal for this time of year which is 45 degrees temperatures all over the place right now. We have 37 in millville. 37 in mount pocono but we have mid 40s around pottstown as well philadelphia. It's 41 degrees currently in cape may. So the forecast for tonight, the clear skies, cold conditions. 34 degrees in the city. We're looking at 20s north and west. So definitely bundle up if you have some friday evening plans on the town. It's going get chilly. For tomorrow, the better of the two weekend days. Temperatures topping out in the upper 40s. Sunshine threw some high clouds and then more clouds increase as we move late in the day tomorrow so sunshine to start as we take a look at the clock 7:00 a.M. No weather worries, dry conditionings but more clouds as we progress throughout tomorrow afternoon and then in particular during tomorrow evening right around 11:00 o'clock mostly cloudy skies. That's when we'll watch that moisture that will be approaching from the west. That moisture could start off in the form of a little bit of freezing drizzle toward the poconos and the lehigh valley. You see that pink shaded color there. The green is the rainfall. So as we go hour by hour, sunday you can see clouds and showers around lingering throughout your sunday. That will begin the wet pattern. So as we talk about the first wave, that will come into play sunday. Continuing into early monday. The next wave will move in monday afternoon through tuesday morning. That's not really it as we continue to go in time, that area of low pressure will develop into aor'easter but it will be well away from us right now it looks like for the middle part of the week. So for wednesday, we're looking at windy conditions and chilly weather. Temperatures topping out, though, in the 40s as we get a little cooler push of air behind that system. Let's spell it out for you recapping upcoming weekend. Tomorrow mostly sunny, temperatures in the upper 40s. So if you have outdoor plans, maybe doing things around the yard, tomorrow would be the better day to do it as we expect dry conditions. Now, as we move into your sunday, that's when we'll have mostly cloudy skies. Occasional showers. Also, continuing into the balance of next week we'll keep things a little unsettled but it's not going to be a complete wash out. We'll watch that first wave move through. Then the second one comes into play monday late into early tuesday. We'll keep clouds around and then temperatures, though, actually above average monday, tuesday and then right around where we should be for this time of year for the middle and latter part of next week. Moving into next friday we could have another front that will bring some cold rain. 

[00:52:01]


>> But once again, rain. 
>> Rain. Rain is the key word. 
>>> Yeah. We could have a little bit of freezing drizzle, though, sunday morning in the poconos and the lehigh valley. Isn't all right. Scott, thank you. 
>> We continue to cover the tragedy at a connecticut elementary school. Here's what we know right now. Right around 9:00 hit this morning, a gunman walked into sandy hook elementary school and opened fire. 26 people were killed at the school. That includes 20 children and six adults.

We also know that another person was found dead at a separate location believed to be linked to the school shooting. Parents and students as you can imagine are in shock. Comeing to grips with the tragedy that is unlike anything else. 
>> Did you hear any gunshots or anything like that? 
>> Um, well, police officers, like, they were -- they were kind because they were police officers ran out the door trying to fine the guy. Then, um, policemen came in and they, um, just like asked if he was in here. But then we had to climb into the closets and -- um, we heard a lot more gunshots and the ambulance came but then the policemen directed to us run out of the building and go to the fire department. 
>> Well visibly shaken president obama getting very choked up when he came out to talk about the shooting earlier today. 
>>> The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of five and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them.

The president and house speaker john boehner hard at work trying to avoid the economic disaster. The two met for about 50 minutes to make progress toward a deal. Neither side would go into detail about what happened. Boehner criticized the president for unwillingness to compromise. 
>> The president promised balanced approach his proposals have been anything but. He wants far more in tax hikes than in spending cuts. 
>> After late day meeting boehner said talks were quote doing great. 
>> New details emerging about the man who opened fire inside the crowded mall in oregon. Jacob roberts roommate says he had a weird look on his face when he left the house. Roberts apparently wanted to join the marines. A foot injury kept him from doing that. He shot and killed two people inside of a mall on thursday before he turned the gun on himself.

He was awarded the military's highest honor by president obama last year. He is credited of saving the lives of 13 americans and 23 afghan soldiers during a firefight in 2009.

>> Special night at the white house and president obama and the first lady celebrated the 6th night of hanukkah. It included traditional prayers and the lighting of candles from a 90-year-old menorah. It was seriously damaged super he storm sandy. It symbolizes perseverance much like the holiday. 
>> Jews honor ever lasting hope that ght will over come the darkness, goodness over comes evil and faith can accomplish miracles. 
>>> The president also said america's support for israel remains unshakeable. That is your 5@5:00. Nding it before it even started u.N. Ambassador susan rice taking her name out of running for the secretary of state position. This following months of criticism over her comments on the benghazi attack. Peter doocy is following this story from washington and there are so many angles to this one. Good morning, peter. 
>> There are. Ambassador susan rice was never actually nominated for the job of secretary of state but based on statements president obama made in public hefz believed to be a frontrunner for his nomination. She thinks a potential confirmation process would have been lengthy and disruptive so she says she is out. 
>> I withdrew my name because i think it's the right thing for the country. I think it's the right thing for the president and putting those things together that makes it the right thing for me and my family. 

[00:04:21]


>> President obama said while i deeply regret the unfair attacks on susan rice in recent weeks the position demonstrates strength of her character and admirable commitment to rise above the politics at the moment to put our national interests fist. The american people can be proud to have a public servant of her caliber and character representing our country. Republican senator lindsay graham says he respects rice's decision to withdraw her name. Graham has been highly critical of rice and her role in the administration's public response to the terror attack in benghazi. Meanwhile former u.S. Ambassador to the snuchlt john bolton explains why he thinks all of this suspect had aing. 
>> I think they had come to a political conclusion it was too costly for the nomination to go forward she wanted to get her $0.02 on that. I wouldn't be surprised after a few friendly interviewshere is more discussion about it. I think the administration wants to get this off the radar screen. 
>>> Massachusetts democratic senator john kerry is now believed to be president obama's top choice to replace hillary clinton and secretary of state. Don't expect ambassador tore rice to dispier. She is being mentioned as a pick for national security advisor a very important job that does not require senate confirmation and it is on the schedule to meet with president obama later on today. Heather? 
>> Thank you so much. No senate confirmation. That might be key. Now it is time for a look at who is talking. 
>> Charles krauthammer looking at his reason why he believes rice heyed the decision. 
>> Had she been nominated benghazi scandal above been on the front page. With her not being nominated benghazi scandal will die in the mainstream media they will have no interest in the story. That's why I think the president put himself out there he would rather have had her I think he feels he somehow kneeleded and her consolation will be he will make her national security advisor which is a very powerful position which does not require the as sent of the senate. 

[00:06:44]


>> John kerry is ather rumored choice to replace hillary clinton as secretary of state. Fox poll shows what americans think about kerry and rice. 
>> When asked who president obama should nominate as the next secretary of state when given a choice between kerry and rice the majority 37 percent said someone else. Kerry receiving 23 percent while susan rice received 19 percent. 
>>> Keeping on the topic benghazi the fox news poll asked those polled thought the president should order troops to benghazi to helpmericans there 25 percent said -- 65 percent, 24 percent no and the rest were unsure. 
>>> Did they try to cover it up? 47 percent said yes while 42 percent said no. 
>>> All right. Let's talk about some business news now. Even if a last minute deal is reached to avoid the fiscal cliff the damage may already be doneecause a lot of small business owners we have talked to are not investing in their own businessesecause of fear of going over the edge. You talk to any small business owner it's uncertainty. 
>> The election was supposed to take away that uncertainty. Didn't happen. The fiscal cliff paralyzed so many small businesses. The big job creators out there. A wells far go gallup survey found those spending intentions fallen to a year load. They are not upgrading computers or hiring workers. The reason is the fiscal cliff. Small firms are slow companies are s be corpse so they are taxed as individuals and likely make 250,000 dollars a year meaning they will get stung by higher taxes. 
>> Talk to us about twitter a big year for president obama of course no surprise there. 

[00:08:48]


>> It is the time of year when we reflect on what happened through out the year. Twitter is a great way to measure a lot of that. The most retweeted message of the year. President obama's 4 year victory tweet with a photo of him hugging the fir lady. Riept behind the president justin bieber a good-bye tweet to a friend who died of brain cancer. 
>> A whole lot of us are traveling for the holiday season more than in the past6 years. 
>> It is at a high. Basically get ready for holiday traffic jams. Aaa is predicting 93.3 million americans will hit the roads or the skies this holiday season. That would make the busiest travel season in 6 years. Spending could be up as well forecast to increase 6 percent to $759. Why is that? We are probably going out a lot more and spending money on entertainment. Get this? Gas prices not expected to rise. Maybe 3.30 cents a gallon by the end of the year. Air fair is down. Hotel rates thriving a little bit a 2-3 percent. 
>> We will crash on the family member's couch. 
>> With the holiday travels that's what we want you to brew on today. We want to know if you are planning to travel for the holidays if so where you are headed. You can tweet them to us at fox friends first or shoot us an e-mail at fox friend first at foxnews.com AND WE WILL READ Some of those later on in the show. 
>>> Now it is time for your first degree weather update with janice dean. Will mother nature cooperate for travelers today? 
>> Travelers across theast will be in good shape. Across the west another story. Clear skies for much of the eastern half of the country you move to the west we have storm systems one across the west another southwest with a lot of rain and snow which is great news for the travelers. 18 inches for parts of the mountainous regions of colorado through arizona up through the rocky mountains. This is mainly a gad thing because a lot of country is into a drought. This system is going to move into the central u.S. By saturday and then across the east coast by sunday. Going to get rain across the southeast and snow across the southeast. They are moving across the major cities today. We will get into a little bit of activity. 

[00:11:34]


>> I was listening to you. 
>> The time now is 11 minutes after the top of the hour. A real scrooge taking away the christmas concert replacing it with something else. 
>> The parents pleading with the president's health a son fighting for his life inside of a mexican prison. 
>> It has gone on too long. It's a ridiculous case. I think they know it's a ridiculous case. I am asking the president to get involved at this point. 
>> We will hear more from them and the lawyer who is working hard to free them. ?????? ?????? 
[ Male Announcer ] THEY ARE A GLOWING EXAMPLE Of what it means to be the best. And at this special time of year, they shine even brighter. Come to the winter event and get the mercedes-benz you've always wished for, now for an exceptional price.

>> It is now quarter past the hour. Here's what you missed while you were sleeping. The radio hosts behind the hoax have been move to do safe houses because they received death threats. Several other radio staffers are given 24-hour protection as well. We are learning the station may actually lose its license. Those hosts are being blamed a lot of folks that the reason kate middleton's nurse took her own life. A memorial service is being held in her home town later today. 
>> Could jenni rivera still be alive? She took the last minute decision to take the plane ride even though they offer to do put her up in a hotel room for the night. Heather? 
>>> Tyke for a look at who is talking. We are hearing from the parents and lawyer of the former marine being held in mexico on gun charges. 
>> John hammer junior was arrested whieflz passing through a mexican border city on the way to costa rica. He was arrested for carrying this antique shot gun. It belonged to his grandfather. A u.S. Border patrol agent told him it was legal as long as he declared it with mexican authorities. When he went to do that he was arrested instead. 
>>> In a moment we will hear his parent plea to president obama. First here's his lawyer's explanation of this event. 
>> The customs told him it was legal to go to mexico with registration papers. The problem was when he came back into the states. He goes through mexico with customs told him to wait and fooi hours after ty raised him for violation of article 11 paragraph h of the federal law of weapons and explosives which says you can have any shot gun except certain type of shot guns for example ones of certain caliber. This particular caliber was .410 which is not -- it is not reserved for exclusive use of the armed forces and neither were the bullets the gauges that was for the nonexclusives. The issue here really is the length of the barrel. That's the problem. How it was measured and also most important that is why. This had to be under 25 inches and we believe the pressure was taken the wrong way. 

[00:18:04]


>> There han some criticism here at home that the state department and the administration are not doing enough to help secure hammer's release. Last night his parents spoke with sean hannity about this making a plea to president obama. 
>> We are just asking for everyone to talk to their lawmakers. I would make a personal plea to the president to contact the new incoming president of mexico and just ask him to resol 6 -- resolve this case and send him home. It has gone on too long it's a ridiculous case. I think they know it's a ridiculous case because it was an accident. It's a case that their own military sent les to the judges and prosecutors saying this gun is not on the restricted list that it is trying to restrict assault rifles essentially. This isn't anything like this. The prosecutors and the judges have refused to consider that. I am just asking the president to get involved at this point. 
>> Hammer's next hear something scheduled for january 17th. More on that on fox and friends later this morning. 
>>> Time is now 20 minutes after the hour. Troops putting our lives on the line to protect us from the taliban. Why is the army telling soldiers to be so nice to them?

>> Welcome back to "fox & friends first". I am heather childers. 
>> I am heather nauert. It is now half past the hour. It is timeor the top 5@5:30. We are getting to listen in on the chilling 911 call that was made moments after dallas cowboy player crashed his car killing his teammates. Listen to this. 
>> Is anybody injured? 
>> I don't know. It just happened. There's a car upside down and there was smoke every where. 
>> There's a car in the middle of the road on fire upside down. 
>> We have it. We are on the way, okay? 
>> This is a look at the scene of this saturday's accident. It was obtained by tmz. Josh brent had a blood alcohol level over the limit when he killed his teammate in the dwi accident.

>> The epa is now trying to regulate rain water. That is exactly what it is proposing in virginia. A federal judge will hear arguments from state lawmakers who file a lawsuit saying the plan is illegal. The agency wants to classify water as a pollutant and doing so would regulate a single creek that could cost the state a billion dollars and force people out of their homes. 
>>> What they are going to have to do is things like take people's houses, evict them, kn the houses down and plant grass so the water doesn't flow. 

[00:31:53]


>> Listen to this one. The epa says when there's too much water it can be classified as pollutant that gives them regulatory power under the clean water act. 
>> The show won't be going on at an elementary school in massachusetts. The traditional mol day concert at jordan johnson elementary has been canceled after parents complained that last year's performance was too religious. A speech on anti bullying will take the place of the concert in january.

That is your top 5@5:00. 
>>> While the president promised american people balanced approach his proposals have been anything but. He wants far more in tax hikes than spending cuts. 
>> That was house speaker john boehner yesterday talking about the struggles of coming to a fiscal cliff agreement. That was hours before he met with president obama at the white house. Did anything change? Doug luzader is live with the latest hopefully an answer. 
>> The short answer is no agreement yet. But we may see more of a band-aid approach as opposed to a big fix, although that would require the republicans give in to the president to raise taxes. House speaker john boehner did go to the white house late yesterday to meet with the president. No agreement came out of that meeting, but he said earlier in the day that he will not budge on the president's demand for almost unlimited power to raise the nation's debt ceiling as part of the deal. If push had asked the president to do that it would have been shot down. 

[00:33:57]


>> Do you think there is any chance that senator obama would have done that? Zero. Congress is never going to give up our ability to control the purse. And the fact is -- 
>> the president meantime arranged interviews with a number of local tv stations to slam republicans for not agreeing to higher taxes. 
>> The big problem right now is republicans and the house are resistant to the idea of the wealthiest americans paying higher tax rates. I understand the philosophical objection, on the other hand, we are willing to make some really tough decisions about spending cuts. 
>> Are they, though? It is possible republicans may give in on letting those top tax rates fire and revert back to clinton levels. It would push big argument over the debt ceiling and spending cuts the next year. 
>>> Doug luzader in washington for us. Thanks so much, doug.

That's when these workers are threatening to strike 300 of those security guards they are nonunionized workers threatening to strike, walk off the job right here at jfk airport.

>> They refuse to give us proper equipment working equipment, radios. They refuse to give us proper training.

>> They have decided whether or not they are joining the healthcare exchanges. So far more states are opting out than signing up for it. Here's the question, will the president's plan work? Diane macedo may have the answer. 
>> Can't tell you that but I can breakdown how the states are divvying this up. The deadline is here. They have to decide if they are going to set up their own marketplace for private health insurance or if they are going to leave it to the federal government. Tell me if you notice any trends. 20 states have gone for the later option outright. They are not creating their own exchanges. Montana republican state legislature requested to set up an exchange there. They will have a federal exchange there as well. Indiana governor deferred the decision to governor elect.

Send it to fox news.Com. 
>> Have a great day, we'll see you later. "Fox and friends" starts right now. Bye. 
>> >> Gretchen: GOOD MORNING, Everyone. I am gretchen carlson. Thanks for sharing your susan rice wants out. She asked not to be considered for secretary of state. That will push her involvement in libya right under the rug. 
>> Steve: Parents pleading for help. The united states government is joining the fight. Can they fro our marine from mokesco. That's straight ahead ? 
>> Brian: A high school basketball team lose by 105 poigns . Other than the parents want to know why that was allowed to happen. Tough love or basketball beat down. They definitely lost. "Fox and friends" starts right now. 
>> I want to wish everybody happy hanukkah and happy christmas and go giants. 
Mr.1: Yeah, there is scotty. 
>> Brian: Why are you taking sides, scott ? You just want all times to play well, right. 
>> Gretchen: No, he doesn't. He is not a fair weather fan. I like that. He has conviction and says what he thinks. 
>> Brian: Those superbowl championships, you are walking. 
>> Gretchen: Scott happens to be a fantastic singer and dancer. 
>> Steve: He is. 
>> Brian: That scott. 
>> Gretchen: That scott, right there . I am glad he's on my camera. 
>> Brian: Have you actually seen evidence . ?????? Before -- 
>> Gretchen: I told you. You got to know your camera guys. 

[00:02:01]


>> Brian: We know them. 
>> Steve: That was scott. 
>> Gretchen: Ian put him out of focus again. 
>> Brian: Ian. For a change put me in focus. 
>> Gretchen: Our christmas party is coming up and we'll all be out of focus. 
>> Brian: Ian according to reports will not be going. 
>> Gretchen: Why ? 
>> It is hanukkah. 
>> Steve: He has a conflict. We'll start about this. Are we speaking of focus it is becoming clearer, susab rice will not be our next secretary of state. 
>> Brian: I would like to with draw mine as well. 
>> Steve: She said essentially the administration can't afford a fight over benghazi. The big question is, did she fall on her sword or did the white house hand her one. Clearly she was thrown under the bus. 
>> Gretchen: This is what she wrote on september 16th when secretary of state was unavailable after a grueling week, the white house asked me to appear on five sunday talk shows. I relied on fully cleared unclassified points provided by the intelligence committee. The unclassified points were consistent with the classified assessments, I received. First of all was hillary clinton really not available or did she say she didn't want to go tell something that was not the truth. As katherine heritage, un ambassador rice had access to the pdp. Presidential daily briefing before she went out on the talk show and talked about the fact that it was probably a terrorist attack. 

[00:04:03]


>> Brian: Charles krauthammer said now that rice is out and the president decided not to fight the fight here. It mines the end of pursuing the truth with the benghazi attack. 
>> Clearly had she been nominated the benghazi scandal would be on the front page. I think it will die now in the main stream media. They have no interest in the story. I think he would rather have had her and he had yielded . Her consolation will be he will make her national advisor and that does not require the asset -- ascent of the senate. 
>> Steve: When you look at her record on syria and africa, it was not good. Maureen dowd said rice is too automaticbitious and unprincipled. Dana milbank said her attitude was a problem . Hillary clinton begin the choice between john kerry and susan rice. Said I would rather have john kerry. He can talk for hours and not say anything and speaks french. 
>> Gretchen: I was doing studio b . And he was probably uncorking the champagne. There is supposedly a report on benghazi coming out. Usually they make the announcements on friday. Could it be the report is coming out today as the friday release or sometime soon? Will that mean hillary clinton will not testify on december 20th if she wants to run for president, and moderate republican susan collins, the senator, maybe she was the final nail in the coffin. When she came out and said she still had questions. If moderate republicans would not say yes, it was over. 

[00:06:23]


>> Brian: I don't agree with charles krauthammer. I - a lot of nave I seals and military people want to know why they were sacrificed. An drea mitchell has a staggering review what this means for republicans that ambassador rice was not nominated. 
>> I think it was an impossible challenge for her to be confirmed and the white house knew that. They know they are on good political solid ground and this will not help republicans at all the fact that a woman of color was forced out of the confirmation process before she was nominated. 
>> Gretchen: Her race has nothing to do with it or her gender. We have had madelyne albright and condoleezza rice who fits both of the criteria. 
>> Steve: Nominated by the republican. 
>> Gretchen: We have had hillary clinton. Who was the last male secretary of state ? 
>> Brian: Colin powell . For everybody to see race and gender in this is incredible. That has nothing to do with it and that the fact people are looking for that as a political plus or minus. Where are we at with race relations in this country ? It seems like we are back in 1960. 
>> Steve: It could be good news for howard school brown who was beaten in the election . If there is a special election to replace john kerry if he becomes secretary of state, scott brown would be a shoe in. 
>> Brian: He hit the ground running. 
>> Steve: And one other wrinkle for scott brown. Uval patrick is not going to run for reelection . If not senate maybe governor. 

[00:08:29]


>> Gretchen: I thought he was going to do more spreads for gq. 
>> Steve: He did a naked shot. 
>> Brian: Just to make end's meet. 
>> Gretchen: When he was young and he was an attractive >> 
Brian: We have all done naked photographs at one poign. 
>> Gretchen: No, no, no. I have not. We'll set the record straight now, I have not. If he is not answering the question. 
>> Steve: I don't remember money exchanging hands with that picture. 
>> Gretchen: This is for the after the show, show. 
>> Brian: Long way to go before that. 
>> Gretchen: Maybe for the christmas party. Fox news alert, the united states ramping up its involvement in the crisis in syria. Leon paneta signing off on sending two patriot missiles and troops to turkey to beef up the country's defense under syria attack. The missiles will be under nato control. Washington sets up the insurance exchangings under obama care. So far 23 states opted out meaning that the federal government will have to run it for them. 19 will have state run exchanges and six plan on partnering with the fids and virginia and florida are the only two states that have not made a decision. We are 18 days from going over the fiscal cliff and president and john boehner hard at work to avirt a disaster. They met at the white house for 50 minutes. Neither side would go in details, but the mighting came hours after speaker boehner critized the president for an unwillingness to compromise. 
>> The president promised the american people a balanced approach, his proposals are anything but. He wants far more in tax hikes than spending cuts. Boehner said talks were doing great. Do you feel the need for speed ? That is forevermore wwe wrestler. U.S. Navy let him take a ride in the fighter jet for the annual tribute for the troops. How fast did he g. He went 900 miles per hour. Don't worry. They made him go through training. I wonder if he had the barf bad. 

[00:11:17]


>> Brian: It is impossible to go through and not throw up ? 
>> Steve: It happens a lompt 
-- lot. 
>> Brian: If you had taken a flight that fast. 
>> Steve: In a airplane. 11 minutes after the hour. He faced down iraqi insurgents but the treatment in prisons had the family terrified. 
>> Gretchen: No christmas concert, kids. How about an anti-bullying speech, instead that story. I don't know. ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? me to take a centrum silver multivitamin every day.

>> Gretchen:15 minutes after the hour. He survived iraq and afghanistan wars only to fine himself jail would in a mexican prison. He decided to take a vacation and he was jailed for possessing a registered weapon. He was targets of threat and extortion by cartel members looking to make a profit. Despite the difficult ordeal he is showing incredible strength. 
>> We gave him a phone number of someone to call. If something happens and we can't get there and take hours to get there, we had made arrangements for machine to pick tup. He wrote it in my bible. They may not let you take anything out . He said. They are not taking my bible. He's hanging and he's tough. 
>> Gretchen: And now a congresswoman stepped in to help the family bring john home. Congresswoman thank you for getting up early. I know you are working with the family and I interviewed his mother the other day . Her first brew nationally and she was scared and came to you for help. What can you do ? 

[00:16:46]


>> It is it a tricky situation for the family. As you pointed out. He's been incarcerated since august for a technical nothing crime. He tried to do the right thing. He asked our u.S. Custom and border agents, can I bring the firearm in to mexico. They photographed it and measured it and weighed it and said fill out the forms and he was in the mexican authority office when he was jailed when he was trying to reg I felter his woman. The family has been low key and working through many mexican attorneys that they hired to try to get their son free and after mongs, they have got no action and so they decided to take the gamble and go public . Boy, this story took off . We contacted the state department and our ambassador, you name it and president obama, janet naacp, we have reached out to everyone and thanks to our colleagues in congress. 30 minutes co-stined letters to naacp and clinton,ing -- napal tanio to bring him home. 
>> Gretchen: It is not like the taliban has him. This is commexco and i understand the drug cartels are in charge of the prisons there. Don't we have good enough relations to get him home. 
>> You would think so especially with a brand new president taking over . We have supposedly good relations with our neighbors. They also lecture us about how badly we treat illegal immigrants which is burch of a balony and yet they have an american hoar incarcerated. He is chained to his bed. This is told to me by mexican authorities. Why ? They had to take him out of the general population after the extortions and beatings. They have him in an area away from the general population. They have to chain this marine to the bed to make sure he will not escape. It is unbelievable that the mexican government is not stepping in to help us while they take our money and help we give them . Incredible our own u.S. Government is not doing all we can to bring hammer home for chris nas. He's done nothing wrong. 

[00:19:23]


>> Gretchen: Sounds like you are frustrated with our own government, am I getting that correct ? 
>> I don't want to be what jean kirpatrick who is blame the auerican. Of course it is the mexican government at fault. But the u.S. Government has to say we are not going to give you a status update on john hammer, we are going to lobby for his release and get him and if they want to go through a trial, that is fine. Bond him out. He suffered with post traumatic stress and served in iraq and afghanistan and got out of a clinic to deal with stress and now he finds himself. It is unfair and unjust. We'll keep on fighting. We'll make it happen. 
>> Gretchen: Thanks for your efforts and thank you for getting up early. 
>> I appreciate it >> 
Gretchen: I just talked about the taliban, right. The taliban's mission to kill americans, whyure our troops told to be nice to them.

Researchers looked at nine studies of over 200,000 people and found being born by c-section babies were more likely to be heavy in life. It doesn't mean it caused the weight gain.

They came back to do 34-13 and will face the pittsburg steelers next week. What could be the playoff deciding contest. Jets still fancy themselves in the playoff hunt.

Hamilton drove in 148 rbi's. He has a history of substance abuse and a bit of a streaky player and has trouble avoiding injury. And we'll see what happens next. 

[00:37:53]


>> Gretchen: Also a history of the home runs. Angels said -- rangers excuse me said you can go. 
>> Steve: The economy is still sputtering and the federal reserve has a plan to get it back on track. 
>> No, no, no. All you have to do is hook the bad boy up to the house and throw the card in and boom, boom and mow, money and more money. 
>> Steve: Yeah, more money and chairman ben bernanke said the fed will print more money to push down interest rates. Will more money mean more problems ? Nothing to laugh about when you think of what the government is dog. Printing all of this money and trying to get it -- we are dog what ? 
>> The numbers are staggering. Ben bernanke is going to print a trillion a year. This is it the fifth year in a row he printed a trillion bucks meanwhile, president obama is going to borrow eye trillion dollars this year and that is for the fifth year in a row that they borrowed a trillion. You printed a trillion and borrowing a trilian where is it going to end ? Odds are you will have a financial crisis. Inflation or debt crisis. In the immediate future we are bumling along with slow growth. 
>> Steve: Ben bernanke said they will continue keep interest low until unemployment got down to 6 percent. I know you are a econanist. Isn't the best way to get unemployment lower to get more jobs. 
>> They have done this four years and it hane worked . Unemployment rate is 7.7 percent. Why are we dog it all over again when it hasn't worked in the past. People have zy --anxiety. It is hanukkah and christmas. And done talk about the money being prented. But there is axiety. Inflation or debt crisis or slow growth with continued high unemployment. Not a pretty picture.

>> Gretchen: Ed. 
>> Brian: Indiana girl's basketball team scored big on tuesday night. What do you mean really big? They won a game 107-2. Now parents on the losing side want to know why wasn't the game called off sooner? Why wasn't better sportsmanship shown perhaps by the winning team? Bob is the athletic director at arlington high school that, school that lost big time. So thank you for joining us, bob. Are you upset with bloomington south? 
>> Thank you for having me. As a school we hold no hard feelings toward bloomington south. The way we look at it now our girl's basketball program is at the very beginning stages of development. We currently have ten girls in the whole program. Six of those ten are playing basketball all together for the rst time in their life. I'm not talking being on a team, really just playing the game for the first time. Bloomington south, year in and year out is a state power. Currently they're 8-1. Ranked number 10 in the state. So we definitely -- we just see it as two programs that are about on polar opposite ends in the spectrum. 
>> Brian: I would say so, but i think there's a lot of teams substantially better than their opponents. They don't win by 105 points. Would you be dispint fundamental a team under injure jurisdiction won by 105? Would you angry at that coach? 
>> Well, I mean, we trust bloomington south and they're coaching staff about all they could outright keep the integrity and the sportsmanship the best they can. You know, there are things that you can do, like taking press prestons off and we feel they did a decent job of. 
>> Brian: Wow. 
>> We don't hold any hard feelings toward them. We look at it as an opportunity for our girls to see if a program like blackton south, entry they are. 
>> Brian: They saw a lot of that program. Here is what the coach said. Both teams played hard. To do anything less by either team would have been demeaning. Arlington came out and worked on their player development as did we. The long standing reputation of our program and coach is one that would validate this information. Saying it would be more of an insult if we stopped shooting. Do you agree with that? 

[00:55:04]


>> To a certain ex at any time, yeah. I mean, again, where do you draw that line of trying not to score as mocking the opponent and embarrassing them? I think one thing you could look at is the character of our young leaders. That score board is up there all night for 32 minutes and just like the people said, our girls played hard tore 32 minutes. It's easy for them. 
>> Brian: The coach of your team said they could have shown better responsemanship. I think that's the least, don't you think. 
>> After a loss like that, you speak -- we're taking it as we're just going to focus on us and our girls basketball program. We're extremely proud of them and the effort they gave that night and the fact that they didn't quit. They're a resilient group of young ladies. We're not focused on the negative. 
>> Brian: You got to maybe get together with other athletic directors and talk about things like a mercy rule perhaps. Down by 50 at the half. 
>> Right. Yeah. You're right. Or possibly the idea of running the clock once you get to a certain spread. Here in indiana we have the governing body which will work tight will he with our coaches. These are great conversations moving forward. We hold no hard feelings toward bloomington south. It's great opportunity for us to improve. 
>> BrianOKAY. If you're up by 90 against them, I want you to stop your girls from scoring next time around. Bob, thanks so much and good luck with developing the program and the stance you guys have taken and good luck to your girls. 
>> Thank you for having us. Appreciate it. 
>> Brian: Thanks. Good luck this season. Straight ahead, you've seen this picture on fox news channel. But are the other networks covering the union violence out of michigan?

>> Gretchen: Tgif. It's so great to get to friday sometimes, isn't it? December 14, 2012. I'm gretchen carlson. Thanks for sharing your time. You can count her out. Ambassador susan rice telling the president to withdraw her name for consideration for secretary of state. But why now after she held two meetings with gop senators? Is it because there is another report possibly coming out? Lots to discuss this morning. 
>> Brian: The president and the speaker meet to talk about the fiscal cliff. But are they getting anywhere? 
>> I'm beginning to think that president obama's position is like michael corleone, my offer is nothing. 
[ Laughter 
>> Brian: Is that really the president's plan and better yet, is it working 
>> Steve: Meanwhile, this is what you get for trying to rip off a church, a real shocker. Was it perhaps a case of divine intervention? "Fox & friends" hour two for friday starts right now. 

[01:01:10]


>> This is chris jewel, camera 4 operator and I say merry christmas to you and you're watching "fox & friends." 
>> Gretchen: All right. Today is the day to honor our crew. All these fabulous guys, for the most part guys, who operate our cameras and there is chris chulo. What we call the gib. That camera moves all around, camera 4. Move it up and down. 
>> Steve: He have has no idea how to operate it. 
>> Brian: By the way, we ask who is the weakest camera man and give him this camera and chris chulo -- 
[ laughter ] oh, oh. 
>> Gretchen: Get him! Get him! 
>> Steve: How long you been on this show? Almost from the get go. Great to have you. 
>> Brian: He doesn't get paid. He does it for experience. 
>> Gretchen: Yeah right. With all that experience, maybe he could become secretary of state. Unfortunately, susan rice won't be secretary of state. Yesterday in an op ed she took herself out of the running. The timing is interesting 'cause there is reports that maybe a big report is coming out on actually what happened, the american people might time fee find out what happened in benghazi of the she went on the sunday talk shows, five of them, a couple of days after the september 11 attacks and said that it was a spontaneous attack. Even though now it's become clear she and others probable will he knew that it was terrorism. 
>> Steve: In fact, after it hit the fan, we predicted on this program that she eventually would be withdrawn because she simply was not worth the fight at this point and yesterday in her op ed in the page of the "washington post," she essentially said that, not worth trouble. She said on september 16 when secretary of state hillary clinton was unavailable after a grueling week, the white house asked me to appear on five sunday talk shows when discussing benghazi. I relied on fully cleared, unclassified points provided by the intel community, although she knew the secret stuff, which encapsulated their best current assess am. These unclassified points were -- 

[01:03:20]


>> Brian: Were you following the white on those highlighted or following you? 
>> Steve: It was that perfect. 
>> Brian: That was the bouncing ball. The president said while I deep will he regreat the unfair and misleading attacks on ambassador rice, it reflects her character. Chaftz says coincidence? I don't think so. The state department owes us a report. That's why I think susan rice made that announcement today. You're starting to see the department squirm a little. They're saying maybe we'll give you a summary. Secretary clinton may not come up. I think the report, if done accurately, will be a very difficult thing for the white house, the state department, the department of defense and the c.I.A. To explain. 
>> Gretchen: There is a lot of moving parts that were happening yesterday afternoon. First of alt, it started coming out that hillary clinton may be wouldn't testify on december 20 as planned. Moments later, susan rice takes herself out of the running. One of the main reasons potentially that this report is coming out, remember, susan rice extended the olive grant and met with senator lindsey graham and john mccain, her two fiercest critics. She then met with senator susan collin a moderate. She also came out of the meeting saying, I actually have more questions now than I did before. So if you couldn't get the moderate republican to vote for you for secretary of state, the writing was probably on the wall. 
>> Brian: What I thought was totally out of bounds with andrea mitchell said yesterday in her evaluation and analyzing what this means in terms of politics with her backing out, she brought up the gender factor and the race factor. Listen. 
>> I think that this had become sort of an impossible challenge for her to be confirmed. She realized that. The white house realized it as well. I think they know that they are on good political, solid ground, as you were pointing out. This is not going to heparins at all, the fact that a woman and a woman of color has been forced out of the confirmation process before she was nominated. 

[01:05:23]


>> Gretchen: Nothing to do with it. 
>> Steve: Look, it was george w bush, a republican, who placed in the job of secretary of state a woman of color, condoleeza rice. We have seen this a lot, this kind of talk from the left over the last couple of months. 
>> Gretchen: It's interesting because if anyone is a proponent of women seeking office it's me. I don't agree with andrea mitchell at all on this. When you look back at recent secretary of states, a lot have been women and african-american. You have madeleine albright, hillary clinton, condoleeza rice, I can't even remember the last male. Then you brought it up that it was colin powell. I'm not sure it has anything o do with why susan rice will not be secretary of state. 
>> Steve: It absolutely does not. She went out and many people feel she lied to the american people to give the president of the united states political cover just before an election. 
>> Brian:17 days and three days to write legislation. Probably less than 17 days 'til we hit the fiscal cliff. The president invited the speaker to the white house yesterday and our e-mail box, we're getting filled up. There comes the speaker and there goes the speaker. It lasted an hour and 15 minutes. Did anything get ironed out? So far insiders say no. Yao goldberg offered this analysis and it was pretty brilliant. 
>> I'm beginning to think that president obama's position is like michael corleone's position in godfather 2, my offer is nothing. His real goal is watch the republican party go up in flames and eat themselves alive. Which so far seems to be working. I think that what boehner tried to do at this point is simply take the middle class tax cuts as permanent, which would be a huge conservative victory, eat it on the raising the top rates, and then live to fight another day. 
>> Steve: Okay. So that's jonah goldberg's opinion, that mr. Boehner should cave and say okay, let's g ahead and raise up rates. Yesterday in their very brief conversation less than an hour, apparently the president -- I'm going to paraphrase what we know -- the president said okay, john, you ready to cave? He said nope, I'm not going to raise taxes on anybody. How that lasted an hour, I don't know. 

[01:07:33]


>> Gretchen: Because it really comes down to whether or not the president is also going to agree to spending cuts. Remember, folks, about two years ago he said that he was in favor of raising the age of medicare to 67 from 65. So where has that president gone? Now at a most crucial moment when let's face it, in order to get a deal done, both sides are going to have to give in on stuff that they don't want to give in on. If they want to make a deal, or the other option is just go over the cliff. 
>> Steve: The problem is, dick durbin said yesterday very clearly, under no circumstances are we going to raise the medicare retirement age. Nancy pelosi essentially said exactly the same thing. So two of the strongest people in the senate and the house say no to the president, there is not a lot of wiggle room there. 
>> Brian: The president did a morning show interview yesterday on the west coast and said that john boehner was too concerned about raising tax, about what republicans uld say if he raised taxes. 
>> Steve: It continues. 
>> Gretchen: Fox news alert now, two large back to back quakes shaking the california coast this morning. 6.4 magnitude quake rocked the southwest coast near baha, just about an hour ago. Moments later, a 6.1 quake struck, shaking san diego and los angeles. So far no reports of any damage or injury. 
>>> The united states ramping up its involvement in the crisis in syria now. Overnight defense secretary leon panetta signing off on send to go patriot missiles and 400 troops to turkey. That's to help beef up the country's defense against potential syrian attacks. The missiles will be under nato control. 
>>> Today's decision deadline for states to decide if they're going to set up their own insurance exchanges under obamacare. Right now 24 states have opted out. 19, including the district of columbia, will have the state-run exchanges. Six states plan on splitting it with the feds. Utah and florida are the only it who have not made a decision. 

[01:09:35]


>>> Talk about divine intervention, check this out. Two thieves learning a painful lesson while trying to rob a church in houston. They tried grabbing the electric cable, likely for its copper. And set off this explosion. Cops say these guys won't be hard to find. Their injuries should be a give away. Those are your headlines. What will their injuries be? Burn marks? 
>> Brian: I'm not sure. 
>> Steve: Yeah. Near electrocution. Although the theft of copper wire is pretty rampant because cop service quite valuable these days. 
>> Brian: Ten minutes after the hour. You've seen this picture on fox news channel over and over begun, steven crowder getting punched over and over again. But are the other networks covering the union violence out of michigan? We'll and the facts next.

>> Steve: Welcome back. You've seen the violent video this week. Fox news contributor steven crowder getting punched in the face repeatedly by a pro union protester in michigan. Where is the outrage from the main stream media? Just two years ago they were quick to characterize the tea party rallies as dangerous. Remember that? So is there a clear double standard at work? Looks like it to us. How does it look to senior contributor at the daily caller, matt lieu I who joins us live from d.C good morning to you. 
>> Good morning. 
>> Steve: What's interesting is the night of the big rally, 12,000 people outside the state house there in michigan, all the networks covered it. Yet, with this incredibly -- for tv pictures, you're always looking for good pictures. To have an assault caught on camera and for the big three not to run it in their newscast, that just seems like journalistic malpractice, doesn't it? 
>> Absolutely. It should be irresistible to the press to show pictures like this. If something happens and it's not caught on tape, it's not as effective on tv. But if you get it on video, if you get a picture of it, it should have been irresistible. It was part of a larger story and the press said well, the protests were boisterous or that there was some clashing. But they didn't really show the pictures. I think we hear a lot about liberal bias. But selection bias, the stories you decide to cover or not cover I think is probably the most insidious form of violence. 
>> Steve: Yeah. The pictures we're looking at were for americans for prosperity, that wasn't just someone tipping it over. We had somebody on the greta show that said the guys came in with box cutters and worked to knock it down. Came down on men, women and children, some people in wheelchairs and stuff like that. I mean, that is a story that is irresistible, you would think, if people wanted to tell a big story. 
>> It should be. Keep in mind, americans for prosperity had to get permits to put this tent up. They actually reserved that area. They had electricity there. So they went through the proper channels to protest, which is their right. And the tent was torn down and i have seen other videos, not just the videos that have sort of gone viral, but other videos that clearly show there were women and children, elderly folks in there. It's sort of a horrifying thing and really hasn't gotten the coverage. Now yesterday, americans for prosperity in wisconsin said -- I'm sorry, michigan said they were going to file charges or that they had. I guess it's possible that if there is any legal recourse, the press might finally start to cover this. But so far, really hasn't. 

[01:16:35]


>> Steve: Yeah, although they didn't tell the story before. So it's hard to say, you know, a couple of days when we didn't tell but this story, we thought we'd give you an upstate on the story we didn't tell you. Why do you think the main stream immediate why are not covering this? 
-- Media are not covering this? 
>> It's unclear because the pictures should make it irresistible. But I think the question that a lot of folks brought up is what would happen if it were reversed? If it were a tea party member. 
>> Steve: Oh, my goodness. 
>> Right. Remember a couple years ago, the allegation that a tea party protester used a racial epitaph rode them for days and this was just an allegation that somebody said something. Here somebody has punched somebody in the face. This is clear, if this were reversed, the main stream media would be playing the video incessantly. Number two, you would start to see conservatives come out and condemn the violence and criticize a -- they would actually turn on the tea party guy, not defend him. But I think thirdly, it would become part of a larger narrative, right? So if the tea party had done this, it would be, well -- mitt romney needs to comment on this. Or part of the war on women. And that certainly hasn't happened. There are things that democrats and I think president obama gave a speech. There was a democratic representative who said there will be blood. Jimmy hoffa caught in a civil war. All those things happened before the violence and yet, nobody is really tying it into that larger narrative. 
>> Steve: That's right. And also on the left, I know a number of people are suggesting steven crowder actually deserved getting the beat down, which is crazy. All right. Matt, thank you very much for joining us today from our nation's capitol. 
>> Thank you.

>> Is aorkie. She's blind. And this is pixie. We really don't know what she is. 
>> Steve: This is the time of season when I know you guys try very hard to make sure that these dogs don't wind up staying in a kennel over christmas. What's the best way we can adopt them out and others? There are thousands across the country. 
>> The first thing is christmas is maybe not the best time. It's fun, there is a lot going on. But if you plan a lot of stuff ahead of time and you're all prepared. But I think that -- it's really hard. The adoption rates are super down right now. 

[01:23:49]


>> Steve: Why is that? 
>> Economy. 
>> Steve: Yeah. At the can't feed themselves, how can they feed the dogs? 
>> But you just go to the shelter and go to petfinder.Com and pick a breed. Start look. 
>> Gretchen: Twinkie, how did she become blind? 
>> She was born that way. 
>> Gretchen: She's shaking. Is she cold or just scared? 
>> Scared. She had a rough trip. 
>> Gretchen: Okay. 
>> Brian: I believe that pixie is a chihuahua pekinese. Could that be a guess? 
>> Yeah. This one came from a breeder who cast her off because she was blind. 
>> Steve: So many people do, for one reason or another, they don't have a did you go and they think some day I'm going to go to the pet shop and buy one. There are millions of animals at america's shelters that are so easy and so needing a home. 
>> Grateful. 
>> Steve: They are grateful. They're great dogs. 
>> You can get any breed you want in rescue. 
>> Steve: Sometimes it takes a little while to find the one you want. 
>> Yes, you can. 
>> Brian: How long have they been getting along like this? 
>> Blind? 
>> Brian: No, they get along well. They're not fighting or scratching. These are young dogs. 
>> They're really sweet and don't have an alpha personality so they're tolerating. 
>> Gretchen: So they don't need to be in charge? 
>> No. 
>> Gretchen: So tell us the types of families or maybe single people who would be a good fit for these dogs. 
>> For this one? 
>> Gretchen: Yes. 
>> I think when she's blind like this, it's a little harder. She's so cute and a yorkie. It's hard for people to understand this special needs dog. They're special. And a lot of people won't adopt them. But someone like her, she needs someone that has a stable environment where things don't move around. 
>> Brian: They develop their other senses. 
>> If I put this dog down, you would never know she was blind. 
>> Steve: I know of people who adopted animals after watching this program. If people would like more information about your program, do you have a web site?

>> According to a new survey, 70% of dog owners will buy their dogs a christmas gift. But vets say they can't comprehend christmas, but they can sense that we are too stupid to know that. 
[ Laughter ] they will hate the gift. 
>> Gretchen: Yes, and I'm one of the stupid ones who just went out and bought my dog some christmas gifts the other day. They'll go right in the stocking for the dog. And I believe that my dog will know that they came from me. 
>> Steve: Sure. 
>> Gretchen: And my kids. 
>> Steve: If you let the dog chew up the stocking, that really is what dogs want.

[ Laughter ] 
>> Gretchen: Oh, my gosh. Okay. I haven't heard that one. 
>> Brian: Quick look at the headlines. 
>> Gretchen: Okay. One of the only living medal of honor recipients recovering this morning from a brutal attack. Details on the fight involving dakota myer unclear. We know an 18-year-old has been charged with assault. He was awarded the military's highest honor by president obama last year and credited with saving the lives of 13 americans and 23 afghan soldiers daughter fire fight in 2009. 
>> Brian: Even though president obama promised obamacare would save you money, the ceo of the nation's third biggest health care company says it's actually going to double your premiums? The head of aetna says when the law kicks in, small businesses, some individuals, will be in for a rate shock. He has shared his concern with the president and lawmakers in washington. 
>> Steve: Meanwhile, feast your eyes on this. Does this little girl look like a terrorist to you? 
>> You're kidding me. 
>> We're going to get you out of here in a second. Okay?

>> Steve: That 12-year-old girl, who is wheelchair bound, was detained by the tsa at dallas-fort worth airport. Agents thought she had bomb residue on her hands. The girl was kept away from her mom while a bomb specialist was called in. 
>> It's frightening and I got mad. 
>> You would think that they would have checked her wheelchair and they did nothing. Then that's when it just seemed to -- everything seemed to spiral out. 
>> Steve: After 45 minutes, she was free to go. Agents gave the family no explanation and no apology. Heart break video. 
>> Gretchen: Politicians reaching across the aisle. Okay, now you think is going to be good news? No, they reach across the aisle to throw punches. They say we need more of this in america, but this is the first session of ukraine's newly elected parliament. The massive brawl started when lawmakers burst to the front of the chamber and fought overt vote for a new prime minister and speaker. I don't know, john, you may be up to something. All these secret meetings between bainer and obama, they've gone nowhere. Maybe if they duke it out like in a hockey game, maybe we get something solved. 
>> Steve: They're not blue or red. They're black and blue, according to those people. Meanwhile, take a look at this, were you able to see this morning's meteor shower? We told but this yesterday. This is a shot of the streak seen above the desert in israel. It takes place only a short time ago. As many as 50, as you can see, meteors per hour were said to be seen. 
>> Brian: Anyone hurt? 
>> Steve: No, they're fine. Don't know about space, though. But in space, nobody can hear you scream. Here is another look above tyler, texas. Nasa says that this year's show could be the best as the moon's glare won't interfere with visibility. That's important. Meanwhile, let's take a look at where it is raining. They probably didn't see much in texas because the cloud cover. Also back through portions of arizona, new mexico and southern california, showery there. A little bit of snow activity early on this friday up along the eastern shore of erie and ontario. 20s in the northern plains. Montana now, the chilly spot on this map with 13.

Let's start there because cincinnati and the eagles locked in a game that cincinnati had to win to keep their playoff hopes alive and they did. Turnovers were the key. Philadelphia gave this game away. Five turnovers in all. A messy sn for them where they underachieve and they're having a change in coaching. Cincinnati will face pittsburgh next week in what could be a playoff deciding game. The jets are still working in the background. Shocking comments by espn analysts about the race of an nfl rookie superstar, rgiii. Rob parker questioned the blackness of the quarterback yesterday. This was in response to rg 3 telling the media that he refused to be defined by race. Here is what parker said. 
>> This thing we all know he has a white fiance, there was a talk about he's a republican. He's not really,kay, black, he kind of does the thing, but he's not really down with the cause, he's not one of us. He's kind of black, but he's not really like the guy you really want to hang out with 'cause he's off to something. 
>> Gretchen: What? 
>> Brian: Actually got worse from there. Griffin may not want to be defined by race, but religion is important to him. Last month he told reporters the only thing he fears is god. Espn spokesperson said the comments were appropriate and i think he's on suspension. I know him, he's a great gape of the I was shocked to see those comments. Steven h. Smith says I really want no part of this conversation. 
>> Gretchen: I think I'm going to leave that story out of my son's -- 
>> Brian: It will be a little controversial. 
>> Gretchen: The josh hamton deal maybe. 
>> Brian: Five years, 125 million.

>> first of all, good morning. Thank you for having me on "the hobbit" is an incredible film directed by peter jackson. Here is the deal, it's going to be a little overwhelming for qUDIENCES BECAUSE THERE ARE SIX Different ways you can buy tickets and see "the hobbit." 2 d, 3 d, 3 d imax. He shot the film in revolutionary 48 films p sect. To keep that less geeky as possible, that means you're getting twice as manymages on screen per second, so it looks like you're looking at more real life. It looks like you're looking into a window of a real life set. It looks incredible. Peter jackson has done it again. It's beautiful marspiece. 3 d is incredible. If you want to buy the right ticket, it will be a difference of up to $6 if you want to see it in 3 dhfr. If you have a big family, skip it. 
>> Steve: All right. And that movpens today. One that opens for moms and dads on christmas day is "django unchained." 
>> Yeah. This is a quentin taxpayer tino -- terrentino movie. Not a family movie whatsoever. High in the profanity and violence element. The guy who did "pulp fiction," it deals with jamie fox. He is a former slave turned bounty hunt who are is after it to save his life. It looks incredible. It opens up on christmas day. It's quentin terrentino's seventh film and stars leonardo DiCAPRIO. Five golden globe nominations yesterday for "django unchained." 
>> Brian: Let's talk about "les miserables." Am I going to be pleased with this? 
>> Yeah. Here is the deal, they did a thing called live singing with this movie. It's very rare in musicals because most musicals, they record the music three or four months prior to going on set. So when the actors get there, they have to mime the lyrics. This time they sing live into the camera. The emotion is happening right there. And what at this was sat down with hugh jackman recently. Here is us, we live sing our interview. Here is hugh jackman and myself. 

[01:40:09]


>> Tell me the positives and negatives of singing live ?????? ?????? the negatives are if you don't have a score ?????? ?????? like during this interview ?????? ?????? we are pretty much singing the same notes all the time ???????????? 
>> Steve: Awesome. 
>> Gretchen: Very cute. 
>> We were totally singing. They do live sing. It's the most beloved musical of all time. It's been seen by over 60 million people and opens christmas day. 
>> Gretchen: Christmas day also opens "parental guidance." It's a family movie. I have a 7 and 9-year-old, can i bring them to this movie? 
>> Here is the deal with this film. This is your family movie for christmas day. It's bette midler and billy crystal, they're grandparents watching their three grandparents. There is going to be jokes thatkids are going to love. There is going to be jokes that adults love. It's like a pixar balance where kids willee a different movie and adults will also. All audiences will be able to enjoy every element of this film. It's your family movie. 
>> Steve: That's nice, it operates on a couple different levels. Before you go, that bill murray movie where he plays fdr, I've heard that it may not be up for an oscar this year. 
>> No. This year is a huge, huge race for the oscars. You have denzel washington, daniel day-lewis, a lot of different people up for oscars. He's not going to make the cut 'cause the movie is not that great. He is phenomenal in the film. But the movie is dull, it's a little boring. I found myself dozing off. But I sat down with bill murray back in toronto a couple months ago and for some reason, he noticed the suit that I was wearing had a dot on it. So he decide -- he proceeded to get up and clean my suit. We have video here. He got up and cleaned my suit. I haven't washed this suit since. 
>> Steve: From days work at a dry cleaner. 
>> Brian: I loved bill murray in "meat balls". Seemed like a very similar role. 

[01:42:11]


>> Brian, I want to apologize to you. Here comes the boom did not make my top ten this year. 
>> Gretchen: Oh! 
>> Brian: Forget it! I'm leaving! 
>> Gretchen: Wait a minute. Kevin, did you like "fred clause" years ago? 
>> You know what? It's a dekent movie. 
-- Decent. Way better than "here comes the book." 
>> Gretchen: Brian is redeemed. 
>> Steve: Kevin, thank you very much. And merry christmas. 
>> Thank you so much. Happy holidays. 
>> Gretchen: What are we going to do? We might end up doing the rest of the show without brian. 
>> Steve: He'll be back. You watch. 
>> Gretchen: The blogs will go nuts with brian storming off. They don't understand, brian. Coming up next, 100-year-old family business about to be evicted by the feds.

>> Gretchen: That graphic should be nominated for some sort award. That's nice. After nearly 100 years in business, the federal government is forcing them to shut down. We're talking about drake's bay oyster farm in california, was recently informed that they would not be allowed to renew their federal park lease. The interior department plans to turn the land into a marine wilderness area, and as a result, the oyster company and 30 employees are out of work. Kevin is the owner of drake's bay and now suing for an injunction to keep his business open. Good morning to you, kevin. 
>> Good morning, gretchen. How are you? 
>> Gretchen: Doing just fine. Thank you for getting up so early. So tell me what you've been doing for all these years, your oyster farm. 
>> The oyster farm is really kind of a main stay in our community. We produce about a third of the oysters grown in the state of california. We get about 50,000 visitors a year who love this place, been here for over eight decades and the community and our county and san francisco b area loves us. But that didn't resonate with washington, d.C. 
>> Gretchen: So the interior department wants to shut you down. Why? 
>> Well, actually a small handful of folks who are really wilderness activists who care deeply about getting people off the land, I think is the best we can tell, want to give up something to create a humanless landscape and it's a little strange because national sea shore was created as a work landscape. The oyster farm is completely surrounded by working ranches and so to remove the oyster farm from the middle of the historic ranching lands is odd. 

[01:48:07]


>> Gretchen: Aren't the oysters part of the landscape? 
>> Well, they have been for a very long time. As a matter of fact, the national academy of sciences says that drake's, where the oysters live, is probably healthier the oyster farm because of the eco system services. It's the reason that we see oysters being planted in the chesapeake and san francisco bay. 
>> Gretchen: Right. 
>> And now we have an interior department who wants to remove them. 
>> Gretchen: So let me ask you this, the board of supervisors -- let's face it, this is not a conservative part of the country. Board of supervisors, senator diane feinstein, democrat, they looked at the claims and they also became outraged at what's happening to you? 
>> As a matter of fact, that's true. Senator feinstein looked very carefully and she recognized the park service actually fabricated the science and misrepresented thscience, had the national academy look at their claims. They agreed that it was -- their words were, selectively presented and overinterpreted and misrepresented the claims. So all their claims of harm fell away, yet secretary salazar still made the decision to remove the farm. 
>> Steve: It's interesting. You're now suing. Please keep us up to date on what happens to your oyster farm in beautiful california. Thanks for your time today. 
>> Thank you.

>> Brian: It's government gone wild. The state of of virginia is heading to federal court to fight new epa regulations. The agency wants virginia to control and regulate rain water on private property. They say if the move goes through, thousands of people may lose their homes because of rain. 

[01:53:22]


>> Steve: Like in that song, who will stop the rain? The epa wants to try. Joining us is the attorney general of the great state of virginia, ken cuccinelli. 
>> Good morning. Good to see y'all. 
>> Steve: I know you were accusing the epa of massive government overreach. What exactly does the epa wan to do? 
>> Well, what they want to do is they want to force fairfax county and the virginia department of transportation, my client, to spend over $300 million to cut the flow of rain water into a creek by half. Not a mutant, mind you. They want to try and cut down on the amount of water going into the aquatain creek. The way they're trying to do it is the only way they've been able to regulate pollution. Well, water isn't a pollutant. The name of the law is kind of a give away. It's the clean water act and the idea is to keep water clean, from pollutants. So they've got it backwards here. 
>> Brian: What are they asking people who live by the river to do? To trap water? 
>> Well, they're aiming at the local and state governments, but we're going to have to take private property if we're going to fulfill this requirement. What they are trying to get us to stop, literally stop the flow of rain water. So they own road there. They don't own parkland or anything they can work with to have a pool to trap water. So we'll have to take houses. We're going to have to create pools to hold water for longer periods of time. And really one solution is taking homes by eminent domain, tearing them down and planting grass, so the water sex in instead of flows into the creek. This is really just ludicrous. This is over $300 million of probable cost between these two agencies for one creek! 

[01:55:24]


>> Steve: It's crazy. Here is what the epa says in their motion. Epa's proceeding is in harmony with the broader purpose of the clean water act, clean, the operative word there, including congress' objectives of protecting the physical and biological integrity of water and reducing the water quality impacts. That sounds like something from the epa. The key is, this is nothing new. This was going on where water was running into that creek when george washington was still running around them parts. 
>> The creek is right near mount vernon and george washington was writing in his own diary about his inability to get across this creek because of high water volume to get to the house of burgesses, we call the house much delegates -- before we were a country. So this is not a new problem. What the epa is doing, desp what you read, we all want obviously to keep our waters clean, but they are not legally allowed to do it this way. They can not try to force the state and local governments to get in the way of rain water. 
>> Steve: You're absolutely right. It sounds like a gigantic overreach by the epa. We hope you'll keep us updated on what happens. 
>> Brian: Every time it rains, we'll think of you. 
>> Good, thank you. 
>> Brian: By the way, 1799, george washington died on this very day. 
>> Steve: Thank you very much. Meanwhile, do your holiday pictures all turn out dark or blurry? Don't go to a professional. We've got fixes for you free in the next hour.

>>> The taliban's goal is kill americans. American troops are being told now to play nicey nice with them. Reports that a new draft of the army handbook says our troops ignorance of culture have led to attacks. Troops should not speak out against the taliban or defends women's rights.

>> It became clear to me, and that's why I sat on this couch a couple weeks ago, that her ship sailed. A co things happened, number one, there was an attack culture in washington when it becomes clear that the entire establishment is going against you. Look what happened to my old pal, the former attorney general, alberto gonzalez. I had to meet him secretly. It became clear that everybody was piling on. In the case of ambassador rice when they started digging up what happened in africa in 1998 in the tanzania and kenya embase bombings when she was a relatively low level person, she got piled on for that. When they started anding the finances of ambassador rice and her husband who are quite wealthy and started pouring into every detail and she was not being defended by the administration. I mean, the president was making all the right sounds, if you want to pick on anyone, pick on me, thumping his chest and alt rest. But the fact is, she had no group appointed by the obama administration to defend her against these attacks. But the two northeastern nod rate republicans, susan collins and kelly ayotte, joined the angry white men, you know, GRAHAM and McCain, and then it couldn't be a male-female issue against this poor beleaguered black woman -- 
>> Brian: You don't believe that. 
>> Gretchen: Angry old white men? 

[02:08:03]


>> I am speaking expansesively and metaphorly and for effect here. But it became clear she couldn't be the beleaguered damsel in distress. The poor black embattled ambassador. It became clear that she was the minimum price. I have to say one more sentence. She was the minimum price to pay for the administration's disassembling on the facts and circumstances of the benghazi attack. She was going to be the minimum price that the democrats that the obama administration had to pay for that clear offense just as I believe the tax hike on the 2% is the minimum price the republicans have to pay for losinghe election. In washington you make minimum prices. She's the sacrificial lamb. 
>> Gretchen: I totally agree with you, it was the senator from maine, tthat was -- collins, that was it, because she is the moderate. If you couldn't get the moderates on board. But here is my question for you, does this mean that benghazi goes away now? Because now there is all this talk that hillary clinton, she was going to testify december 20, now she may not because there may be this bombshell report that's coming out and maybe hillary clinton wants to run for president. 
>> That's a lot there. Remember munich, 1972, the israeli athletes are massacred by the palestinian radicals in the olympic games. All right. Then you have for the next decade the israelis hunting down the perpetrators and killing the people who perpetrated the mass murder of the israeli athletes. That's the armed forces approach, or the sending seal team 6 against osama bin laden. That's the military approach. What's happening in benghazi is pretty clear to me. It's a law enforcement approach. We busted them at the airport in turkey. In cairo the cops there apprehended one of the alleged masterminds of the benghazi attacks. It's clear there will be a law enforcement approach to catching the perpetrators of the benghazi attacks. Not a military approach. Now, I believe in terms of the hillary clinton testimony, they can now use that secretive, undercover, law enforcement approach as the reason they do not publicly disclose what they're doing to apprehend the perpetrators -- but also may be true. 

[02:10:25]


>> Brian: The law enforcement approach has fallen very short. 
>> We have a half dozen in custody. 
>> We had a senator who had to get the f.B.I. In to question those captured would be kill increase tunisia. There has been no pursuit by our government to question these guys. 
>> The one thing we can't do, it's clear to everybody, is have a drone go over the militia headquarters in benghazi and bomb them because it's too small there. You don't know, you know, this guy from -- the perpetrator from his cousin. It's a very difficult situation. I think that precise surgical stuff is maybe the way to do it. 
>> Gretchen: We have to get on to another state department issue, the former marine served in iraq and afghanistan, he's going to costa rica. He stops in mexico, registers his gu before he goes across the border. Now he's been in jail since august. He's chained to a bed. Should the state department be working harder to get him home? 
>> First of all, uniquely i covered mexican prisons. I've been inside the most notorious. I've never seen an inmate chain to do a bed. I'm not saying that the congresswoman is not being, you know, accurate here. I'm just saying in my experience, have never seen it. Remember also that the mexicans are extremely ticked off about fast and furious and all the guns we poured into that country. They're -- 
>> Steve: But to chain him to a bed? 
>> We don't know that's that true. Secondly, reer they are very, very sensitive about their own sereignty and the fact that american guns have been pouring into the country. I don't understand. That doesn't in any way say this man shoulde behind bars because I think it is an atrocity. I don't know why our customs and border protection people didn't warn him. He's bringing a shotgun into mexico, say, hey, dude, they're going to bust you 100 feet from here! 
>> Gretchen: We were the first ones to break this story. We interviewed the mom a couple days ago. She decided to go public because she's been speak to go her son in prison and he's told her he's chained to a bed. And he's fearing now for his life. This takes immense courage for the family to come forward and they need the help from our country to bring him home. 

[02:12:34]


>> Well, I think we can all suggest to the mexicans no harm, no foul. What's the problem here? He apologizes. He was bringing a shotgun, an old shotgun on a surfing expedition. However, and he had post vietnam stress, post iraq, afghanistan stress and all that. I think they can cut us some slack and I think the noise and the fury on this side will be helpful. 
>> Brian: I look forward to you covering this show. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> Brian: When are you going to air it? 
>> The weekend, on saturday night. Bright future. The senate. 
>> Brian: It's a lot of money. A million dollars.

>> I'll flee a heartbeat.

>> Gretchen: Federal reserve chair ben bernanke says easy money is good for the economy. So let's keep it coming. Keep printing it. But will pushing interest rates as low as they can go eventually backfire? 
>> Brian: James freeman is assistant editorial editor for the "wall street journal." James, he is going to buy $85 billion worth of debt every month until our unemployment gets down to 6.5%. Good or bad? 
>> I think we've been trying this for five years basically, printing money to see if that's how you grow an economy. Sort of like the old "saturday night live" skit with christopher walken. He only knows how to say is more cow bell. All ben bernanke seems to know how to respond to the economy is more money creation. I think what we've learned these five years, we still have slow growth, high unemployment is you can't print money. You can't print your way out of a bad economy. You need to actually worry about growth and how you get people to work and invest. 
>> Gretchen: So if you were advising ben bernanke, what would you tell him to do instead? 
>> Just focus on stable prices. Don't try to print money as a way to offset all the other mistakes they're making in washington. You just focus on a stable dollar, people can depend on it, and then what you do is you force the government, the rest the government, to finally get spending in check, get a tax and regulatory policy that allows businesses to grow. 
>> Brian: By him printing money you just told us, he's keeping the pressure off the president to cut spending. 
>> Yeah. Because right now, the government is able to finance this massive debt at about 2% a year. The pressure is not on them. If interest rates went do sort of normal, reasonable levels, the government all of a sudden, to finance the debt, would be spending what we spend on medicare every year. It would force responsibility. Right now all of this credit basically to the government allows them to run huge debt. 

[02:18:53]


>> Gretchen: We look at what is happening in greece where they can not print their own money and they have a massive spending problem. You have rioting in the street. So in a way, in america, since you can print the money, it's just kicking the can down the road, right? 
>> I think people realize intuitively, this can't work forever. The biggest buyer now of our long-term bonds is the federal reserve. In other words, the government itself is printing money to loan to the government. This can only work for some period of time before the rest of the world says, we no longer trust thu.S. Dollar. We don't givt the credibility we used to. 
>> Brian: People outside our windows don't trust the u.S. Dollar. That's the scary part. 
>> People have been excited about the rise in home prices. It's just the long-term, this is not how you grow an economy. This is not how you thrive. 
>> Gretchen: All right. You heard it from james freeman, with the "wall street journal." Thanks. 
>> Thanks. 
>> Brian:19 minutes after the hour. 
>> Gretchen: No love for jesus? A jesus look a tossed right out of a sports stadium and wait until you hear why. 
>> Brian: Do your christmas photos always turn out like this? There are simple things you can do to make sure your photos are picture perfect. We'll share the secrets, if you promise to keep it a secret. me to take a centrum silver multivitamin every day. I told him, sure. Can't hurt, right? Then I heard this news about a multivitamin study looking at long-term health benefits for men over 50. The one they used in that study... Centrum silver. That's what I take. My doctor! He knows his stuff. 

[02:21:13]


[ Male Announcer ] CENTRUM. The most recommended. Most preferred. Most studied. Centrum, always your most complete. 

[02:23:33]


>> Gretchen:23 minutes after the top of the hour. Quick headlines. Could jenny rivera have avoided death? It turns out the mexican american singer made a last minute decision to take that deadly plane ride. She was offered a room for the night, but she decided to take off to her next destination instead. 
>>> And the show won't be going on at an elementary school in massachusetts. The traditional holiday concert atdan jackson elementary in mansfield, guess what? It's been canceled. Parents complained that last year's performance was too religious. A speech on anti-bullying will take the place of the concert in january. Christmas? Bullying? Hh, I don't see a lot of similarities. But that's what they'll be doing. Steve? 
>> Steve: It is. Thanks. Don't spend hundreds of dollars on professional holiday pictures this year. We're going to show you how you can actually take those same perfect pictures with your own camera. The president of unique photo in new jersey joins us now. 
>> Great to be here. 
>> Steve: We're going to take a lot of pictures over the next couple of weeks and the average person, whether they got the fancy single lens reflex camera or point and shoot, they put it on automatic and they just take all their pictures. That winds up with a picture like this where it's it's a family action shot, but the girl is a little dark. You can't really see what's going on of the how do we fix that? 
>> Taking pictures, is what we t unique photo. We really try to get to you work on turning the camera off the automatic mode. Get into the manual modes on the camera. In a ticket like that, the camera senses the light in the area and doesn't realize that you really want a picture of the lovely young girl that's there. So what you do is you put the camera in a program mode, rotate the dial. You force the flash to fire in the camera. Called fill flash. 
>> Steve: The thing with -- next thing you know, when you look at that, you can actually see the detail on the girl. That's beautiful picture. Let's come down to the next one. A lot of people are going to be playing in the snow, but I have gotten this picture many, many times, shooting the kids, playing in the snow on automatic. It seems everybody is a little blurry. 

[02:25:37]


>> Yeah. This is one of those things where you want to put the camera in its shutter priority mode because the camera will sense the bright snow and bright light and won't pick a shutter speed which is fast enough. Then when the children jump and the snow go up in the air, they blur. So you have to force the shut to go speed faster. YOU'LL SHOOT AT 1,000th OF A Secretary. 
>> Steve: If I don't know how it do the priority mode, can I go into, in miami camera has icons, I can switch around? 
>> Absolutely. A lot of the cameras today have port trait mode, sports mode, all sorts of things like that. They adjust the cameras really, really well. They coo a pretty good job. 
>> Steve: Now, this would be in portrait mode. It is, well, nicely lighted. But it's kind of awkward, isn't it? 
>> This is a sophisticated picture taking circumstance. We encourage you to -- 
>> that's holding a glass. Maybe not the appropriate dress. The kid is wearing kind of a nutty hat. 
>> One of the things you want -- as a photographer, is you want to control your subjects a little bit. You want to make sure that they don't do things that they want to be photographed in 'cause those photographs last forever. I'm not sure that the person in that photograph wants to have a glass in her hand or wants to look like that. The framing of the picture, really affects it. 
>> Steve: This is the kind of picture you would like a portrait to wind up at. There seems to be a different dynamic. What did the photographer tell these people that they didn't tell the others? 
>> He tried to get the expressions uniform. They're all smiling, they're all dressed the same. He's framed it right. We're not cutting anybody's heads off. So you can see the picture provides a much more happy memory of what's begun on. They don't look so happy in that picture. 
>> Steve: No kidding. Meanwhile, if you are like clark griswold, spend 25 days getting ready for christmas, you have all your lights on your house and you take that picture, it's a little dark. It probably should look more like this. How do you get this instead of that? 
>> Okay. Couple of things you need to do th. First of all, you need a timed exposure. One that's longer than what the camera would set up. In this case, the camera focuses on the lights on the house, so it fools the camera into thinking the picture is brighter. So you get a nice canon camera like that and a tri pod. Set it up. You set it into that shutter priority mode and you force the shutter to stay open a little longer, it's called dragging the shutter. You'll get a much more composed picture. The shutter speed, you'll play with it a little bit. The other trick in that picture, and this is a really, really good tip, is that this picture is taken sort of, you have your christmas dinner, you go out and feeling good and go out and take a picture of your lights. This is taken right after sundown. 

[02:28:10]


>> Steve: That's good. That way you can see the blue sky. 
>> That's correct. 
>> Steve: I know the little point and shoots can be 50, 60 bucks. If you want a nice camera, low end, to take fantastic pictures, how much? 700, $800 range, which it allows to you take a variety of pictures. Is is a more professional, the panasonic gh 3, a $1,300 camera. 
>> Steve: Oh, boy. Unique photos, get the big camera show. 
>> New jersey, largest camera store. We have an amazing camera show. New jersey camera show, 50 vendors. 40 free classes this weekend. Come on down to fairfield, new jersey, we'd love to see you. 
>> Steve: Matt, good job. 
>> Thank you.

>> Retirement speech yesterday, senator joe lieberman said when he first joined the senate, blackberry was a fruit and tweeting was something birds did. 
[ Laughter ] it's funny. It got annoying when he kept giving more examples for six more hours. Going on-line with what he did at the supermarket. Google is what you did when a pretty girl walks by! 
[ Laughter ] 
>> Gretchen: Oh, my gosh. 
>> Steve: He didn't stop. He had it going. 
>> Gretchen: There is something about the fruit with the things, when I first got one, my daughter said to me, mama, she said, when you going to put down the blueberry? 
>> Brian: Yeah. 
>> Gretchen: She didn't want me to get an iphone. That was a very strong indication that mommy didn't pick up the blueberry very often when at home with kids. 
>> Steve: Remember the guy who sang doe. ?????? Deo ?????? ?????? . 
>> Is that the only song did he? 
>> Steve: That was his big song he lived off ever since. Harry, pictured there, stopped by -- who is he with there? Stopped by the al sharpton show over on msdnc a couple of days ago and he was talking a little bit about what the president should do with all those people who on the right, oppose some of his policies. Here is what mr. Deo said. 
>> Fascinates me is that millions of americans expressing their desire to stiff -- that there should be this lingering infestation of really corrupt people who sit trying to dismantle the wishes of the people, the mandate that has been given to barak obama, and i don't know what more they want. The only thing left for obama to do is to be like a third world dictator and throw these guys in jail. 

[02:35:22]


>> Steve: Throw them in jail. 
>> Brian: If the president gets relie detectorred, he should be able to do whatever he wants. Did he feel the same way about george bush when he won bay wider margin? What about all the democrats that got in his way? Should they have been jailed? 
>> Steve: Speak of dictators, he's known a few. Remember in 2006 he actually went down to visit chavez in venezuela and referred to george w. Bush as the biggest tryst in the world. 
>> Brian: That was fantastic. 
>> Gretchen: Here is a different quote where he called homeland security the gestapo. Citizens are having their rights suspended. You can be arrested and not charged, you can be arrested and have no right to counsel. 
>> Brian: You mean those charges that -- those acts, like the patriot act that president obama left in place? That's the period of america? Here he is saying something else. Praising a cop killer. Listen. 
>> Such is the case with jamal, he is not guilty of the crime for which he has been charged. He did not commit the crimes. He has been charged with. Those who prosecuted him know that. If it's up to us, citizens the world who care about justice to stay the course, to make sure that he is released. 
>> Steve: Freedom of speech, harry belafonte. 
>> Gretchen: Now to your headline this morning. One of the only living medal of honor recipients recovering from a brutal attack. Details on the attack on dakota myer. We know an 18-year-old has been charged with assault. He was award the military highest horn by president obama last year. He's credited with saving the lives of 13 americans and 23 afghan soldiers during a fire fight in 2009. 
>> Steve: She's accused of drunk driving in maine. But sally struthers says she didn't do it. Oh, gloria. Her lawyer has entered a not guilty plea for her. She was arrested in september in maine where she frequently plays a role in the musical "nine to five." She's scheduled to be back in court in february. 

[02:37:30]


>> Brian: I didn't know "nine to five" was playing in maine. A new study finds children born with a c section are more likely to eat fatty foods and become overweight later in life. Researchers looked at nine studies of over 200,000 people and found when born by c section, the babies were 33% more likely to become heavy. But they say this doesn't mean that a caesarean caused the babies to gain weight. It's easy on the baby through a c section. 
>> Gretchen: Really? 
>> Brian: Yeah. Easier on the baby. 
>> Gretchen: On the mom, different story. But let's not get into that right now. A jesus look alike tossed out of a sporting event in england. All right. So you see that image there. That's nathan grinnedle being escorted by police. Thousands of people at the professional darts tournament began chanting jesus, jesus! When they saw him. Organizers said it was too distracting to the players, so they asked him to leave? Maybe he should have stuck around for a little inspiration for the dart throwing. Exactly! They could have played this music and maybe they would have done better. 
>> Brian: When jesus does come back, should we greet him with a chant? 
>> Gretchen: You're not going to know. You need to go to confession a few more times before that's going to happen. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> Steve: With a police escort. 
>> Brian: It's dangerous. Could cause a riot. 
>> Steve: Those darts guys, they've got to concentrate, please. 
>> Brian: Please, jesus. Enough. 
>> Steve: All right. Straight ahead on this friday, just in time for christmas, and the holidays, workers at one of the nation's busiest airports threatening to go on strike. Late breaking details that could slow you down as you they had grandma's house. 
>> Gretchen: Then no such thing as a private conversation on some buses because big brother is listening. Is that even legal? Peter johnson, jr. Next. First, shear alisyn with what's on tap for the weekend. Hi, you're on the bike? 

[02:39:40]


>> You know how much I love working out. 
>> Gretchen: No, you don't. 
>> And I'm hosting the 9:00 a.M. Show today. So I think I'm going to do it from here. Kill two birds with one stone. On the weekend, here is what's coming up.

[02:43:32]


>> Brian: Hundreds of private security workers in new york jfk airport threatening to walk off the job just days before christmas if their demands aren't met. Now more with what this could mean for holiday travelers. Lydia? 
>> Good morning, brian. Exactly right. This strike could happen five days before christmas. 300 workers could go on strike. These private security guards, they are nonunionized workers. Right now we still don't know exactly what this could all mean for travelers. They have very important jobs here at jfk airport. They actually control the traffic here in front of the terminals. They also guard alarm doors. So if this could happen, if this does happen, a lot of travelers we spoke to are extremely worried about it. Again, they are nonunion workers, but they are being backed by one of the largest unions in the country. For now, that's the latest here at jfk. Brian, back to you. 
>> Brian: Thank you very much. Gretch? 
>> Gretchen: Next time you ride the bus, be careful what you say because big brother may be listening to you on the bus? Government officials are installing audio surveillance on public buses across the country, giving them the ability to record any and all conversations. So should public safety trump your right to privacy? Ginning -- joining me, peter johnson, jr. Why are they doing this? 
>> I guess there have been crimes on these buss and there have been issues with the bus drivers and some of the unions are saying, listen, you got to protect our bus drivers. What's happening, though, is that your right to privacy, limited as it is in public situations, is going to go out the window in places like san francisco on the trolley cars, durham, eugene, oregon, columbus, hartford, athens, other cities around the country. The d.H.S., Department of homeland security, and city and local and state authorities are putting money together to tape your conversations on buses. 
>> Gretchen: Why can't they put up a camera to help us if they're worried about the bus driver? 

[02:45:38]


>> You're right. They have cameras. Now they're integrating audio. Now they're integrating that it can go out on the web to a depot somewhere else, to a police facility, to someone that can listen to your conversation with your children on the bus. You're talking about school, you're talking about going to see a relative, going to see your mother, and all of that stuff becomes part of the ether. 
>> Gretchen: I'm glad you didn't say I was talking to my husband about date night. 
>> I didn't say that at all. 
>> Gretchen: That might be more private. 
>> It would be private, but all of that is private. So now we have a situation in this country where yes, there should be some limitations on what goes on in public facilities. We see in airports. We see it in certain cabs where they have cameras. But now our conversation will be monitored. 
>> Gretchen: Is it legal? 
>> In the end it may be legal. In the end, the government may find a way around the fourth amendment because they're saying, we're giving you warning that we're listening to you. What kind of country is it where we say, it's okay to listen to you because we've told you that we're going to listen to you? How far is the standard being deviated that we're saying, yeah, we can accept that? What do we accept next? In libraries, in doctors' offices? Do we accept it in the studios and in the offices of fox news or nbc news? Where do we limit this in terms of eavesdropping? And to say, okay, we need to protect our bus drivers. I agree. But at what cost do we do that? Is video enough, as you say? 
>> Gretchen: Let me ask you this, what kind of warning -- because for example, I'm thinking of drug warnings. They say them really, really FAST AT THEnd OF TV Commercials or really, really tiny fine print. What kind of warning -- 
>> there are signs up on these buses that say your conversation is going to be listened to. But should we sit in silence on the bus? The bus, which is the hallmark of civil rights in this country, remember ros parks? You can go to a museum in dear born, michigan and see that bus, about going to the back of the bus. Do we all now sit silently on the bus because we're afraid that our government is listening to our conversations about groceries, about family problems, about date night, about who we're voting for for president, about what we intend to be doing? Fine. If there is a terrorist risk, then there is a notch in the law to allow that. But to have americans eavesdropped on on a daily basis going from work to work,o church, from church, that, i think, is a real, real problem that we've got to grapple with it. The government may find an excuse for it. But I don't find any excuse for it at all.

>> Greretchen: Welcome back. Have you ever used the excuse, i have too much work to work out? Thanks to our next guest, the excuses no longer is a good one? 
>> Brian: Who is that next guest? I believe it's ryan moore, the ceo and fnder of rebo innovation. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Gretchen: He's here to show you how you can work out from the comfort of your own desk. How did you come up with the idea? 
>> Close friend of ours passed away from cancer. We were inspired to join 100-mile, three mountain bicycle challenge. But we needed to train. We were having a hard time running our business, getting our work done while cycling indoors and training. So we looked for a device that would allow to us mount or computers, but nothing existed, so we made our own. After training for the event exclusively using what we made and riding it, we thought hey, this is a great idea. It really works. 
>> Steve: It really does work. And brian was talking earlier about how when he works out at the gym, he's always reading. But what I've noticed is, and this is great because you've got a laptop here -- is it's often shaky. So it's hard to read. If you come up with this desk thing, foamy and I'm sure nasa helped you develop it, the computer stays absolutely rock steady while you're going as fast as you possibly can. 
>> Right. We designed this so it was a low intensity. Had a short throne so it wouldn't shake the computer too much. 
>> Brian: I've been feeling the quads of a lot of the people on our staff, so I said we need to firm up. Let's see if we're trying to build some thigh power. Go to the news room as well where the workouts are aplenty. 
>> Gretchen: Look, yes. We force our people to sweat while they actually put together the show. Actually sometimes there sweating without working out. 
>> Brian: This thing folds up quick, right? How does it fold up? 
>> You just push it together and it snaps. Just like that. Has wheels. You can transport it, move it around. Weighs 35 pounds. 
>> Steve: One of the great things is you've got a mileage thing on it so you can figure out at the end of the day how far you've gone. I know you've sold so far, and they sell for $250. You can get them on amazon. You've sold 6,000 so far. Has anybody e-mailed you and said okay, today at work I went 179 miles, or what the biggest number is? 

[02:55:13]


>> We get a lot of reports of that. People will clock 200, 300 miles over the course of a month. We love to hear that. Some people are competing using that. 
>> Brian: I've had in. I stick this on the bike and if it goes over the lip, you have to be -- have the reflexes of a wide receiver in order to stop it. That's a good j. Again, the entrepreneurial spirit mixing with necessity. 
>> Yes. We love to hear the most is when people write us back after they used for a year. They say I'm dealing with my multiple sclerosis or met a weight loss goal. We met a gentleman while studying for his bar exam used this for 90 minute acidy for 12 months and lost 45 pounds and is continuing to meet his goals. 
>> Steve: You know, one of the special things is you've got the softest bike seat ever. A lot of those bike seats are hard and doesn't feel good back there. This is great. It's like a cloud. 
>> Brian: It's a great butt cushion is what you're saying. 
>> Steve: It's like a cloud. 
>> Brian: Okay, fine. 
>> Gretchen: I wish I could try it out, but I wore a skirt today. Okay. So wait. It's $249? And it's reinnovation. 
>> It's called the fit desk. 
>> Gretchen: We'll be right back. 
>> Steve: Crew, go faster! Fast er! Ring. Progresso. Your soups are . . Tomato basil. Potato with bacon. We've got a lotta empty cans.

=======================================================

>> We teach classes throughout the region. We teach them at the barnes foundation, the academy of fine arts, the local arts centers, we teach children in the school district. If we can teach 5-year-old and 8-year-old appreciation, we can teach anyone. We can teach prisoners. 
>> It is interesting to take a journey into a photograph. Photographs are still. Poetry is moving in time. When I look at the iges, they are moving in my head. I take these journeys into the work. 
>> The students who come here are high achievers. They do 1illion different things. Every student I meet, whether they are an economics major, a science major, a political major, they are an artist in some way. ?????? 
>> when my husband and I went to the barnes foundation in 1969, we were put in front of a painting and it was a girl eating. We were asked, "what do you think?" So few hands went up. Slowly, they came down with ms. De mazia saying, "no, no, no, no. It is not a girl eating." What you see is not paint on canvas. It was unbelievable how, in one moment, I really saw what was in front of me. I got addicted that day. 

[00:02:26]


>> The work of the barnes foundation has always been gallant. We continue to be gallant. It is succinctly described as " an experiment in education." 
>> John dewey and his pragmatist approach to aesthetics was the first director of education the barnes foundation. We developed this approach to understanding art. Violette de mazia was the person who put it into practice in the classroom. 
>> It is an art appreciation. We try to lead you to see. 
>> We teach a very similar approach to what de mazia taught for 63 years at the barnes foundation. 
>> Violette de mazia enrolled in the classes at the barnes foundation. She found that she was an incredibly adept student. She could not only catch on to the ideas quickly and understand them, but she could then articulate them to others, which is the sign of a great teacher. 
>> She was hired as a teacher in 1925 and became director of education in 1951. 
>> We want students who are interested, not only to belong and to report and to come with their friends, but interested to find out what these things are that other human beings created. 

[00:04:28]


>> She was an enormous force, an enormous personality, and the driving force at the barnes foundation for decades and decades. 
>> She was incredible. She was a small, a petite woman. 
-- A small, petite woman with fluffy hair. She had a tiny, little voice. She became so animated when she started speaking about what she knew. She devoted her whole time to the education program. 
>> All of those associated with him have worked for what we have and what we can offer to students. We intend to continue to work. 
>> They were an intellectual partnership. They really got into sharing the experience of looking and seeing paintings. 
>> There would have a topic. They would travel to europe and go to as many art institutions as they could possibly manage and write as many notes as they could possibly manage and they would work on drafts. There were multiple drafts of every book that the barnes foundation published. It must have been a brutal piece of work. The french primitives were violette de mazia's baby. She was responsible for that, although everyone contributed. 
>> Two and two makes four. This is a wonderful picture. Teaches us nothing unless you are taught to verify that two and two do make four and that the picture is a fine picture. 

[00:06:31]


>> Her classes were performance. She would dress in a flowery dress that would somehow tie into the main point of the class or the main painting they were working with. She would put a flower in her hair that was somehow related to the topic of the class. She wore rings that jangled and she had an eye problem, irritation, so she always wore dark glasses, which added to her mystery. 
>> They do not do this any longer, but they would move paintings for each class. 
>> Paintings were taken off the wall and put on easels. That was another rare treat. 
>> You have 60, 80 people in the main gallery. 
>> Classes were from 1:00 until 4:30. 
>> Halfway through the class, you would turn your chair around and look at the paintings on the other side. 
>> You would turn your chair around and that was the only break that we got. 
>> It was an objective approach. 
>> What does the line do in the painting? Is it throughout the painting? Does it in close volumes or is it free-falling? 
-- Free-flowing? The same goes on for volume and color and space. It is a total adventure. 
>> On average, studies have shown that people spend 10 seconds reading the blurb under the painting and three seconds looking at the painting. What does the blur tell you? Who the people are and what is representing -- what is represented in the painting. But it does not tell you anything about the painting. This approach is an objective approach and it helps you understand what the quality is in the painting. 

[00:08:35]


>> Dr. Barnes and miss de mazia felt that art was connected to every facet of life, because it is. It is just that simple. You do not realize how you often look what you do not see. 
-- Look but you do not see. It is appreciating what is all around you. Is there for you to discover and appreciate it. You go from one delight to another delight. 
>> We want to take it further into yourself. We want you to to it with your mind. We want you to digest it so that it becomes yours. That is through applying the points, the principles illustrated to your own problems, your activities, your work in any field. One thing that we emphasize is that art and life are absolutely inseparable. 
>> Her knowledge of art was unbelievable. Her understanding of art was mind blowing. It was the most unbelievable experience. Her performances, her education program, taught me how to see. 
>> Most of the students say, she changed my life. I can see some much more than i saw before. She gave us a great gift. ?????? 

[00:10:44]


>> it is a serious question about how one can get by as a poet. There are so many different paths. I love teaching. That is the path that I have found. For me, it is the larger question of, what is the work of poetry? If you are a poet, what is the work that you are doing? For me, the work is to listen, to honor mystery, to honor stories. ?????? to explore things that I know and imagining back into a place that has vanished in the city. Part of that came in this book with will brown, a photographer from philadelphia. The photographs were taken in and 1970's and the poems were written in 2010-2011. The photographs are from the early 1960's and 1950's, the 1940's and 1930's. Will have this box of photographs and we were looking through them. One was of this cadillac. I said, "these are not just abstract pictures." He knows the people in the photographs. I said, "tell me about that." He said, that is the palm -- he said, "that is the poem. There is a story there. Good luck finding it." Not all of the photographs move in mysterious ways like I felt will's photographs moving. 

[00:12:57]


>> I had an idea about doing a collaboration and thought it would be interesting to work with tom. I built a house in 1965, or something like that. Since then, that has been my neighborhood. 
>> The fact that he was taking pictures on sunday mornings when the streets are clear, that gives it a documentary field. There is something interesting about those empty streets that creates another atmosphere. There is a reality that is happening in the streets. There is a new reality happening in the photograph itself. The title of our book is called "the picture that remains." That is a poem that is based on a number of his photographs. It was not just about one, but was referencing sevel different photographs and images. A lot of his imagery feels like I can not necessarily put my finger on what it is but I know is there. I wanted to honor that in my pawns. 
-- In my poems. I took a journey back to a vanished past and imagined into that past. The poem is not illustrating this photograph. They are parallel works. 
>> This is so special. 
>> It is less directly commenting on the photograph and more in a whole nother area. I like that the column -- the poem has its own world and the photograph has its own world. Together, there is an overlap. It is enough for it to work. A week in the childhood of w.C. Fields. The ec field played in the fields of cuyahoga. Back then, no one ever said philadelphia. As a child, fields was always playing. One was juggling, the other he called it, "the days of the week." Wednesday was a box car that carried raw sugar and everybody had the sugar to prove it. Thursday it was a visit from men in sweaty suits. Friday was cigarettes and a mess of money on the streets. Saturday it was a hair cut from john the barber. The whole day was a half day and a bucket of bleach. Saturday night was a whole other day. Mothers sharpening their knives, and girls with curls, AND ALWAYS THE SINGING AND TxE Fighting. The police could do nothing. Sun there was another country, a bath, an open window, a moment of silence. But only a moment. Looking at a picture of the old dutch settlement, the drawing was too small to be this neighborhood. His father told him that it was, back before any of them were born. It is that honoring of the mystery that keeps me coming back and interested in writing things that I do not have full access to myself. I do not know what I am looking at, but I know I am seeing something. That is part of the generative place of poetry for me. It is the language that goes into the poem "colleen," which i wrote. It is about my sister and intellectual difference. She does not see it. How do you write a palm engaging someone -- a poem engaging someone you have never had a conversation with but you have known your whole life? How do you make it on this, real, provocative, strange? Language fails, and that is where the photograph comes in. 

[00:17:31]


>> You do not care for prices. You knew -- you know exactly what you would like and where to find it. 
>> The whole family has dreams. I, too, look for your language, though I sometimes fear what you probably said. All of the words that I put into your mouth. To me, you say nothing and i write it down as fast as I can. 
[Applause] 
>> the whole point is people, whether they have disabilities or not, how specific they all are and how unbelievable. It never ends. We do not even know what we do not know. For me, poetry is a journey. I am discovering who I am, who my sister is, this city that i live, all of those things. Words can transcend even time and space. They interface with the imagination. We can go back to some neighborhood where w fees -- were w.C. Fields lived as a kid and take the transformation of his imagination and feel transported. That is the work of poetry, if you get it right, to frame whatever it is. You do not even know. You discovered it while you are writing. 
-- You discover it while you are writing. ?????? 
>> over the course of princeton's very long and illustrious history, it might not have been a university that was especially well known for the arts. Any student who comes here and is an artist participates in the arts. Also, the hundreds of students who experience performance or the arts from a spectator position. The arts play an incredibly important role here at princeton. The word atelier -- the word "atelier" means workshop. It was a program founded when she worked as a librettist. Her work was deeply affected by being in the room with composers and musicians. Hearing and seeing how they worked, and the languages of their art for all -- of their art forms. That inspired her to create the princeton atelier, a program where artists from different disciplines come together to create a new work in the context of princeton students. We want the students to have a different experience based on each atelier. This one came about thanks to collaborators are around princeton. Someone, one day, said, "let's do an evening of original, 1-act opera as. Let's let this evening of performance be the culmination of a few years of classes." "Leer on the second fllor" is a revision of the king lear story. The professional artists are anthony davis and allied haven 

[00:21:20]


-- and alan. They are a well-known team. Anthony is a playwright and allen is a composer. It is a very beautiful, sad, a contemporary piece with a woman near a scientist at the center. She is suffering from early onset dementia. 
>> We wanted the female leer to be aware of the condition. For her to have an advanced illness in her early 60's, it seems to be a wonderful paradox of being a victim of for on study. 
>> Her three daughters are conspiring with or against her, mostly against her, in some way. 
>> The three young women who play the daughters are all students at princeton. They are wonderful. It is a stress for them to do these characters about strained relationships with mothers. It draws on a lot of things. 
>> We have an amazing soprano. She is singing the lead. We have other professional singers singing the adult roles. It is an incredible experience for the student performers, to be onstage with professional opera singers, to create an amazing show. 
[Applause] 
>> "offcourt" is a collaboration between two students. Lily and james. This is her first form -- foray into writing a libretto. 
>> I am doing creative writing and theater. I did an atelier with composers and writers. This is how I ended up doing this. 

[00:23:30]


>> I had no idea I want to be a music major. I tried all sorts of things. It hit me at the end of sophomore year, I really love composing music. 
>> I think they're calling it a micro-opera. It is a short opera about a woman who finds herself married to a man who wants to be a member of a very fancy tennis club. They go to the tennis club and everybody is dressed in white. She is disgusted by all of the who's who's who just want to be there to watch tennis. They are drinking martinis and are watching tennis. She wants no part of it. Her husband sees that this is the place to be. 
>> We were talking about whether we wanted the language to be more poetic or colloquial. We tried to find some balance between that. It sounds absurd to say some things in an opera -- ?????? what's going on ? ?????? ?????? sometimes, it is jarring and upsetting. We actually argue about every word. 
>> She is really the key. I have written draft after draft. 
>> And james adds so much to the words. We have become friends doing this. 
>> "Weakness," written by barbara white. She wrote the piece in collaboration with kate, a choreographer. Students are members of a chorus. It is a fascinating collaboration because dance is intricately a part of the opera. 
>> We started working together about two years ago, talking about how things might look. Even things like the casting, how many dancers, what the movement would be like. I invited her to come in on the music as well it is a very intensive collaboration. 

[00:25:44]


>> The thing that is a departure for me is to think about in having character, which is a bit of a theatrical way of thinking about presence on stage. Contemporary dancers are thinking a great deal about energetics, animal impulses, visceral ideas that come through the body, the kinds of things that we cannot articulate in language. 
>> Based on a celtic myth of a woman who is deeply in love with a man, he is called away, and then he claims an impetuous outburst. 
>> My wife can run faster than the king's horses! ?????? 
>> she will race my horses. 
>> She does run faster than the king's horses and then she dies. 
>> The thing that is fascinating about opera is you have these disparate mediums communicating which it -- communicating with each other. There is the way of trying to comprehend each other along the way. 
>> It is important to us that the professionals grow from their experience and that they are not simply coming to teach students. The other thing we hope artists get out of it is, what happens when you learn from bright young people who do not know anything about your art form? It is an old adage that you never learn as well as when you have to teach something yourself. We want the students to have a different experience based on every atelier. We want them to see themselves as brave collaborators. Sometimes, they are not seen as risk takers. We want them to take risks. There are no ways to fail, as long as they are trying to do something new. That is our goal, to bring the arts to every single princeton student. This is an incredibly artsy university. ?????? 

[00:27:56]


>> it is so exciting to work with younger people. It is really great. I mean, I do not want to work with somebody my age. 
[Laughter] 
>> I like working with james. 
>> It really paid off. It has been fun. I have learned a lot. A lot. 
>> A lot is important to us. 
-- Art is important to us. It offers cues and clues to what can and should be the art of living. Violette de mazia, 1899-1988.

[knock on door] There's something you both need to see. The radio's working. The pattern's repeating on a loop. It's like it's some kind of morse code, but it's not morse code, or at least it's not any morse code that I've ever heard. So do you think maybe it's donald? Why now? How would he even know that we're still alive? Well, he left the radio for walter for a reason, and he left it on that frequency for a reason. Maybe he's trying to contact us. Well, yeah, him or anybody else with a shortwave radio. The only way to know for sure 

[00:04:39]

Carla warren is here. My old dead lab assistant is here to haunt me. The one that was burned in the fire. The radio is picking up a transmission. We think it's from donald. Do you recognize it? Okay, I ran prelims on the transmission through my encryption program, just trying to figure out if there's some sort of pattern hidden in the beeps and tones, but I can't make heads or tails of it. Okay, walter, if they're right and donald did send you a message, it makes sense that he'd expect you to know it. Right. Makes sense. Why send me a message I can't understand? So can you? Hmm? Understand it? [beeping] It's in "a" minor. Peter, I'm sorry. I didn't know we were going to get a message. How could I know that? I wouldn't have taken the acid if I had known that. What kind of acid did you take? Black blotter. I found some hidden in the storeroom. Why? Because it was an excellent batch. No, why did you drop acid? I'm desperate to remember the plan before he completely takes over. Who are you talking about, walter? Nina and I made an arrangement. What kind of arrangement? She promised that when I finished the pn to defeat the observers, she would help me remove the pieces of brain that they put back in. I don't think that's a good idea, walter. I don't want to lose you, peter. 

[00:10:42]


I don't want to lose any of you. And you won't, walter. I'm right here. We're all right here together. It's not enough. I'm afraid we're running out of time. What do you mean, walter? Two nights ago, you were all asleep. I found myself at the tunnel entrance door, dressed and ready to go, to go outside. Out there. Where was I going at 3:00 in the morning, peter? Where? I don't know, walter. And neither do i! But he does. But he does. He knows where I was going. Who knows, walter? The walter that was. [timer dings] I don't even remember what I was doing. It's like the first time I went out, but I stopped myself. But what if next time I didn't stop myself, couldn't stop myself, what then? I promised you, peter, but he made me. He almost made me. For reasons I do not know. I need to figure out this blasted plan to defeat the observers, and I have to do it quickly to rid myself of this devil. There must be something they left intact, something I can use. Peter. Peter. Peter, I don't think I should be discussing this in my condition. You need to allow me to do my work. I need to think, to figure out the tones. Okay, come on. 

[00:12:46]


What if we don't have to crack the code? What do you mean? The signal's coming from somewhere. If we track it, maybe we can figure out what it means. Peter, can we locate where this signal is being broadcast from? Well, I'll get in contact with anil, see if the resistance has a receiver that can help us triangulate the signal. 
???   ??????
thank you, my dear. The tech works by isolating the frequency of the radio signal you're looking for. It locates the signal by using three different vectors to triangulate the signal. (Peter) AND WE HAVE TO BE AT A CERTAIN ELEVATION To track it? No, the machine does it for you, utilizing a satellite. 

[00:14:47]


(Peter) HEY, WALTER. We're about to find the signal's origin. I know that. (Carla) DO YOU KNOW THAT There's something hidden in this lab? (Peter) WALTER? Walter? What's wrong with him? When did he get here? Half an hour ago. He brought the tech that's gonna help us track the signal's location. Let me set the parameters. Set those red geolocate buttons to "accept."

Have to go on foot from here, but the transmission's definitely coming from that direction. Well, how far out? Uh, it's hard to say, but the signal's still strong. I'm guessing not more than a couple hundred yards. What? You amaze me. After everything I've put you through, I did the very thing I promised you I wouldn't do, I left you again. I'm more than a little embarrassed, you know? Peter, you don't have to say anything. No, I do. I don't deserve you. I'm just so lucky, so incredibly lucky to have you. Peter. [beeping] It was an observer. [beeping] Peter? There are two more over here. Another observer and a loyalist. 

[00:22:32]


Looks like they were killed during a firefight. Based on the decomp of their bodies, I'd say 10, 15 years ago at least. I think we just found donald. Liv, take a look at this. It's an early prototype observer gun. Looks like he killed the two observers and the loyalist but then died of his wounds before he could drive away. Well, if donald's been dead all these years, then where's the signal coming from? Right over there. [beeping] Olivia! This isn't the source of the transmission. It's just a relay being used to boost the signal that's being bounced in from somewhere else. 

[00:24:35]


What is it? The body behind the wheel, it isn't donald. It's sam weiss. Walter. What is it? Was there a man that was part of the plan named sam weiss? Sam weiss. I've never heard of him. He doesn't know him. Who is he? Uh, he was someone that peter and I knew in a different time line. Was? Yeah, we just found his body. Looks like he was trying to protect the signal relay from the radio transmission. What did he have to do with donald and the signal? (Olivia) WE DON'T KNOW, BUT APPARENTLY, He was helping to keep the transmission going. Well, is there a possibility that sam weiss was donald? I don't think so. I mean, we've seen glimpses of donald on the video tapes, and his hair color and body type just doesn't match up. Peter's recalibrating the tracking device so that we can find the signal's origin point. We'll call you back as soon as we have something new. Yeah. (Carla) OKAY, SHE WON'T SEE YOU NOW. You're still cold, walter. Colder. This is absurd. I haven't got time for infantile games. Just tell me what it is you have me looking for. Your secrets. I have no idea what you're talking about. And I can't begin to guess. (Carla) CAN'T? That word was never in the vocabulary of the walter bishop I knew. He once told me, "there is no god in this lab but me." 

[00:26:42]


He is not me. Tell her, nina. He's right. That walter would think nothing of going off on his own to new york right now. He'd share all his secrets with the observers, demonstrate his unequaled brilliance. A man of your staggering intellect and vision would be recognized by the observers, valued, revered even. Grab your coat and hat. Stop. I won't let you talk me into leaving the lab by myself again. I promised peter! I will not jeopardize the plan. I won't risk the safety of everyone I care about. (Autrid) WALTER? Warmer. You're burning up. And I know how that feels. I don't understand. What is this? No, put it back, walter. (Carla) IT'S YOUR LIFE'S WORK, The work I came to burn the night that i died. Perhaps just a peek.

Why would I do that? I--i promised peter. I promised that I wouldn't leave the lab alone again. I wouldn't make a unilateral decision like that. I wouldn't do something that could hurt the people I love. You're in denial. You've been him longer than you've been you. Why else do you think I'm here? I'm just like this journal.

You know donald. So what can you tell us about him? When the invaders came and people started to fight back, my wife and I helped the cause in any way we could. We gave food, supplies, medical attention, and shelter to those courageous enough to stand up against them. You were part of the resistance. We didn't call ourselves that back then, but yes. After a while, we acquired a reputation as people who could be trusted. That's how we met donald. About eight months after the invasion, he showed up at our doorstep. He said the invaders were looking for him and he had to go away. But he needed us to watch over the boy. He said he was part of an important plan to defeat the invaders. Donald said he'd worked with a scientist from boston, but the scientist had been captured, he wasn't sure he'd ever see him again but that he hoped that he would. (Walter) THAT'S ME. Did donald say where he was going? No. And you never saw him again after that? That was part of the arrangement. He couldn't come back. He didn't want to put us in danger. We heard that he was dead. Before he left, he gave ushis. We had to turn it on every five days at the same time, so it could broadcast a coded message. If you were still alive, you would get the message and come for the boy. That was over 20 years ago. (Carolyn) HE DOESN'T SPEAK. He hasn't aged a day since he came to live with us. We call him michael. There were times when I thought about not turning that signal on anymore. Selfishly, I wanted to keep him here with us. This is the hardest day for me. I never doubted that michael was important, 

[00:52:42]


that he was meant for something great. [somber music] 
???   ??????
here. Something to warm you up. It's just hot cocoa. I had a daughter, and when she was little, she loved hot cocoa. She used to say, that of all the hot cocoa in the world, mine was her favorite. 

[00:54:48]


Do you know me? Do you remember me? But he met us in a different time line. How could he possibly remember you? Observers experience time differently. Maybe he does too. (Carla) [echoing] YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM WHO You are. Some things are not ours to tamper with. Some things are god's. (Walter) THERE'S ONLY ROOM FOR ONE GOD IN This lab, and it's not yours. (Elizabeth) GOD, I JUST CAN'T BEAR IT WHEN You're not here. You know what I'm doing, you know where i am, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I won't give up, elizabeth. I can do this. I need you not to doubt me. Nothing's going to happen to you. I promise. Walter, you're trying to create a wormhole into another universe? Yes. I think I just said that. I'm sorry, but you can't. Yes, I think I can. No, walter, I won't let you do it. [grunting] WALTER! [grunting] 

[00:56:50]


No! Walter, there has to be a line somewhere. There has to be a line we can't cross. My son is dying, dr. Warren. I will not allow that to happen again. I am become death, destroyer of worlds. Don't you quote oppenheimer. Knowledge cannot be pursued without morality. You sound like a sanctimonious southern preacher! I may go to church every sunday, walter, but I also have three degrees in theoretical physics, and I am telling you you cannot do this. We both know the amount of energy required to create a portal will forever ruin both universes. For the sake of one life, you will destroy the world. Some things are not ours to tamper with. Some things are god's. (Walter) THERE'S ONLY ROOM FOR ONE GOD IN This lab, and it's not yours. The journal doesn't matter. Even if you burn it, it's too le now that you remember all the things you're capable of. (Nina) WALTER, YOU GOT THE BOY BACK. You've got to continue. You've got to keep fighting. (Carla) I THINK WE BOTH KNOW You're too tired to do that. 

[00:58:52]


There's nothing to burn. You've been him longer than you've been you.

>>> When you are not number one in anything and number two in turnovers, you got to have five in a game so you can be number would be in the nfl. 
>> We wanted to be number one. 
>> Number one in something. 
>> Good morning steve keeley. 
>> Everybody thinks I got co oties, the new kacie and sunshine band. 
>> Ahh. 
>> I'm sure, don't worry, other ladies will have egos on the show. They won't mind that. 
>> Good morning, kacie. 
>> Kacie are you scared of me too. 
>> I got a card for you. 
>> Well, karen and I are real close, the heavy breathing. I usually breathe heavy around beautiful women, but pneumonia, sue is so scared she stayed on another floor. 
>> I didn't want to get on the same room as you but I will be down later on. In the meantime we are getting it together up here this morning and talking about a chilly start. Colder then it was yesterday. So we have, our bus stop buddy, all ready to go, out in force. First, number of the days, first number and then buddy. It is a good number. It is a nine. Thought it was a six there. Who knew. Just about perfect for december 14th even with the cold start it is december, supposed to be cold, 30's in the city, 20's every where else and sunrise at 7:15. But 52 degrees, not bad, mostly sunny skies, just fine for friday and then tonight we are down to 35. We will have a clear sky and the same weather pattern the pass couple of days but we will have have changes on the way and that is happening just in time for second half of the weekend. We will talk about that in the seven day forecast, kacie? 
>> Okay, sue one pesky incident that is sticking around, you know it, water main break. Walnut street closed between 16th and 17th, sansom and spruce run parallel to that. We will let you know when it is gone. 

[00:02:08]


>> I've got two incidents, burlington bristol bypass is closed that accident is cleared and reopened, also reopened monmouth road that was closed, one direction gets by there still a down pole there at the scene but you can get by. Your authorized to use monmouth road, both directions between anderson and pine let's go out to the roads. We are not going out to the roads, guys? 
>> All right, kacie.

Eight five-year old woman struck and killed this happened at 7:00 on stenton avenue at murdock road. We will get more details on this and we will bring them to you but who may have been responsible.

>> Reporter: Good morning, guys. The subway stations, platforms, trains they have surveillance cameras and right now police are hoping surveillance video helps someone recognize their suspects. They are looking for two teens who opened fire in a crowded subway car wednesday night and sent two men to the hospital. The two boys started arguing with a 35 year-old man wearing a chicago bulls jersey, that happened just after sixers game. Police say boys started using profanity and man told them to stop. When train did come to a stop finally at forty-sixth and market streets the boys got off the car, one turns back pulled out a gun and fired one shot. It hit the man in the jersey in the stomach and same bullet hits an innocent bystander in the leg. The suspects took off running. When we spoke to a relative of the bulls victim she said it was has thing he expect. 
>> It was really surprising like I was shocked that it happened, you know, on the el and I just saw it on the news again. It is still, I'm just can't believe that happened. It is crazy. Nurses say that he was very lucky, you know, that it just went through. 

[00:04:22]


>> It is just bizarre. Conversation is a conversation. If you don't agree with someone's opinion, that is okay. But to take the gun out doesn't equal ice it it makes you a pure idiot and person h don't deserve to be on the streets of philadelphia. 
>> Reporter: Now police say these two boys were between the the age of 16 and 19, both are wearing gray hooded sweat shirts. One had a blue puffy vest on. He was one who fired the gun. Both have a thin complex, darko owe thin build, dark complex and in facial hair. If you did see these two guys around, forty-sixth and market stations you are asked to call police. The guardian angel will try to help and passing out flyers that have have sketches and also information about the shooting. They will be passing that around. That subway stop, so that people if they didn't hear about the shooting they know now and they are hoping someone can come forward. 
>> All right, great pictures on those septa cameras, that will stop a lot of crimes too. 
>>> We will look for an update throughout the morning n other news police now putting together clues in another double shooting in chester county. Sky fox over the scene on the 500 block here of olive street. This is is in coatsville. Earlier yesterday. That is where two people were shot.

Dipietro was gunned dunn wednesday and sources telling fox 29 dave schratwieser that he may have been targeted because he was talking publicly about an unsolved mob hit back in 2003.

Twenty-two of them elementary schools, and rest high schools, all being cut, so are some middle schools, along with those high schools. There are some school mergers in the plan. School officials say the closures will save them close to $30 million a year and it is a crucial amount when the district is facing 200 million-dollar deficit every year.

>> Stephanie salvatore on this this morning. Hard to believe looking at this video and hear reason karen just talk about shooting somebody, not only battling over the sixers in an argument. 
>> Reporter: It is surprising also that these kids didn't think about the fact that there were cameras on the subway train this surveillance video is so clear, and police are hoping that that is exactly what will lead them to catch the kids that they are looking for. Police say there were two teen boys, that started to trash talk a 35 year-old man in a bulls jersey, after the sixers game on wednesday. Now the argument started off pretty innocently and escalated when the train stopped and the two get off of the car, one of the boys turns and and fires one shot in the crowded subway car. It hits the the man in the bulls jersey in the stock and another bystander in the leg. Both men were treated at the hospital. One was critical. Other who was stable was released.

Police say they are both wearing gray hooded sweat shirts, blue puffy vest on the shoot are and they are they are both thin build, dark complex, no facial hair. They are hoping that this video which is clear you get a good look at these two guys. They are hoping that is exactly what police need the public view to recognize them.

>> Police say the the guy, 37 year-old gets in the fight with a 19 year-old man, pistol whips him, shoots him, this all happens as the guy's kids are watching from the car. Hey dad, good job. Police were chasing the guy when he lost control of the car and then crashed into this this building. Then he takes off running with the child under each arm and police easily caught him finally, and let's guess probably rightly so that the kids won't be in dad's care much longer. 
>> It is just taking his children to the shooting, takes his children on the high speed chase, he crashes in to a wall, and thank god they were in car seats.

By saturday night we are socked in with cloud cover but saturday itself should be a decent day. Here we go midnight we are starting to see precipitation moving in. It is not much but poconos lehigh valley you could see freezing drizzle and if you are awake at 4:00 in the morning maybe a little bit of rain around here. We have a break. It will still be cloudy. You may see sprinkle or two. But starting at 2:00 in the afternoon we will see rain pick up in intensity and by 5:00 p.M.

Same scowl and hair as the heat miser so I thought i would be nice and in the compare him to punxsutawney phil whom he is resembling in my mind because he is still in the hell and has not said anything publicly. Maybe we will hear about what he thinks about the eagles and his disastrous team by february 2nd just before the super bowl but still in comment from the owner. You can hate jerry generals, owner of the cowboys. He is out front when they had that death of the player last week and other player charged, he did not hide from reporters and was talking about it. That guy is a good owner because he add least appreciates fans and lets fans know is what going on. Not in this town. We have no idea is what going on. Don't be surprised if mr.

And then three straight plays, three straight turnovers, and fi turnovers in all for the game and they end up getting blown out after that three-point lead and the final score ugly just like the season and now the eagles are way beyond that eight-eight season that they would not stand for and we will see if andy reid is still standing after the season. 

[00:47:59]


>> The turnovers were, they were throughout the game but there were a clump right there where we had a series of turnovers and interception, fumble and another one. You got to take care of the ball. There was nothing that I could say about that. That is my responsibility to make sure that the guys do it, and I take full responsibility full blame for that. 
>> I got to tell the kids to held on to the ball with both hands. It is not his responsibility. Everybody blaming him. He does not fumble or throw these short passes we will talk about it with g. Cobb. We will talk bit.

?????? ?????? Next on "Great Performances".... ?????? All my troubles seemed so far away ?????? Time travel back to 1967's "summer of love" to go behind the scenes with the Beatles, as they embark on a Magical Mystery Tour that had the whole world talking. ?????? Roll up ?????? In new interviews with Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, along with archival commentary from John Lennon and George Harrison, the Fab Four tell it like it was. 
STARR: I'd love to say there was like this incredible master plan, but, uh... there wasn't. ?????? Sitting on a cornflake ?????? Also sharing their reminiscences are Peter Fonda, Terry Gilliam, and Martin Scorsese. Actually, looking back, it's influenced a lot of the work I've done. The songs you'll never forget, the film you've never seen. 
It's "The Magical Mystery Tour: Revisited." Take one! "Great Performances" is brought to you by... This program is also made possible by... And by contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you. ?????? today, ?????? ?????? 4,000 holes... ?????? Magical Mystery Tour could only have been made in a climate that the Beatles had themselves created. ?????? I'd love to turn you on ?????? 

[00:02:38]


FONDA: We had our own art, we had our own music. Everything. We had all these... Whoa -- we don't have our own film. 
McCARTNEY: It wasn't the kind of thing we could do a disclaimer before and say, "Ladies and gentlemen, what you are about to see is the product of our imaginations, and believe me, at this point, they're quite vivid." 
[Cheering] 
MAN: End number, applause. Clapping, all the rest of it -- cut. 
MAN #2: Take One. 
MAN #3: Now everyone, try and look very, uh... 
[Voice fading] 
[Crowd murmuring] 
MAN #4: Quiet! 
MAN #3: Everybody, run out past the cameras. Go! 
[Crowd cheering] If you look to your left, ladies and gentlemen, the view is not very inspiring, ahhh, but if you look to your right... ???????????? 
STARR: We had to get on the bus, that was the first thing. We had to get on the bus and go on a Magical Mystery Tour, and it had all been decorated, and with the couriers, it was like loaded, the bus, when we got on. 
[Car horn blares] Who is that man? 
["I Am the Walrus" plays] 
[Radio dial spinning] ...give the letters which thou findest about me to Edmund Earl of Gloucester. This picture probably reflects their state of mind more than anything else they had done at the time. That's the way they perceived the world around them. ?????? I am the eggman ?????? ?????? Ooh! ?????? ?????? They are the eggmen ?????? For me, the freedom of the picture was something that was very very important, the sense of breaking all the form. Obviously some of it I didn't quite understand in terms of the humor, but it was the way it was in those days. I mean, people were trying everything, and whether it fully succeeded or not was really beside the point. ?????? Let me take you down ?????? ?????? 'Cause I'm going to ?????? ?????? Strawberry fields ?????? ?????? Nothing is real ?????? ?????? And nothing to get hung about ?????? ?????? Strawberry fields forever ?????? Magical Mystery Tour comes out after one of the greatest years of domination the record industry had ever known. ?????? Misunderstanding all you see ?????? ?????? It's getting hard to be someone ?????? ?????? But it all works out ?????? ?????? It doesn't matter much to me ?????? ?????? Let me take you down ?????? ?????? 'Cause I'm going to ?????? ?????? Strawberry fields ?????? The Beatles had three singles that year, all of which were number ones. ?????? In Penny Lane, there is a barber showing photographs ?????? ?????? Of ev'ry head he's had the pleasure to have known ?????? "Penny Lane" was the A-side in America. "Strawberry Fields Forever" was the B-side and got to number eight, "Penny Lane" got to number one. ?????? On the corner is a banker with a motorcar ?????? ?????? The little children laugh at him behind his back ?????? ?????? And the banker never wears a mac ?????? ?????? In the pouring rain ?????? ?????? Very strange ?????? ?????? Penny Lane is in my ears ?????? ?????? And in my eyes ?????? Then in June, "Sergeant Pepper," of course, number one for the entire summer. ?????? Woke up, fell out of bed ?????? ?????? Dragged a comb across my head ?????? ?????? Found my way downstairs and drank a cup ?????? ?????? And looking up, I noticewas late ?????? ?????? Found my coat and grabbed my hat ?????? ?????? Made the bus in seconds flat ?????? ?????? Found my way upstairs and had a smoke ?????? ?????? Somebody spoke and I went into a dream ?????? ?????? Ahhh-ahh-ah ?????? ?????? Ah-ahh-ahhh... ?????? The almost amazing thing was, a month after "Sergeant Pepper," "All You Need is Love," of course, another number one. ?????? Love, love, love ?????? ?????? Love, love, love ?????? ?????? Love, love, love ?????? 

[00:08:44]


MAN: We were never disappointed, particularly that year, '67, to be doing the "All You Need is Love" television broadcast, to be Britain's representative around the world, and you've got this song that nobody else has ever heard and play it for the first time in front of millions of people. I mean, it's just... A, an extraordinary opportunity and, B, brilliantly pulled off because you can have the opportunity to come up with a song called "My Dad's called Burt," and nobody ever hears it again, which is sad because it's a great song, but, uh... ?????? It's easy ?????? ?????? All you need is love ?????? ?????? All you need is love ?????? ?????? All you need is love, love ?????? ?????? Love is all you need ?????? So then, Christmas, "Hello Goodbye," number one. ?????? You say yes ?????? ?????? I say no ?????? ?????? You say stop ?????? ?????? I say go go go ?????? ?????? Oh, no ?????? ?????? You say goodbye and I say hello ?????? It was an amazing year for them so, of course, the minute that you got your hands on "Magical Mystery Tour," you wanted to listen to every single track, because they were coming off of "Sergeant Pepper" and "All You Need is Love." 
WEATHERMAN: In Scotland and Northern Ireland, there'll be slight frost leading to icy patches on roads around dawn. Afternoon temperatures will range from 5 degrees centigrade, 41 Fahrenheit, in northern Scotland, to about 8 degrees centigrade, 46 Fahrenheit, in southern England. ???????????? "The Val Doonican Show!" "Top of the Pops." These are just some of the BBC programmes this Christmas. 

[00:10:53]


[Applause] ?????? I'm in with the in crowd?????? ?????? I go where the in crowd goes?????? ?????? I'm in with the in crowd?????? ?????? And I know what the in crowd knows?????? 
MAN: In my family, Boxing Day was more often the party day really, lots of relatives around. 
WOMAN: Aunties and uncles, and my sisters and brothers would have all been over, having had their Christmas at home together, and then over to us on the Boxing Day. 
WOMAN: It was tradition for us to go into the neighbour's house on Boxing Day and we used to play Monopoly in the afternoon, and I was always allowed a snowball with Advocaat and lemonade in, that was my treat. 
MAN: The Christmas schedule is always one of these difficult things to get together, and on that particular year in 1967, I had a gap on Boxing Day. And suddenly I got a hear of this film, "The Magical Mystery Tour." It was described to me as a film made by The Beatles, containing the Beatles, and containing a lot of music, and that, as far as I was concerned, was good enough. ???????????? Roll up, roll up for the Magical Mystery Tour! Step right this way! ?????? Roll up ?????? 
BARTLETT: Sitting in front of the television, very very close to the screen, no clue who was in the room with me apart from my dad, because he seriously didn't like The Beatles and he spent most of his time grunting and saying it was a load of rubbish. "Why don't you turn it over and why don't you talk to the visitors because we've got guests." 
DICKINS: My dad said, "They should get their hair cut," and I said, "Dad, you know Jesus had long hair, don't you?" And he just didn't know what to say. 
SMITH: My parents didn't like it, my dad thought it was rubbish, and I'm pretty sure he turned it off before the end. 
MAN: I loved it, it was a great movie, to see The Beatles doing something different, as wizards and all that sort of thing. 
WOMAN: I was 15 years old. I remember we sat and we watched it right the way through in silence, and afterwards we just looked at each other and we said, "What was all that about?" That was the beginning of the end of their innocence to me and my innocence. 

[00:13:15]


FROST: I liked it, with reservations and so on, but why were people so puzzled by it, do you think? 
McCARTNEY: I think they thought it was bitty, which it was a bit, you know, but it was supposed to be like that. I think a lot of people were looking for a plot, and there wasn't one. I think the younger people would get it, the people who knew what was going on in society would get it, and the older people, who were expecting "Morecambe and Wise" or a British variety show, wouldn't get it, and I think, in a way, quite rightly would be annoyed. It was like they'd been cheated out of their Christmas special. 
ANNOUNCER: There was, it seemed, very little magic about this particular mystery tour, most reporting viewers, in fact, finding it virtually incomprehensible. "There was no theme or storyline," they complained, the programme appearing to consist of confused, disconnected shots of the weirdest things and suggesting a nightmare rather than a mystery tour. The following are just a few of the many outraged comments. 
MAN: The biggest waste of money since the Groundnut Scheme. 
WOMAN: Positively the worst programme I can remember seeing on any TV channel. 
ANNOUNCER: The sma minority who did enjoy the programme hailed it as something completely different. A schoolboy had this to say -- "It was one of the best Christmas programmes we have had for a long time. The idea was clever as well as original. It was very funny in parts, a marvellous programme in black and white 
-- in colour it would be indescribable." 
GILLIAM: '67, they arrived. I thought it was kind of a dream come true, because it was like a gigantic... the part that I was focused on was a gigantic costume ball, it seemed to me. People were just dressed outrageously, beautifully. I want to do some gold breeches down to the knee, but with buttons from about there upwards. What is this thing you've got here? This button? That, it's... a button that's green. Yeah, I can see it's green. Yeah, but it means "go." Instead of, you know, all the other buttons that people wear that've got messages on them. This one just says "go ahead" because it's green. 

[00:15:42]


GILLIAM: What loved was the contrast between the new generation, the music world, and the bowler-hatted, pinstriped city gents. Everything seemed to be nicely defined, which, of course, for an American, was fresh, because America, everything is supposed to be equal so people camouflage the differences; in England it was very clear what the differences were. ?????? And that's an invitation ?????? ?????? Roll up for the mystery tour ?????? 
MERTON: When they first toured, they were touring with comedians and singers and stuff and it was part of a show biz package deal. So that was what, '63 they were doing that. So in the space of four years, which is nothing, we're in the world of Sergeant Pepper and kaftans and incense and San Francisco and all that kind of thing, so I should imagine some members of the Establishment were rather sort of perturbed, because it looked to them like The Beatles had gone from being "take that" to "take this,"or something. The entire nation had been let down by The Beatles. They hated it, at least the people who wrote in the newspaper hated it, you know. They, um... Don't forget that, with all the success we'd had, every time something came out, a new record or whatever, they'd all try and slam it so that, you know, because once they'd built you up that high, all they can do is knock you back down again. I mean that's what happens, that's life. So they really didn't like it, but it's understandable too because it wasn't a brilliant scripted thing that was executed well, it was like a little home movie, really, an elaborate home movie. ?????? La-la-la-la-la ?????? ?????? La-la-la-la-la... ?????? I would guess that the majority of the American population did not know that Magical Mystery Tour had been a television film. True Beatle fans would know, but because it was so far away and so distant, they didn't seem to care that much because, after all, everybody has television shows, so maybe this is just one we missed. I did get to see it, but I was in the incredibly small minority. Most Beatle fans never saw it, and probably have not seen it till this day. Now shut up! Shut up? I've had enough of it! I can't stand it anymore! I'm gettin' off! Off! Don't get historical! 

[00:18:26]


STARR: It was Paul's idea, really. We were hanging out in the studio, you know, looking for stuff to do, really, and he came up with this idea, he said, "Look! I've got this idea!" 
[Chuckles] And we said, "Great!" And, uh... it actually moved from that circle to this... to this! When a man buys a ticket for a Magical Mystery Tour, he knows what to expect. We guarantee him the trip of a lifetime, and that's just what he gets. The incredible Magical Mystery Tour! It was basically a charabanc trip which people used to go on from Liverpool to see the Blackpool Lights, and they'd get loads of crates of beer and an accordion player. ?????? When Irish eyes are smiling ?????? All the coach trips I went on to Blackpool, the lights were very fuzzy... but that's another story! 
[Accordion playing, rhythmical clapping] 
["The Fool on the Hill" plays] ?????? Round and round and round and round... ?????? 
[Man shouting nonsense commands] 
MAN: On your marks... get set... Go! 
[Tires screech] 
[Dramatic overture plays] This time I mean it! 
[Tearful laughter] I... I can't breathe anymore. ?????? See how they fly, like Lucy in the sky ?????? ?????? See how they run ?????? ?????? I'm crying ?????? ?????? I'm crying ?????? ?????? When he saw Cutie, it gave him a thrill ?????? ?????? Don't you know, baby ?????? ?????? Curves can kill ?????? ?????? Death-cab for Cutie ?????? ?????? Death-cab for Cutie ?????? 

[00:20:50]


GAMBACCINI: The part of "Magical Mystery Tour" that I didn't get, and which I knew Americans would also not get, were the things that were very English. For example, the concept of a Mystery Tour. America didn't have it. You had to know where you were going before you got onto a bus. 
MAN: There was no attempt to say, "This is just a young people's thing." That's what's so wonderful about The Beatles. They didn't have any of that snobbism. You know, the character that plays Ringo's aunt is this big fat lady, you know, she's just kind of crazy. But that's great, there's a great deal of love there, with the old guys and the characters. And I think that was part of The Beatles aesthetic too, you know, "this isn't just us." 
INNES: It was made like an art film. The small narrative of the bus sort of held it together again, but again, it wasn't... you weren't supposed to know where it was going. Very long red settee similar to this and they had a number of papers in front of them, and they were planning this film, but particularly Epstein had a pie chart and they were already planning who would do what in a film. Epstein was delighted, of course, because they'd just finished a major album, they were no longer touring. He hadn't really got a great deal to do, and he was quite clearly very enthusiastic about the whole thing. 

[00:22:52]


LENNON: He was just a beautiful fella you know, and it's terrible. 
MAN: What are your plans now? Well, we haven't made any, you know. I mean we've only just heard, haven't we? Epstein had a little office in an ultra modern building with a parking space underneath it, and they were all in there. I didn't know what the hell it was all about, and they said to me, "We've said to Epstein we want to make this film," and I think they thought that now that he was dead, they wanted to go ahead and make it anyway. And this was an important sort of genuflection to the work that they had done with Brian. And they did try at that point to express, they wanted to be free and easy and not be constricted by the studio system and the things that were in it. They had the opportunity and the money to do something that nobody else would have been able to do, and therefore it is a unique piece of filmmaking. You could almost call it a vanity, like a vanity publication of what they were doing, but it was more than that. ?????? Walking down a very narrow alley in the street ?????? ?????? I saw an old man a-standing by a wall ?????? ?????? Hastily I ran up to the old man ?????? ?????? And I said to him, in phrases very small ?????? ?????? Get away from the wall ?????? ?????? Get away from the wall ?????? ?????? Get away from the wall ?????? 
STARR: Ivor Cutler we knew, of course, because he had those great records. Uh... I'm sure somebody saw, Nat Jackley was his name, you know, on a show or something. 

[00:24:55]


[Drum pounding] 
[Speaking gibberish] 
[Shouting nonsense commands] The other thing we used to do, at night, we'd go through the "artists need work" books. And we'd go, "Oh, yeah, he looks good!" Or, "Oh, yea look at that person!" And we'd just pick 'em out the book. Okay! ?????? Oh, baby, you made me love you ?????? ?????? I didn't wanna do it, I didn't wanna do it ?????? 
[Accordion plays] 
[Scattered applause] 
[Whistle blows] 
[Marching band plays] Good morning, lads and lasses. My name is Miss Winters. I just wanted to say, if there's anything I can do to be of assistance, well, you know what to do. 
WOMAN: I think what happened with The Beatles was, if you were around, you were on the bus, you know. If you'd been wherever the bus set off from that day and they thought you were all right, you'd have been on the bus. 
WOMAN: "Would you like to come on a coach trip with The Beatles?" "They're making a film." That's it, that's all we knew. I think we had two days' notice. Yeah, we got it on the Friday and had to go on the Monday. 

[00:26:57]


MAN: Nobody would have believed them... I'd left my job on the Friday, and I didn't go back on the Monday, and I did lose it, but it was worth it. Yeah. 
MAN: Take one. I don't know the rest of the words. You can "la la" it, darling. 
MAN: Yeah, just sing, and if you don't know the words... Are we on? Yeah, we're running. ?????? Oh, yesterday... ?????? Do you like your old Auntie, darling? Oh, you're all right, you're one of the best. ?????? All my troubles seemed so far away ?????? 
FONDA: That bus was hysterical! All the people on the bus too, whoa, what a great thought! ?????? And that's an invitation ?????? 
SCORSESE: There was something very musical, very dancelike about the editing of the Magical Mystery Tour number, the bus. Freedom of the camera, along with the restraint of the characters looking toward the lens. For me this has always stayed, and it's one of my favorite moments in movies. And that's stayed with me over the years, and I think, actually looking back at it, has influenced a lot of the work I've done. 
[Indistinct conversation] 
AUNT: Shut your eyes... 
MAN: We're going. 
[Laughter] Listen, this film. Oh yeah. Tell me something about the storyline. 
LENNON: Well, you see, it's about a group of common or garden strange people on a coach tour, around anywhere really, and things happen to them, you see. Something will go, "Diddly dee, Magical Mystery Tour," and there's a little scene. You've got them! I've got what? You've got them on your head. Where are they? Do you want to knock them off? Yes. Go on, then. 
[Speaking gibberish] 
McCARTNEY: It was lovely to see john being so comfortable in playing with this little girl, but it's a side of John that you never really saw, and I must say I don't think I'd really seen it much to that point. All right, I'll put it on my hat. 

[00:29:20]


STARR: I'd love to say there was this incredible master plan, but, there wasn't. 
McCARTNEY: We thought it might be a good idea to go towards Cornwall, where I think we'd had fond childhood memories. I'd hitchhiked down there when I was a kid. George and I had done that. 
NIGHTINGALE: I don't think we ever really were told the reasoning behind much of it. It was just, "This is going to happen, and so-and-so is gonna be doing this, and so-and-so is gonna be doing that," and we just did it... to be honest. It was, uh... "spontaneous," I think, is the word. Yes. That's a very good word, yeah. 
CROWLEY: You didn't have time to think about because it was all sort of happening, but if you analyzed what was happening, you really didn't know anyway, did you? Couldn't put your finger on what was happening. 
[Laughter, singing] 
MILES: Paul always had a tremendous interest in spontaneity and random events and effects, but random in his sense would be an accidental trick of the light or a superimposition. ?????? Oh-ohh-ohh-ohhh... ?????? ?????? Round and round and round and round and round ?????? ?????? He never listens to them ?????? ?????? He knows that they're the fools ?????? This is the story of your lives! The old dreams, the left placenta... 
McCARTNEY: I had a period of a few years when I was living in London and I wasn't married like the other guys. They were living outside of London, so I would kind of probably see more cinema, see more theatre, go to more events, just because I was there. And one of the things that I got was a super 8 camera. Started off just doing snapshots, doing your home movies to go on holiday. But then I got more and more interested in it, and I found one that you could rewind so you could then go through again. I did a film that I wish I had now which was out of my hotel window in Paris. I filmed a gendarme on traffic duty and he's just stopping all the cars, so that was one roll through, and then the second time, he'd gone, so I then just filmed all the traffic. So it looked like this impossible job where the traffic was just going through him all the time, which was nice enough for ten minutes, it was amusing enough for me. But then the nice thing was I found a sodtrack with a jazz saxophonist called Albert Ayler who did a wonky version of the Marseillaise, so while this guy is "Oh non non non, monsieur! Oh-la-la-la..." You hear this... [IMITATING SAX] Yeah, I was doing a lot of that. And I think that was part of why I wanted to do "Magical Mystery Tour." 

[00:33:23]


MILES: McCartney always had his antennae out, so those would be the avant-garde things he would do, but he would also go to the various sort of night clubs and hear torch singers -- and he used those actual words, that he always had his "antennae out," and stuff would go in and it might not come out for years and years. They've got all these rules for everything, rules of how to live, how to paint, how to make music, and it's just not true anymore, you know, they don't work, all those rules. I think what happened with The Beatles is, we always thought, "Ooh, the people back home would love to know this," so we felt like we were the megaphone, so if it was happening to us and we liked it, we thought, "we should let them know," because they're not down here hanging out with the artists, but it would be good to pass on the good news. It was a 50/50 thing. They were influenced by what was going on in the underground, but they themselves, by taking some of those ideas on board, spread the ideas so rapidly and so quickly through their fame, that they became sort of leaders of it, in a curious way. Keep up, please. We're following... 
MAN: Well, what one could see very clearly were the sequences, but how the sequences related to each other, how they juxtaposed themselves inerms of an overall story, I could never see. 
MAN: There was almost like improvisation where everybody gets into the groove and then they start expanding on that, and to be honest with you, I don't remember if they mimed to playback -- I guess they did, actually. They must have, because all of a sudden, I remember the first time the sound guy testing and you hear one of the tracks booming out across the Kent countryside, it was amazing, and everybody was like galvanized, the energy that the music gave them. ?????? I am the eggman ?????? ?????? Ooh! ?????? ?????? They are the eggmen ?????? ?????? Ooh! ?????? ?????? I am the walrus, Goo goo g' joob ?????? 

[00:35:23]


SERESIN: Already there was abstract qualities in their humor and writing and their approach to all sorts of stuff, and I think the film was a sort of natural progression, all came out of that culture. ?????? See how they run ?????? ?????? I'm crying ?????? I thought it was brilliant, I did. It was like anarchic. ?????? I'm crying ?????? ?????? I'm crying ?????? ?????? I'm crying ?????? 
LOSEY: When we were doing, what was it, it was the "Walrus" scene or something like that, Paul got me up about 2:00 in the morning, he said, "We want a dozen midget wrestlers for tomorrow." Dozen midgets, you know. I said, "How the hell do I get a dozen midgets down here in time to shoot tomorrow morning?" He said, "I don't know." It was worse than the Hollywood system, you know, because Hollywood had real power. But that's what I did, and theyere produced. 
McCARTNEY: The sequences were just suggested, often by memories from our childhood, things that we'd remembered or we'd remembered seeing or doing ourselves. /EMAN: Action! So, for instance, a tug of war was something you'd see at all the village fetes, there'd often be a tug of war between the burly men of the neighborhood. So a lot of these things found their way in as ideas. I suppose the whole film has a bit of a village fete atmosphere to it. 
MILES: It's all their childhood memories, all being jumbled up and juxtaposed, coming out as a series of fairly surreal images. 
FONDA: Don't get upset, don't expect something other than "The Beatles." If you expect The Beatles, you're getting them, full force. They are really there, much more than they were in "Help!" and much more than they were in "A Hard Day's Night." They were really there because it was all their thing, they were shooting, they were deciding what to say, what to wear, how to do this. In that way, it was a Magical Mystery Tour of them. ?????? Sitting on a cornflake ?????? ?????? Waiting for the van to come ?????? ?????? Corporation tee shirt, stupid bloody Tuesy ?????? ?????? Man, you been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long ?????? ?????? I am the eggman ?????? ?????? Ooh! ?????? ?????? They are the eggmen ?????? ?????? Ooh! ?????? ?????? I am the walrus, Goo goo g' joo-- ?????? 

[00:38:15]


[Calliope playing "She Loves You"] 
GAMBACCINI: It seems to me now that Magical Mystery Tour is an attempt to fuse those elements of quintessential Englishness which made The Beatles feel like the people they were with the advanced psychedelic elements that they had introduced into the culture. It's a graft. ?????? There's a fog upon L.A. ?????? ?????? And my friends have lost their way ?????? 
STARR: Well, shooting "Blue Jay Way" was great. George had written that song because he'd stayed on Blue Jay Way in America. And I was just always interested in cameras and lenses, and I had all those prism lenses and closeup macro lenses. And in those days, thanks to...some medication, it... 
[Chuckles] was the most exciting thing we'd ever seen! ?????? Ask a p'liceman on the street ?????? ?????? There's so many there to meet ?????? 
SCORSESE: I think you can really feel the influence of the avant-garde cinema at the time. They all took their own home movies, et cetera, and they were always experimenting with this imagery, and so it seemed natural that they would try to create something that was certainly not the traditional narrative that they had worked with in the Richard Lester films, which are quite wonderful, but in a very different way. They were almost like making their own movie paintings, music pieces, dance pieces, and it wasn't cinema, it was something else. ?????? Please don't you be very long ?????? ?????? Please don't be long ?????? 

[00:40:19]


HARRISON: There was always good songs, there was a couple of good songs, and there was a few funny scenes. I mean, the scene to me that stands out is the one of John shovelling the spaghetti onto the fat woman's plate. I mean, that was the best bit of the movie for me. 
LENNON: Paul showed me what his idea was and this is how it went, it went round like this, the story, and the production, and he said, "Now here's the segment, you write a little piece for that." I thought, "I've never made a film, what's he mean?" He said, "Write a script," so I ran off and wrote the dream sequence for the fat woman and the thing with the spaghetti and all that. 
[Lady laughing, sobbing] 
MAN: Action! 
LOSEY: John and Paul basically would put their heads together and come back and they'd say, "Right, this is what we want to do tomorrow." Something as simple as, you know, half a ton of spaghetti, and you have to get George Cook out of bed and say, "George, first thing you do is send your buyer down to get as much spaghetti as there is." 
SERESIN: I do remember watching John on rehearsal or whatever and the pleasure he got, like a kid playing in mud, slopping out all this spaghetti on that woman. 
[Accordion plays] 
WOMAN: There are bits that are silly and a bit self-indulgent, but on the other hand it's not pretentious. I don't think they ever were. They always managed to keep the right side of that line. And where you had Paul wanting to reflect his background, John would come along, literally Spaniard in the works, and give it that edge and made it sinister, and bits of Magical Mystery Tour are actually quite frightening, and quite scary, and that's John. I can hardly get my breath! It's intake, Jessie, not output. I am, I am! I am already! Three times this week already! For goodness' sake, Jessie, sit down. Remember! When you talk about Bunuel, everyone was so shocked to see that shot of him apparently cutting an eye. And I remember how shocking it was to see that. Now you look back on it and go, "That was a very important thing in the history of cinema." You probably couldn't have had "Psycho" without that. And that's the nice thing that happens with these things. I mean I don't want to elevate "Magical Mystery Tour" to the great heights of, you know, the most important things in cinema history, but I think in a lesser way, it did set a tone that then people could pick up and sort of say, "Well, if they've done that, we could do this." 

[00:43:30]


SOMBER CHORUS: ?????? Oooh-ooh-ooh ?????? 
MERTON: It's not worrying too much about your public image at that point, I think, it's about what you want to do. Here's an opportunity to make a film. What do you want to put in this film, what scene do you want to do? So I admire it from that point of view. 
WINTERS: Ladies and gentlemen, when the coach stops, would the gentlemen please follow Mr Johnson and e ladies stay with me. 
MERTON: It is immensely entertaining because you don't know where it's going to go next. Suddenly you're in a strip club. Come on, where are they? 
INNES: I do remember Viv being rather sort of miffed at the thought, you know, because Paul suggested he wore a kind of chiffon-ey scarf to look more trendy, and I don't think Viv took kindly to that, but he did it. ?????? The cab was racin' through the night ?????? ?????? Mm-mm-mm ?????? ?????? Baby, don't do it ?????? ?????? His eyes in the mirror, keepin' Cutie in sight ?????? ?????? Uh-huh-huh ?????? ?????? Baby, don't do it ?????? 
INNES: I think we related to them because they were mischievous and funny, but we didn't care about show business particularly. ?????? Curves can kill ?????? ?????? Death-cab for Cutie ?????? We had a lot of that kind of art school world in common. We'd all seen the art movies, we'd seen the certain paintings, we knew Magritte and things like that, and you know, when you're twenty somethings, you like them, and use them in things. And so if we had sort of robots or masks or things like that, we offered them up as images. ?????? Someone's gonna make you pay your fare ?????? ?????? Someone's gonna make ?????? ?????? You pay your fare ?????? ?????? Someone's gonna make you pay your fare ?????? ?????? Ohhh ???????????? We had no idea what the film was going to be like, but there was a kind of clue in the title, you know, "Magical Mystery Tour." It's a clever title because you can pretty much do anything, you know. ?????? Death-cab for Cutie ?????? ?????? Death-cab for Cutie ?????? 

[00:46:13]


MAN: I was sitting in front of my dad on the floor, he was sitting in the chair and I was like resting against the arm of the chair and the stripper came on, and as it started to get more and more risqu??, I suddenly found this hankie being draped across my eyes, which was quite embarrassing for me because obviously I thought I was so grown up at 11 years old. 
DICKINS: "Magical Mystery Tour," I think it was telling the older generation that things were changing, that's how I felt, that the old routines were going to change. I think probably my dad may have found it a bit scary. 
[Gulls calling] 
WOMAN: Sir, I am sorry that Mr Norman Hare disliked "Magical Mystery Tour." We are an elderly couple and had never seen or heard of The Beatles. The film entranced us and was all too short. I thought it a clever blend of all-too-real life and pure magic. They achieved the atmosphere of a coach tour perfectly, the surge of humanity from the coach at each stop, the sad wet sands of the inevitable dead low tide on West Country beaches. These and other points were cleverly heightened by the fantastic dream or nightmare sequences, also familiar to the coach tourer who has nodded off. The photography was imaginative and original and I laughed till I cried several times. But I fear they will not make another film like it, and perhaps they had better not try. Yours Faithfully, Ann Lee Michell, Mrs, Milverton, Somerset. 

[00:48:32]


LOSEY: I think there is within them a kind of English idea of subversion -- rather than the American idea of subversion, of stone throwing and that sort of thing, so it's much subtler. Because England as itself is a very different place, observing it for the last 50 years as a foreigner, an outsider. The way the English respond and change is quite different from the way other nations 
-- They don't actually go at it head on. 
MERTON: It's a sort of travelogue. It's a sort of documentary. It's a sort of slice of British working class life. It has so many goodies in it, but I can understand why Establishment felt threatened by what The Beatles were doing, because you know, if everybody grows their hair long, who's going to be in the army? ...and get your bloody hair cut! 
SCORSESE: For me, it certainly still holds up. The imagery was created without CGI, at a time when it was all photochemical, and some of it we may have gotten used to now. Now of course, the emphasis on professionalism and polish and politeness is very, has come back now with a vengeance. It's expected, and there's a tendency to forget that really, that's only one choice, you know, one way of going. 
NIGHTINGALE: I think it's brilliant, it's just a laugh. And I don't think that's just because of our memories, I think it's just a piece of film that would be enjoyable. I don't care what the people think about it, I'm still proud to be part of it. Yes, yeah. 
[Accordion playing] ?????? How I love ya, how I love ya ?????? ?????? My dear old Swanee ?????? 
GAMBACCINI: It's a charming acknowledgement, and indeed perhaps a profession, in a very positive way, of "these are the people we are, and these are the people we've become," mixed together. 

[00:50:38]


STARR: Ha... ?????? Let's all get up and dance to a song ?????? ?????? That was a hit before ?????? ?????? Your mother was born ?????? ?????? Though she was born a long, long time ago ?????? God! He's the worst dancer! ?????? Ooh-ooh ?????? ?????? Your mother should know ?????? ?????? Sing it again ?????? 
STARR: Yeah, "Your Mother Should Know." The dancing boys, how great! ?????? Your mother was born ?????? Who choreographed that? I don't know if we did that or not. It looked too real for us, because it was all... You know, I'd like to say I did, but I don't know. 
McCARTNEY: You can see that in some of the segments we'd had no idea, there's just a smiley face in number four, so that was like, "We'll think of something fun." And I think wehought that just to have an improvised film would give us a lot of freedom and would also show the kind of playfulness and the freedom that we were experiencing as The Beatles at that time. However, we realized we had to have something to show people, and when the cameraman would say, "Where do you want me to be?" you'd say, "on the coach, in the morning, 9:00," and we thought, well, that's enough information. ?????? Ooh-ooh ?????? ?????? Your mother should know ?????? ?????? Your mother should know ?????? 
INNES: You know, you could argue that, oh, the Beatles caught the bus, but The Beatles didn't catch the bus, they werethe bus. ?????? Roll up ?????? ?????? Roll up for the mystery tour ?????? ?????? Roll up ?????? ?????? And that's an invitation ?????? ?????? Roll up for the mystery tour ?????? ?????? Roll up ?????? ?????? To make a reservation ?????? ??????

One tremendous thing about PBS is that it makes art accessible by putting it on a platform where millions of people can access it for free. And we need it. We need music, we need dance, we need great theater for our soul, for joy in our lives. A lot of people flip on PBS and hear or see something that wakes up that integral part of being a human being which is enjoying the arts of other human beings. So I'm grateful for PBS as an artist and as a viewer.

Are definitely looking out for you. This is a fox nuse alert. 12 hours removed from an unthinkable tragedy in newtown, connecticut where we know that 28 people are dead them children and 7 of them adults and one of them the shooter. A 911 call came from the school reports of a shooter inside. Local and state police immediately responded and what they found inside described by police as horrific. We obtained the audio tapes while the tragedy unfold. 
>>> Caller indicated someone SHOOT NEGLIGENT BUILDINw. It is the front class. We have multiple weapons and one rifle and a shot gun. We need ambulances here apap. 
>>> The shooter is 20 year old adam lanza, his mother is a teacher at sandy hook. Reportedly killed in her home by lansa before the assault on the school. Police are questioning his brother ryan who was mistakenly thought to be the shooter. Police are in the horrible task of identifying the dead. It will be a lengthy process and likely take until tomorrow morning. It is it a fluid situation with crucial pieces of information that continued to emerge and rick leaventhal reported for fox all day. Rick, with the latest. Nshawn elementary schools are not supposed to be crime scenes buthat is what is happening in sandy hook. The medical examiner and teems of investigators are collecting evidence and going through the gruesome task of identifying the bodies of 27 victims including the shooter who shot himself after killing 6 adults and twept kids inside of that elementary school. We are told by investigators and federal law enforcement sources that the shooter adam lanza killed his mother in the home they shared in newtown, connecticut this morning and then took three weapons that she owned. A glock and handgun and rifle and went to the school driving her car. The school where she apparently worked as a substitute teacher. He gained entrance through the security and then opened fire. We know that the police responded. You heard the and they called in reenforcements and those officers didn't waste time. They got all of the kids and survivors out of the school and moved them to a nearby fire house that was set as a staging area and that is where the frantic parents were directed to take their children and get them home safely, sean. 

[00:03:28]


>>> One . Reachers went on record. The school had added new security that you had to be buzzed in the school and it was at that point the shooter went to the administration and what we learned it was during morning announcements somebody kept up the announcements and that served as a warning and a lot of other store storse of heroism including the custodian and teachers whampt have you heard on the ground today. 
>>> We have heard that children and adults and schools heard screens over the loud speaker system as it was upfolding because they came over the speakers and the children and teachers heard gun shots in the school and many of them took cover and locked themselves in classrooms and others ran for the exits and one gun boy six years old watching his teacher shot and running for safety out of the classroom. 
>>> Took his freppeds with him. We don't know again how the shooter got in whether they buzzed him because they recognized him or he circumvepted security, sean. Rick, we'll be checking in throughout the night joining me is connecticut state representative john fry is with us and his two nieces and nefew were at the school. Thank you for joining us tonight. A community of 27,000 people fairly well to do miles northeast of the new york city. What can you tell us about the community and what you know from your nieces and nefews. >>> Sean, thanks, it is a great town here. I can't stop thinking about last night, last night sandy hook elementary had a holiday concert that I attended. My niece was part of the choir and I think back to the hundred kids on the stage and their familis and sibblings running throughout the auditorium and 12 hours later this tragedy occurred. 

[00:05:45]


>>> Yeah. 
>>> Obviously, have you spoken to any other people in town and stories that we have been hearing including the custodian and a teacher on tape that I will show in a second and the lengths that people went to protect the children was amazing. 
>>> It was incredible. I know one of my nieces was in the library. And they werushered boo a closest to protect them. My sister did something which I don't think I could have done. She was on the way to the school and there were five or four boys all in first grade running up quite a distance from the fire house and she stopped and picked them up and not knowg what was going on and one of the boys said there was someone with a gun trying to kill them and in the school and she called the school and the police department and she stayed with them. They had emptied out and stayed with them not knowing the fate of her own three kids in the school. 
>>> Just senseless evil and our thoughts and prayers. I hope you know from the country are with your community tonight, sir. State representative fry, thank you for joining me. We go back live to newtown, connecticut where bill hammer is standing by to give us deof the latest tragedy. Bill. 
>>> Sean, the story is not even 12 hours. We were live 10:15 eas time when the news just started to come across the wire. And frankly at the time, we were told one person was shot in the foot and treated in the local hospital. There little nuse after that and that went on for a considerable amount of time. It was 45 minutes to an hour when we learned the details we go back and piece together in the mind. There were no other injuries. There were just dead bodies indeed of the elementary school here in connecticut. And the police were absorbing the information and going room to room and trying to make sure the killer and gunman was accounted for and though one else was inside . Many of the children were told to close their eyes and run to get out of the building and make sure they didn't look around the surroundings where they were. I spoke to a woman whoyce daughter is okay. They were led out of the back door of the school to make sure they did not pass by any of the dead children who were lying there in the classrooms where they had gone to school here. These stories are just so chilling, sean. And when you think. We are learning about this news for the first time. It just bloys your mind the level of evil that rolled through the town today. 

[00:08:54]


>>> I don't think I could say it any better than that, bill. The idea that the kids were told close your eyes as they walked them out. Three stories struck me today that came to pass. The six year old we just mentioned as the shooter was shooting, he grabbed her friends and ran out of the classroom and custod dan running up and down the halls and warning people. And a teacher, numerous stories of teachers hiding kids in closests and locking doors and putting them in the lavatories and one was interviewed by abc earlier tonight. 
>>> I took one of the students on top of the toilest. I knew to get in there and you will be all right. And I pulled the book shelf and we were barricaded in that. 
>>> Dutell them to be quiet. Did you worry. I told them to be quiet. And be absolutely quiet. I was so afraid if he heard us and start shooting the door . We have to be absolutely quiet and I said. There are bad guys and we need to wait for the good guys. 
>>> I just wanted us to be okay. And I was so, so saddened that there are people in this situation that are not okay. And my heart goes out to anyone who knew them. And was part of their lives. I can't imagine. 
>>> It is hard to come to grips with. You called this evil and the parents, I am upon sure many bought christmas gifts for their little children and now planning funerals and christmas eve and christmas day are going to come and they are not going to have their kids home. 
>>> Sean, a few of the things we are learning just now about the victims it is the next wave in the story. You knowledge -- think it is sad now. Hang on. We'll plete the people killed inside of the building. We are told the principal had been in the school district for years. Age fren. She had two daughters and three step daughters and leaving all of them behind and george, a teacher in the district as well tomorrow morning at 8:00 eastern time we expect the state police to give positive identification to the bodies inside of the building. When you are five years old, 10 or 11 days from christmas. You believe that santa claus will be in your house. And today, the devil came to the town and this town has to live with this for the rest of the their lives. 

[00:11:45]


>>> Bill, thank you for being with us. And this is the second deadliest shooting in u.S. History. This investigation is underway. A source told the ap more than two guns were found inside of the school. And we'll update you on that. We'll walk through the days ahead as we continue our coverage on the fox news channel. ] lobster's streets to tell real people about our new 15 under $15 menu. Oh my goodness! Oh my gosh, this looks amazing!

Aids is going to lose. ?????? ?????? 

[00:15:04]


>>> we have endured too many of these trag dec in the past few years and each time i learn the news, I react not as a president buas anybody else would, as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there is not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelping grief they do. The major of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5-10 years old . They had their entire lives athem. Birth days, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams and so our hearts are broken today. May god bless the memory of the victims and in the words of spritzer. Heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds. >>>Hat was president obama earlier emotions running high as the country copes with the senseless trag 20 children and 6 adults and breaking moments ago, a source told the ap more than two guns were found in the school. It was recently reported that two handguns were found. Federal authorities are working to trace those fire arms. Joining me to help explain what the police do now and where they go in the investigation . Rod wheeler was teaching a course on active shooters. And former nypd detective joe coffey. He supervised the late son of sam investigation in the 1970s. Obviously this kid has emotional problems and you have to be crazy and/or evil to kill -- these are babies. Kindergarteners here. You dealt with this. 

[00:17:35]


>>> This guy is a soc path like almost all of them are. People say they are mentally ill and they probably are. People like him, they are socio paths. 
>>> Meaning they don't center a conscience and a sense of right and wrong and no guilt associated with berkowitz. Son of sam. Ed him motive. My mother put meave up for adoption. It is crazy. 
>>> It is it falling back on an excuse. They are socio paths. 
>>> They are offering counseling to first responders because the scene was so horrific and the families, i don't know how as a parent and I am a parent of two kids do you ever overcome I don't know how the recovery coming in. Buwhat are police doing. They have to go through the horror of identifying the boes and going and telling the parents, where do they go from here? 
>>> They have to respond to a call that involves children. It is one of the worst that a police officer can go tompt when you see the carnage that the officers saw today. It is unbelievable and they will have conflict as a matter of fact. What the police are doing right now, there is a number of things. A number of unanswered questions that we are trying to figure out. What was the motive behind the guys action. Granted he was a socio path. Buthere is it always a spark and warning signs in everyone of these cases. Right now the investigators and atf. They are trying to figure out where these guys got the ammunition from and weapons from why did he select this school and classroom? We are trying to figure out all of that now. 

[00:19:39]


>>> You don't have to be an investigator to peace together the fact his mother worked there and he killed his mother and went to the school. He suffered from personality disorder or perhaps tust -- autistic or medication maybe. We'll check in with medical experts later. 
>>> In my business and law enforcement area. You confront evil. He was the epitome of evil as timothy macveigh and berkowitz. They are creatures that shouldn't walk the earth. And these type of people, they are immune to right and wrong. They have no clue. 
>>> One last question. When a cop walks in and sees that, cops see a lot in the course of their career. 
>>> That's right. 
>>> This has got to be particularly traumatic even for them. They have to go in there and identify and people have to clean this up. It is to be difficult for everybody involved in every level. 
>>> It is it the worst scenario that we can find ourselves n. All police officers are professionals and we are train tod respond and we have to respond in these situations. Buwhen it involves children it is the worst thing you can ever experience. We still have to go in and remember them. When the first officer got on the scene, they had no icallyclue whether ther had killed himself. They have to attend to the injured buhad an active shooter to take out. It is a terrible situation to deal with, sean. 
>>> I know one thing, these police officers, they will live with this for the rest of their lives. 
>>> No doubt. I don't know how the parents recover. As a parent I don't know how you recover. 
>>> Coming up. You are looking at hoboken, new jersey the home. Brother ryan lanza and plus word is breaking about the shooter's mental condition. We have the details and stay with us. For the continuing develop ams as they come in the fox news Please Sir, I want some more. More? He has asked for... What? Well he did say please... Please and thank you. Pass it on. ?????? ?????? ?????? ??????

[00:26:30]


>>> Police try to peace together what made 20 year old adam lanza open fire in a connecticut school today his 24 year old brother ryan is in police custody being questioned at this hour. They are outside of the apartment in hoboken, new jersey. What is the latest that you are hearing? 
>>> Just during the commercial break they wrapped up the police tape and it is generally a quiet scene behind me and a very different scene here and part of that confusion likely stemmed from the fact that ryan lanza id was found on adam lanza. You mentioned that he is speaking with police. That is the case. He is not considered a suspect neither he or his girl friend. They rolled up here earlier this afternoon and a reliradiable source said they saw police surrounding the building and ryan was hand cuff taken away. He was determined not to be a suspect however. There were all the sorts of conflicting reports. They thought someone was murdered inside of the apartment building behind me or the father. The father is cooperating with the fbi and they are really talking to the family members, we are learning that adam lanza likely had some form of autism and a permanent disorder. Back to you. 
>>> Is it true that ryan had not spoken with adam in two years,? 
>>> Well, sean I can tell you we heard the reports, buwe have not been able to confirm. 
>>> Tharching you. And in the after math of today's tragedy there were reports earlier this year the sandy hook elementary school implemented safety procedures and so what happened and what else can schools do to prevent incidents from happening in the future? Joining me is director of safe havens international. I was peeking to friends of mine that are in the educational world and they are very clear, this school went above and beyond to get boo school, you had to be identified, and then buzzed in. And it seems like in this case. They were doing everything right, what would be the next step? 

[00:29:02]


>>> Sure, thanks for having me on. And want express condolences to the community and family. I am hearing a number of indications of good things that were in place in the school. Busecurity is only strong as your weakest link. You buzz them and screen them, we are commonlied to test security and can breach security and we have to have good technology and we have excellent technology today and make sure we are using what we know about how people can be trained to detect subtle signs of danger. 
>>> Does that mean. 
>>> No approach is fool proof. 
>>> That's the point. The son of a teacher at the school would be somebody who would probably be let in and you wouldn't know and this is it a town of 27,000. Well-to-do community. Walk in and get frisked. Is another step that every cool has armed guards. They can get in there fairly early. 
>>> There are other tech techniques that can be used . We have had shootings in the schools with metal detectors. There are limits to the techniques. Buthere are things in terms of training of staff and pattern matching and recognition and based and staff is trained to pick up on subtle differences we see it when we buzz in the schools to test them. I have been stopped because they detect something is not right to use about the store tore to get in. If the person is normally coming and going from the school it would be unrealistic to expect they would not buzz the school inform we'll not know until there is investigation . A lot of schools and organizations put in good technology budon't necessarily back tup with good training. The human brain is it the greatest defense mechanism and stur vival mechanism known to mankind according to a colleague I respect greatly. He's right. If we program the brain and teach people there are a number of incidents that have been stopped through techniques. Bunothing is 100%. 

[00:31:28]

They kept it really edgy, and, like, a lot of the latin american muralists and the latin american artists, their styles are very unique and new to their time, you know, somewhat controversial, but that's who I look up to mainly. Personally, I'm very excited about going to college. It's something new, and it's something different than what I'm used to. I'm definitely going to be a little out of my element, but that's what makes it so exciting is that, you know, it's something fresh.

>>> We heard gun shots and the gym teacher directed us to stay against the wall and everyone started panicking and then policemen came in and they just liked if he was in here? But then we had to climb in the closest. We heard more gun shots and the ambulance came and then the policemen told us to run out of the build go to the fire department. 
>>> One little girl's frightening account of what happened in sandy hook elementary school. And the country mourns the tragedy. It is not the first school shooting that the nation has had to deal with. Rachel was killed in the columbine high school mass cure. Darryl, as a parent, all I can think of today is these parents out buying christmas gifts. Kids at this age excited about santa claus and christmas is it coming, and now planning a funeral and no christmas or birthdays, how do you recover? You have been through this. 
>>> Well, tre is nothing you can tell a parent that lost the child. They need their friends and family. In our case, we made choices. We made the choice not to be angry and better but to celebrate rachel's life and today we have the largest school training programs and reach three million students a year with rachel's challenge and train over 300,000 children and school 500 suicides prevented. A lot of the answers are long term. They are not just a knee jerk reaction or more laws and regulations . But we have to be a kinder nation and take time to listen to one another and be role models in these kids. And you are active and in your healing, am I interperting it right. My son craig was in the library and he came within a split second of being killed. And I would have lost two children. My heart goes out to the parents who lost the children and dealing with the trauma of the children going through. And counseling and a they need a lot of love and attention. Our hearts and prayers go out to all of these wonderful poem that lost children tonight. 

[00:39:18]


>>> When duthink you started to recover. It takes a long time to heal this pain. How long did it take you to turn the corner a little bit. 
>>> Honestly, you never totally heal. There is always a hole in your heart when you lose a child. We have children and grand children. But there is always a missing gap there with rachel. It does -- you go through stages of shock ask disbelief and anger and whole gamut of emotions and the initial sting in the fst two or three years begins to wear off and you never lose it completey loo. And celebrating their lives and focus on that and not direct the anger toward the shooter and even fractis and this is not a time for those parent to hear but we chose to forgive and some people can't do that. Forgiveness and focusing on the positive in your child's life goes a long way to helping. Darryl, sorry about what happened to your daughter and thanks for sharing your experience and helping more people. Nand the shotter may have suffered from a personality disorder. Joining me now about the shooter's mental condition. We have doctors here part of the fox medical teem. We heard personality disorder. I heard the term autism and asberger's syndrome. Obvious low the kid at this age shooting his mother and going into shoot with abandon all of these kids. Would any of those conditions tell you that can happen? 
>>> He is out of touch with reality. If he had asberger's he may have had ongoing melt downs associated with violent behavior. It is possible he was on medication and it was not working and he didn't have empathy and had social problems. But that doesn't explain everything and given the age of 20, that he became pscotic and he had a delusional system that led to a heinous crime. 

[00:41:50]


>>> Is it always a medical condition. If someone is disconnected from rolit and no sim thee or consciousness and no soul, there is human evil, I mean somebody can kill innocent children like it seems to me that is it evil. 
>>> I don't know what the doctor's opinion is on I don't let poem off of the hook and say it is it a menal condition. It is an issue of evil here as well. 
>>> Here's what I think >>> the common denominator. Lack of empathy. You can't walk up to the child and kill it and sigh the child fall to the ground or slump over and maintaining any empathy. Why can you lose human empathy. You can be delusional and working on a delusional system. But you could be if you think I do this I save the whole world. And that is one level. And sure personality disorders can do this and other conditions like drug abuse combined with either a mood disorder or personality or all three. But is it a mental illness. Of course it is. That lack of empathy doesn't come from no where. And in 20 years sean I never found anybody who does anything like this that been through hell in a way that creates mental illness. 
>>> This is important I think. First resphonders are going to need counseling and the parents. As a parent they are going to need counseling. And stunes are going to be traumatized and post traumatic stress and different and all like want troops go through. What do you expect to happen to the people in >>> the vet administration locked at 600 kids who were, thank god weren't killed will have stress disorder and they will be aggressive, sad or not feeling help and not sleeping well. It can last for months and months if not years. Cognitive therapy helps. Thank you. And coming up next. A former resident of that tight knit community is standing by. That is coming up next right here on hannity. Music is a universal language. But when I was in an accident... I was worried the health care system spoke a language all its own With UnitedHealthcare, I got help that fit my life. Information on my phone. Connection to doctors who get where I'm from. And tools to estimate what my care may cost. So I never missed a beat. We're more than 78,000 people looking out for more than 70 million Americans. That's health in numbers.

I don't know if that is okay, teachers, but I wanted them to know I loved them and that would be one of the last things they heard and not the gun fire in the hallway. It is horrible, horrible.

>> Would you have them go to vigils and funerals or depends on the kid.

>> I have six children and 1984, we had the palm sunday masscure. This man went in a house and shot and killed 10 kids. They were all sitting around and no one ran away. It is it a freeze thing. When someone is systematically shooting people kids freeze. It is like they were all 12 and under. Six yore old and five yore old and these kids were all sitting around and all had shots. 
>> You saw temperature >> vivid in my mind and the first responders I am sure that was horrific. 10 day I saw and largest mass murder in new york history before 9/11. That is burned in my brain. I can just imagine what this was. How come there was no survivors. This punk. Probably shot them in the head and if he shot body shots, we would have had a lot more survivors. 
>> Doctor, you have seen many. Ni did the autopsies on those. 
>> You have seen a lot. How do you kind of, I guess it is like any job, you have to find a way to compartmentalize what you are witnessing or you don't survive. 
>> In a sense, the deceedents are out of the pain and misery. It is it the partners and families. They are going through a state that will last a few days until they get their babies back. The sivenadults will be autopsied especially the perpetrator. But the children have to be examined and they have document the injuries on the children and if there are bullets in the bodies they have to be removed. To match it up to the weapons and make sure there was not a weapon they don't know about. It takes time. 

[00:58:18]


>> It comes back. And I have been involved with this safe school thing and see something notify. And call number there. And it is coming down. I get calls in the office. Schools now aring for off duty cops with a gun. Let's be honest if a guy had a gun, he might have killed some people you would at least be able to limit it. 
>> That's what I want. 
>> That's why they target school systems. 
>> It is going to come down to it. These are precious thingings. We'll pay for a retired cop with a gun so one of these punks come in. He will not have free will. If he had more bullets and time, he could have killed more until those cops got there. It is horrific. 
>> I think we are headed there especially cops in new york. 
>> I think it is it great. But the good news, kids are resilient and over time, this doesn't have to interfere their life. Will it influence, yes. But the community can come together and heal one another if it landles it proper low and its like they are moving that way.

=======================================================

In newtown area. Our coveragel continue. 
Bill: Coverage continues on "happening now.". 
Jenna: If you're just joining us a school shooting in connecticut. Still uncon fermed details. This happened at sandy hook elementary school about hour and a half ago. According to wires and local reports we're getting some information there are several injuries at this elementary school this friday morning. A few details about this area. This place, this newtown, township, in connecticut is about 60 miles from new york city. 'S a town of less than 30,000 people. So small community and a small elementary school at that we're trying to work on details what actually transpired this morning but according to the latest, we have unconfirmed report from the local paper, the courrant, there are two shooters being reported. One shooter is dead according to this report. Another one is still on the loose. Again very spotty reporting at this time. We're working very hard to get someone on the scene there. You're looking at a satellite sh of this elementary school. Again a very developing scene there shortly after 9:40 this morning according to the local newspaper. Police reported a shooter was in the main office of the school. A person in one room according to police and according to this local report had numerous gunshot wound. Working to confirm this. We have a someone from sanford, connecticut. Veto, how do we find answers to the questions? 
>> You have a lot going on here, one of the main concerns police have you have every single parent with a child in this school trying, and they're trying to get into the school and you have to keep them out of course. What is going on, this is still confusing, it has been since it broke. Now you've got a shooter. What's going on here? Is this a male that had a relationship with a woman teacher that is is going in there? Is this somebody laid off not too long ago. ? You have a lot of answers. The main thing is the children and you may be stuck with them now being locked down until the police can actually get in there and do their homework in the entire school. That's what you got going here, jenna. This is a beautiful city. This is a beautiful city. It is very small. It is ritzy and quiet let's say. It is very different from stamford, bridgeport, new haven and other communities around there. 

[00:02:30]


Jenna: Questions remain as you mentioned and we're working to get some of those answers as this story develops. Here are some live scene shoots we have into our newsroom. Vito, one of the things we're working to get is a picture in the local newspaper being reported on the associated press. Apparently this local newspaper has a photo of younger students, some crying, some looking frightened according to this description, being escorted by adults through a parking lot in line, hands on each other's shoulders. The number one thing is to try to get the kids out of the school. At this point, hour and a half after this news breaks is it likely all the students are out? 
>> I would, I would doubt that right now. It takes a while. You're not dealing with high school kids, even middle schoolkids, very quickly they can go out. You're dealing with five to 10-year-olds probably scared out of their wits right now. Little by little you have to take them out. Make sure there is not anybody else or bad guy in this area. Looks like it will come to a head pretty soon but the whole then during the course of your workday, why, what happened here? 
Jenna: Sure. 
>> Is it somebody disgruntled. Did somebody break up with somebody? Somebody treat their kid wrong in the school? 
Jenna: Very difficult to speculate at this time. Vito, thank you very much. We'll call on you again as we get information. We want to share this with our viewers. Lt. Paul vance of the connecticut state police has this to share with us. He says there will be a news conference on site at 1:30 eastern time. He is giving time frame at the sandy hook elementary school. He says they're not releasing further details at this moment, but he referred to it as quote, a large scene. We'll give you more as we get it. 
>>> Right now some brand new stories and breaking news. 
Jon: You know ambassador susan rice withdraws her name from consideration to be secretary of state. Why she backed out and who's in the running now. 

[00:04:31]


>>> Also a nightre for a former marine, jailed for months in mexico on what his family says are trumped up charges. How they are fighting to bring him back home. 
>>> Almost a century later new information on the hindenburg disaster. We'll look into what caused it with an expert, all "happening now." 
Jon: And a good friday morning to you. The u.N. Ambbssador susan rice takes herself out of the running to be secretary of state, ending a long standoff with senate republican who is promised to fight her nomination. I'm jon scott. 
Jenna: A big development there. Hi, everybody, I'm jenna lee. And the ambassador making it official in a letter to the president saying she didn't want her nomination to become anymore of a distraction. Ambassador rice has been under fire as you know weeks after making statements about the deadly attack on our consulate in libya, originally calling the attack quote, spontaneous. She offered disclaimers in those statements. That term and way she described it, really under heavy criticism by her critics. In the weeks that followed the ambassador met with leading republicans to try to smooth over things. Now her decision could have a ripple effect from the white house to capitol hill, probably reshaping the makeup of the president's second term cabinet and also maybe the senate. Wendell goler is live at the white house with all of this. Wendell, was this rice's decision or was this a decision made by the white house? 
>> Reporter: Jenna, by all accounts it was rice's call although there is no indication president obama pressed her to reconsider. He angrily criticized republicans for attacking rice over her initial explanation for the benghazi consulate attack and in a written statement yesterday he said, quote, while i deeply regret the unfair and misleading attacks on susan rise in recent weeks, her decision demonstrates the strength of her character. Rice told nbc's brian williams, she didn't want to be a distraction. 

[00:06:33]


>> I didn't want to see a confirmation process that was very prolonged, very politicized, very distracting, and very disruptive because there are so many things we need to get done as a country. 
>> Reporter: Meanwhile south carolina republican senator lindsey graham says he still believes rice misled the public and he won't give up his attempt to find out why, jenna. 
Jenna: There were many rumors she would be nominated for the secretary of state position, wendell, it is important to remind our viewers she never was. 
>> Reporter: No. 
Jenna: We're still wondering who will be nominated. What names are you hearing? 
>> Reporter: By all accounts john kerry is now the frontrunner, probablyly without any fight from the senate colleagues over the confirmation hearing. Kerry is the chairman of the foreign relations committee with extensive foreign policy experience. Since the democratic governor of his home state of massachusetts will choose a replacement, the democrats won't lose a senate seat at least not in the short-term. We can expect that announcement reasonably soon. We're hear former republican senator chuck hagel of nebraska is in line to replace defense secretary leon panetta who promised his wife he can return to california. Hagel likely to have easy senate confirmation though israel supporters say hagel is not supportive of enough of efforts to isolate iran. A few other possibilities. Tom donilon becomes the president's chief of staff. Jack lew, former budget director goes to treasury to replace tim geithner who says he won't have a second term and. 
Jenna: A bit of musical chairs as we go into the new year and see who fills those positions. Wendell, thank you for the latest. 
Jon: Ambassador rice might be bowing out but the investigation into our attack on consulate in libya is far from over. The ambassador defending her response in the days immediately after the attack. Listen. 

[00:08:38]


>> I don't think anybody is ever wholly blameless but i didn't do anything wrong. I didn't mislead. I didn't misrepresent. I did the best with the information the united states government had at the time. 
Jon: South carolina republican senator lindsey graham said even though ambassador rice will not lead the state department the congressional inquiry what happened in benghazi will continue. Listen. 
>> Susan rice, in my opinion misled the public and there are other problems with her time and politics and the national foreign affairs arena. Problems were deeper than me and deeper than benghazi but we're not going to let this go. 
Jon: Joining us now for his take on these developments, former u.N. Ambassador john bolton. He is also a fox news contributor. Mr. Ambassador, I'm guessing you read the letter to the, the op-ed piece in "the washington post" this morning which susan rice talks about why she decided to submit her wii drawl letter from consideration. She writes this as it became clear my potential nomination would spark enduring partisan battle i concluded it would be wrong to allow this debate to continue distracting from urgent national priorities. Were there any enduring partisan battles when you were serving in that same job? 
>> Well, probably so but you know, what's unusual about this circumstance obviously is she had not been nominated yet and to have the little exchange that we had yeuterday, she writes to the president. The president issues a statement, results in the obama administration preemptively surrendering on a war that hadn't been declared yet. You know when jim baker was chief of staff for ronald reagan, he operated on a principle thathe president never loses. That you try and structure things so that the president doesn't take any unnecessary hits because you're trying to maximize the president's influence. This is an example of the white house for reasons utterly inexplicable to me announcing they have lost when they didn't have to do it. They could have nominated john kerry, whomever, said he was leading contender all along and away they go. I think it is a real incentive for republicans on the hill on the fiscal cliff talks or whatever it might be, not to overestimate the president's political power. 

[00:11:05]


Jon: She wrote one other thing that caught my eye. She said, after the despicable terrorist attacks that took the lives of four colleagues in benghazi our bought must work through serious questions and bring the perpetrators to justice. We must strengthen security at our diplomatic posts and improve intelligence in a volatile middle east. Is that a bit like closing the barn door after the horses escaped? 
>> Exactly. That is what senator graham and others have been saying. They will continue to press the investigation on benghazi. Why the requests for enhanced security before the attack on september the 11th not granted? Why were we unable to do anything on the september the 11th and where did the administration come up with the story that the terrorist attack was somehow connected to the mohammed video? In a way I think susan rice's withdrawal of her secretary of state candidacy really clears a way potential obstacle. Now there is no talk about racism or sexism. Now we can get to the point the president himself asked for, what did he do wrong? What did his administration do wrong that led to four americans being murdered? So I think it's important to proceed down that road, perhaps starting next week with secretary of state hillary clinton's testimony up on the hill. 
Jon: That is going to be fascinating to watch. Ambassador bolton, good to have you on. Thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
Jenna: We'll get back to the school shooting in connecticut. We're just learning more information on what happened this morning. Harris, you have more for us in the newsroom. 
>> Reporter: Let's catch evybody up in case they're just tuning in, jenna. This is newtown, connecticut. The sandy hook elementary school reported a shooting hour and a half ago. State police in connecticut are assisting local police here in the area and here is what is being reported of the a dispatcher with the newtown voluntary ambulance corps said one teacher has been transported to nearby hospital in danbury possibly with a gunshot wound. We don't k the extent of that injury. I can tell you other schools in the area are locked down. This would affect 5400 children in this very small community in that lockdown position. The school we're talking about, jenna, had toddlers to fifth graders reportedly. What we know now is they are asking parents to sit by a phone and wait for a call from the newtown central community center. They want that as a dispatch rather than parents showing up. They want parents to stay back so they can work the scene, secure it but also try to catch suspects or any evidence that they need to gather at that time along with helping any potential injured. But the other reason is they want those parents to be in a location where they can be easily reached. Should the worst happen and they need to contact them about that. So that's the latest now. Newtown, connecticut. A town on edge, schools on lockdown at this point. No more to report. No deto report on the actual shooter or shooters in this because those reports are still unconfirmed. I don't want to fill in too many details we can't fi up. Our fox affiliate from new york, nyw is in flight to get there by chopper as we learn more about this situation of course we'll bring it to you. Jenna. 

[00:14:25]


Jenna: Harris, a little more information about the school we're just learning. Sandy hook elementary school has nearly 700 students. So quite a large number of students inside that school. Just a little bit more background. School starts its day around 9:00 in the morning. According to the district exterior doors to the school are locked at 9:30 a.M. Any visitors to the school are required to ring a doorbell and staff uses video to identify that person, jon, and to bring them into school or not. Since the shooting happened at 9:30 according to reports, again a lot of questions yet to be answed in many reports we're trying to confirm. 
Jon: Fairfield county where this school is located is one of the wealthiest counties really in the entire country. This is close enough to new york city, 60 miles away or so, it is considered a bedroom community. There are certainly going to be a lot of parents there who commute into new york city. A lot of those parents are maybe just now finding out what has developed back in their hometown, some 60 miles away. There is going to be all kind of panic among parents trying to get back there, get to their children. Of course, as you said, jenna, the police asked parents to stay away from the school for now. They have the situation under control as best they can there at sandy hook elementary. 
Jenna: We should be clear. As of right now we have no reports of injured students we have confirmed. Harris mentioned one report of a teacher, potentially a gunshot wound to the foot. We're still working on getting information. Our local affiliate from wssb is following this. We'll listen to the latest. 
>> We're doing our best as we're getting reports. State police are he is had tant to say anything until they can confirm it. The tone they're giving us this unfortunately will be a very, verier serious incident at sandy hook element tri. 
>> We heard that from lieutenant paul vance state police spokesperson. You heard him from our coverage many, many times. He headed to the scene. He couldn't give us a lot of details while he himself was heading there he did say this appeared to be a very serious shooting at that school. We're talking about the sandy hook elementary school. That is a k-4 school, about the 600 students on dickinson drive. To give you an idea where that is located, I don't know if we get pinpoint news tracker up. We're in western connecticut. Just below the bottom of our screen would be i-84. If you travel through i-84 through connecticut just before danbury before exits 10 and 11, just approaching the new york state line but not quite there. This is in newtown. A very busy area. Many of those roads access on to and off the highway. This is an area right now completely locked down. We have crews all over the state covering other stories this morning where state police happened to be and they reported to us state troopers from all over the state of connecticut are racing to this location. 

[00:17:22]


>> What strikes me reported these on national scene when it happened in other states generally you're talking about a high school or middle school. To hear this happening at a k-4 school is not that it is anymore serious but with young children there it is that much more frightening. 
>> Absolutely. This is video len shot on the way to the school. Len taking video on his phone heading there. Just ahead of him, difficult to see, difficulty point, one of the s.W.A.T. Teams, armored vehicles heading to the school. They raced to newtown from all over the state of connecticut. Connecticut has regional system where different parts of the state are covered by different emergency response teams as they call them. They would have a western district emergency response team would be in that area, would be able to get there quickly. As you see from len's video heading on i-84 from hartford, they called for s.W.A.T. Teams from all over the state. Many, many state police resources there. One person was transported to the hospital. Newtown volunteer ems confirmed to "eyewitness news" they transported someone shot in the foot. This is not just shots fired in the school. We not at least one person hurt in the gunfire. 
>> We're seeing sad photos, kids are traumatized as leaving the school. Parents are asked to stay by the phone. Do not go to the school. There are lines of pirnts at the firehouse where some children were evacuated. At this point we're getting unconfirmed reports there is one shooter. Some reports are saying two shooters. Most of the reports are consistent there are several injuries. There is some new information coming out saying that danbury hospital has already received at least three people. 
>> And also we know bridgeport hospital, new haven hospital, both on standby. As well as they are, all the hospitals have teams they activate in the case of possible situations where more than one person or many people could be injured. Those teams have been activated. Bridgeport hospital, yale new haven hospital and danbury hospital as well. And that has obviously raised the level of concern. They do say right now that much of the work that's being done there at the scene is trying to account for both what happened and who is where. You talk about a school, elementary school, as you were saying kara, we talk about young children, 600 children in grades k-4. Obviously have young children. You have to figure out who's where. Account for all the children. Who was at school. Who was home sick. That process is happening. Staff members, parents, a lot of work on the administrative side to figure out who's where and account for everybody. 

[00:20:06]


>> You are to in days of social media. The principal has a twitter account --. 
Jon: You've been watching coverage from wfsb out of hartford, connecticut that is our fox affiliate there, taking about the school shooting at the sandy hook he will trent -- elementary school, newtown, connecticut. 60 miles northeast of new york city. A bedroom community if you will. A gunman, possibly two gunmen have wreaked havoc at that school this morning. We're getting two separate reports saying that the gunman is dead but more than that we do not know. Other injuries we do not know about other than the report of the person shot in the foot as you just heard. So we are continuing to stay on top of this very fluid situation. We'll be back with more information as we get it straight ahead "happening now." feeling skin.

We're getting our first live look over the screen. You see the dog at the center of the screen? According to local reports there are dogs currently in the school searching, continuing to search probably for evidence or whether or not there is additional gunman. We heard numerous reports on this breaking news there was one gunman, maybe two. Now we have two report that is one gunman may be dead. But as you can understand this is a fast-moving, very fluid situation at the school. Let's notice that car that they have cordoned off, jon. What we also learned today is that around 9:30 is when the school locks its doors. We also understand around 9:30 is when the shooting took place. So still a lot of questions yet to be answered what exactly transpired here. 

[00:25:03]


Jon: We saw in the aerial shot just a little bit earlier, during the commercial break, the triage area where they set up red and yellow tarps, victims are brought out of a scene like this and placed on those tarps based on the initial assessments of their physical conditions. Red obviously being the worst. And nobody was on either one of the tars. That is potentially a bit of visual good news but again it's too early to tell. There are the tarps there. They are as far as we can tell unoccupied. That is a bit of good news. These developments are still very sketchy. Police obviously have their handful just conducting the investigation. Again as jenna said the report is that the gunman is dead. That has come from two separate sources and the early reports of two gunmen have not been verified although it's looking less and less like that may be a reality. 
Jenna: Such a good point. The superintendent's office of the district, the secretary there would not even confirm the shooting about 45 minutes ag so still trying to piece together so much information. As we show you the students, we want to point out to you, this elementary school of nearly 900 students has k-4. So you're dealing with very young children that are at that school. We listened to local news reports that said according to the local hospitals there have been numerous injuries but again we haven't been able to substantiate that. Right now still trying to work out motive and what actually happened here and what actually the students saw because as we all know, as we continue to reflect on these school shootings, what they witnessed is something that every parent or anyone that, you know, don't necessarily have to be a parent to care about what these kids actually went through. Harris is working at the breaking news desk for any new details on the story. Harris, what have you learned? 
>> Reporter: I just got off the phone with the police department, jenna, and they did not indicate in any way shape or form they are searching for anyone at this point. They would not confirm much for me on the phone. I can tell you this. About 15 minutes from now there will be a command post set up in the center there, right next to, this is what I learned, right next to the triage portion. Jon, you pointed out no one is on that tarp right now. They have transported one person. We don't know what they're doing on the inside to bring people out. So that might be good news, it might not be, that there is no one out there on that triage right now. Just adjacent to that will be a command post in a short little while, so people can be told, a, what number you can call if you're a parent. They haven't set that up but they're working on it. The flipside is the newtown emergency communications center they want parents to sit by their phones at home. I told you that earlier. We were able to confirm that. At this point, again, no confirmation that they're searching for anyone. And having seen scenes like this before, jon and jenna, there is not that urgency on foot from this live picture. And that's important to note because generally speaking when there is active search you see that urgency. It could indicate along with the fact that no one said anything to me they were searching for anyone, that they feel like this scene is contained. Their main goal right now is the children, securing safety there and also getting as much information out. I assume we will learn much more in just a short little while as they get that command post set up but I've got good lines of communication into the town right now. We'll update you as I learn more. 

[00:28:33]


Jenna: The associated press, harris, now coming out saying according to an official the gunman has been killed in the shooting at this elementary school. I want to recap the timeline and catch everybody up to what happened over the last two hours. We mentioned to you, 9:30 in the morning at this elementary school the exterior doors are locked and no one is allowed in unless identified through video surveillance service. At 9:40, 10 minutes after that happened, police reported a shooter was in the main office of the school. One person in one room had numerous gunshot wound again according to police. We saw about an hour after that students were being led out of the school by their teachers but we also learned around that time, around 10:30 some students were also still in the school at that time. 
Jon: We are being told as jenna just mentioned, this official is identifying the dead as a gunman, male. We also know that of the seven or eight top people in this school the only male is the head custodian. What I'm saying is that the principal, the vice-principal, all of the top leadership of this school, are all females. So if this was some kind of a domestic dispute that spilled over into the workplace we do not know but that is certainly a possibility here. Again, the gunman we're told is dead. One person, one teacher reportedly shot in the foot. As jenna mentioned another person reportedly shot multiple times, but again the identifications of these victims still in the offing. 
Jenna: Still a lot of questions about whether or not any of the children were witness to the shooting and whether or not we have any injuries among the children. Right now we can report to you that the only confirmed fatality that we've learned of is the gunman as jon has mentioned. We're going to continue to collect information, watch this live scene out of newtown, connecticut. Be right back with more breaking details.

Jenna: Back to that breaking news out of newtown, connecticut, where we're watching the developments in this school shooting that took place about the two hours ago. We're getting a live shot from wnyw. See the triage area, the multiple mats on the ground there? We've seen stretchers out. Luckily we can report to you that we haven't seen anybody injured at the scene. According to some other reports, including a local official, the gunman that is at the center of the shooting is dead. We have multiple reports that are conflicting about injuries and who has been injured. So we're going to wait until we get can get more information before bringing that to you but again sandy hook elementary school, 60 miles from new york city. Small community. Rather large elementary school of nearly 700 students, kin guard 10 to 4th grade. A shooting at this elementary school. Breaking details as we come into the newsroom. Jon? 
Jon: Now that u.N. Ambassador susan rice officially has taken herself out of the running to become secretary of state there is new speculation who president obama's nomination will go to. Right now massachusetts senator john kerry considered to be at the top of the list. Let's talk about it with paul gigot, editorial page editor of "the wall street journal." Ironic, because if it had been susan rice, john kerry's committee would have to confirm her in the senate. 
>> That's right. 
Jon: Now that problem is done away with. 
>> Well, that's right. And it would have been aig fight. 
Jon: Not a problem I should say. The circumstance. 
>> It would have been a big political fight. In that sense susan rice did the president a favor by removing herself from the, from the discussions so that they won't have to have this fight and the president won't have to spend the political capital he would have had to spend to get her confirmed. 
Jon: Interesting, even republicans like senator McCAIN ARE GENERALLY Praising john kerry. Is he a slam dunk? 
>> Remember, the senate's a club. 
Jon: Yeah. 
>> Less so than it used to be but it's still a club and the only senator that I can recall who was not confirmed when he was named to a cabinet position was the late john tower when george h.W. Bush appointed him to be defense secretary. He was defeated. So most senators get the jobs when they're nominated. I think john kerry would not be an exception. 

[00:36:29]


Jon: What about the criticism that, you know, came up during his presidential campaign? This was a young man who went to site in vietnam. He came home and spoke out strongly against the vietnam war and especially about the conduct of american soldiers there. Is that going to bedevil him? 
>> I think it will in some quarters. I think it will be raised. I don't know whether senators themselves or how many of them will have the real stomach to do that because they will say to themselves, well, you know, that was vetted before. He is not running for president. He is running to be, to work for another president. I think some of the other things will come up though. John kerry's views on syria where he said we could deal with bashar assad previously. Wanted to have accommodation with him. Now we know that is totally wrong. You will see some of those issues vet the but I don't know how much the senate really wants to fight again over vietnam. 
Jon: What about foreign policy, let's say he gets the job as john kerry undersecretary of state. What do you see happening? 
>> I don't see much difference between what we've seen. This administration runs foreign policy mostly out of the white house. It has for four years. I think it would for another four years. John kerry would be able to advise at the margins, maybe somewhat less hawkishly than hillary clinton has, believe it or not. He is very reluctant to intervene overseas, for example. Militarily he likes to defer to the united nations. In that sense not much of a change from barack obama. 
>> Very quickly on the political calculation though, the white house generally woip think about nominating senator if they didn't feel they could get another democrat to replace him. What abouttt brown running to replace, well, secretary kerry if he is confirmed? 
>> That would be one of the white house's calculations. Do they want to take that risk of an open seat. If scott brown ran, he would have a very good shot winning again. That might be part of their calculation. On the other hand, they still have a five-seat majority. They would still have a four-seat majority even if they lost that seat. 

[00:38:37]


Jon: Interesting, paul. Thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
Jon: You can catch paul tomorrow as always, 2:00 p.M. Eastern time during the "journal editorial report" right here on fox news channel. 
Jenna: And, jon, we have brand new developments in the school shooting out of connecticut. A live look at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut, 60 miles from new york city. According to an unnamed official talking to the associated press the shooter is dead. At least one teacher wounded. And apparently the students when this happened, the shooting, were sent out into the parking lot. We showed you that one picture, one group of the students being led out in a line but apparentlies a the scene is coming together we're getting this picture, one shooter, a teacher wounded and a lot of questions about unconfirmed injuries that we've heard from multiple sources in and around the area. Want to point out one more thing. Although we hear the shooter is dead we told you about 40 minutes ago we were hearing reports there might be two shooters. Right now those reports are unconfirmed and we're hear being more details the shooter pave had two guns. As these stories develop often times we have to go back to pnt pieces of the picture exactly what happened here. According to the associated press, the shooter dead. At least one teacher wounded. The injuries unknown. And at that time no reports of injuries when it comes to students but we're still working on that information. As we learn more we will bring that to you.

Jon: "Happening now", still trying to clarify exactly what happened in newtown, connecticut, about 9:30 this morning, a little over two hours ago, when a gunman apparently walked into sandy hook elementary school with two guns we are told and opened fire. There are report that is one teacher was shot in the foot. We're told another person was shot multiple times, and the gunman is confirmed to be dead. But again, a very chaotic scene. We don't know whether there were any students injured. We don't know whether students witnessed this terrible event. Obviously the parking lot is full of emergency response vehicles. Parents have been told to stay away. There is a firehouse where pares are being told to gather to find out about the situation regarding their children. Again, we have no indication at this point that any children were actually shot or affected by this but, again, the information, it is still a very chaotic scene, this incident, less than, well, just about two hours old now. Because the chaos and the questions yet to be answered we don't know all of the answers but again the gunman is reported to be dead. Initial reports had two gunmen involved. That often results from multiple people saying that they saw slightly different things, slightly different descriptions. So in an abundance of caution police will sometimes be on the lookout for more than one gunman but at this point we don't have any indication that is the case. Again you can see our fox fill at, wnyw chopper is over the school in the air. Newtown, connecticut, less than two ours ago we'll keep you updated as the situation change. 
Jenna: A new report from the senate intelligence committee find enhanced interrogation techniques used on 9/11 suspects were in effective. This is a 6,000 page report. It is not made public, but one official says waterboarding used on khalid sheikh mohammed didn't help find usama bin laden and were actually counter productive to the war on terror. We're joined by mike baker, a former cia operative. We're mentioned this report was passed along partisan lines in this committee. There is controversy about it. Your thoughts? 

[00:45:35]


>> It shouldn't be any surprise the civil liberties groups and democrats on the committee jumped on board with this and republicans did not. There appear to be, this is part of this is speculation, seems if they went through the report and calling it an independent report but I do believe it was partisan, there were some things omitted. There were a lot of interviews that weren't done with people directly involved but, you know, continues sort of the drumbeat that took place for years during the previous administration, during the bush administration by democrats and people on civil liberties side, they grab the high ground. They said look, you either talk and chat to a detainee, you know, try to win them over and get information, or it's torture. Their point was and they grabbed this high ground early on in debate, there is nothing in between. That is insane. That is nonsense. Of course there is enhanced techniques in between that fallwell short of torture. 
Jenna: Can you give us an example. 
>> Sleep deprivation under controlled circumstances. Temperature control. Audio issues. Stressed positions. Part of this is that we already released so much information about that program. 
Jenna: You bring us to a larger point hire. This is just one report but I would like to talk to you a little bit about the cia how it operates now and how it does its job which is ultimately to protech the united states of america. There has been so much happened in the last 10 years but there's also a lot that happened in the last several months, with libya, with the petraeus scandal as well. How do you think this plays into the ac work that the cia needs to accomplish on a daily basis? 
>> Right. We would like to think the threats to america from terrorism have ended. There was a little bit of that ground swell for a while. People realized, no, that is not the case. There are still hostile elements out there that spend their days figuring out how to attack us and our allies. When you talk about enhanced techniques, when you talk about taking that off the table, and the aggressive intear graduation techniques were stopped by bush administration. It happened years ago. It is pretty clear to our enemies overseas what it is we can and can't do. 

[00:47:46]


Jenna: How does that affect our ability to protech the country? What have we really learned, if we take independent of this report, what have we learned? Are we better off? 
>> We are better off because we understand the enemy more. We had a lot of success over the years taking out a lot of their key personnel. They have almost seems like bottomless pool of potential recruits. But when you talk about, are we better off? Well, it's a little bit like this report, right? How long is a piece of string? People say techniques, i keep wanting to go back to the report, these techniques didn't work. It is inane to say they didn't work ever. The reality is, always a little bit more complicated. The reality is, sometimes enhanced techniques work, sometimes they don't. What we did though in our rush to show how righteous we are during this process was we took them completely off the table. We removed the element of surprise from the kit bag. Whether you use them or not, you don't tell the enemy what you can and can't do. What we did --. 
Jenna: What is the damage for that? 
>> The damage is, going forward and going forward for quite some time ever since the obama administration said all we could do with what is army field manual, I couldn't break my teenage daughter with the army field manual. You advise those in the future who work against us if we pick them up off the battlefield they though exactly what we can and can't do. The element of surprise is important in the interrogation process. 
Jenna: As we look ahead to the year ahead and how safe we are. Great to have you on set with us, mike. 
>> Thank you. 
Jenna: Really appreciate it. Jon? 
Jon: A fox news alert and we are going to take you back now to a live look above sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connect cult. This is new video just into the fox newsroom from our wnyw chopper. You see the cordoned off area in the parking lot of that school where nine:40 this morning a gunman walked in to the school and carrying two guns and opened fire. One person shot multiple times. The a teacher shot in the foot. The gunman himself is reported to be dead. You can see people carrying children out. This was an elementary school. And is an elementary school. What children saw or heard we do not yet know. Parents have been asked to stay away. The children were taken out into the parking lot after the shots rang out.

jon: Fox news alert and a very fluid and chaotic situation in newtown, connecticut, where a gunman walked into an elementary school 9:30 eastern time this morning a little over two hours ago and opened fire. We're told that gunman is dead but what are the other people inside the school? Harris has some new information for us from the breaking news desk. Harris? 
>> Reporter: I can tell you that a code red was issued to this town not long ago and now we're hearing from separate --, I want to draw everybody's attention to something we're seeing in the middle of the screen. The car that is pulling in the center now appears to be that of the type that a coroner's office would use. We're working now, we're hearing in the newsroom that from different sources that there are multiple injuries and in this now, possibly children among them. I have not been able to get the mayor, the police officers, to confirm this for me but I can tell you that at 1:00, as we reported, 1:00 p.M. Eastern here, they will be holding a news conference to let everybody know what they have learned about the situation and bring us all up to speed and who was injured and possibly worse today. Reports, you're seeing it on our screen right now, of multiple injuries, fatalities as well at the school. I'm not able to confirm with sources on the ground but i have heard now from different people away from the scene, including nearby mayor of danbury, mark bouton, who said multiple people are hurt in this. As we learn more we'll bring it to you. Jon, jenna. 
Jenna: Harris, you mentioned mayor mark bowden on the phone from neighboring danbury. Mr. Mayor, what can you tell us about the situation and about the potential injuries? 
>> Well at this point our HOSPITAL IS TREATING v. Victims in danbury. The there will be a presser at 1:00 the press will be able to attend to get more details what happened. Obviously our hearts and prayers go out to the folks and victims and families of the victims right now. It is a difficult time for everybody in the greater danbury area. All of our schools at danbury have heightened police awareness and presence as well as all the regional schools in the area. So we're working on it hard and we'll bring all the assistance we can to newtown. 

[00:55:50]


Jenna: Mr. Mayor, you mentioned three victims at the hospital, what can you tell us about them. Are they teachers or students? 
>> I can't discuss who they are and nature of their injuries. I will tell you that some of the injuries are, are serious but other than that I can't discuss it. 
Jenna: What about the children? Do we know if the children in the school witnessed this incident? Do you know if it happened inside a classroom? 
>> I don't know the details. Our crime scene investigators along with state police are doing what they need to do which is piece together the incident. I'm sure there will be much more detailed information at 1:00 for everybody but obviously in the area a very scary situation for all parents in the greater danbury area. 
Jenna: We want to ask you on our screen. We have reports of multiple fatalities from a local newspaper. We've been able to confirm through local officials, the associated press, that the gunman is dead. Do you know of any other fatalities? 
>> There are multiple fatalities and the gunman is dead, that's correct. 
Jenna: The multiple fatalities, again we can't identify the people -- 
>> I can't. 
Jenna: Of course. We understand. We want to be respectful of that. Mr. Mayor, we appreciate the information you can provide to us. Can you take us back to what you do know transpired this morning, perhaps give us an idea of what happened early on? 
>> Well, obviously the shooting took place earlier this morning. I will say newtown, the town of newtown, their administrative team did a tremendous job managing a very difficult situation. They're obviously very tied up right now and will be talking a little later what the steps they took. Every community since 9/11 in this area has an action plan, whether relates to school shooter or mass casualty, event. We drill it all the time. We practice it all the time. The kids practice it all the time. That's why we do these things with tragic situations. We're ready for them. 
Jenna: We see your response by the way. The response looks overwhelming on the ground, with state and local police. Have you heard of any motive for the shooting? 

[00:57:56]


>> All that is open for investigation. That is something we'll find out as the afternoon goes on. 
Jenna: Getting back to fatalities at this time, what can you tell us about the fatalities? Can you give us any information on whether or not it is administration, teachers, children, anything? 
>> I'm sorry, I can't. I just can't. 
>> That's okay. We understand. Our viewers have been so patient with us for the last several hours and you have as well because it has been a very chaotic situation. I want to point out to our viewers, often times, mr. Mayor, you know this as well, she is shootings happen in high schools. When you have high schools you have students, they are texting, tweeting on facebook. There is lot of communication right away. We have to remind our viewers these are little kids, kindergarten through fourth grade. 
>> That's right. 
Jenna: At this school. That definitely affects information. Jon you have questions for the mayor as well. 
Jon: Part of the frustration for parents, the police had to sweep the school and insure there is no other danger. Has that been completed at this point as far as you know? 
>> They're still working on a sweep. That is the correct protocol. That is drilled with each police department on the area. There are maps of every school, closet, building. They take a very, pragmatic approach and go through each of their own class to -- place is secure. Soou're absolutely right, they're working on that right now, and that's the appropriate procedure going forward. 
Jon: Some of the early reports suggested there might be multiple gunmen. Have you seen anything to verify that, or are we just talking about one shooter here who is dead? 
>> I've heard that same report. I don't have any information that would either confirm, you know, or dispel that report at this time. It's an active, very active investigation. State police take the lead along the newtown police department and, obviously, our police department's providing any help necessary. 

[00:59:56]


Jenna: We've heard that some of theamilies are being told to go to a local firehouse. 
>> Yep. 
Jenna: Can you give us a status report, have families been reunited with their children, or is it still a process of them going right now? 
>> It's my understanding that most of the children have been reunited with families. They had, again, my hat goes off to newtown. They did a tremendous job in managing a very difficult situation. They had, you know, a plan in place, an evacuation plan in place, and they followed it to the t, it worked. They were able to hold the students and protect the students while this catastrophic event was going on, and I'm pretty sure everybody's been reunited in terms of children and families. 
Jenna: I'm getting some more breaking news into our newsroom from your local newspaper, the hartford current, that says that the shooting took place inside the kindergarten classroom. Can you confirm that for us? 
>> I cannot. 
Jenna: Okay. Mr. Mayor, what do you think's important for youwe take a look at this community, again, a k-4 school, nearly 700 students. Have you ever had something like this happen before in the community? 
>> You know, this is a very quiet, peaceful area of the country. No, we haven't. But I will say that there's a reason why we have all these emergency management plans and they work, and this is the reason why we even drill with kindergarten students about how to evacuate the building appropriately. This is why. So with the right planning, we avoided what could have been an even worse, catastrophic event than we have here, and the parents can feel comfort that the greater community have a plan, the kids know that, and it pays off when you have an awful situation liker -- like this. 
Jenna: Mr. Mayor, you've been most gracious with your time during a very difficult situation. We so appreciate the time with you and wish you luck throughout the day. We'll, of course, stay close for more information, but thank you very much, sir. 
Jon: Mark dowden, the -- bowden, the mayor of danbury, connecticut. An ominous report of what may have happened at this school, just before christmas, right in the middle of hanukkah and then this happens on a beautiful friday morning outside danbury, connecticut. 

[01:02:10]


Jenna: If you're just joining us now at 12 eastern time, 9:00 on the west coast. Earlier this morning, around 9:40 east coast time, a shooter walked into the sandy hook elementary school, and we don't know where or what exactly transpired, but there was a shooting that took place. According to one local report now -- and this is the first we're hearing of this, so we're going to be careful with this report -- that the shooting might have taken place in a kindergarten classroom. According to a mayor from danbury, mayor bowden, he said there are three victims at the hospital. He wasn't able to confirm their state, but he did mention that the injuries are serious. He also confirmed for us one report that there are multiple fatalities. We do not know the identities, we do not know the age. These are certainly developments and details that will transpire over the next several hours. Police were called to the scene right away, it's local police, state police, and if you can see on the corner of your screen right there, there's a car. You see the yellow tape kind of marked off around that car. We don't know any information about that car, but we do know a shooter entered the building right after, jon, the school apparently locks its doors in the morning, and that's part of their safety procedure for the nearly 700 students in that school. 
Jon: Our fox affiliate, wfsb from hartford, has been working the story since it broke this morning. We're going to take you there now and listen to some of their reporting as it comes in live. 
>> Reporter: Heightened state of security at their schools as well upon hearing this and, of course, one of the big things that we are waiting to hear and that police are working on right now is what possible motive could be bemind this shoot -- behind this shooting at this school. We do know at least one other person other than the gunman has been shot, and the gunman is dead at this po 
>> Reporter: And as our sister station in new york city is saying, at least three people were injured, two children and one adult. All three have been taken to danbury hospital, but they also say they're looking for a car, maroon or red-colored vehicle with the back window blown out. That is something thatcbs out of new york city is reporting. Again, we're just trying to give you the information that's coming in from so many different sources, choosing the ones we know to be the most reliable with the associated press and our sister stations, wcbs. They sayaw enforcement officials have confirmed this to them. 

[01:04:29]


>> Reporter: And to give you an idea how chaotic the scene as you look and see the resources at the rear of the firehouse that's being used as a staging area, just to give youen an idea, robert goulston reported that police officers came out of the woods escorting a gentleman who was telling people there i had nothing to do with this. But that's the kind of response we're talking about, where anyone found in this area was at least questioned by police, and they want to talk to anyone who was there. Police also just as we are working right now to try and get a handle on act -- exactly what has happened. It looks like the helicopter pictures are having a little freeze-up, but that was a shot of the firehouse where this took place, and you can get a better idea of what that scene looks like. The firehouse is just above that label that says dickenson drive at the middle of the map. The building you can see at the upper left of that label is that firehouse, and that is where robert has been going live, reporting live for us this morning, and then you see the long driveway, the white building -- the firehouse -- the long driveway leading into that school, and that's where police are swarming. 
>> Reporter: Police are efforting to have a news conference, 1:00. We understand they're going about two miles away, and they realize that the public is certainly wanting to know as much as possible, especially parents. A reverse 911 call has already gone out to the residents of newtown informing them of this school shooting at sandy hook elementary. Danbury times is reporting that students started to hear the gunshots during the morning announcements. 
>> Reporter: I'm sorry to interrupt you, cbs is now reporting that at least one child at the school has died as a result of this shooting at an elementary school, sandy hook elementary school, at least one child at that school has died in this shooting. So, obviously, we had feared that that would be the news that we would be getting, that there was more casualties. We know that the gunman is dead, and now we are hearing cbs news confirming at least one child there dead as well, just heartbreaking news. 

[01:06:35]


>> Reporter: Absolutely heartbreaking. Let's go live to robert there on the scene. Robert? 
>> Reporter: Yeah, there is a lot of tenseness here and a lot of confusion. Parents just showed up here, of course, after they started getting information that there was some sort of shooting incident here at sandy hook elementary school. And just look around, you can see all of the emergency vehicles, all of the participants mixed -- parents mixed in together. Of course, the police are trying to secure the scene over at the school. We do know that there have been at least several people shot. Parents are getting information from emergency officials that one of those people shot may be the principal. We are still trying to confirm that. State police are staging an area about two miles from here where they will be doing a news conference to get out some official information. Lieutenant paul advance will be the one -- paul vance will be leading that in the next 20-30 minutes. Of course, we will be at that news conference. But right now over at the school parents just confused. We're hearing that, they're very tense. As we were showing up, a lot of the parents were walking out with their children, very young children, third, fourth graders, and they were, of course, very emotional. A lot of them were crying. One parent telling us that his child told him that sy walked into the classroom and shot the teacher. That's just some of the information. We asked that parent how your child's doing, he was running up the street saying I don't know at this point. So they're still trying to figure out that. There's a lot of information that's coming out. Again, the news conference will be happening about two miles from here. We have a crew there, we'll be getting that information very shortly and hopefully to shed some light, lieutenant paul vance telling us this is going to be one of the worst shooting incidents that we've seen in this state in a very long time, those were direct words from him. But right now newtown police here trying to work with the participants. It seem -- parents. It seems that state police are actually handling the investigation. We have also seen federal agents here including from the atf. There's a lot of heavy weaponry that's being used to go into there. We also are hearing reports that at least one of the gunman finish if there are, if there is just one, maybe more -- was shot and killed. We don't know if that was self-inflicted, or if he was shot during the initial response. Excuse me, live right now you can see some of the ambulances leaving the area. They're coming out of the school, and we know that several people were injured in this, and right now we're just trying to figure out exactly who. We've talked to a woman, they do not have details on who was actually shot, but there are some reports that there have been at least two with fatalities, maybe more. Again, lieutenant paul vance telling me this is going to be one of the worst shoongs they've seen in a ve long time, and can that news conference is supped to happen momentarily about two miles from here, and we do have a crew there, and we will be bringing that to you live. For now, channel 3 eyewitness news. 

[01:09:45]


>> Reporter: Robert, thank you. 
>> Reporter: Setting the scene there -- 
jon: Those are lye reports coming from our fox affiliate, wsfb in hartford, connecticut, and again, only o now words about the situation that's unfolded this morning in newtown, connecticut. You can imagine how terrified the parents are to hear that there are reports that a child or perhaps more than one child has been shot in this terrible event this morning when a gunman apparently walked into a school, opened fire perhapsn the kindergarten classroom. And authorities are apparently saying it is one of the, it's going to be one of the worst multiple shooting events in connecticut history. 
Jenna: It's interesting, jon, here we are nearing three hours of watching this story develop, and for the first few hours we had no reports of any fatalities other than the gunman, and very quickly the situation has changed where we have learned now of multiple fatalities and getting some more details about who may have been targeted or affected by this shooter. According to a local newspaper, the artford current -- which we've been relying on heavily for some of the latest reporting out of the area -- we're getting a picture from some of the children about what happened inside of the school. One 8-year-old telling the paper that police were checking everybody inside the school before they were escorted to the firehouse, and they told the children they had to walk with a partner. That was one sne by one third grader at the school. Another child leaving the school as they were leaving said there was shattered glass everywhere. A police officer apparently ran into the class room where this student was and told them similarly to run outside -- simply run outside and keep running until they reach the firehouse. The firehouse is key. You may have seen it in a few of our shots, it's where the local authorities are telling the parents to go where they can be reunited with some of the students there. And this is an ongoing process, parents being reunited with students. Yet we're waiting on details about the injuries and also the fatalities that we're just learning about. 

[01:11:48]


Jon: Again, it's still developing there. Outside danbury, connecticut, a place called newtown, an elementary school, k-4 grades. All of the front office staff as far as we can tell are females. The principal, the vice principal, some of the school leadership, all women. Whether that figures into what happened here, we don't yet know. But we're continuing to keep an eye on the situation. We'll get more developing, more details as they develop, try the wring you -- bring youhe very latest just ahead on "happening. Now" n. Clear, HUH? I'm not juice or fancy water.

[01:15:24]


Jenna: We get you back to connecticut as we learmore about that breaking situation there and the school shooting n. The meantime, want to turn to washington, d.C. And the latest news there as we get more fallout from the deadly consulate attack in libya. There are conflicting reports on whether secretary of state clinton will actually testify to a house committee on that ambush that killed four americans including our ambassador. Secretary of state clinton was expected to face the house foreign affairs committee next week, but now the state department is saying maybe not. Chief intelligence correspondent catherine herridge is live in washington with more details 
>> Reporter: Good morning. Really three key developments this morning, the republican chair of the house intelligence committee has said he believes there was, quote, gross negligence on behalf of the state department for failing to adequately protect the ambassador. As we first reported here on fox, there was an emergency meeting in benghazi, and at that meeting they sent a cable warning hillary clinton's office in washington that they could not withstand a coordinated attack and that there were at least ten islamist militias or al-QAEDA GROUPS TRAINING IN Benghazi, and they asked for more assistance. Those requests were turned could be and -- turned down and, in fact, the security presence was further drawn down after that emergency meeting. Number two, there's a back and forth over the appearance next week of the secretary of state. Both of the relevant committees are expecting her on thursday, though the state department is suggesting that the date may slide arguing that she is not required to testify or would not anticipate testifying until this internal review called an accountability review board or arb is complete. And then the last development which I think is extremely significant is based on these regulations. These regulations cover this internal state department investigation. Based on these regulations, there does not appear to be any requirement for the complete, unvarnished report to be sent to congress when it's complete. There only appears to be a requirement for hillary clinton to provide to congress her summary or bulletints, if you will, of that report, and that has to be done within a 90-day period. So the question is whether there will be a move by congress to subpoena secretary of state clinton to testify if necessary and whether they will push for the result, unvarnished report if necessary. 

[01:17:41]


Jenna: Catherine, thank you. 
Jon: More on this with republican senator bob corker. He was opposed to ambassador rice's possible nomination and joins us now. So she has withdrawn her name for consideration. Does that in any way change the investigation into what happened in benghazi, senator? 
>> Oh, I don't think so. I think certainly susan rice had nothing to do with the security. I think most of us just thought that she was a little bit more of a political operative than she was a principal and had concerns about her service. I never thought she was going to be appointed, by the way, or at least I haven't for some time because I think the white house was able to see the reception that she got there. But, look, benghazi, I was able to yesterday see the footage from the drone as far as what happened on the ground. I was able to also see from security cameras the groups that were coming in. I do think that we will continue -- there's no question we're going to continue to force a look at the security measures there because the way folks were able to come into our compound with such ease in an area that is totally controlled by militias, I think, is something that every american wants us to make sure we pursue to its end. And I do think secretary clinton will end up testifying, and i hope that the arb is ready for, ready thursday for her to come in and do that. I mean, that's what we expect, and I think she will come before us. 
Jon: President obama has said these were unfair and misleading attacks on his u.N. Ambassador and suggested that the politics of the moment played a role here. 
>> Yeah. 
Jon: What do you say to that? 
>> Yeah. Well, I do think the politics of the moment played a role, and they played a role with ambassador rice coming on five sunday morning programs and acting very much like a political operative. And I've tried to move onioned that, jon, and -- move beyond that, jon, and say, look, first of all, I would have given her a fair hearing. I do not think she was going to be confirmed. It wasn't just that, it was just her nature. She just strikes most of us who have had contact with her through the years more as a political operative. Most of us see the office of secretary of state as something that is almost a first among equals. We want someone who is independent. We know they're going to support the president, but we want someone who will pull the president in a direction that's good for our country when he's off base and maybe pursuing something that politically is maybe good for him but not good for the country. We want somebody more independent, and I think most of us felt that she was not independent, more of a political operative and a loyalist, and i think we'd like -- I know we want someone who, again, is steeped in the knowledge about issues around the world, but is going to be independent enough to pull the president in the right direction when he's off base. 

[01:20:40]


Jon: All indications are that the front runner is your fellow senator, john kerry. Would you support him? 
>> Look, I hate to say anything good, jon, about anybody because it may be bad for them -- 
[laughter] but I do think that, you know, john kerry -- I mean, it appears that he may be the person. I think he would be confirmed quickly. I think people do view john kerry as someone who is a principal, does have that independence. Obviously, he was, he would support the president, but i think he has the ability to pull things in the right direction. I will say that before anybody comes in in that position, I do hope we'll get this benghazi issue behind us. I think it's incumbent upon secretary clinton to come clean, to allow us to know everything that's happened around this issue. And I think we need to get that swept up and cleaned before we, before we start a new regime, if we will. 
Jon: Everyone wants those answers. Republican senator bob corker of tennessee, we appreciate you coming on today. Thank you. 
Jenna: Back to the breaking news now out of connecticut and the school shooting that took place this morning. We're learning a little bit more potentially about the shooter in all of this. And up next, we talk to a parent of a student at sandy hook elementary school where a shooting took place this morning, 9:30, 9:40 eastern time. The very latest with that parent after this quick break. 

[01:25:19]


Jenna: Back with us now with some more breaking news out of newton, connecticut. You're seeing a live shot of the woods, apparently, this is probably behind the school. I'm still getting more information about ha this live shot -- what this live shot is showing us. Police were out in this area, and they looked like, potentially, they were searching for something. And I think you can see some movement in the center of your screen there. So I'm going to wait for some more information on that so we can tell you exactly what's going on, how this figures into the investigation. In the meantime, I want to bring in lisa. Her daughter, leah, is 8 years old, a third grader at sandy hook, and lisa's been gracious enough to join us and tell us a little bit about what happened this morning, lisa. Can you tell us what your daughter told you happened inside the school? 
>> Yes. She was in a, um, a small class, a reading group, and they started hearing, um, I guess bangs, and her teacher -- which I'm so grateful for -- there was just a small group, they rushed the kids into the bathroom, and they locked the door, and they just told the children that it was hammering and tried to keep them calm. And the next thing I know, because it's very hard to get a complete story, the next thing i know is that, um, the police came in, and they were knocking on the door to be let out of the classroom, and when they were, she had seen glass and blood. One child was covered in blood, but I understand that child is safe and was not hurt. It must have been somebody else's. 
Jenna: We're hearing some different reports about the injuries and fatalities and still trying to learn more information as we can to bring that to our viewers and everyone that's watching and listening right now, lisa. What was your experience as a parent? When kid you first -- when did you first hear of something happening at the school, and what happened after that? 

[01:27:21]


>> Well, I was -- it was funny, because I was on my computer, and, um, I get breaking news, and they were -- the schools were on lockdown because of a shooting in sandy hook. And when I think back, I thought it was the town. And the next thing I know, I get a call from carrie summers, her reading teacher, who is my hero right now. I can't thank her enough for calling me and telling me that my daughter was safe and at the firehouse. So they brought the children from the school, the majority of them, to the firehouse, and they -- 
jenna: And what was the scene like there? 
>> Chaotic, chaotic. All I know is that, um, I had children crying, and I knew their parents, so I called them on their cell, and one parent was scared about her first grader. She couldn't find -- so I looked for a teacher, and I could not find, and I know I think this this happened ha in first grade. 
Jenna: We're hearing a few different reports. Some are suggesting the principal's office, some are suggesting the kindergarten class. As you mentioned, maybe the first grade. 
>> Yeah, I heard first grade. 
Jenna: Have you heard anything else? I know that the parents are probably trying to compare notes about, you know, what happened, who did it. Have you heard anything like that? 
>> No, I have no idea. I'm watching the news now, and it's saying that the gunman's dead, and the principal may have been shot, and there was a woman with also shot in the leg, but i don't k. 
Jenna: We've heard some of that as well, but we appreciate that because it's been one of those situations that's been so chaotic, and we've been trying to piece it together for our viewers. How is leah doing right now in. 
>> She's fine. I don't really think that she totally gets it, but she did see, you know, her -- more than I would have liked her to see. She did tell me about a little boy that was in a police officer's arm, and he was bleeding. So -- but I don't know she gets it or -- 

[01:29:24]


jenna: You know, one of the mayors from the neighboring town, mayor bowden, joined us and said the schools in the area really practice this. Has your daughter been in the school since kindergarten? Had they practiced the drills, evacuation procedures? 
>> I believe so. It's a safe school, and I can't say enough good things about teachers and the staff. Um, you know, if anybody -- it would be sandy hook school that has it down right because, again, it's the best school that you can -- I'm grateful for my kids to go there. 
Jenna: Have the teachers or authorities given you any guidance of what to do next? 
>> No. 
Jenna: Have they said they're going to talk to your daughter? 
>> No. I'm still in a state of shock, so I don't know the next step. I don't know. 
Jenna: If you could just stand by with us for one moment, lisa, but because I think we're getting more information about what we were seeing on the screen there with the woods, jon? 
Jon: One -- I would just say, jenna, that one parent told authorities said she heard two g bangs at the time of this shooting. We also know that the federal, the department of alcohol, tobacco and firearms is on the scene. They have recovered more than one firearm and, again, we were told that the shooter walked in with at least two weapons. But whether there is still an active search underway for a second gunman, that's the question, and that may have something to do with that helicopter aerial shot of the woods outside the school. It is a fairly wooded area. It's 60 miles to the north and east of new york city and not heavily populated. There you can see it appears to be a search dog looking around in that area under that tree near the school. 
Jenna: Back with lisa just for a moment. Lisa, you said this is just a school you appreciate the teachers and love the experience that your daughter has had so far. Just in general as you reflect, and I know you're still in a state of shock right now, what is next for the school? Do you, do you foresee returning your daughter to class on monday, or is that, again, still something that's unknown? 

[01:31:30]


>> You know, I don't know the details, and -- nor did I ever want to go through this experience. So, again, I'm in kind of, again, just I don't know. I don't know. 
Jenna: We can understand that, and I don't -- you know, it's my fault. I shouldn't have gotten ahead of ourselves, because it's still a situation where we don't have a lot of answers. Lisa, I just really appreciate your perspective, especially as a mother in the area. Thank you so much for the time. 
>> Thank you very much. 
Jenna: More on this breaking news out of connecticut when we get back. to and... Social Security are just numbers in a budget. Well, we worked hard for those benefits. We earned them. And if Washington tries to cram decisions about the future... of these programs into a last minute budget deal... we'll all pay the price. AARP is fighting to protect seniors with responsible... solutions that strengthen Medicare and... Social Security for generations to come. We can do better than a last minute deal... that would hurt all of us. 

[01:35:39]


Jenna: We continue to follow this very developing, chaotic situation out of newtown, connecticut. A school shooting took place around 9:40 eastern time this morning. Harris has some brand new information for us now. 
>> Reporter: All right. A couple of things. They have broken down in just the short little while, jenna, the try I can't imagine area -- triage area. The second development is coming from abc news, and we are working to confirm this for ourselves. We know that a news conference is about -- scheduled about 24 minutes from now with the fewtown police department joined by federal officials who are now on the scene. Abc news is reporting through those federal local contacts that they have that a dozen people possibly have died today here. Again, we're working to confirm that, among them children, according to abc news. Here's what I can tell you. The atf, the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and exclusives is there at the scene. They have sent seven agents from the atf there to the school in connecticut. The agents from the atf have reportedly collected firearms. We're not told how many. But they are now working with the state police in connecticut with whom I've spoken with today so that we knew we had multiple shootings here. We still don't know the configuration, how many adults, how many children. Abc news, of course, reporting these fatalities through their sources. We're working with ours now to term if this up. -- Full-term this up. Jenna, we knew early on in this story that this was anticipated to be the worst in many years shooting scene in this connecticut state history. An elementary school with possibly more than one crime scene inside the school through what we're learning from reports. The principal's office, a kindergarten classroom, possibly multiple firearms. We know the atf is picking those up now. Children among those injured, according to abc news, children among those killed today. A terrible situatio a code reddish shoed throughout the town. I knew that earlier from the emergency management agency there on the ground in newtown, connecticut. Jenna, jon? 

[01:37:57]


Jenna: Harris, thank you very much. Want to be very clear with our viewers, we have two major items confirmed right now when it comes to this school shooting, and that's about it. We know that there's a school shooting, and we know that the good gunman is dead. As far as the fatalities and injuries, we have zero details on that confirmed. We hope to hear directly from the state and local police in, hopefully, around ten minutes, so we want to get those news items confirmed to you, but we do not want to rush anything at this time. It's such a sensitive story. A shooting at an elementary school, k.4. Nearly 700 students there. We'll keep you posted as we hear more. 
Jon: Well, "happening now" to one of the big political stories coming out of washington, it didn't take long for the blame game to start. This after ambassador susan rice withdrew her name from consideration to become secretary of state. Nbc's white house correspondent chuck todd was quick to blame what he called conservative media. Listen. 
>> There were legitimate questions to ask about the benghazi story, but the idea that she belonged in the center of those attacks never made a lot of sense. She sort of became a victim of this. 
Jon: So what about that? Fair? Let's check in with our news watch panel, judith miller, a pulitzer prize-winning investigative reporter and kirsten powers, a daily beast columnist. I guess chuck todd would have us believe that susan rice, ambassador rice's statements on the morning shows about what happened in benghazi played no role whatsoever in her decision to withdraw her name from consideration, judy. 
>> Well, of course, this is just -- it's ludicrous. Chuck todd has been a great defender of susan rice, and i have been very, very critical -- as you know, jon and kirsten -- of the administration's handling of the benghazi disaster. But I will say this, the response to susan rice, the focus on her, the killing of the messenger is, as joe scarborough has said, disproportionate. And I find it very unusual that this campaign, though led by republicans, was quickly joined by liberals and by left-wingers who accused susan rice of being too cozy with african dictators. She was getting it from all sides. What really, really offends me is the personal natures of the attacks on her by journalists who should have known better. Maureen dowd called her too ambitious, too unprincipled for the country. Dana mill banks said that she had an attitude problem. This kind of reaction was totally inappropriate. 

[01:40:40]


Jon: Kirsten, we also heard from andrea mitchell who said this was not going to help republicans, forcing a woman of color out of the consideration to become secretary of state. Where does that play into all this? 
>> It's irrelevant. It has nothing to do with anything. First of all, we've had a woman african-americanecretary of state, you know, a republican, actually, who was confirmed by the same people who are criticizing susan rice. And can, you know, I think that the storyline that somehow -- and this was what susan rice said in her withdrawal -- was that she somehow got caught up in partisan politics isn't a true story. Because as judy just said, there were liberals that came after her in very personal terms. The criticisms from the republicans were actually about benghazi, and, you know, the criticisms from the left were much more perm, and I think -- personal, and I think, was the turning point. I think if the left hadn't gotten on the bandwagon, maybe she wouldn't have had to withdraw her name. So clearly the tide turned against her when you had a major new york times reporter coming out against her, for example. 
Jon: Well, and are the media remembering what happened to john bolton -- 
>> exactly. 
Jon: He was given a recess appointment, and tried -- you know, his name was submitted to the full senate for confirmation, but that was shot down, judy. Nobody seems to remember that there was mostly partisan politics involved in that. 
>> I mean, in the has always been partisan, it's always been political. Nominees of major national security officials are not exempt from politics, but they should be exempt from the kind of ad hominem, personal, really vicious attacks that we saw against susan rice. It was completely uncalled for. There were reasons to oppose her on policy grounds. The republicans pretty much stuck to that, and I agree with kirsten. If this hadn't been joined by the left, she wouldn't have had to withdraw. 

[01:42:41]


Jon: Judy miller and kirsten powers, our news watch panel, thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
Jenna: Any moment now out of newtown, connecticut, we expect to hear from state and local officials about what transpired at sandy hook elementary school, still trying to piece together multiple reports from a variety of sources about what actually happened inside that elementary school about three hours ago. Again, reports that there are multiple fatalities, identity, age yet unknown at this time. We want to be very careful with these reports as they come into our newsroom. We did hear from one parent just moments ago, a parent of an 8-year-old in the a school who said that her teacher was able to get the little girl out by hiding and locking themselves in the bathroom and then being able to escape. Jon? 
Jon: Let's also take you now to washington, d.C. Where jay carney is holding his daily briefing, talking about the susan rice situation. Let's listen in. 
>> So at this point I'd rather just inform you that the president has been informed about the shooting, was informed at 10:30 and is being given regular updates as more information becomes available. 
>> Will we hear from him today? 
>> You know, we'll just have to keep you updated as more information becomes available. 
>> Two other topics. In the abc news interview, the president was asked about the legalization of marijuana in a couple of states where voters sounded off on that and essentially said that, um, it's not a high priority for him, no pun intended, I guess, to go after recreational users. But, obviously, this is a serious issue, states' rights versus federal rights. And I'm wondering if there's any concern that the president's comments could signal that states, you know, it's okay to go ahead and pursue your own policies on marijuana, we're not going to enforce it at the federal level? 
Jon: All right, we are -- and my apologies, I thought that jay carney was going to be talking about the withdrawal of susan rice from contention to be secretary of state. He did mention that the president was informed about the connecticut school shooting and has been staying on top of the situation. Harris has breaking news for us now. 

[01:44:53]


>> Reporter: Yeah. This is just coming into our newsroom. A hospital in danbury, connecticut, which is not awfully far from the scene of where the shooting happened, almost three hours ago now, in newtown, connecticut, that hospital spokesperson saying that it is on lockdown out of an abundance of caution and to protect confidentiality of the patients which have been taken there. They have only the needed staff at that hospital at this point. They've sent others away. So, basically, if you are not essential to saving lives at that hospital, you've been told to go home. They have only treated three patits, they say reportedly. Again, this is the hospital in danbury, connecticut, not too far from the scene in which you're. Watching live on the screen now, that's newtown. They do not anticipate any more patients to be transported to their hospital at this time and, of course, we know this, they are not releasing any specific information about patient status, so on and so forth. No discussions that they've had with any of the families. I do want to caution, jenna said this earlier, jon, I think we all have, that as information comes in on this story, we have to be careful about reporting numbers. We have seen a jump in the reports about how many people have been shot and possibly killed today. I can tell you from different sources the numbers are above 12. Some of them have them as high AS IN THE 20s AT THIS POINT. Injuries and fatalities. We're working here at fox news to shore that up. We want to be responsible in telling you what we can confirm. We also want to tell you because, of course, we're in the world of twitter and everything else, you may be seeing it, that we're seeing the same reports. We're chasing them down. No doubt about it, this is a horrible scene playing out in newtown, connecticut. Back to you guys. 
Jon: And as you were just speaking there, harris, we got some information in that at least five children are dead. This has been confirmed by our fox news producers and confirmed by two law enforcement sources, at least five children dead, four adults dead, and the number, again, as harris just mentioned, could go higher. The adult gunman is also dead. The initial reports indicate he drove to that school from new jersey. Two handguns were recovered from the scene. The status, the motive here still unknown, absolutely no indication what the motive was according to one investigator. But that's going to be pieced together in the days and weeks to come. Teachers are being called heroes for the way they responded, having locked their classroom doors to keep the gunman out. And apparently, many of the fatalities took place, as jenna was saying earlier, in a kindergarten classroom. Just an awful situation. We are still waiting for a police briefing. The news conference set to begin in 15 minutes or so, but obviously, in a fluid situation like this very often those things are postponed. You can see the bank of microphones there at the ready. 

[01:47:58]


Jenna: A fluid situation, jon, as you just mentioned. State and local firms are involved. We just heard from jay carpny that the president is aware of this school shooting and is receiving regular updates on it. We also understand that the fbi is supporting state law enforcement at least at this time. What you've been watching along with us for the last several hours has been a very organized chaos, if you will. Many responders to the scene, multiple ambulances, but at the same time we've been questioning about what actually happened with the injuries and fatalities. We're learning more about that now. As harris mentioned, as jon mention ld, we're just getting initial reports at this time that there are children among the dead to the left of your scream, you see someone running. Guys, is that a live shot? Just to be clear, what you're seeing behind the school there with the wooded area, as we saw one of the scenes that seemed active, some law enforcement rushing into this field in the back, and we're still trying to figure out how that, that adds into the investigation. Were they concerned about an accomplice? It doesn't seem to be the case at this time despite some early reports. What about the weapons? We're hearing multiple reports, one being confirmed that there were two guns at the scene, but whatbout other firearms as well? Again, a very developing situation three hours in. We do know the shooting took place 9:40 eastern time, right as classes got started. 
Jon: There alsoere reports that authorities were still looking for a second vehicle they believed to be involved, they were looking for a burr gandhi van with a blown-out back window. Whether there might have been another gunman involved, again, it seemed speculative in the early going, but they are apparently actively looking for a second vehicle. Harris is still working the story for us from the breaking news desk and perhaps can bring us some new information. Harris? 
>> Reporter: You know, as the story was breaking, one of the things that I do, jon ask and jenna, is I do jump online and try to see who I might want to follow. Representative john fray, who serves his seventh term right now connecticut house of representatives, has been tweeting out in the last short while that he has nieces and nephews at that school, that they have been pulled out, that they are at the firehouse, and they are safe. Representative john fray says that he is learning there on the ground and seeing reports that a gunman who was masked came into the newton town school. So this is one of the areas that we'll follow, those local officials, if you will, those elected officials who are communicating via online. Back to you guys. 

[01:50:32]


Jon: All right. Harris faulkner working the story from our breaking news desk. Again, we have been told to expect a police news conference in about ten minutes, but very often in a situation like this those things get pushed back and back and back. Still a very chaotic situation even as recently as, oh, half an hour ago or perhaps a bit more when we were speaking to the mayor of danbury, he said that the sweep of the school was still underway. Police go in in a situation like this, they have to make sure that they have covered every base and cleared every classroom, so they have a sizable elementary school that houses normally about 600 students to go through, and they were still upside way with that project -- underway with that project within the last hour. So, again, we have it confirmed that there are at least five children and four adults who are dead in this situation, but the number could go higher. 
Jenna: We're actually hearing some confirmation that the number probably is higher at this time and also learning a little bit more about the shooter in this situation. According to one of our fox news producers, we're now learning that the shooter was wearing a military vest. There is a possible second shooter, but that is not confirmed at this time. As we've mentioned to you in the reports about the second shooter have gone back and forth along with the report of an additional car that law enforcement might be looking for. According to this one report from our fox news producer as well, we're hearing that there's 26 deiced at this time. -- deceased at this time. Eight adults and 18 children according to our latest information. At this time, as you continue to take in video that we have of the scene along with the live shot of the press conference that is going to be underway in a moment, we can also report that there is no current, active shooter. We did tell you that the gunman, one gunman was dead at the scene. What transpired, whether he took his own life or whether or not law enforcement was involved, we do not know. We do know that police have cleared the school, and the governor of connecticut is on the scene as well. 

[01:52:35]


Jon: We are told that that number, jenna, the 26 dead actually does not include the gunman. We're told that 18 children are deceased and eight, eight adults who were working inside sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut, it certainly ranks as within of the worst -- one of the worst mass shootings in this country in decades really. 26 dead so far. Who was the gunman, what was the motive? We don't know yet. But, again, that number could go up. Three people have been taken to local hospitals. We don't know anything about their conditions. Again, the fact that a relatively small number of injured were taken away is, in this situation, not a good sign. 
Jenna: We felt some comfort earlier on when we were watching the live scene at the triage mats that were on the ground and thinking, well, maybe if there's no one being taken out of the building on a stretcher, maybe this is limited in scope. And what we're learning now is a very different picture, indeed. So again, as we're reporting to you, 26 deceased at this time; 8 adults, 18 children. Where the shooting took place is still undone firmed. -- unconfirmed. We have heard differing reports, one being the principal's office, one being the kindergarten class, the other the first grade. A parent joined us a few minutes ago, her third grader was in a reading class, and her teacher told the class this is construction work, this is a hammer and got the students into a bathroom and locked the doors there. They kept that door locked and kept the students inside the bathroom until police came and took them to the firehouse. The scene that they describe, the young student, the 8-year-old, says she saw shattered glass in the building, some blood as well. She also saw a police officer carrying out what looked like an injured little boy. The status of that little boy, his identity we don't know at this time. Trying to figure that out for you asell. 

[01:54:39]


Jon: The shooter, we're told, WAS DRESSED IN BLACK BDUs AND A military-style vest. It certainly sounds like the kind of preplanned thing that you saw in the aurora movie shooting massacre. This doesn't necessarily have all the hallmarks of a domestic dispute that cause somebody to suddenly snap and walk into school, this sounds like it was planned. But, again can, you know, all of that is for another day. Right now there is the grieving to handle. Eighteen students, we're told, are dead at this connecticut elementary school. Eight adults as well at the hands of a gunman who took at least two weapons, a glock and a cig sauer, into an elementary school, possibly even a kindergarten classroom and opened fire. It's just beyond comprehension how somebody could want to do something like this, but that's what they're dealing with in connecticut right now. 
Jenna: The big question for all these stories is why, you know, what is the motive, why would anyone do this ever? We know that's a question we struggle with and you struggle with at home, and brightly so. Harris -- rightfully so. WE SAY BDUs, THAT'S BATTLE Dress uniforms. This guy however old he was was dress inside what seems to be described in military gear, and that doesn't suggest it's official military gear. You can buy this stuff online, and, you know -- 
>> Reporter: Absolutely. Your connection to the military and mine as a dependent, i immediately wanted to know more about what this guy might have looked like. Now, remember the representative there, fray, had tweeted out guy seen masked gunman. Mask we're not positive about, but dressed in black bdu uniforms, those are vital to every mission. That's how they're termed in the military. They're cutting-edge military gear. That would mean this guy walks on the scene, he's going to be a tough target even if you do have an opportunity to take him out the way he's dressed and quite frightening. Can you imagine this for the children? We want to bring everybody forward now with the story. The timetable for the news conference is shift ago little bit. We were hoping it was about three and a half minutes, they may take a little more time. We'll pop up with it as soon as it happens, of course, here on fox news channel. But I can tell you from very early on lieutenant paul vance with the newtown police department there and his emergency response team were working first to get the triage together, they pulled that back when they realized it wasn't necessary and peeled those tarps off the ground about 45 minutes ago. And then they were setting up the command center about two miles from this location. We know that that has been the central point. They've notified the president from there letting him know, and I would guess many more details than we were given very early on and even now. So as we wait for that news conference and we get those heartbreaking numbers that now are being confirmed; 26 dead -- not including the gunman -- 18 of them children. No doubt we'll learn more possibly as early as the top of the hour, but potentially a little bit after that. Jon and jenna? 

[01:57:55]


Jon: We are awaiting this news conference from authorities. It appears that they are getting ready to begin, harris. They are giving some microphone checks and so forthright now. You can see in this videotape from earlier, um, just the chaos that erupted outside this elementary school. Newtown, connecticut, a very, very peaceful place about 60 miles to the north and east of new york city. Not the kind of thing where you expect this to happen on a beautiful friday morning just before christmas and in the middle of hanukkah. But just what an awful situation has really transformed that village, that town as a gunman walks into this elementary school with two guns and opens fire. 
Jenna: A town like so many across our country, jon. Less than 30,000 people, a school with nearly 700 students, kindergarten through fourth grade. Again, according to unconfirmed reports, the kunder garten class -- kindergarten class is potentially where the main part of the shooting took place. Although we do know that 18 children are ilved in this shooting are dead, we do not know their ages, we do not know their classes as we've heard conflicting news from the ground there. It could be a first grade class as well. We've also heard of multiple deaths as well with adults. So hopefully when we get this press conference, we're going to get more details for you because the information coming out of this breaking news situation has been difficult on so many levels to piece together. 
Jon: It's just been an awful morning. It started out with the early reports of a shooting, and we just did not know how bad this was but, again, the indications are that 26 people are dead, 18 of them children. The gunman we do know is dead, although there is talk of potentially a second gunman that police are still looking for. We are awaiting that news conference and perhaps we'll get some of those answers then. 
Jenna: Continuing coverage now

=======================================================

>>> Good evening. I'm chris matthews in washington. Tonight, we have to get our headround it to understand why things like this happen will take much longer. But let's get to it. We've got michelle franzen on the scene, clint van zandt, psychologist jeff gardeer. We have nbc white house correspondent chris tin welker. We've got larry johnson, the president of the national association of school safety and law enforcement officials and james johnson, baltimore county police chief. First we go for an immediate update to my msnbc colleague, michelle franzen. Michelle, thank you for staying with us tonight. 
>> Well, hi, chris, we're here in the newtown area of connecticut, just nearby a couple of miles from sandy hook elementary where the shooting, tragic shooting, took place earlier today. At this hour, hundreds of rez dents are gathering at a nearby catholic church for a vigil. Holding a prayer for those who have lost their lives today, those youngest lives, anywhere betweenergarten and fourth grade where those student were shot today. They're holding a prayer vigil and trying to comfort the families that they were told lost their loved ones in this town. It's a small new england town in this area. A very rural area in the central part of connecticut here. And the school, certainly k through 4 that with mentioned, we don't have the identifications or the ages of the school children and their names that are being released. What we are being told is that investigators are processing that school now. They will be dealing with identification of those students and trying to return them as governor malloy says of connecticut, back to their families so they can mourn and grieve their loss during this time. This community certainly just now getting out of the sadness and shock part and this grief heavily starting to set in. What we don't know about the shooter at this time is his exact identification. They're trying to process that information, as well. There are numerous reports that they're trying to figure out the exact identification he had at the time. But those family who is have lost those children, 18 who died at that school this morning, chris. Two others that were transported to a local hospital and died later. And six adults and then, also, the shooter that died. 27 people in all killed in this small area community here. And more details that we'll be learning about the heroics inside that school as this tragedy played out. We're hearing about how teachers that were in that section of the school where this happened, when they heard shouts or the shooting that started to begin, that they gathered those children and they hovered in an area and we've seen the images of parents who were reunited with some of their children. We 'seen some of the expressions. Many told to cover their eyes as they came out of that area. Again, this tragedy, we're getting used to hearing this, but, chris, this shooting involving some of the youngest victims this time around. 

[00:03:42]


>> Let me ask you what we know about the time. Here we are at 7:00 eastern right now in our second edition torrent. And I'm asking a very tough question. The bodies of the young children, and that's what they are, young children, 20 of them now all together, the 18, are their bodies still being held at the elementary school? 
>> I think investigators are still trying to deal with that scene there. And we've heard from law enforcement that they are beginning to work through that school to identify the bodies, to get the bodies out of there. But we are told by one law enforcement officer that's krieb describing the scene on the inside, that it's very difficult to deal with. The bodies in there that they have to deal with and what they have to view that it's going to take several days to actually make sure that they're able to process that scene in there. 
>>> Gentlemen, thank you. We do know a bit from all the reporting by the major organizations, new york times and associated press and our own nbc efforts here. It wasasically a guy who had mental illness history of some kind. He got up this morning, killed his mother. Took guns that were registered in her name, including an assault rifle and two semi-automatic pistols with lots of ammo. Headed off to the school where she thought and her two classrooms. After killing a number of administrators, adults, and began to kill the students, where there's 20 dead. What does it tell you? Can you get to anything if that's all you knew? 
>> No, it's really hard to tell exactly what was going on with this person. There are a lot of people in this country who have mental illness. At any one given time, it's estimated that about 25% of this country is suffering from a mental health disorder. Now, only 1 to 2% of people have a really serious health disturbance or they might be psychotic or delusional. But just because somebody has a mental illness -- 

[00:05:51]


>> of course not, no. Bud psychosis, and the ability to kill your mother and 20 kids? 
>> You know, there are so few cases of things like this, it makes it very hard to study. We know that sometimes men in particular will kill their kitz just to get back at the woman because they know that that's the most effective way to hurt the one that they really love. So I think that in this particular case, maybe, he killed his mom. And then he wanted to kill the things that his mom loved, as well. That's why he went back to the school and killed the kids that she's been involved in teaching over the years. 
>> Let's get another view, a second opinion. I know that we'renly getting the profile of this case. We're looking at the fact that this 20-year-old killed his mother and then went in killed 26 people. And there we have it. What does that mean? I mean, it doesn't happen. It rarely happens. Your thoughts? 
>> Yeah, it does rarely happen. But I think what was going on here, the possibility that he could have killed himself, killed a person who's very close to him, who's his mother. Maybe someone else and then killed everything that his mother believed in, which was education and nurturing children. It tells me that, yes, this is about extreme rage but also about severe mental illness. To kill the most innocent parts of our society. Bad enough the teachers, administrators, but to kill innocent children, this is a rage that I believe was fuelled by delusion. Psychosis. He is at that age for onset, possibly, wn't foe know for psychosis, schizophrenia. He knew he was not going to come out of this thing alive. And that was his major statement about hate towards his parents, towards his mother, but especially towards the world. 

[00:07:57]


>> Is it premeditated? 
>> I believe that this was premeditated. It was part of his long standing, I believeelusional system where this had been building up for quite some time. But, again, part of that delusion. A lot of people will say, well, he couldn't be insane if he planned this out. Insanity is a legal definition. So what we know right now is that this person had some severe, mental illness. That's all we can make as far as an educated guess. 
>> But legal sanity is the ability to know the difference between right and wrong. How do you determine that in this case? 
>> Well, in this case,e don't know what he was thinking as far as what was the difference from right and wrong. Certainly what he did was extremely wrong. You have to go back to the pre-morbid history. If we don't see a very long history of psych yach rik illness and we don't really know whether he was on medications, whether he had problems with compliance with meds or whether his family knew that something was going only, which I suspect they probably did. This does not come out of the blue. 
>> Josh, I've read about people who are hired killers. They get used and hard to doig anything you can imagine. Going in and shooting young kids, kindergarten age, in their face. Literally in cold blood. Literally knowing it's the real world he's in. How do you cross over from fantasy and sigh quo sis? 
>> Well, when people are in the midst of a psychotic episode, they really can't distinguish between reality and what they're experiencing. I think it would not be appropriate just to say because head's doing this in realtime, that he actually understands and appreciates what he's doing. He may be in a complete psychotic state. I think it's hard for people to understand that some people can meticulously plan. They can execute something like this, be psychotic and have no idea what they're doing. 

[00:10:13]


>> What's the role of suicide? Is that essential to this kind of multiple shooting? Where does it fit here? 
>> You know, I don't think that necessarily the suicide mean much terms of the real reason why he did something like this. I think he knew there was no way to get out of this thing without facing massive consequences. 
>> Jeff, yououghts about suicide? This obvious mass murder situation? 
>> I see it a little bit different. By looking at many of these cases of the mass shooters, they have made a decision. They made the decision that this is going to be terror, horror and then they're going to take themselves out. There's no way they're going to come back from this, so everybody is going to die, including themselves. 
>> Is this a statement to society they're making? In their own, horrible way? Who are they talking to when they do this? Jeff? Who are they addressing with this horrible act. That they want to know that they did it. 
>> They're addressing society. You marginalize me. You don't think much of me. You hate me. You don't want me to be part of you. And, in fact, what we know, chris, this is what they really think about themselves. And then they project it onto those loved ones and they project it out to society. Zo this is the way where they perhaps felt like they have no power. Now they have all of the power. And that's why they can stare a child in the eyes and shoot them point-blank because they are in control of that horror. 
>> Dr. Wiener, who are they talking to? 
>> Well, you know, I think that what they're trying to do is send a message that they mean something in this world. It's a very sick way. But I've seen people in my practice who actually talk to me about having these fantasies of going in and committing mass atroies. When I ask them about it, they say well, my life means nothing. And when they look at people who seem happy, who seem like they're doing well in life, it makes them really angry. And so they feel like they want to make a difference and this is their way of doing it. 

[00:12:38]

>>> we've endured too many of these tragedies in the pasfew years. And each time I learn the news, I react not as a president, but as anybody else would. As a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there's not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings. Kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. 
>> We're back. That was a very emotional president obama early this afternoon at the white house. Nbc's christin welker is live from the latest in washington. Christin, it's such an interesting and powerful moment in the presidency. Being president is to be us. Is to be our em blematic person and to react almost like the adult in the family the grown up, you know? 
>> Absolutely. Absolutely. And president obama today add miting that he was responding to this to this tragedy not only as the president, but also as a father who has two daughters. And that is how he watched these horrific events unfold. We certainly saw that raw emotion come out when he addressed the nation a little bit earlier today. The other thing that stood out about his commen, chris, he talked about the need for meaningful action, saying it is necessary regardless of the politics. He didn' into details today. I expect during the coming days and weeks, we will learn a little bit more about what he meant specifically about meaningful action. The last time he talked about gun control and this type of issue were in the days after that horrible shooti aurora, colorado. I'm going to read you a little portion of that speech because it fleshes out what was behind his words today. The president saying he believes in the second amendment. But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that a.K. 47s BELONG IN THE HANDS OF Soldiers, not in the hands of criminals. That they belong on the battlefield of war. I believe the majority of gun owners would believe that we shouldo everything possible. That a mentally unbalanced individual should not be able to get his hands on a gun so easily. So those are some of the policy issues, I think, that are behind those words that he made today. And, again, we expect those words to be flushed out in the coming days and eks. I can tell you that this debate has already begun here at the white house. People going online expressing their frustration, their sadness, their grief today on the white house web site. But also calling for stiffer gun legislation. But president obama was notified about this tragedy at about 10:30 this morning. He has been receiving updates throughout the day. He reached out to the director of the f.B.I. Well a to the governor of connecticut, governor malloy. Also express the fact that the federal government will stand with the president as it deals with this unspeakable tragedy, not only emotionally, but offering up its full resources to the state of connecticut as it begins the healing process. What will undoubtedly be a long and dark process of that state. The president ordered the flag lowered at half staff and throughout washington, d.C. And to your initial point, chris, the president making it clear that this is something that is not only a tragedy for the state of connecticut, but the tragedy for the nation, as well. His emotions certainly overflowing today. One of really the most emotional moments that we've seen from this president. 

[00:20:27]


>> I agree with you completely. Thank you so much, christin welker. We'll be back with more cove raj of the shooting at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticu vacation earth. 
(All) the gulf! It doesn't matter which of our great states folks visit. Mississippi, alabama, louisiana or florida, they're gonna love it. Shaul, your alabama hospitality is incredible. Thanks, karen. Love your mississippi outdoors. I vote for your florida beaches, dawn. Bill, this louisiana seafood is delicious.

>>> welcome back to "hardball's" coverage of the tragic shooting this morning. Back with us live from newtown, michelle, you're there tonight live. I wonder what it feels like. I wonder what the people of that community are all sharing right now, the grief? 
>> Well, we've certainly felt this emotion grow throughout the day as the des of this tragedy unfolded. And, at this hour, they are continuing to hold that vigil that we talked about earlier at a nearby catholic church. Hundreds gathering there. Residents and families coming together and mourning together, trying to make sense of this tragedy together. I think we have a live view of that vigil at this hour. And several people have commented who are attending the vigil tonight, that they just wanted to come together. That, of course, many of them knew of the children at the school, whether they made it out or did not survive today. And they knew the families. It's a very close knit community here. So they're coming together, trying to of condolences and trying to make sense of what could have possibly prompted the shooter to go ahead and take such -- so many innocent lives today as these tragic events unfolded. This vigil will probably see more events like this in the days to come as the community comes together to make sure that they are around for these families. Of course, any time of the year, any place this would happen would be tragic. But, of course, we're coming upon the holidays. There's a lot of holiday decorations in place, the local fire house was supposed to be having a christmas tree event tonight. Instead, they offering refuge to those families who had lost their children today at that school. It is a close-knit community. The governor said evil has touched this community today, but they will come through this. We've also heard from secretary duncan who also said that they will be here to make sure they get through is tragedy. There's also been an out kl pouring of emotion people reaching out from that area knowing exactly what these families are going through today, what they're going to be going through in the weeks and the years ahead. We're watching the governor making his remarks. 

[00:26:33]


>> In these times of trouble, when the unthinkable happens in our very midst, our faith is tested. Not just in the religious sense, not necessarily in our faith in god, but our faith in community. And who we are and what we collectively are. And it's, in so many ways, permissible to have those thoughts and doubts about who we are and what we are and what community represents. But that we turn to understand as we turn around this room and recognize our friends and our neighbors. Those we have done things for and those who have done things for us. This is a great and beautiful community located in a great and beautiful state in a great and beautiful nation. In the coming days and coming weeks, I would pray that you all embrace one another. That you lift one another up. That you understand the difficulties that you collectively will undergo. Keep in your prayers the children who lost their lives today. Keep in your prayers the adults who lost their lives today. Understand that a test is just that. That which we rise to and answer and respond to. As many of us prepare to celebrate the birth of christ, understand that that, too, will bring sorrow as we think about these instances that have happened so close to those days. That, too, will pass. All of the public officials who have assembled here today and in the presence of your great select person, I bring and extend the con doll lances of this entire state. May god bless you. May god bless our children who were with us today and those who were taken away. My god bldults who lost their lives today. Thank you.

>> That's governor dan malloy. He happens to be a democrat, in fact, that couldn't be less relevant tonight.

Got it. 

[00:32:02]


>>> As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it's an elementary school in newtown or a shopping mall in oregon or a temple in wisconsin or a movie theater in aurora or a street corner in chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods. And these children are our children. We're going to have to come together and take more action to prevent tragedies like this. 
>> Meaningful action. Today's tragedy in connecticut brings the issue of guns to the forefront of america's minds tonight. With me are two people with personal experience with gun violence, u.S. Congresswoman carolyn who lost her husband in a 1993 mass shooting on a commuter train. By the way, we called the nra, the national rifle association hoping to get someone from that organization on tonight. They said they're not commenting until more information is thoroughly known in this case. Congresswoman, thank you so much for coming on. I know this brings it all back, but I thought it was great. I said we've got to get carolyn McCARTHY BECAUSE HER REASON TO Be in public life, to take on the voters to deal with the public life was this issue of the horror that hit your husband. 

[00:34:13]


>> And it was. You know, it's not funny, but, yesterday, in my office, we sat down to plan what we were going to do for the next term. And I said, listen, I came here to congress to reduce gun violence. We have to do something about it. The president's words meant a lot to me today because his tone was different. We have to take this head on. And I know that the white house had said earlier that this was not a time to talk about gun violence. You know what? They're right. It should have been years ago so that hopefully we wouldn't have had to go through this. There are things that we can do to hopefully cut down the amount of killings. But my heart goes out to the families and for those that lost their loved ones. Here we have the holidays. This is when the christmas tree is up, the hanukkah lights are lit. Children shouldn't have to worry about going to school and facing these kind of tragedies. But my heartbreaks for the survivors and the parents because I know what they're going to go through. I know that I'll be lighting another candle tonight for all of those families about praying for them. But the conversation has to go forward. 
>> I remember when bobby kennedy was killed. And johnny carson, we all liked in those days, said I never asked the people to do anything like this, but write your congressman. So I dutifully wrote my congressman about kbun control. But the people who care about reasonable gun control get concerned when an e moegtsal horror like this ou curs. And then the nra comes back to its fund raising. The people concerned with the gun horrors lose interest. How do you sustain a balanced look at gun control and gun ownership in this society. 

[00:36:18]


>> I think that because we have to keep that message out there, all of the time, and not wait for a tragedy like this that happened. 
>> When you think ablt it, a couple of weeks ago we had a shooting with an nfl player. One of the commentators. He couldn't believe the hate mail he got. He couldn't believe how people came down after him. That's why people are afraid to speak out. They're afraid of the nra. They're afraid of the large lobbyists. And that's the same thing, chris, as the members of congress. Whether republican or democrat, you see that that they cow behind and not getting anything done instead of standing up. They're afraid they're going to lose their next election. If we can save a whole bunch of lives, isn't that what we're supposed to be in congress for? It's not taking away the right of someone to own a gun. 
>> Next up, you were at virginia tech, you're a survivor down there. And I'm glad you were. Here you are. But a lot of people in the gun ownership side, the second amendment people say if a bunch of people have guns, they could shoot this guy down when he walks in the door. I can imagine what we heard the days ahead. If some of those school officials would have been armed, they could stop them before he got to the kids. 
>> Right. You'll be hearing it. But I don't understand it. We are the most armed country in the modern world. And we have the most problems with gun violence. If more gunnings solved our problems, then we'd be the safest country. The conversation that the vast majority of americans are having is the reasonable middle ground. That's something that gun owners, nra members support themselves. It's the leadership that has this absolute extremist approach. But the real people understand that having a background check is not going to stop them from getting a gun. 

[00:38:24]


>> These were two glocks, semi-automatic weapons -- 
>> and a bush master. 
>> Yes. Can you stop access to getting if they broke mentally when they bought the guns? Or they got them from someone else who got them of sound minds. The laws don't control an easy transfer. You can sell it to a friend, lend it to a friend or steal it from a friend. 
>> Right. There's not one thing that's going to stop all shootings. And we can't always have the conversation about how can we have prevented the last shooting that happened. We need to be talking about the eight kids that die tomorrow. 
>> Tell me about the bush kl master. 
>> That's a gun that wasn't sold in our stores. It's a high-powered, military well. It's something used in war zones. It has no place in our society. Anthink the vast majority of people like gun owners realize that. 
>> You must have watched the president today when he spoke with such emotion. He's such a cool guy. We know that. That's a nonpartisan assessment. Today, he had to stop himself for almost a minute there. We've just been struck again by one of our own, one of our own has killed 28 people that are dead today that would have been alive tonight having dinner and enjoying friday night. It's a fact. And he had to say that to the country. How do you get across the fact that this isn't the kind of thing that has to happen. It's the kind of thing that might not happen. 
>> I would say to the president, there are out there. Go to the may your and get the 700 mayors that are trying to make a difference to reduce gun violence. And I agree with my colleague that, you know, it's not one thing that's going to stop all of these kinds of shootings. We're talking about going over the financial cliff. Oir states right noul have closed their doors to young adolescence and to people who need counseling because they have anger. So I mean, these programs all have to be put in together. That's who we, as a society, and we, as politics, should be doing. But I have to say. I do agree with the president today. It doesn't matter whether you're a republican or a democrat. I know an awful lot of nr aerks members that agree on the background checks. I agree when we passed legislation after va sa tech, but we haven't had it fully funded. In the courts, anybody who's been adjudicated to be mentally ill, has a domestic violence or a felon, they should not be allowed to have guns. But they're sitting in a courtroom somewhere but p but we cannot computerize them because they don't have the money to do it. All groups should come together and the nra should be working with us. 

[00:41:55]


>> It's interesting. The nra is very good at training people how to use weapons. They do care ablt gun safety at a certain level. You have to derstand u without becoming a usader on all of this, it isn't a perfect slope. 
>> Thank you for coming tonight. This is "hardball" tonight with continuing coverage on the school shooting in sandy hook, connecticut. multivitamin silver. Both of us actually. Our pharmacist recommended it. And that makes me feel pretty good about it. And then I heard about a study looking at multivitamins and the long term health benefits. And what do you know? They used centrum silver in the study. Makes me feel even better, that's what i take. Sorry, we take. 
[ Male Announcer ] CENTRUM. The most recommended. Most preferred. Most studied. Centrum, always your most complete. ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? I want candy ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? I want candy ?????? clean toothpaste. I tell them dentures are very different to real teeth. They're about 10 times softer and may have surface pores where bacteria can grow and multiply. Polident is specifically designed to clean dentures daily. Its unique micro-clean formula kills 99.9% of odor causing bacteria and helps dissolve stains, cleaning in a better way than brushing with toothpaste. That's why I recommend using polident.

[ Male Announcer ] POLIDENT. Cleaner, fresher, brighter every day. me, you know it can be hard to breathe, and how that feels. Copd includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Spiriva helps control my copd symptoms by keeping my airways open for 24 hours. Plus, it reduces copd flare-ups. Spiriva is the only once-daily inhaled copd maintenance treatment that does both. Spiriva handihaler tiotropium bromide inhalation powder does not replace fast-acting inhalers for sudden symptoms. Tell your doctor if you have kidney problems, glaucoma, trouble urinating, or an enlarged prostate. These may worsen with spiriva. Discuss all medicines you take, even eye drops. Stop taking spiriva and seek immediate medical help if your breathing suddenly worsens, your throat or tongue swells, you get hives, vision changes or eye pain, or problems passing urine. Other side effects include dry mouth and constipation. Nothing can reverse copd. Spiriva helps me breathe better.

[00:46:27]


>>> Welcome back to "hardball." If you're trying to comprehend the tragic, mass shooting up in connecticut today, the question remains can students at school ever be a hundred percent safe? Joining me right now is former f.B.I. Profiler, larry johnson, president of national school safety and law enforcement officials. And on the phone, james johnson, chairman of the partnership to prevent violence. Well, mr. James johnson, chief, I want to ask you about your reaction to this in terms of baltimore schools. Is there anything that's developed since the hard days of columbine where schools take more responsibility to prevent the entry of someone who's dangerous? 
>> Well, certainly, we don't know the facts about what is unfolding today up north. But there's been a lot that's taken place since columbine. We have immediate intervention. But the very progressive action taken by schools all across america, as well. 
>> What are you saying in terms of metal detector. You can perhaps keep a kid from -- oh, we've got the press conference starting. We have to go back to the state police press conference in connecticut to get the latest. Here we go. 
>> And then we're going to establish -- we have a process established in place that we're going to utilize to identify each individual. 
>> We're cautiously optimistic that we can have positive ids by tomorrow. We're working together to hope to accomplish that. 
>> Does that include the body of the other male? 
>> The families have been identified. The preliminary identification has been made. Through ro cess of elimination, the families have been told. But, again, we want to be positively, absolutely sure. 

[00:48:33]


>> Certainly they're with us, working with us. There were f.B.I. And a.T.F. Offering ability in case something crosses state lines. Simply stated, everyone's come together in the law enforcement community. This is a massive investigation. So many law enforcement agencies don't ever have to undertake. So we're certainly newtown state police working side by side utilizing any resource we may need and we're very appreciative of all of the help that we're getting. 
>> At this point in time, we're confident that we have the shooter. 
>> You ire talking about the shooter in the classroom? 
>> Yeah, I'd rather not do that, quite frarngly. 
>> I've been a trooper for a long time. It's just something that serves no useful purpose. I'd rather not get into that. It's a horrific scene. Between our mutual experience, we've never seen anything like this. It's heart wrenching for us as it is for the families. I'd like to leave that there. 
>> I think what we've got to do, we're looking at that. We'll go backwards as far as we have to go in this investigation. Hopefully, we'll stumble on answers and hopefully not develop anymore more questions. But we want to be able to build a process and build a story. An investigation like this is like a puzzle. We want to put this puzzle together and form a complete picture so that everyone without any doubt whatsoever can truly understand what occurred. What I would like to say is that we'll come back tomorrow in the morning, let's say 8:00 in the morning to let you know how we have progressed overnight. As we prepare the list of positive identifications, I want to do one list. I don't want to do it piecemeal. I don't want to do a couple here, a couple there. I want to do one finalist. The minute that's done, we'll be here with it, and we'll also post it on our website so it's available to everybody. All right? 

[00:50:41]


>> What is your timeline for the other -- of your officers with this situation, the way they were able to get those kids out of there and keep them calm and get as many out as quickly as possible? 
>> These guys, when they got to the door, were first in the DOOR, AND THE SURROUNDING PDs And the troopers, their training kicked in. This is something that you train for, you train for, you plan for, you work towards, you hope they never have to use. And their training kicked in. They saved a lot of lives. They did a great job. They did a great job. Extremely proud them. I'm sorry? 
>> What can you tell us about the shooter at all? 
>> I'd rather do that in the morning, once we have positive identification, even of the shooter. We want to have all that information. And hopefully we can tie up some loose ends for you first thing in the morning. But I would like to leave it where we are right now. And, you know, we'll fill in the voids tomorrow as much as we possibly can. 
>> Is your timeline for the other crime scene the same? 
>> I'm sorry, this young lady? 
[ Inaudible ] 
>> no, the connecticut medical examiner is managing the cases, and he did request some assistance in equipment that has been brought in for him. But he's -- they're there working now. 
>> How did row first hear about the shooting? What was the -- 
>> in a nutshell, it was 911 calls that came in to newtown state police, and the response was instantaneous, okay. 
>> From within the school? 
>> Yeah, from school sources. 
>> One call? Multiple calls? 
>> I'm not sure. And yes, I believe so, but i don't know how many if that was the next question. 
>> What are they saying about the father? 
>> We've been contact with any authorities, our investigators with any authorities that can assist them in furthering their portion of the investigation. I do know that new jersey has been mentioned. There had been two or three different locations that had been mentioned. Not to read anything into that. If there is something significant about reaching over a state line, or about doing something that may be related to this case, we're not going to hide it from you. We'll make it available to you. We'll certainly provide you with that information. But, you know, don't read something into it just because you have heard that we have gone to authorities in another state. That doesn't mean anything, really. 

[00:53:00]


>> With the resources you have for this, how are you delegating this scene in regards to -- 
>> it's working fine. We've got people on extended shifts. Some people are going to work extra hours. And suffice it to say everybody is all hands on deck. We'll get this done, and we'll do whatever it takes to accomplish this in timely fashion. All right. I'm going to end it, because what I like to do is the give you guys a break and give us a break. We'll be back at 8:00 tomorrow morning here, okay? Thank you. That. 
>> Was the state police press conference up in connecticut. Let me go to larry johnston, the president of the national association of school safety and law enforcement officials. I think mr. Johnson that just about every parent of especially young children are going to be thinking monday morning and beginning to think over the weekend how their schools are in terms ofsafety. How do you as a leader of the group that is for this kind of effort to solidify the safety requirements of schools? What should schools do in reaction? The principal of a school, for example, knowing there is going to be a public clamor for safety, what do they do? 
>> Well, they communicate with parents what they have always done is open line of communication. Hopefully communicating through their counselors and social workers inside the school, asking them not to spend a whole lot of time allowing their children to watch this carnage as it unfolds in connecticut. It's heartbreaking as it is, i think some conversations need to happen with the young people. But I think we need to really get our young kids away from the tv for a while so that they're not so taken in by this. This is a tragedy. 
>> And james johnson, your thoughts as police chief in baltimore involved in this effort. What do you think? A militant focused parent should be thinking about right now? 
>> Well, certainly I think parents across america today should pay more attention to the gun violence issue that is plaguing our nation. And that the key to this issue is background checks. We know, we know in law enforcement that an estimated 40% of all firearm transactions occur through nondealer sales. We know all across america based upon a recent police executive research form study that just in six cities in one week, gun violence cost over $38 million. And we know that background checks work. The brady law, indisputable background work on this brady law stopped nearly two million prohibited purchasers from federally licensed dealers. But we need to stop the 40%. And for gunowners, even if you lawfully possess these guns, lock the guns up. Keep them away interest the hands of people who are not suited to possess weapons. That's the big lesson I think we all should take at this point in time. 

[00:55:47]


>> Clint van zandt, what do you think is the appropriate national debate right now on gun safety, gun control? 
>> Thing are a number of issues going on here. I agree with the chief. There needs to be background investigations done. We need to find people with mental health conditions that should preclude them from owning weapons. But, again, we may well find out today, chris, that we know the two weapons, the two handguns used were actually owned by the shooter's mother. We know that earlier this week the shooter at the mall stole the weapon from a friend of his, that ar-15 that he used. So simply stopping the wrong people from buying a gun, that's not enough. We got to do a lot of other things on the mental health issue as well as conflict resolution to make this whole package. 
>> And my colleague chris jansing is up there. Chris, thank you for joining us, staying with us tonight in newtown. How is it feeling right there as we go to break right now? 
>> Indescribable. I do think that the governor expressed what a lot of people are feeling, that evil visited here today. And it's hard to put into words. I've been to far too many of these, chris. They are all horrendous tragedies. The grief is unspeakable. There is something a little different here. We're talking about little kids who are 5 years old, 6 years old, 7 years old, kids who were in elementary school, who should HAVE BEEN LEARNING THEIR ABCs. I should also tell you that I'm standing in front of a firehouse, which is where a lot of the parents had gathered, waiting to be reunited with their children. And of course 20 of them were not going to leave that schoolhouse alive. It is where the governor spoke to many of those people. And when I saw him, a little bit earlier tonight after he made a brief statement in front of cameras, he looked tremendously grief-stricken, was trying to hold back tears as well. I don't think there are any words, frankly, chris, for the mood in this community tonight. 
>> I was with him a couple of weeks ago, dan malloy, seems like a good man. And that's not a partisan statement. Let me go back to cliff vanzandt. You deal internationally and nationally across the country. This is not a connecticut story. The president made it a national story by his extraordinary emotional comments tonight. He said he is going to do something. What is he going to do? 

[00:58:03]


>> Yeah, I think we expect the president to say he is going to do something. And I think congress is going to say they're going to do something. But chris, really, they're limited. I mean, we've got 310 million americans, 280 million guns. What are we going to do about the guns that are already -- we could say today you cannot buy another gun in the united states. We could have the stricter gun control in the world as far as purchasing weapons, and 100 years from now this could be acted out because the weapons are still going to be there. We have to deal with the systemic problem, which is more than just buying guns. 
>> Chief johnson, I have to tell you, I live in d.C. I live right next to it. I've lived here for many years now. I love this town. Like so many big cities like philadelphia where I came from, we have violence all over the place. The announcement created hope that gun murders have gone down only 100 this year in d.C. You go to places like paris or rome, they don't have this kind of thing. What is it about america that is so familiar with gun violence, it just seems to be part of the territory at some point in our history, like now? 
>> Well, certainly as your previous guest stated, the availability of firearms across this nation. And certainly, again, I do believe that 40%, 40% of all firearm sales from non-licensed dealers, you know, chris, that's like letting 40% of people walk right through the turnstiles at the airport without checking them. That's how serious this issue is. And I believe these tragedies have taken place in nevada, in oregon, and wisconsin awaken america up. And we're looking at this issue now, and we want action. 
>> Okay, thank you so much, chief johnson. Larry johnson, thank you, sir, for joining us as well, and thank you cliff vanzandt. That's "hardball" for now. Thanks for being with us.

Explore new worlds and new ideas through programs like this, made available for everyone through contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you. Thank you. You might think that the only way to walk in the footsteps of Hollywood history is like this. But there is another way to see and touch the golden age of cinema. Join me for a walk through the hidden heart of historic Hollywood. Hollywood is just one suburb in the sprawling city of Los Angeles. But everybody in the world has heard of this city of dreams, the legendary place where the movies were made and the original movie stars were born. My path to Hollywood history starts in Runyon Canyon Park, then I head east on Hollywood Boulevard past Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel before turning off the boulevard into a secret Hollywood neighborhood. Then I come back down to the Egyptian Theatre and Hollywood and Vine's intersection, and then on to my last destination, the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. In 1887, a Midwesterner named Henry Wilcox and his wife developed 120 acres of prime real estate and they called it Hollywood. Now, the Wilcoxes were teetotaling Prohibitionists and it was their hope that this rural haven would attract like-minded folks seeking year-round sun. Never did they suspect that their Hollywood would attract movie makers and become our Hollywood. In the 1920s, '30s and '40s, this was home to the golden age of cinema, but is there anything left of its glittering past? Let's walk it. The park is open to the public from sunrise to sunset. Even hiking in Hollywood is entertaining. It used to be a country estate and home to various movie stars like Janet Gaynor, Charles Boyer and Errol Flynn, but now the only traces of early Hollywood country life is a crumbling tennis court and some fabulous views of the city below. From the top of Mulholland Drive, it's about 1 1/2 miles down the hill, where exit the park at Fuller Avenue, turning left into Hollywood Boulevard en route to my next two destinations: Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. In the late 1920s, the Chinese Theatre started the tradition stars into cement. From Shirley Temple to the cast of Harry Potter, this shrine seems to hold an eternal allure for tourists. Grauman's was and still is the scene of some of Hollywood's flashiest premieres, and it's become the iconic symbol in books and movies of the quintessential fantasy movie palace. My all-time favorite is around here somewhere. There he is, Gene Kelly! Its entrance is mobbed seven days a week with star-struck tourists, freelance costume characters selling photo ops, and the hawkers selling everything from T-shirts to bus tour tickets. The carnival ambience is all part of authentic Hollywood history. Afterwards you can opt for a scene change on the other side of the boulevard. Right across the street is the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. From the street you can breeze through the hotel's restored lobby, which hasn't changed much from when it was first built in 1927. This hotel was the playground for countless movie stars and moguls, one of the first true Hollywood hangouts. The hotel's ballroom was the location for the very first Academy Awards ceremony in 1929. And poolside at the Tropicana Bar is where Marilyn Monroe had her first modeling job. Now it's time to take a detour away from the hustle and bustle of the boulevard, so I turn left on Highland Avenue and head up into the hills, my destination High Tower Drive. What is that? That is so pretty! 

[00:05:19]


CHARLES FLEMING: Well, it looks like a campanile, or a bell tower, but in fact, it's an elevator shaft. That's how you get up to the Alta Loma Community, which is where we're going to be walking. That or the stairs. It's a working elevator. It's a working elevator. It was built in the 1920s by a developer named Carl Kay, who wanted to create an artist's community for the people of Hollywood, far away from all the noise and bustle of the studios and Hollywood Boulevard, so he built these homes up here for costumers, for wardrobers, for screenwriters and art directors to come up here and be away from all the noise and bustle, away from them because the only way you can get in is by going up the elevator, if you have a key, or walking up the stairs, like we're going to do. 
SHAPIRO: I mean, is this, can anyone walk here, or do you have to live here to? This is a public staircase. These are all public staircases. You see, what happened is, Los Angeles wasn't always a town of cars and freeways and traffic jams. It used to be a pedestrian town, like all the other great towns of the world, and there was a public transport system that got people to and fro. Usually the electric cars, the famous red car, they ran down Hollywood Boulevard, they ran up Highland Avenue, and these staircases were designed to get people from these hilly areas down to where they could get on a public transport. 
SHAPIRO: And they're still public property, right? 
FLEMING: They're all still public. Okay. No one uses them anymore. But anyone is allowed to walk. Anyone-- you're perfectly safe here, entirely legal. 
SHAPIRO: So if we were in the '20s or the '30s right now, would we be seeing a lot of Hollywood folk walking up and down these stairs? 
FLEMING: ll, remember, you're talking about the 1920s and 1930s in Hollywood; all you would see would be Hollywood people. This was a company town. There was only one business here, and that was the movie business. The last time we walked here in these Hollywood Hills in this particular area, we met the man whose mother was the voice of Snow White. And he grew up here, because she was a person who was employed by the studios to do voices. So those people are all still living here. Maybe their grandparents were the ones that moved here, or their parents, but they're all still living here. It's still kd of a company town in a lot of ways. Okay, so are they secret or are they forgotten? There's nobody here. They're secret because they're forgotten. They're secret because they're forgotten. Nobody comes up here, nobody knows about them. You know, there was a very famous short that was filmed not far from here called The Music Box, a Laurel and Hardy silent, made in about 1920, in which the heroes were obliged to deliver a piano up to a house in a neighborhood like this with, of course, comic results. The Three Stooges, similarly, shot, not a short, but a talkie in which they had to deliver ice up to a neighborhood like this, so even in the great golden day of Hollywood this was considered unusual enough that could become the subject of a short film. 

[00:08:00]


SHAPIRO: Ah, I hear the sound of the other Hollywood. Yes, civilization has returned and your stair walk is ending. But don't worry, you still have a couple of staircases to go down. You'll find yourself on Highland Avenue; you'll head down towards Hollywood Boulevard. I'm going to miss this Hollywood. There's more Hollywood to see, there's plenty more Hollywood to see. Even the old Hollywood, like everything else in Hollywood, it's a little smoke, it's a little mirrors, it's a little fantasy, it's a little deep focus. You pay attention to what you want to see, make it romantic in your mind and enjoy it. Like the movie makers. Like the movie makers did, like they still do today, right here in Hollywood, California. 
SHAPIRO: It's about a ten-minute walk back down Highland Avenue to Hollywood Boulevard and then I turn left, or east, to continue my journey. Next stop, the Egyptian Theatre. The Egyptian was the very first movie palace to rise on what was a sleepy, tree-lined Hollywood Boulevard in 1922. It was the concept of co-owner Sid G??auman, the flamboyant showman who later brought us the Chinese Theatre down the street. Grauman tapped into the Egypt mania trend that was sweeping the nation in the early 1920s and went so far as to dress all his usherettes like Cleopatra, among other P.R. gimmicks. You can wander off the Boulevard into a fantastic forecourt that's been faithfully restored to its original d??cor. Best of all, the palace is still running movies in a great big, un-subdivided theatre that is a cinephile's dream. It is currently operated by the nonprofit American Cinematheque Foundation, which programs an eclectic mix, ranging from the oldest silent films and vintage Hollywood classics to new independent releases. For a deeper look, the theatre gives monthly historic tours where you might just meet Paul Rayton, the long-time projectionist who has worked magic from the tiny projection room for over 40 years. 

[00:10:08]


PAUL RAYTON: Our film lovers feel that I may have gone to the dark side, because I've come around to the point of endorsing electronic projection. However, I feel that it has to be done right if it's going to be done. It's just like doing film, really. It has to be done properly. 
SHAPIRO: Paul is a specialist in the dying art of vintage film projection. 
RAYTON: It's like working with true antiques, so we had to give it the true antique kid glove treatment. Nitrate prints have a rather checkered history because sometimes they were a bit flammable, so we were number one, kind of jazz. It takes two of us to do it with a nitrate show because somebody has to watch the projector very carefully all the time, just in case, because just in case. There's a spark or... Sparks or anything. So in accepting digital projection, are you sort of at peace with the idea that you're going to be out of a job soon? I don't think we'll really be, in this case, we'll be out of a job. The trend is that projectionists are being put out of work. This is true, and so there'll be fewer and fewer of us who, in our job description, write up and say, "Projectionist." 
SHAPIRO: So, back to Hollywood Boulevard, where I keep following the stars at my feet and the movies in my head. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER: Nearly everyone who comes to Hollywood inevitably visits this widely publicized intersection, hoping to brush shoulders with the movie stars. 
SHAPIRO: But by the time I get to the legendary intersection of Hollywood and Vine, I still need a guide to set the scene for me. So this is it, Hollywood and Vine. 
GREGORY WILLIAMS: Yes, the place. 
SHAPIRO: Aren't people a little disappointed when they get here? It's not exactly the mythology you expect it to be. People have always been disappointed when they get here, because they expect it to hit them in the face, but the truth is, this was an epicenter of show business. This is where it was really happening. And these buildings around here, at Hollywood and Vine, were the first height limit buildings in Los Angeles, 13 stories, and they were very proud of it. And what came into these buildings were some of the biggest agencies in show business. Gary Cooper got in the movies by walking down Hollywood, between Vine and Cahuenga, and somebody said, "You ought to go over to the studios, they're hiring cowboys," and he was okay, and he got into the movies that way. I mean, right here we had Myron Selznick, who was David Selznick's brother, and he had Carole Lombard, Henry Fonda, Claudette Colbert, Boris Karloff, they were his clients. And then, when the radio days came, because just off Sunset you had NBC Radio, CBS Radio, where you had all the ad agencies here. You had Young & Rubicam, you had William Esty, and they were representing the cigarette companies, so they were the sponsors of all the radio shows that sed in 1938 that brought even more stars here, because you could walk down there and see the Jack BennyShow, Burns and Allen, and then the restaurants really made this a hub. And the biggest one of all, my favorite, which is no longer, there's no trace of it, is the Vine Street Brown Derby. And it was an epicenter of eating and stars. They had the phones at the booth, was the original of that; they had private rooms so you could order up and have a full meal in a private room with your guests. So when you walk along the Hollywood Boulevard of today, do you see anything of historic Hollywood? Oh, yeah, there's always buildings. There are quite a few left between Vine Street and Highland. They ruined the two major corners of Highland and Vine with these giant mega-developments in the last ten years, but there are still, within that center, there are some core buildings that are really nice. I always wanted to create a magical dial where I could dial back, you know. Like, if I could dial back, let's go to 1900, you'd go like, oh, my God, you'd be in a paradise, you know. There would be lovely, lovely, stately homes and beautiful gardens and you'd smell lemon blossoms because there were lemon orchards everywhere. Then I'd go up, like, 20 years, anl of a sudden you've got these crazy movie people running around in cars, and Buster Keaton, and Charlie Chaplin, and they would just go off and film movies everywhere. Drove the citizens of Hollywood crazy because they thought they were a bunch of gypsies, you know, running around in their cars. And then when you go up even further, then you all of a sudden get stately studios like Paramount. And at Paramount Studios a block away is where they first started shooting indoors. It was the first indoor stages, so there was this huge technical advance just right down here. So it's just step after step, so that's what I just love about it, how much it's changed. I just love the fact that you could take one place and go through a century and see how much exciting things, how many famous people have come through here. 

[00:14:41]


SHAPIRO: Now I head south on Vine, all the way to Santa Monica Boulevard. When you hit Santa Monica Boulevard, take a left and soon you'll see the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. It's nice to end my walk in a lush green oasis, quirky Hollywood Forever, just behind the Paramount back lot, which continues to offer a full menu of mortuary services for the newly nonliving. It also welcomes fans and curiosity seekers in search of the ghosts of Hollywood past, and there are plenty ofhem here. 
THEODORE HOVEY: People who c Hollywood want to see old Hollywood, and unfortunately a lot of old Hollywood is no longer h and this is a place where they know they can come and feel that atmosphere, that aura of the golden age of film. Do you feel it when you're here? Oh, absolutely. I don't get jaded about it at all. At the end of this corridor is probably our most legendary resident, someone who has been memorialized every year since he psed in 1926. This is Rudolph Vantino. That's his original Italian name. Valentino was really the first great matinee idol and he died very tragically at the age of only 31. How did he die? Complications from peritonitis, something that probably could have been easily taken care of these days. 
SHAPIRO: So he died in 1926, and are people still coming to this day to honor him? Every year, on the anniversary of his death in August, there is a memorial service and hundreds of people do attend, and there are speakers, expert speakers, historians, people who even had some sort of almost personal connection to Valentino. There are performers. They show at least one or two of his old silent movies that evening. It's been well attended ever since the year he passed away. It's really the... kind of the first big movie star death cult, and because this cemetery is accessible and is not limited to... people aren't behind locked doors, he has his... he's had a lot of visitors over time. Wow. These flowers are very pretty, but you must find some weirder stuff. Well, if you look really csely, you can see some of these darker parts are not actually part of the marble. They're lipstick stains, and we see lip imprints on here a lot. Do you look askance at that? Does that trouble you? No, we have to take care of it because it does stain, as you can see, so the longer it stays on, the more it stains, and after a while you just can't get all of it out. But, uh... Nicely done. 

[00:17:50]


(laughing) Why do you think people keep coming back, you know, to honor these celebrities with flowers and kisses? I think for a lot of people, they're almost religious figures for some people. People are so caught up in the magic of it and coming here to visit is maybe getting a little in touch with that. 
SHAPIRO: Having explored this city by foot, I feel like I've come a little closer to touching both the dream and the gritty reality of today's Hollywood. And it wouldn't be Hollywood if I didn't let a scene stealer like Mel Blanc, famed voice artist for the Looney Tunes, have the last word. "That's all, folks." Well, that's all for Hollywood, but it's just the beginning for us here at Historic Walks. Hello, I'm Lyn May, and thank you very much for joining us. I hope you're enjoying this program. I think it's terrific. And if you'd like to see more, we can make that possible. We're so pleased that you are part of the PBS viewing audience today, and if you'd like to see this wonderful program again with some extra features, you can do that by calling the number you see at the bottom of your screen and making a contribution of $75 and we'll send it out to you just as quickly as it's available. Now, it's part of this incredible travel ethos. It's just this wonderful thing that comes complete with a book called 1,000 Places to See Before You Die. This is the kind of programming you find only on public television, and we are so pleased that you've found it and that you'll stay with it, and we hope that you'll become part of this... I was going to call it a movement, but you know, public television has been around for a very long time. You may know that. And it's around because of you. When you call and make your contribution, let me show you some of the ways we have to say thank you. Support this PBS station with a contribution of $75 and we will say thank you with the expanded home version ofHistoric Walks. This history-travel documentary explores some of the world's most fascinating districts, by walking the unique and famous footpaths where history was made. In each city, you will be taken beyond the standard guidebook facts, and will gain insight from glorious vistas and contributions of passionate local experts. From New York City's iconic skyscrapers, to the cradle of liberty, Philadelphia, to old glamorous Hollywood, the city of dreams, Historic Walks digs deeper thhe typical travelogue. The DVD also includes a bonus walking tour of Washington, D.C., including the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, plus a complementary app with maps and walking tours. For your $90 contribution, ask for1,000 Places to See in the U.S.A. & Canada Before You Die. This book takes you from national parks to the Corn Palace, from historic mansions to classic ballparks, and so much more. Includes more than 150 places of special iest to families, and the nuts and bolts of how and when to visit. For your $150 contribution you can have it all: the expanded DVD with bonus material, the app, and the 1,000-page book. Take a "historic walk" to your telephone and make a contribution today. Thanks. Hi, I'm David Rubinsohn, and there is so much more of this program coming your way. We're going to go to see the skyscrapers of New York in just a few moments, and then after that, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, all the great historic tours of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Theprogram is called Historic Walks. It is yours for a $75 contribution. We will send you this DVD. It also includes a bonus walking tour of Washington, D.C., featuring the Martin Luther King Memorial and other great sights. You will see that, and there's also a booklet in here and an app as well. We will send that to you as well, because we're very hip here at PBS. We know what apps are. So this is for you. We're going to send this to you. Now, in that last segment, the Hollywood section, I loved the part with the cemetery that it ended with. And this book, 1,000 Places to See in the United States and Canada Before You Die, for your $90 contribution, has other cemeteries. There isn't just the one there, the Hollywood Forever. But there's also, of course, the Pierce Brothers Westwood Memorial Park, Forest Lawn, there is Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills, and there's even a Dearly Departed Tours. That's just one page out of this really cool book. This book hits every state, hits all the provinces in Canada, so it is a terrific place to go and take this. This is such fun as you just flip through it. And it is, it's kind of like a bucket list, as one of our volunteers was pointing out. This is a bucket list between a jacket here. And it is a very big bucket list. This is over a thousand pages long. We can send them both to you for a $150 contribution, and you'll get it all, and you'll also be supporting this PBS station. Here's Lyn. You probably heard me chuckling when he was talking about cemeteries. Maybe you want something a little bit more active. And I was intrigued... (laughter) I'm just saying, I mean, it's a thought. You know, I found something in here. You know, watching television is considered a passive activity. I never think it is because I talk back to the television. I get very excited about it, although if you're really an active person who also watches television, I found "Active Travel and Adventure" in the index of this wonderful book. And if you want to bike, you can look up places to bike all over America, Alaska and Hawaii. So that is reason enough to go to your telephone, make the call, make your contribution, and if you do it at the $90 level, this is what you get. 

[00:23:31]


It's full of everything: History, walks, cemeteries, whatever works for you, it's in here. Which makes it very much like public television. Public television works for you, works for your children, it works for your parents, and that's one of the reasons it's very easy for those of us who come to you once in a while and ask you to make a contribution to this fabulous service. It's easy for us to do, so we hope that you'll give some thought to making this one of your priorities and making the call and just making that contribution. We'd like that. It's interesting that we're in a sense telling you to turn off the TV and get out there and explore this beautiful country that we live in that we all love so much here in the United States of America. But if you can't or you just don't have the funds, we will bring the United States to you. That's what we do here at public television. We bring the world to you, either through public affairs or through science or nature, of course, our children's programming. That's where it all begins. That's where so many of us began our television experience, because it's a safe haven. That's what PBS is. You know you can trust PBS, and we're happy to earn that trust and we do that and we hope that we invest your dollars appropriately. How do we know that wethat? Well, times like this. You let us know that we're doing the right thing by putting on a great show like Historic Walks and making that financial contribution to this PBS station, because we cannot do it without your support. Obviously, there's a little bit of government support. We never know from year to year what that's going to be like. Corporate support is always kind of up in the air. So it really comes down to you. You we can trust, you we can rely on. We hope you feel the same way about us. So please, make that pledge now. Support this PBS station with a contribution of $75 and we will say thank you with the expanded home version ofHistoric Walks. This history-travel documentary explores some of the world's most fascinating districts, by walking the unique and famous footpaths where history was made.

Thanks. I want to share what I think is an embarrassing statistic. You know, there are a lot of people out there who are watching who are not contributors, who do not donate. AnI take great pride in donating to public television, and it's not that anybody really knows I do it, because it's not like something that comes up at dinner parties, I have to say. 

[00:27:09]


(laughing): "Do you contribute?" "Oh, yeah, I contribute." But I feel good about it, because I feel that when I turn it on, I have a stake in it. Right, right. Well, and what does come up at dinner parties, of course, is, "Did you see that terrific show oPBS the other night?" Whether it's a Ken Burns documentary, whether it's a fascinating episode of NOVA about the string theory, or Sesame Street. "Did you see what Elmo did this morning?" I haven't done that for a very long time. But sometimes those come up. That's right. Because, you know, I still love Sesame Street, I'll admit it. It's entertaining for everybody. It is indeed. As is this show. And we're going to the skyscrapers of New York in just a moment, and that is really, really cool. Wonderful city. We'll be looking up a lot during the show. And you know what? You'll find things on New York City in here. $90, make that call. And if you'd like the DVD which he is holding, 75. Or of course those of us who want everything, what do we do? Put them together. $150-- we'll do it that way. Do it that way. Partnership, it's a beautiful thing. $150 contribution, we'll send you all this. Includes an app, a bonus walking tour, and, of course, the book, 1,000 Places, and I'll tell you, one of the things that you do before you die, become a member of this station. Absolutely. Make that pledge of support right now. Thanks so much. Let's go to New York. 
(playing march) I'm taking my walk through Philadelphia, meeting the people and seeing the places that keep history alive. It's July 4, and what better place to celebrate Independence Day than right here in this revolutionary city? Philadelphia, in the state of Pennsylvania, is truly the birthplace of the American nation. It was right here where the greatest leaders and thinkers of the early American colonies congregated and wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. This was the first capital of the United States, and many of the historic buildings and institutions that played a role in the invention of America can be found conveniently crammed into the historic city center. In fact, you can easily walk it. Leaving the parade route, I visit the Quakers at the Arch Street Friends' Meeting House, then on to Christ Church, with a stop for an authentic ale break at the City Tavern, and onward to Independence Hall, the Philosophical Society and CarpenteHall before exploring the 18th-century neighborhood of Society Hill, and then ending up on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway for a street party and fireworks. Every day is a bit like celebrating the 4th of July when taking a walk in Philly's historical center, which is particularly rich in history from the colonial and revolutionary eras. You might stble upon favorite natives like Betsy Ross and Benjam Franklin any time of the year, though this is their busy season. Good, a photo with Betsy and Ben. Yes. Oh yes. Yeah. 

[00:30:35]


BENJAMIN FRANKLIN: This is the place to be on Indepennce Day, don't you think? How many days of the year do you get to be Betsy and Ben? Well, I've been Ben now 305 years. 
SHAPIRO: I start my walk by veering off the parade route and heading way back into time to visit the very earliest settlers of Philadelphia who continue to welcome visitors to their meeting house. The Quakers or, as they call themselves, Friends, were a powerful influence in pre-revolutionary days. This is the oldest still- functioning Quaker meeting house in the United States. I'm meeting a long-time member and historian of the Arch Street Friends, Carol Spawn. So the Quakers pre-dated July 4th but... Oh, indeed they did, yes. They certainly had an influence on America. Yeah, I think they've always had an influence, but not a very large one because our faith is so different from almost every other faith practiced in this country. The first statement in William Penn's Charter of Liberties that he gave to all the people who came here at his invitation, that basic principle is one of freedom of religion, so that certainly is the first place where we all settled up our ideas of what this country would be ke. Do you feel like the Quakers have received their due, you know, proper credit for their contribution? Not very much. I've never heard us praised, and this city, which is the center of William Penn's colony, pays very little attention to William Penn. It's all Ben Franklin instead. 

[00:32:47]


SHAPIRO: Do people talk to each other at any point during the service? 
SPAWN: No, they don't talk to each other. What they do is speak something that God wants them to share with other people in the room. And some meetings don't have any speaking at all. You simply sit quietly for an hour. No pastor, no minister. So, we don't have sermons. We don't have rites of any kind that get practiced. Do you have a book? No, we don't have a prayer book; we don't use any special Bible. But do you think that in some ways, the Quaker ideas of freedom of religion and equality and anti-slavery, you know, filtered into the consciousness of the Founding Fathers in some way? Well, I'm sure they did because we still have them. It's still part of what we like to think of as our American way. 
SHAPIRO: So the name Philadelphia means "city of brotherly love." City of brotherly love, yes. And William Penn gave the city its name. Yeah. Do you see vestiges of that in today's Philadelphia? I see it all the time. I find kindness everywhere I look. 
SHAPIRO: Next I go one block east on Arch Street, then take a right on 2nd Street toward Christ Church, founded in 1695 as a colonial outpost of the Church of England. Those bells, they're the exact same bells that were rung in 1776 when the Declaration of Independence was being read. Amazing. 
(bells tolling) Fifteen signers of the Constitution attended here, including George Washington, John Adams and Benjamin Franklin. Visitors are always welcome to sit in George Washington's family's pew during Sunday services. In the air... I'm in the air that George and Martha sat in. And if you're a John Adams fan, John and Abigail Adams. But on the 4th July, the church displays an extra special artifact. 

[00:35:10]


RONK: Let me show you the prayer book of Dr. Jacob Duch??, the Church of England Minister of Christ Church and also the chaplain of the Continental Congress. What you're looking at is his book of common prayer, and you can see it here where he's actually crossed out the prayer for the queen, Queen Charlotte, and the royal... 
SHAPIRO: George, prince. And what he does specifically is cross out the prayer for King George, and in its place writes his own prayer. It says, "That it may please thee to endow the Congress "of these United States "and all others in authority, "legislative, executive and judicial, with grace, "wisdom and understanding." Instead of praying for the monarch, he's praying for the government. 
SHAPIRO: I'm walking south on 2nd Street to the corner of Walnut and 2nd to the famous City Tavern, where virtually all the founding fathers used to hang out, and where I'm now going to take an ale break. The current tavern is a faithful re-creation at the original building constructed in 1773. The City Tavern played a pivotal role in the revolutionary period as a central hub for business, politics and social life. Chef Walter Staib is fanatical about the historical authenticity of his food and drink. He and local master brewer Tom Kehoe spent years researching 18th-century recipes from the kitchens of the founding fathers for the perfect, most authentic ale. So everything that you make here, the ale and the food, comes from an original recipe. Every single thing we do. We're here to interpret the foods of the 18th century. Sure, we cheat a little bit. Yes, I have Coca-Cola and I do take credit cards, correct, but other than that, you don't see any television in here, no radios, none of that. The staff dresses up in 18th-century attire that are all handmade. 
SHAPIRO: The original tavern burned down 150 years ago, but an exact replica, built on the original footprint, was commissioned for the 1976 bicentennial. Mmm, that is absolutely delicious. Thanks. Mmm. It's our number one selling ale here, by the way. It outsells the others. And it has honey? Honey and lemon in the original recipe, yes. Yes, lemon zest. I want to compare it with number three. So, who made this one? This is from Ben Franklin's recipe. Ben Franklin. So we call it, "Poor Richard's Tavern Spruce." 

[00:37:42]


STAIB: The greatest beer to cook with because you have the flavor of the spruce right in there. I marinate my chicken in there, I marinade rabbit in there, it's a dynamite beer. 
SHAPIRO: Were these colonial guys foodies? I'd say more than you would ever imagine. Really? I just thought it was kind of like whatever meat they could find, and they'd slap on something on their bread. Can I tell you, you and everybody else thinks there was no sophistication. It was just the opposite. There was so much sophistication when it came to entertaining and to dining because it's all they had. Who would have been in this room who I would have learned about in history? Any of them. You could take almost anybody. 
SHAPIRO: Was Thomas Jefferson here? 
STAIB: Many times. During the last couple of years before the Revolution, everybody says a lot of the final detail and strategies would discussed in the tavern, right here. Remember that the British, when they closed the harbor in Boston and Paul Revere came to Philadelphia, where did he go? One stop. Paul Revere came here? Right here. For an ale? No, to tell everybody and then have the ale. 
SHAPIRO: It's extraordinary. You learn about George Washington and Ben Franklin in school but to taste what they tasted, to taste what they liked to taste, is really something else. Those beers are made with love and passion, like my food. So the beer has passion, my food has passion, and this is what we're all about. Well, you know, here's to the two of you for preserving American history in this marvelous way. 
SHAPIRO: On the 4th of July, Revolutionary War re-enactors set up camp in the tavern garden and... oops, I bump into yet another Betsy Ross. And, of course, thou knows what Washington wanted me to make. A flag. Yes, indeed. Now, does thou know that I made some changes to the flag? Something about a five-point star. And thou has gotten it properly. Thou has remembered well, my dear. Washington had wanted the stars to be six-pointed. It was quite bold of you, actually. Yes, that's probably true. To propose a different pattern than he had in mind. Yes, I suppose, but I am a practical woman. I'm going to show to thee how I make those five-pointed stars with only several foldings. And when those are all done, I shall make one small snip of the scissors and that star... Wow. 

[00:40:01]


SHAPIRO: The city tavern is located at the edge of the Independence National Historical Park, also known as Independence Mall, a park area that encompasses both historic buildings and the new museums and a visitor center. I head back to the mall where the parade started earlier, and I visit Independence Hall. Then I visit the nearby American Philosophical Hall and Library, and finally the Carpenters' Hall. Dotted around the green lawns of the mall are modern structures that pay homage to important artifacts like the Liberty Bell or the Constitution. And you can follow the footsteps of the Founding Fathers right into the original Independence Hall, which is furnished just as it was when America was founded. Make sure to visit the visitor center first thing in the morning to reserve your free tickets for the day. The hall is often packed with long lines. The Assembly Room is where delegates of the Continental Congress debated and signed the Declaration of Independence. In the Congress Hall, George Washington and later John Adams were inaugurated president. The American Philosophical Society is the oldest learned society in the United States, sometimes described as America's first think tank. It was founded in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin with the mission of promoting useful knowledge, a mission it continues to follow to this day. Membership is by invitation only and represents the highest levels of scholars and leaders in a wide variety of disciplines. Though their membership is by invitation only, their conferences can be accessed online. Their research library is free to scholars, and all year round the public is invited to Society Hall and the next-door library to view exhibitions that give a glimpse into some of the incredible treasures in the society's archives. Now I walk on to the nearby Carpenters' Hall, which has been the headquarters of America's first trade union since it was built in 1773. Carpenters' Hall was built for, and is still operated by, the Carpenters' Company of the City, America's oldest trade guild. It holds a place in early American history as a key assembly point for many different tenants, notably the very first Continental Congress, who chose to meet here in 1774 to avoid royalist spies. Nicholas Giannopoulos is a distinguished member of the club, a structural engineer who has personally helped save some of Philadelphia's most important historical buildings, including the Carpenters' Hall itself. Carpenters' Hall is one of the earliest examples of an original, unaltered, pre-independence building. Visitors can explore the ground floor exhibition space, but Nicholas invited me on a special tour of his favorite parts of the building upstairs. 

[00:43:11]


GIANNOPOULOS: It's a unique building, room, and the collections... our collections date back to the 19th century. I'm wandering into a neighborhood called Society Hill where there are gorgeous 18th-century houses. There are hundreds of them. They even have churches and synagogues from that period. This really feels like time travel. Not far from Carpenters' Hall is the historic 18th-century district of Society Hill and the Powell House, home of the first mayor of Philadelphia. But I'm heading to Headhouse Farmers' Market. 
DAVID BROWNLEE: Well, we're walking here right on the southern edge of Society Hill. Society Hill gets its name from the Free Society of Traders... 
SHAPIRO: David Brownlee, a professor of history, is also an enthusiastic local. So what was Society Hill like back when it was bustling? Well, the extraordinary thing is, it was quite like what it is today. There is not a place on earth that I can think of where you can find this number of houses and all of the associated amenities-- markets, churches, associations, clubs-- preserved in one place that reflects so accurately what an 18th-century city was really like. Hundreds and hundreds of houses. 
SHAPIRO: So how is it that it's been preserved over more than 300 years? 
BROWNLEE: Well, in part it was preserved by that greatest preserver of urban architectural artifacts, poverty. And there was no redevelopment in this area until the 1950s when, in a sense, this extraordinary collection of 18th-century buildings was discovered again. But this part of the city has been a living and essential component of it since the 1690s. By the middle of the 18th century, Philadelphia was the fourth- largest English-speaking city in the world. It was behind Dublin and Edinburgh and London, of course, which were really quite a lot bigger. But it was a metropolis, a place that would attract people from all over the world, would attract the young Benjamin Franklin, who emigrated from a much smaller city, Boston, to come here and ply his... and find his fortune here in this city. It was here that all of the early foundational institutions of the young nation were created. Of course, it was here that the Declaration of Independence was written, that the Constitution was written, but it was also here that the banking system was inaugurated, that our first hospital was created, that our first modern university was created, that the first lending library was set up. All of these were institutions of aetropolis, of a center of ideas where things were made and ideas were created all the time. The great pleasure of being in Philadelphia on the 4th of July is that you can watch a wonderful parade, you can explore history quietly, and you can end up at this great big street party where everybody else ends up. And you can do it all in just one day.

I was looking at the DVD as it went by, and I was thinking about the past before DVDs and how grateful I am that they exist. When I was a young woman, I didn't miss much that was said on television or if I was listening to the radio. Now, with the DVD, you can go back and look at it again. And, boy, is that terrific. One of the other piece of technology I like is the clicker. You know, you can change the channel just like crazy. I often stop at PBS. And sometimes I'm not even aware that I've stopped on a PBS program. I stop because I see something that interests me. I see re on public television that appeals to me than I do anywhere else. But so does my daughter, who is much younger, and so do my grandchildren. And that says something about this particular kind of television. Historic Walksis not something you're likely to see on commercial television. So if this kind of programming is valuable to you, look at that number on the bottom of your screen, pick up the phone, call us, make your contribution. Or you can do it online, another piece of technology. How about that? Tick, tick, tick. Time is running out for you to become a supporter of this station. Please get to the phones right now.

For you $90 contribution, boy, we have been having fun all day long, all night long, just flipping open the book and finding various places. Here's the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, which is located-- I had no idea-- in Cincinnati, Ohio. I had no idea, I would have guessed somewhere along the East Coast. Theodore Roosevelt National Park, that's in North Dakota. This is just a fabul... Texas comfort food. Oh, man, there's a lot of food in here. This is just a terrific, terrific book. I get hungry every time I page through it. Or, for your $150 contribution, you can have it all.

This is what it is all about. Make that call right now. Absolutely, thank you if you already have. And if you have to make hard decisions right now on what you make your contributions to and what you have to stop, my guess this is one you would keep because it's so valuable to you. A lot of us don't go out as much as we used to, whether it's because we need to conserve on gas... I live in the country. My town, East Haddam, Connecticut, is also in here, I'm proud to report. I had to bundle, we call it-- I have to plan my activities, and you probably do, too. So if you're making critical choices and you're staying home more and yore watching more television, I certainly hope that you'll think about Pbs as one of the places you'll put your very precious dollars because this is where your children can watch television and you don't have to be embarrassed, where you can find programs that appeal to every member of your family, and where I think you still get the best news anywhere. For those of us who don't want it all to fly by in 30-second sound bites, this is where you find the kind of news that has substance and content. So if all of that matters to you, now is your chance to make a contribution. And if you do, here are some of the ways we say thank you. Support this PBS station with a contribution of $75 and we will say thank you with the expanded home version ofHistoric Walks.

For your $90 contribution, ask for 1,000 Places to See in the U.S.A. & Canada Before You Die.

We've got about a minute to go and then we're on to other stuff. Yes. We would like for you to join us, either as a new member of this television station-- and mention that when you make that phone call-- or an old-timer who says, "You know, I have a few extra dollars and I know where I'm going to put them." That would be terrific. That would be great. Remember, for your $150 contribution, we will send you this, plus bonus material on here-- the Washington, D.C. tour, which is terrific. Also there's a booklet in here, there's an app. And we will combine it with this book, 1,000 Places to See. You know what's in here? What? Garrison Keillor's Prairie Home Companion,for NPR fans. I'm not a bit surprised. Yes, you can go watch a taping of that. That's, of course, in St. Paul, Minnesota. Not Lake Wobegon, that's more of a state of mind. Since you can read without your glasses on, do another one. Okay, well, then I come overo the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve. Never heard of it. Never heard of it, but that's a thousand places... that's in Strong City, Kansas. So, if you live in Strong City, Kansas, we want to hear from you right now because we just gave you a shoutout, so thank you very much. There's also the Phoenician in Scottsdale, Arizona. Oh, I know that. You do? Yeah, that's a great, great palace hotel type thing. Some of everything in there. Everything in here. Yeah, from Beverly Hills, of course, to, of course, Philadelphia cheesesteaks. Ah, yes, yes, yes. All sorts of great food in here. That is for sure, so... And, you know, when you watch a program like this, just so you know how that equation works, when you call and make a contribution, that tells the people who buy the programs, because they use that money to buy programs that you like. So the more calls you make during the programs that you really like, that increases the chances that you may see more of those programs. So give that some thought when you're looking at that number at the bottom of the screen tonight. Because we really do need to hear from you because we do depend on you.

??? ??? ??? ??? 
>>> eh, eh, eh. 
>>> Muy bonito. 
>>> Hoy es viernes. Hola, hola. Un abrazo a los amigos que nos reciben por univision, la casa de todos. 
>>> Y damos la bienvenida a cynthia. 
>>> Buenos dias. 
>>> Y martita carrillo. 
(Aplausos) 
>>> en los espectaculos, ya estan los restos de jenni rivera, estan en los angeles, con su familia, y le vamos a dar todos los detalles, y la nota de la semana con el caso completo. 
>>> Y tendremos lo mas visto de la television. 
>>> Y no se pierda el momento del humor con la escuelita. Y vean como nos cacharon en el detras de camaras. 
>>> Todo esto y mas en univision, la casa de todos. 
(Aplausos) 
>>> estamos felices porque esta noche es especial para univision porque se trasmite el primer "teleton usa." Seran 28 horas en vivo desde los angeles, nueva york, miami, grandes estrellas se unen para esta causa, todo comienza a las 7/10 centro. Yo tambien voy para alla. Y la gran familia hispana unida. Esta noche en "teleton usa." 

[00:02:01]


>>> Y la gran familia hispana unida por nuestros ni??os. 
>>> Vamos directo a la informacion. Vamos a hablar de jenni rivera porque desde anoche pudimos ver que despues que se confirmo que los restos comparados ahora se comprobo que tristemente era su cuerpo, decidieron que la diva tenia que regresar a su casa en california. Y en medio de una gran difusion partieron en avion privado. Veamos lo e paso. 
>>> En este avion partieron los restos de jenni rivera ayer jueves del aeropuerto internacional de monterrey, despues de comprobarse que algunos restos pertenecian a ella por las pruebas de adn se procedio a entregarlos, quienes lo cremaron en esta funeraria, todo era confusion, y desde esta camioneta salieron las cenizas de la cantante, a bordo conducia un sujeto que aseguro que estaban en el aeropuerto. 
>>> Viene contigo? 
>>> No puedo decirles. 
>>> Vienen algunos familiares. 
>>> Lo desconozco. 
>>> Traes alguna urna roja. 
>>> Ya no. 
>>> Y fue enn cortejo funebre donde realmente iban las cenizas el que despido a la prensa. Y ahi se dispusieron a abardar este avion que los llevaria a la ciudad de los angeles, donde pidio que estuvieran sus restos. Algunos cfans acudieron a darle el ultimo adios. 

[00:04:23]


>>> Los fanaticos se unen a esta despedida. 
>>> Si, me acabo de enterar, y el ultimo adios a esta artista que estaba en la cuspide de su carrera, lamentable q haya sido asi. 
>>> Ahora falta que los otros integrantes de las victimas tengan los resultados de las pruebas para llevarse los restos. 
>>> Aqui en hoy, alberto hernandez. 
>>> De lo malo el saber y comprobar que son los restos en lugar de seguir alimentando esperanzas, lo bueno es que estan tranquilos, sabiendo que es el cuerpo de jenni. 
>>> Es lupillo cumpliendo su promesa, tenemos imagenes del cortejo funebre, estuvo encabezando esto, el cortejo siguio por la carretera laredo, estuvieron escoltados, fueron pocos los medios que lograron esta imagen, porque la mayoria estaban en el aeropuerto, y ellos entraron por otro lugar y abardaron el jet privado, y tomaron este avion privado para que lupillo cumpliera la promesa de llevar a su hija, donde lo dijo. 
>>> Es una familia sumamente, como esta parte se habla de compartir, y de estar juntos, y como decia andrea, el saber y tener algo, y saber que si paso, que es tu hija, que si es tu mama, donde puedes llegar y llorar, y poder honrar su vida creo que hace sentir mejor a la familia. 

[00:06:52]


>>> Y tenemos la imagen donde se ve que esta al volante. 
>>> Y aqui la situacion o lo relevante ya que existen estos restos tambien la forma de hacerle homenaje, porque se prepara no solamente la situacion de ceremonia religiosa, y estos homenajes que son bien merecidos, a lo mejor - no son en vida, pero tambien hacerle homenaje aqui en mexico. 
>>> Y mucho festejo, como lo que ella queria, era muy de fiesta, muy gozoza de la vida, y ves a su madre, su actitud es ejemplar. 
>>> Tambien como la fe, como esa parte de creencia y de estar bendiciendo la presencia de jenni en su vida le dio esta fortaleza que es de admirar. 
>>> Es lo que esperaban todos, los miles de fanaticos tambien que se dieron cita fuera de la casa de la madre que llegaran los restos a los angeles, y estieo imagenes vamos a presentar a continuacion del momento que llego la urna, y todos los fans esperaban la llegada de los restos a su natal long beach, california. Y se congregaron fuera, los arreglos llegaron uno a uno, no dejaron de cantar temas de su idolo, cada momento lo cantaban con un sentimiento que se ponia la piel chinita, y a las 10 arribaron en este auto, cuando arriba el avion al aeropuerto de los angeles, y despues llegan los restos de jenni procedentes del aeropuerto, y un carro que vamos a ver en un momento mas. 

[00:08:55]


>>> Eso fue a las 11 de la noche, porque joaquin no alcanzo a nombrar, 9:30 de los angeles. Al final del noticiero alcanzo a meter estas imagenes del arribo del avion. 
>>> Se especulo mucho de los homenajes, del cortejo funebre, que iba a pasar, y pedro rivera nos revela las ultimas peticiones que hizo jenni. 
>>> Gracias a dios esta en su tierra natal, preferimos que no refieran como fallecimiento, ella se graduo a una mejor vida, esta con nosotros, esta con nuestros padres dios y jamas morira. 
>>> Se especulo mucho del accidente, queremos aclarar que en una manera hubo terceros en este accidente, queremos aclarar rumores de secuestro, atentado, porque mi hermana no tenia enemigos, fue siempre querida, lo que sucede es que mi padre dios la llamo a estar al lado de el a que cantara al lado de el junto con su equipo. 
>>> Ver estas imagenes de juan rivera que fue el que dio este comunicado, fue un mom dificil, siempre lo traia, siempre pendiente de el, de los hijos que tiene con brenda, siempre estuvo pendiente de la familia, y los hijos de jenni son pegados a su tio juan. Veiamos a chiquis y a janica. Y era importante este momento, que estuvieran los restos para que tambien la familia descanse. 

[00:11:15]


>>> Hay una aceptacion. Y tambien es importae aclarar estos rumores que surgieron que ya ni para que recordar, pero es importante, que su hermano no tenia enemigos, y que no hay nada mas que un accidente. 
>>> El que estuvo en las redes fue juan, saben todas las burlas que se hicieron, y juan los enfrento, les ha escrito, les dijo muchas cosas fuertes, porque en su dolor sentia que tenia que seguir defendiendo a su hermana, y sale a hablar con esta certeza de que ya paren, nosotros estamos bien, basta y respeto. 
>>> Y creo que muchas veces cuando estamos en vida hablamos que si te tocara la miaor te de que manera te gustaria. 
>>> Ella no queria ser cremada, ella queria ser enterrada, y no que sus cenizas se guardaran, pero con el cajon cerrado. 
>>> Y van a cumplir su voluntad, es parte de lo que la familia decide, querian hacer u ceremonia privada para brindarles a los fanaticos, donde jenni lo habia pedido. 
>>> Todavia no leen esa carta. 
>>> Lo van a hacer en familia. Cuando tuvieran la confirmacion se iban a reunir, supongo que ayer fue complicado, porque recibir losrestos, saber lo que va a pasar, alguna declaracion que habia dicho que queria ser incinerada, y cambia de idea, es como tomar la decision de respetarla a ella. Su ultima voluntad. 

[00:13:29]


>>> Surgen rumores por las imagenes de la urna de color rojo que habian pedido alguien de los familiares. 
>>> Seguramente fue porque ella habia dicho que queria ser cremada, pero ya ahora es distinto. 
>>> Escribio que queria ser enterrada para que la pudieran visitar. 
>>> Y como lo comento cynthia, que salieron a defender a jenni, otra es su hija chiquis que ha estado pendiente de las redes sociales, y a raiz de algunas entrevistas, o que consideraban comunidades amigas, ella respon y dice estoy cansada, bueno me lo sacaron. Ella escribe en ingles, y le hicimos una traduccion en espa??ol. 
>>> Y porque desde el inicio aclara que no llegaron los restos. 
>>> Hay gente que estuvo dando diferentes declaraciones y diciendose y haciendose llamar manager. 
>>> Ya llego mi reina, la gran se??ora, mi madre, la numero 1, a su long beach quido. Y la mayoria de la gente nos expresamos como los restos pero no de forma ofensiva. Y de un twitter largo, y 
dice: Estoy cansada que este dando entrevista sobre mi madre, a menos que consulten conmigo y mis hermanas. Y despues se va de lleno con las 

[00:15:45]


personas, le dice: No tienes derecho a dar ninguna entrevista, sin saber informacionconcreta, y sin preguntarme primero, y despues otra persona que se llama laura, y tu tampoco no tienes derecho a abrir el hocico. 
>>> Porque laura dio declaracion que era la ultima manager de jenni, y que habia sido un atentado. Y se especulo con esto. 
>>> Y este es el tercero. 
Y dice: Sabes que no fuiste gran amiga de mi madre, esperen pacientemente y tendran la verdad. Y despues entre al twitter de laura y manifiesta que lo unico que habia dicho que jenni amaba a la chiquis. 
>>> Ella dijo mas cosas en diferentes medios de comunicacion. 
>>> ??Quien es? 
>>> No lo se, pero todo el mundo la conoce alla. 
>>> Es periodista? 
>>> Creo que si. Trabaja en la industria, pero no era la mejor relacion que tenia con jenni rivera. Y se que no tiene por que estar diciendo nada, la indignacion no es nada mas de la familia, la indignacion es en general de toda la gente que la conoce, alguien que se se cuelga de este triste momento. 
>>> La situacion esta complicada, y tambien en las redes sociales no solamente chiquis manifesto indignacion, hay un mensaje de juan rivera, que se mantuvo en contacto. 

[00:17:46]


>>> Juan puso este en la ma??ana 
y dice: Gracias p querer tanto a mi hermana, nosotros celebramos su graduacion a mejor vida. Los quiero mucho. 
>>> Es lo que deciamos, la familia manifesto esta situacion de estar unidos. Y homenajeando a jenni. 
>>> Ellos profesan la religion cristiana, y morir es graduarte en la vida. Y se refiere muy en su fe que no hay que llorar. Y en una graduacion estamos felices. 
>>> La manager de lupillo dijo que en camino al aeropuerto la gente se ponia una mano en el corazon, y sentia el amor que le tenian. 
>>> Eso va a quedar por siempre, admirable la actitud de la familia. 
>>> Y tenemos imagenes del cementerio donde los restos de jenni descansaran, se espera, y parece que los funerales se realizaran la primera semana. Sabes algo? Tenemos imagenes del ceme cementerio... 
>>> Ahi van a depositar las cenizas, en un nicho. 
>>> Habia leido esto. 
>>> Desde el 18 de diciembre programar un funeral publico y hacer una gran celebracion, como jenni lo queria, esta en esta disposicion de compartir, celebrar la vida. 

[00:19:57]


>>> Hablando de este vamos a platicar del papa de jenni, fijense que fue captado el dia de la celebracion en un puesto que tiene y cada a??o monta en una plaza, ahi vendio discos de jenni, obviamente hay algunos que les parecia extra??o, dijeron que sera aprovechando la situacion, la gente empezo a criticar, a hacer comentarios negativos, y explico que hace cada a??o, vamos a oirlo de su opia boca. 
>>> Si, aqui estamos ahora en la placita olvera. Y a es donde yo canto cada domingo, y cada a??o le traigo las ma??anitas a la virgen de guadalupe. Le agradezco a la gente que esta con el mismo sufrimiento, agradezco su cari??o, y esperemos que todo a bien. Y claro que unos nos vamos antes que otros, pero creo que mi hija esta en las manos del se??or, si asi es ojala que nos eche tambien sus bendiciones asi como nosotros le ecs a ella. 
>>> Bueno, ahi esta. La realidad es que mas alla de lo que la gente pueda pensar, si lo hace cada a??o el dia de la virgen seguramente lo seguira haciendo. 

[00:22:03]


>>> Ellos son gente de trabajo, que fueron a buscar el sue??o americano, emigraron, que el fue metio a lupillo, a jenni, a la musica, esos puestos lo tuvo toda la vida. Acompa??aban a su papa a vender cafe, y jenni conto que su papa le decia deberias tambien cantar, y ella en un principio se rehuso, y un disco donde ella narra cada una de las canciones, y comenta de la primera cancion que se aprendio gracias a su papa. No somos nadie p juzgar lo que el se??or hace. 
>>> Ves que a pesar del dolor de la familia, estan activos, estan pensando de que manera continuar con su vida. 
>>> Es el lema de jenni, cuando paso todo lo del divorcio, y que tenia que seguir cantando, y aunque tenia un profundo dolor la vida continuaba. Pero era como parte de sus lemas de vida. Y viene de este aprendizaje, la actitud de la familia habla de lo que ella era. Una actitud de los hermanos, los papas. 
>>> Si el se??or lo reconforta estar cantandole a la virgen, vendiendo disco, que lo haga. 
>>> Al regreso tendremos fuertes declaraciones de la hermana de arturo rivera y el jefe de prensa de jenni que denuncia malos tratos de las autoridades. Esto al regresar. ??? ??? ??? ??? 

[00:27:57]


>>> al rato fredy conn bn bailongo. Pero antes vamos a esto. ??? ??? ??? ??? 
>>> y seguimos con la informacion acerca de lo que paso en este lamentable accidente. Y tenemos informacion del vocero de comunicacion social del estado de nuevo leon, vamos a ver que nos dice. 
>>> Eso fue entregado lo poco que se pudo rescatar, son restos humanos no en cuantia. Ellos estan identificando estos restos. Y ya se podra entregar la comprobacion cientifica. El procurador me dijo que se tuvieron que tomar casi 300 muestras de adn distinta porque no hay restos humanos en una forma que estariamos acostumbrados. 
>>> Hay que recordar que el accidente tuvo lugar en una sierra y esparcidos los restos en mas de 400 metros, es una tarea dificil la localizacion de todos los restos. 
>>> Y esta diciendo que si se entregaron, pero no esta bien informado, pero hasta ayer la familia de jacob, el maquillista, la familia de jorge sanchez, el licenciado macias, no tenian noticias de nada. Es triste que lo estan dando vuelta, cuando es gente q se costeando sus gastos, boletos de avion, y que no los traten de manera debida. 

[00:30:00]


>>> Y ayer estaban mandandonos mensajes que apoyaramos para exigir los restos. 
>>> Creo que hay una manera de meter presion porque le dicen ven tres dias. 
>>> Y ellos se hacian cargo de su familia. Es fuerte lo que sucede, porque no quiero pensar en medio de este gran dolor, todavia tener que lidiar con estos tramites burocraticos. 
>>> Incluso hasta 8 dias. 
>>> Y paguenlen el hotel. 
>>> Y tenemos una nota con cynthia rivera que fue la primera persona que notifico a la familia de jenni. Vamos a ver lo que dice. 
>>> Un comunicado emitido por la procuraduria general de justicia anuncio que el proceso de identificacion del accidente aereo han coincidido en el resultado y han procedido a entregar los restos, pero esta version dista mucho de la realidad, cynthia rivera, la hermana de arturo rivera argumenta otra version. Las autoridades no determinaron el dia y hora que entregaron los restos de su hermano, y por que el cqso de jenni rivera se resolvio mas rapido. 
>>> Que sucedio que a ustedes no les han entregado los restos de arturo. 
>>> No solo a mi, hablo por todo, los unicos restos que entregaron son los de jenni, la informacion es casi nula, y practicamente no te dicen nada, que tienen que compaginar las pruebas. 

[00:32:13]


>>> Pero a la hermana de jenni no le cuadra que a sus familiares, a su hermano alberto se le haya practicado primero y que no se le haya entregado el cuerpo de arturo. 
>>> Por la situacion puede tardar 4 dias. 
>>> Ustedes fueron los primeros que entregaron su prueb de adn. 
>>> Si. 
>>> Lo unico que quiero es que entreguen ya el cuerpo. 
>>> Y lo unico es tener los restos, es lo que estan buscando. 
>>> Y que quiero que los tengan mis papas, y no se las autoridades, quien este a cargo de esto, que nos entreguen y podernos marchar, porque esta incertidumbre es horrible. 
>>> Hasta el momento no tuvo contacto con lupillo, despues que le aviso a lupillo de este accidente. 
>>> Hay un grupo de personas, amistades de jacob, de arturo, muchos fans que nos ayudan, queremos meter presion al gobierno de nuevo leon para que estos restos sean entregados ya. Hace un rato platicamos de la tranquilidad que te puede dar tener algo. 

[00:34:24]


>>> Se le nota a la familia de jenni. Al final de cuenta se desprende, pero necesitan tener algo, y entendemos que era la unica mujer, pero no queremos que se hagan oidos sordos y gente que respondio ya, el manager de espinoza paz, y que apoya y mete presion con contactos y gente, ana barbara agradezco, porque tambien era maquillista de kate, de ana barbara, y podemos ayudar. Se consiguio que no habia dinero para cremar los restos, es triste que aparte de toda la desgracia que le cayo a esta familia, le caigan estos problemas de decir no tengo para cremarlo, pero no me dan nada para hacerlo, nadie me ayuda. 
>>> Cuanto tiempo van a esperar. 
>>> Vengan en 8 dias a ver que le decimos. Pero no hablamos de un papel, hablamos de personas. 
>>> Habia un famoso, pero los otros tambien eran seres humanos. Y la presion de los resultados de jenni. Y toda la familia necesitan tambien los restos. 
>>> Era mas facil ver un pie con u??as pientas, seguramente sera mas dificil el trabajo. 
>>> Pero los han tenido viendo esta fotografias, que no nos gustan, a las familias se la pasaron no una, mil veces, pedimos al gobierno de nuevo leon que ayuden a que esta familia tenga los restos, platique con cynthia que decia quiero llevarle los hermanos, para que tengan paz mis padres. 

[00:37:01]


>>> Y respeto a toda la controversia de los pilotos, alejandro argudin, director de aeronautica civil mostro algunos documentos para dar mayor informacion. 
>>> Se encuentra el plastico de una licencia definitiva expedida a favor de este piloto con las mismas restricciones de transporte privado, una licencia vigente. A dicho de los propietarios de la empresa, se trataba de un prestamo, una promocion, en funcion que la artista jenni estuviera en deseo de adquirirla. 
>>> Mucho se dijo que si jenni tenia intencion de comprarla, finalmente habra informacion que nunca sabremos. Otra que saldra a la luz poco a poco. 
>>> Para efectos legales es mas facil esa version. 
>>> Pero dicen que no es cierto. 
>>> Pero se hablo la edad del piloto, el chiste es que no tenia caja negra, en el momento que se construye no tenia caja negra, y quizas en alguna remodelacion se la podrian haber puesto. Nadie sabe nada sobre la causa. 
>>> Ayer en la informacion que teniamos es que habian detenido a unos policias que se habian intado robar algunas de las cosas que habian encontrado en este lugar, un celular de arturo rivera que habian querido adquirir, y en un sitio de internet, san que nunca falta el aprovechado, y se ofrece una faja que era de jenni, por la cantidad de 4 mil pesos, y hay un mensaje que dice tengo como comprobar, y tambien algunas extensiones de cabello, si gustan les mando mas foto, esta grande, algo sucia, y huele a perfume. 

[00:39:34]


>>> Tengo una mala noticia para usted, arturo usaba faja, que pena que le tiro el changarro, creo que su faja la puede poner donde quiera. 
>>> Lo mas importante es que es triste que muchas personas utilicen esta situacion para lucrar. 
>>> Y sacaron fotografias que trataron de vender, y ante el dolor que esto puede provocar tengas la sangre fria. 
>>> Ademas no aparece la ropa y no las maletas, que eran caras. 
>>> Pero se deshizo el avion. 
>>> Bueno, mas adelante tendremos a raul de molina desde los angeles con mas detalles del caso de jenni. ??? ??? 

[00:44:34]


>>> se??oras, vamos a transformaciones y recordando mas de jenni rivera. 
>>> Si, vamos a ver las transformacion en la musica de la diva de la banda. Y esto es algo bueno. Y aqui el primer look. 
>>> Que edad tendria? 
>>> Como 18? 
>>> No, 23. 
>>> Se ve chiquita. 
>>> Ahi esta jenni en este album que se llamo somos rivera. Y el look muy lupillo. El sombrero, otro disco de 1994 con los viajeros del norte. 
>>> Pero chino, chino. 
>>> Se usaba la base. 
>>> Claro, y vemos esa fotografia. 
>>> Aqui si quieres verme llorar este disco es de 1999 cuando empezamos a escuchar mas de ella. 
>>> Interrumpimos con una noticia de ultima hora. 
>>> Que tal, para informar lo que pasa en connecticut, varios reportes de un terrible tiroteo, ocurrido en la escuela primaria sandy, distintos reportes que sugieren que no unicamente que la persona que disparo murio, sino decenas de heridos y muertos. Podemos confirmar que hubo un tiroteo en connecticut, y se puede reportar varios ni??os, estaremos investigando, tendremos la ultima informacion mas adelante en el "noticiero univision" y en los boletines de prensa. Gracias, buenas tardes. ??? ??? 

[00:46:47]

>>> Jenni y sus mejores... No alcance a leer. 
>>> Este es del 2001 un disco que viene de una musica mas de corridos. Venian corridos, canciones mas bravias, para el pueblo, mas diferente. 
>>> Y mas sensualidad, como que los ojos son mas coquetos. 
>>> Este disco me encanto, con el que en mexico viene con la cancion "se las voy a dar a otro". Porque tu no la quisiste. La tuviste tanto tiempo y no la aprovechaste. 
>>> Claro. 
>>> Al 2003 jenni saca homenaje a las grandes, un disco con canciones que grandes hicieron famosas. Y se ve hermosa, delgada, elegante. 
>>> En el 2004 saca el disco de simplemente la mejor. Y notamos mas glamour en el look. En su tono de pelo, maquillaje. 
>>> Con este disco es el que conozco a jenni, parrandera, rebelde y atrevida. Y hay discos como besos y copas, para todos los fans, para la gente que conoce mas de ella y que le gusta la musica, este disco es importante, porque narra en cada cancion algo importante de su vida, como les habla a las madres solteras. 

[00:49:06]


>>> En el 2007 la diva en vivo. Es un disco en vivo. Muy autobiografico, en este va diciendo por que y lo que fue su vida. 
>>> Ese estaba muy padre.

>>> Y este tambien en el que venian diferentes recopilaciones, este tambien fue un gran disco, y la podemos escuchar cantando con banda, mariachi, y este ni se diga, batio record de ventas, porque salio "las joyas prestadas por banda". Y se vendieron como discos de shakira. Y nos falto el disco de la misma gran se??ora, donde podemos escuchar la cancion "cuando una dama muere".

>>> interrumpimos con una noticia de ultima hora. 

[00:55:48]


>>> Presentamos imagenes de lo que ocurre en estos momentos en una escuela primaria en connecticut, la informacion no esta confirmada, vemos en estos momentos a agentes de la policia recorrer parte de la escuela. Lo que sabemos es lo 
siguiente: De acuerdo con testigos que hablaron con periodistas de distintos medios, una persona empezo a disparar, y hasta el momento existen reportes no confirmados que el pistolero, el primero que disparo dentro de la escuela esta muerto, pero al mismo tiempo, y esto es lo mas preocupante, reporte de decenas de heridas, y quizas tambien de muertos, en estos momentos no tenemos la oportunidad de confirmar la cantidad de heridos y muertos, pero reportes sugieren que hay varios ni??os. Es una informacion que surge en este momento, nuestra corresponsal tiene la ultima informacion, esta via telefonica desde ahi. Blanca rosa, que sabes? 
>>> Buenos dias. Adicional a lo que informas, los ultimos informes hablan de un vinculo con uno de los jovenes de 20 a??os que posiblemente participo, y el vinculo es que habia tenido un altercado con la directora del colegio, son las ultimas informacion que estamos escuchando por parte de algunos de los padres de familia que son decenas que han ido a recoger a sus ni??os, y empezo todo alrededor de las 9:40 de la ma??ana, y lo que te menciono es con respecto a lo ultimo que se sabe, son dos jovenes de 20 a??os, el vinculo es a traves de uno de ellos que tuvo algun problema, que tipo de problema, que tipo de altercardo? Tal fue que tenia alguna relacion con alguien del colegio, esta por verse, las investigaciones continuan y es caotico en termino de lo que esta ocurriendo, los heridos fueron trasladados al hospital mas cercano del area. 

[00:58:38]


>>> Lo mas preocupante de todo hasta el momento es la cantidad de posibles muertos y heridos entre los que se encontrarian varios ni??os, la cifra varian, y no me atrevo a confirmar, pero que estas escuchando sobre muertos y heridos. 
>>> Efectivamente, se habla de 27, y con respecto se habla entre 14 a 18 ni??os que posiblemente han muerto. Entre las edades podria deducir que son entre 5 a 10 a??os de edad. Con respecto a las cifras oficiales, a lo que podrian decir, a las 1 convocaron a una conferencia de prensa en el mismo lugar, donde el jefe de la policia va a dar mas detalles conrespecto a lo que ocurrio, y posibles motivos, y va a darnos un poco mas de luz en medio de esta tragedia, la cifra, la sola idea que hayan perecido tantas personas es realmente escalofriante. 
>>> Lo que podemos hablar es de como se fue desarrollando de la cronologia de lo que ocurrio, a las 9:40 de la ma??ana un pistolero entro a esta esa enconnecticut, y empezo a disparar, hay distintas fuentes de las que no pudimos confirmar, que sugieren que el numero de muertos esta en las decenas, y que hay entre los muertos varios ni??os. El gobierno de estados unidos y policia local tiene la intencion de dar brevemente una conferencia de prensa para reportar sobre lo que ocurre, y lo que vemos es lo siguiente, es una serie de ambulancias y agentes de la policia que se encuentran dentro del area de estacionamiento de la escuela primaria donde esta ma??ana hace aproximadamente 3 horas se realizo esta matanza, esto va a generar una nueva controversia y un debate sobre la posesion de armas, y sobre la segunda enmienda que lo permite. Estamos hablando de un condado donde el 20% de la poblacion es hispana, esto lo que sugiere que en la escuela primaria donde sucedio esto pudiera haber varios ni??os latinos, estamos viendo imagenes desde helicopteros, hay varios policias con perros que en este momento se encuentran recorriendo el area, y la principal preocupacion es asegurarse de que no hay otra persona armada dentro del centro educativo. Al mismo tiempo vemos a agentes movilizarse, en este momento no hay ni??os, esto paso hace 3 horas, esto sugiere que los ni??os que se encontraban dentro de la escuela ya fueron evacuados, y estamos viendo a diferentes cuerpos de la policia, tanto local, estatal, que todavia siguen recorriendo el area. En solo algunos minutos habra la primera conferencia de prensa para que todos nos enteremos, primero que fue lo que ocurrio, es imposible saber el motivo, lo mas preocupante es los reportes no confirmados, son reportes no confirmados que sugieren que hay muchos muertos, muchos heridos, de las victimas en decenas, y que entre los muertos y heridos se encuentran varios ni??os. Estamos viendo todavia imagenes de ambulancias algunas de las cuales no estan siendo utilizadas, y sugiere que toda la operacion de rescate y evacuacion de ni??os ya ocurrio testigos sugieren que entro entre 9:35 y 9:40 y empezo a disparar, y tambien informes no confirmados sugieren que murio al ser enfrentado por la policia o por algunos de los padres. La informacion que nos llega es todavia en partes, no confirmada, pero la sugerencia de lo que pudo haber sucedido ahi es terrible. Nuestra corresponsal se encuentra via telefonica, donde estas en este momento? 

[01:04:30]


>>> Estamos bastante cerca de donde paso esto, y la cronologia, este paso alrededor de las 9:40 recien la prensa y radio y television comenzamos a reportar de esto. Inicalmente lo primero que escuchamos que se trataba de una persona que habia fallecido, y se escucho una hora despues que una de las personas que habia producido este tiroteo era un joven, y que habia otro que todavia buscaban, ya alrededor de las 12 del dia que se empezo a escuchar quo y la otra persona al estaba bajo control, y como estas diciendo, hace medio, no e espuestamos hablade un de las y lo que estamos viendo son los centenares de padres que fueron enterando por los medios. Y que paulatinamente se fueron enterando como el resto de nosotros que esta era peror, y quiero aclaque porque realmente resultaria tambien ptme ptfi es frustrante, porque siempre ocurren este tipo de situaciones y hablamos del control de arma, y siempre hacer referencia de eso, t, y bypie y solamente ptfe y pthe>>> y quisieramos recordar que el martes en oregono hubo otro tiptl ptfeo ptfe y hay todo un debate en estados unidos sobre el control de armas, en las pasadas elecciones, ninguno de los dos candidatos quiso sugerir mayores restricciones para el uso de armas en estados unidos. Y quienes defienden el uso de armas se basa en la segunda enmienda que le permite portar armas. La pregunta de mucho es si armas de guerra o armas se les nes permido. Luego de la matanza en un cine en aurora, colorado, o lo que paso en oregon, o de lo que estamos viendo ahora, generalmente quienes defienden la posesion de armas de fuego y la segunda enmienda de la ctt constitucion, dicen que quienes matan no son armas sino las personas, y culpan como locos, o personas con problemas mentales. Y la pregunta es si una restriccion en el uso de armas evitaria estas matanzas, y si hay algun tipo de problemas, si seria facil manejarlo. Blanca rosa vilchez se esta acercando ya a la escuela. Y continuamos con esta cobertura, vemos imagenes del estacionamiento de la escuela primaria en connecticut, donde esta ma??ana hubo una matanza, dejenme darle la ultima informacion que llego del presidente obama, ya fue notificado de este tragic incidente, y va a seguir recibiendo reportes a lo largo del dia, esto lo dijo el portavoz presidencial. 

[01:10:11]


Y dijo: Todavia esperamos por mas informacion. Les y le y la agencia ap habla de 27 muertos, y entre los muertos estan reportando 18 ni??os o menores de edad entre los asesinados. Es la agencia ap. 
>>> Soninformacion que no confirmamos, pero si se confirma hablamos de una de las peores masacres denal, recuerdo en esto caso se trata de una esl escuela, estamos hablando no de solo una sino varias armas de fuego involucradas, estas son imagenes desde connecticut donde hay, no vemos la presencia de ni??os, hay la presencia constante de distintos cuerpos de policias y agencias policiales de estados unidos. Ya no vemos ni??os. Ya no vemos ambulancias ni entrando ni saliendo. Y por lo menos sugiere que la situacion se encuentra bajo control, vimos distintos cuerpos de la policia que junto con perros estaban asegurandose que en las areas aleda??as no hubiera otros pistoleros o no hubiera mayor peligro, la mayor parte de los ni??os fueron evacuados, tambien la informacion de reuters que dice que una clase completa de estudiantes pudiera estado involucrado en esta matanza, es decir que hayan sido las victimas, lo reporta el diario haford, todo un salon de clase pudiera haber sido victimizado, es imposible saber si se trataba de una sola persona o de varias. Si se une a nuestra cobertura especial, aproximadamente a las 9:35 de la ma??ana, 9:40. Un pistolero entro a una escuela primaria en connecticut y empezo a disparar, los reportes iniciales decian que el pistolero habia muerto, y que dos personas mas habian muerto, fue cercano a las 9:35. Pero la informacion se convirtio terriblemente en una verdadera tragedia a medida que avanzaba el dia. La agencia de noticias ap habla de 27 muertos, y estas son imagenes del lugar y como han visto se han estado repitiendo, el presidente de estados unidos ya fue informado desde luego esto tomo a todos por sorpresa, el presidente barack obama, de acuerdo con el portavoz presidencial ya fue informado de este tragico incidente. Tambien dice el portavoz presidencial que esperan mas informacion, que el presidente sera actualizado lulargo del dia, no hay planes de ir a la zona de connecticut, y esto es interesante, el propio portavoz hablada del compromiso he renovar las prohibiciones a aarmas de ataque, y este fue el debate que tuvimos en las pasadas elecciones sobre si pondrian algun tipo de regulacion a las armas, el presidente obama dijo que esta a favor de prohibir en estos momentos armas que se utilizan en combate, armas que se utilizan en guerra, para las calles y las casas. Es un debate que sin la menor duda va a continuar. Hay que ponerlo en perspectiva, quizas la primer masacre que todos recordamos y que puso en entredicho el facil acceso de armas de fuego fue en la escuela colombain, en colorado, donde dos estudiantes dispararon a varios compa??eros. Tambien me toco cubrir una masacre de estudiantes en la universidad de virginia tech donde un solo pistolero disparo. Tambien en aurora, colorado, un pistolero que iba vestido como uno de los personajes de la pecula batman, y de confirmarse el numero total de muertos hablariamos de la peor masacre en la historia de estados unidos. Estos son ima, y pf y estas son igenes de la misma jrsf y donde estan entrando y saliendo miembros del policia ptfa dudosamente nos puedan indicar si bien bien no el motivo, las cifras que son terribles, una agencia haestables de 27 muertos, y de 18 ni??os que pudieran encontrarse ventre los muertos, puede ingresar a noticias univision.Com donde puede encontrar la ultima informacion, y la policia reporto varios heridos incluyendo a un maestro. Y la situacion es confusa, hay varios medios de comunicacion en el lugar, se fueron preparados que han llegado tres heridos a un hospital. Y miembros del equipo suat estan en el lugar. La policia estatal recibio la primera informacion a las 9:41 minutos. Y enviaron equipos de emery tambien indican que el acresor murio en la escena, no sabemos por que, quien le disparo al ae aeegrazvref la poblacion donde sucedio esto tiene 575 estudiantes, y tiene 50 maestros de tiempo completo, esta informacion estamos tratando de ponerla en contexto, pero mientras mas nos enteramos es mas preocupante, aqui hablamos de ni??os verdaderamente muy peque??os, hablamos de ni??os que no llegan ni siquiera a los 9 o 10 a??os. Es decir que en esta escuela elemental habia ni??os de 10 a??os o menos, habia ni??os desde kinder hasta el cuarto grado. Habia ni??os maximo de 9 o 10 a??os. Otras de las informaciones, es que entre los posibles muertos, las autoridades basadas en interrogantes y en cuestionamientos de los padres de familia parece indicar que el ataque ocurrio en un salon de clases, porque las informaciones que tener sugieren que varios de los ni??os desaparecidos, cuyos padres no los han encontrado, sugiere que fue con un salon de clase. Hablamos de ni??os peque??os, de 10 a??os o menos, perlos maestros se encuentrmaestros de tiempo completo. Es una poblacion donde hay un 20% de hispanos. De acuerdo con la cadena cb s el pistolero era padre de uno de los estudiantes, es absurdo especular sobre que pudo haber hecho que el padre de uno de los estudiantes disparara dentro de la escuela de su hijo, y por que lo hizo en contra de los ni??os que se encontraban en el lugar. La situacion es absolutamente confusa en este momento. Es imposible saber en que momento las autoridades van a hablar, pero las proporciones de esta tragedia crecen conforme pasan los minutos. Es una situacion tan grave que el presidente de los estados unidos ya fue informado, equipos de seguridad estan ya a la escuela. Es demasiado tarde. La informacion de reuters se las vov a leer, que al igual que la agencia apolicia, habla del mismo numero de muertos, la policia esta realizando labores para asegurarse que en esta escuela no hay que hablan de la misma cibfra de muertos. Si se pudiera confirmar seria la peor masacre denentre la historia de estados unidos de acuerdo con uno de los policias, los disparesponsables se aarchiprsdre y el he ptf el director y sicologo de la escuela estan muertos. El pistolero es un adulto, es a la informamente que llega psf bsf que fueron recuperadas, hay reportes no confirmadistintos de que habia un segundo pistorero yp y es por la abilitacion ??e bsque podria haber otro pistolero, y segun la mayor parte de los reportes hablan de un pistolero ya muerto. Y la primaria sandy ense??a a ni??os de 5 a 10 a??os. Una de las madres de los ni??os llego a la escuela poco despues, se llama brenda levinski, y las palabras de ella resumen lo que sucedia. "Fue espantoso, todo el mundo histerico, padres, estudiantes, habia ni??os saliendo de la escuela sangrando". No se si eran heridos, estaban sangrando". Es la declaracion de una de las madres cuyo nombre es brenda levinski. Uno de los oficiales de la policia estatal de connecticut le dijo que esto va a ser malo, no se atrevio a dar cifras, pero de acuerdo con la policia estatal de connecticut la situacion es tan grave que sera uno de los peores dias que recuerde estados unidos. Esta es la madre que dio las primeras declaraciones a reuters, dice que un enmascarado entro a la oficina del director y que pudo haber sido el ataque inicial. Y que ella pudo constatar que el director habia sido herido. Nuestra corresponsal blanca rosa vilchez, ella esta en nueva york, pero tan pronto nos enteramos viajo a connecticut, donde te encuentras? 

[01:27:18]


>>> Estamos cerca del lugar de los hechos, y mira, es 1:26 de la tarde, la confe rerencia habia sido anunciado para mas temprano, pero un poco el retraso es por las informaciones. En primer lugar, y un poco para complementar, se habla de una clase que no saben en que situacion estan los ni??os, y no sabemos la cantidad de ni??os, pero se habla de una clase especificamente que las autoridades no han logrado darse cuenta de donde es que se encuentran. Con respecto al atacante, para confirmar lo que dijiste, tenemos informacion, que uno esta muerto, y que el otro esta bajo custodia. 
>>> Te interrumpo ahi. Hablas de dos pistoleros? 
>>> Si, uno el que la policia logro dispararle, o que fue lo que ocurrio, pero se habla que uno murio y que otro esta bajo custodia policial, es un elemento nuevo. Podemos resasumir que el retraso de la conferencia de prensa es que quieren ser mas preciso, y hay elementos totalmente nuevos que antes de dar la conferencia quieren confirmar. 

[01:29:22]


>>> Entonces, lo que sabemos es que definitivamente hubo un pistolero y esta por confirmarse si habia un segundo. Eso sabemos. 
>>> Efectivamente. 
>>> Habria que preguntarse si estos jovenes de 20 a??os podria ser padre de uno de los ni??os de 5 a 10. Aunque dicen que estaba vinculado con la escuela. La otra informacion es la siguiente, y estamos teniendo mucho cuidado, dos agencias muy respetables, la agencia ap, y reuters coinciden en el numero de muertos, y esto me lleva a la siguiente pregunta, hay toda una clase de ni??os, no sabemos de que grado, pero hay toda una clase cuyos padres declararon a las autoridades que no han visto a sus ni??os, sugiere que pudiera ser todo un grupo a quien uno de los pistoleros hayan disparado. 
>>> Uno no quisiera pensar que sea eso asi, pero es una de las alternativas o teorias que podrian ser. Hablamos de toda una clase, esto paso a las 9:40. Y ya sabemos que una clase no aparece, eso... 

[01:31:51]


>>> Me llega informacion de eso, y la agencia de noticias reuters dice que una clase entera sigue sin ser localizada, y esto reporto un diario local y quien cito a fuentes anonimas dijo que 20 personas recibieron disparos, y que tuvieron lugar en una clase de jardin. Y la cadena cb s, reporto 27 muertos, y 18 ni??os. Blanca rosa, la informacion vamos a tratar de una clase desaparecida y pudiera tratarse de una clase de kinder. Hay uno de 20 a??os y otro de 18. Blanca, hablanos de connecticut, queda a 80 millas de nueva york. 
>>> Si, la cifra oficial, hemos venido a esta area a hacer reportajes con personas indocumentadas uno podria asumir dada la poblacion hispana en el estado y en la ciudad que tambien se encuentra reflejada en la de la escuela. 

[01:34:16]


>>> Como es esta ciudad? Es una ciudad de clase media, es de inmigrantes? Que recuerdas de newton? 
>>> Es una ciudad bastante peque??a, para estar ubicada en esta area triestal, es una ciudad de clase media, con poblacion trabajadora latina, que cada vez fue emigrando mas, y hay ciudades como nueva york que permiten que salgan del estado de nueva york, incluso en nueva jersey, y busquen mejores perspectivas. Y cuando recorrimos esta area, recuerdo que se trato de dar una especie de licencia de conducir, abrir sus cuentas corrientes, y que permitiera que no fueran asaltados cuando cobraban. Y esta alrededor de hora y medi media. 
>>> Y tengo mas informacion. De acuerdo con miembros de la policitan pronto otras escuelas fueron ordenadas que se cierren. Para decir entonces todas las escuelas fueron cerradas, y no es que hayan dejado salir a los ni??os, todos los ni??os se tuvieron que quedar en el lugar, y nadie podia entrar ni salir. Ahora el presidente de los estados unidos hablo directamente, de acuerdo con la informacion que llega de la casa blbnca, hablo con el director de cia, para instruir que hacer. 

[01:37:18]


Y la agencia ap dice: Que uno de los atacantes, y hay confusion, no sabemos si hablamos de un solo pistolero o dos. La mayor parte de los reportes sugieren que hubo uno solo, pero otros dicen que podria ser dos. Y lo mas grave de todo, y hay que reconecerlo asi, hablamos de la peor masacre de estados unidos si es que se puede confirmar las cifras. En la que coincidieron las cifras de muertos, ap y reuters coinciden en estas cifras, y entre las circunstancias hay una clase completa, y para entender esto nos acompa??a via satelite marta maduro. Doctora, es practicamente imposible entender esto desde el punto de vista sicologico, como lo explica? 

[01:39:37]


>>> Es un problema que la comunidad en si no puede entender, no hablamos de un individuo, sino dos pistoleros, esto a nivel de presion sicologica tendriamos que hacer un estudio previo, son dos personas que entran, no es un estado ni de ansiedad, ni de necesidad o de desequilibrio que tuviera un padre que entra a una escuela a hacer una serie de da??os tan grande, que va a dejar marcada por toda la vida, ya que es una epoca que marca mucho y nos lleva a lo que se llama un desorden afectivo ocasional que va marcar la temporada de la navidad. 
>>> Doctora, gracias por hablar con nosotros. Y vamos a la primera conferencia de prensa. Vamos a traducirles. 
>>> Como ustedes pueden imaginarse el gobernador esta horrorizado de lo que ocurrio, se reune con las familias, esta preocupado de lo que ha ocurrido, y para darle a las familias la informacion, por eso el gobernador no esta aqui. Vamos a hablar con un representante de la policia estatal para saber lo que ocurrio, y le queremos dar la informacion, pero el gobernador, la principal preocupacion es darle la informacion a las familias. El coronel de la policia estatal. Buenas tardes, les voy a dar informacion basica de lo que ocurrio, y despues le diremos como darle mas informacion. Despues de las 9:30 recibimos una llamada al 911 de emergencia de la escuela. Y inmediatamente pedimos ayuda para saber lo que ocurria, agentes llegaron al lugar de la escuela y empezaron a buscar a un pistolero dentro de la escuela, esto implicaba buscar al pistolero, luego fue tratar de evacuar lo mas rapido posible a todos los estudiantes. Toda la escuela fue buscada, investigada, los estudiantes y los maestros fueron llevados a un lugar temporal y luego se les permitio salir. Hay varios muertos, no hay informacion exactamente cuantos muertos hasta que podamos notificar a los familiares, el pistolero murio dentro del lugar, hay mucho trabajo que se realiza para se busca a personas vinculadas para conseguir la mayor informacion posible. Y para saber mas de este individuo. El lugar esta protegido, y hay muchas agencias del gobierno que trabajan juntos para tratar de saber lo que ocurrio, lo vamos a tener informados de lo que ocurre de una forma regular. Y este es el representante de la policia de connecticut. Dijo que el gobernador recibio las condolencias del presidente. Y que va a ayudar con todos los recursos para ayudar a todas las victimas de esto. En este momento el gobernador hablara al respecto, pero la prioridad es dar informacion a las familias. El representante de la policia estatal, que es el teniente coronel que habla, dice que no va a responder preguntas, el anterior era el representante del gobernador. No han querido contestar preguntas, y pueden entender la enorme preocupacion y todas las preguntas que hay, es la informacion oficial que llega de la policia estatal, alrededor de las 9:30 la policia recibio una llamada dellugar al 911. Encontraron a un pistolero, no hablaron de dos, a quien mataron en el lugar, luego pusieron a los ni??os en una zona segura hasta que los pudieran recoger, no quiso dar cifras sobre el numero de muertos, y la razon es la siguiente, la policia estatal y local, las agencias federales tienn la obligacion de no dar informacion publica hasta que los familiares sean enterados primero, nnos quieren decir a nosotros cuantos muertos hay. Y quienes son hasta que los familiares no tengan informacion, es la razon por la ue no estuvo en la conferencia d prensa, dijo que la prioridad es tener toda la informacion, se refiere a saber quienes son los muertos, quienes son los heridos si se puede confirmar la muerte de los ni??os y hablamos de 18 ni??os muertos que los padres sean los primeros en enterarse, y no los medios de comunicacion antes que los padres, por eso no estan dando las cifras totales. La doctora marta maduro se encuentra via telefonica con nosotros. Doctora, disculpa, tuvimos que interrumpir, y por que ocurre este tipo de cosas, hay muchos ni??os que se enteran de lo que ocurre, la primera pregunta es que deben hacer los padres. Y estoy pensando en mi hijo de 14 a??os para tratar de explicar lo que ocurrio. La explicacion que se le tiene que dar mas que todo en esta epoca es que estos muchachos que efectuaron esto, son s sentimientos realizados con alguna perdida, no es un solo muchacho el que entra a atacar, es un problema a nivel individual, llevar a a los ni??os a una terapia, o grupal, que sea una parte explicativa y sanadora, porque hay que explicar algo consiso y hablarle de un desorden que pudo terminar en uno de los atacantes, no es lo mismo que tomar un individuo que nos llevan a un diagnostico. 

[01:48:52]


>>> Derecha, y ante los ni??os que no estuvieron involucrados, nos estan viendo, estoy seguro logico pensar que si paso en una escuela en connecticut puede pasar en texas, en la florida, nueva york, california. Como se maneja esto? 
>>> Esto es explicarle que pasamos por un problema conflictivo y que se van a tomar muchas seguridades, los sicologos deben cer un programa preventivo y no sienn temor, estoy segura que van a tomar las medidas para hacer informaciones a los ni??os, para hacer terapia de grupo, para bajar el nivel de ansiedad. 
>>> Como se le explica a un ni??o, que ven a traves de de los jue juegos de video. 
>>> Van a tener que explicarle a los ni??os los diferentes trastornos que existen en el ser humano, que hay trastorno de bipolaridad, explicar que esto tiene cura, son tratamientos que hay que explicar, entonces, se hace una serie de charlas donde se prepara, es un momento de mucha violencia, los videos, television, juegos, hacen que se asimile de manera negativa, es importante que tengan control de los ni??os, porque muchas cosas se deben a la violencia comunicacional que existe. 

[01:51:24]


>>> Una vez que ocurre esto, cual es la sugerencia? 
>>> Que los padres y ni??os deben asistir, la parte de esta comunidad debe asistir a grupos urgentes, porque es por temporada que va a quedar fija en los padres de familia, tanto de los que fueron afectados como las que tienen los ni??os, es una ayuda grande para que no quede dentro de las connotaciones mentales como que va a repercutir en todas las comunidades, y bajo un tratamiento preventivo no formaria parte de la sociedad. 
>>> Gracias, doctora. Se lo agradezco. Desde el punto de vista periodistico reportamos cada vez mas matanzas, en colorado en 1999 hubo dos estudiantes asesinados. Y recordaran lo que paso en oncine donde hubo 12 muertos, y de confirmarse esta informacion de la agencia ap, hablamos de por lo menos 27 personas asesinadas, incluyendo a 28 ni??os. Porque hay reportes de decenas de heridas, la agencia dice lo siguiente, que de confirmarse esto, se trataria uno de los tiroteros con mayor victimas fatales. Y este a??o que han dejado numerosos muertos, el reporte confirma que tiene 24 a??os. Y tambien otro informe que dice que el pistolero podria ser padre de uno de los ni??os. El representante de la policia estatal de connecticut informo que habian encontrado a un solo pistolero, y que murio en un enfrentamiento con fuerzas y es imposible saber exactamente. La otra agencia, abc tambien reporta la misma cifra. Ap, reuters y abc hablan de 27 muertos, incluyendo 18 ni??os. Y el pistolero es una persona de 24 a??os de edad. No 20. Que llevaba 4 armas, llevaba vestimenta negra, y que llevaba un chaleco. Y de acuerdo con el reporte de la cadena ab cuc dice que entro primero a la oficina del director de la escuela, el director se llama dom... Tanto el director como el sicologo murieron ahi. Vamos a recordarles que esto no es un hecho desafortunado, son hechos frecuentes en estados unidos, y mucho mas frecuentes de lo que quisieramos reconocer. Estados unidos sufrio multiples matanzas, el 20 de julio otro hombre, un estudiante universitario asesino a 28 personas en aurora colorado, se entrego tranquilamente despues. Y en el pasado, el que tanto dolor causo, el tiroteo, en la escuela secundaria, estas imagenes todos recordamos, en colo colorado. Y hasta el momento hablamos de un pistolero, y el perfil empieza a clarificarse mas, hablamos de un joven de 24 a??os que llevaba 4 armas. Que iba vestido de negro, y se habia puesto una mascara para entrar a la oficina del director, y tanto el director como el sicologo estan entre los muertos, el reporte es que habian muerto un pistolero y dos adultos, fue la primera informacion que habiamos recibido, pero poco a poco se fue extendiendo, y lo que tenemos que saber todavia, es la cronologia de los hechos de esta ma??ana, si el pistolero llego primero a la oficina del director y donde mato al director y al sicologo, y despues fue a asesinar a varios ni??os , particularmente concentrados en un salon de clase de jardin de ni??os que sugiere que algunos de los muertos pudieran ser de los ni??os mas peque??os, en esta escuela de cerca de 500 estudiantes.

>> Deborah: Hello everybody and thank you for joining us. As we broadcast today from hollywood, florida. I'll tell you why I'm here a bit later but first we begin with the latest on that horrible school shooting at an elementary school in connecticut. 27 are dead. Including 20 children. In what is being called the worst shooting at a grade school in u.S. History. 27 people are dead. 20 of them children. And one of the worst school shootings in american history. It happened at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. When news of the slaughter first broke, there was no indication of the awful extent of the unfolding tragedy. 

[00:02:20]


>> There have been multiple reports of a shooting at an elementary school in newtown, connecticut. 
>> But it quickly became an event so shocking even veteran reporters had difficulty reporting the news. 
>> It certainly ranks as one of the worst mass shootings in this country in decades really. 
>> This is the network reporting 27 dead. 27 dead. 
>> Unimaginable numbers. 27 people dead. 
>> The gunman who was found dead at the scene was identified as the member of a family named lanza. It's being reported that the shooter's mother nancy lanza was one of those killed at the school. She was a teacher there and most of the slaughter reportedly took place in his mother's classroom. There are also reports that one lanza brother was being questioned by police. The school looked like a battle zone with heavily armed s.W.A.T. Teams assembled outside. 
>> The majority of those who died today for -- were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. 
>> The president wiped away tears and seemed to struggle to maintain his composure as he spoke about the massacre. 
>> They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings. 
>> These terrified children hands on each other's shoulders were evacwaited to safety. Look at the expression on this little girl's face. Distracts parents waited outside the school desperate for news. 
>> The school is off to my left here still an active crime scene. Now participants have been ushered to the fire house to be reunited with their children or to hear the grim news that their child didn't survive. Grief and fear is etched in the face of this mom and these two children cower in terror. This little boy was taken out wearing a policeman's jacket to keep warm. It's the second mass shooting in america in a week. On tuesday, a gunman opened fire on shoppers at a mall in portland, oregon. Before turning the gun on himself. Experts say the shooting underlines the need for realistic drills like this one at schools across the usa. Safety expert steve kardian. 

[00:04:41]


>> It hits us even worse because the children are so young and so helpless. They cannot defend themselves. They cannot comprehend what is going on. They are very, very soft targets. 
>> The high school students in new jersey went through a simulated attack by armed teens who opened fire on the student body. This training video shows what some experts recommend during an attack in school. 
>> What if that gunman actually enters the classroom? What do you do? 
>> If the gunman enters the classroom and you believe you're about to be shot. Go for the gun, go for the gun, go for the g. Neutralize his attack and yell for the kids to get out of there. 
>> But many of the victims in today's elementary school maacre were kindergarteners. Too young to defend themselves against a madman. 
>> Deborah: The shooting is all the more shocking because of where it took place. Newtown, connecticut is the kind of place where nothing horrible is supposed to happen. It's a quaint new england town where parents usually feel safe. But today that's all changed. 
>> Newtown, connecticut was called the safest place in america. Before a madman's rampage at sandy hook elementary school. Look at the promotional video of newtown. An idyllic peaceful place where anyone would want to live. It's small town america at its very best. Each year, the townspeople gather for the labor day parade and they just had the christmas tree lighting ceremony. Newtown is surrounded by rolling hills, open fields, and picturesque streams. It was founded in 1711. It has a population of just over 27,000. And the median household income is more than $111,000. Two and a half times the national average. Newtown is just 90 minutes from new york city and a great place to raise kids. Who can feed ducks at the lake or skateboard at this specially designed skateboard park. Actor anthony edwards of "er" fame lives in newtown and kim kardashian's stepfather bruce jenner went to high school there. The local schools are a big draw for young families. They're considered among the best in the state. Look at these photos taken at sandy hook elementary in happier days. A fireman gisafety tips, the school carnival, students perform in a choir. Principal dawn hochsprung posted this picture on twitter of a safety drill just three months ago writing "safety first at sandy hook." Until now no one could have ever thought a nightmare like this could have happened here. 

[00:07:12]


>> Deborah: As all of america comes together in grief over the shooting we remember other school massacres that have similarly stunned america. Over and again we're forced to ask ourselves how can anyone target completely innocent victims? 
>> An unimaginable day of sorrow in newtown, connecticut. The worst massacre at a grade school in u.S. History. Sadly, we've seen this kind of scene unfold all too often before. 
>> This happens at schools because it's the place that has the biggest shock value for the shooter. This is someone who wants to come in and create mayhem and create horror. In 1999, the nation watched in horror as students at columbine high school in littleton, colorado scrambled to escape as teenagers eric harris and dylan klebold opened fire. 
>> Everyone around me got shot and I begged him for ten minutes not to shoot me. 
>> They were captured on surveillance camera calmly walking around the school firingmiautomatic weapons. They murdered 12 students, one teacher, and injured 21 others before committing suicide. 
>>> In 1997 in paducah, kentucky, three students were killed and five wounded when 14- year-old michael carneal opened fire on his classmates taking part in a prayer circle. The following year in jonesboro, arkansas, four students and one teacher were killed by 11-year-old andrew golden and 13-year-old mitchell johnson. The baby faced killers pulled the fire alarm and then opened fire on their classmates and teachers as they poured out of the school. 2007 saw the deadliest attack ever at a college campus. It happened at virginia tech university when disturbed student seung-hui cho killed 32 people and wounded 17 others, one of the saddest school shootings happened in 2006 after a one room amish schoolhouse in bart, pennsylvania. Charles roberts took the entire school hostage and shot ten girls age 6 to3. Killing five of them before committing suicide. Now once again the most innocent of victims. Elementary school children in newtop, connecticut find themselves -- newtown, connecticut, find themselves the target of a lunatic. 

[00:09:33]


>> This shocks a nation and even more it shocks a world because no matter what our differences are, we all share as human beings the love of children. 
>> Deborah: Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected by the school shooting in connecticut and of course we'll have more details on the story as they develop. 
>>> Other news today taylor swift is breathing a sigh of relief now that a man is in custody after he tried to break into her nashville home allegedly armed with a knife and he targeted the star right on her 23rd birthday. 
>> Police say this is the man who tried to break into taylor swift's nashville mansion armed with a knife. 24-year-old jacob kulke is behind bars today. He traveled by bus from wisconsin to be with taylor on her 23rd birthday. He was arrested just before 2:00 a.M. After allegedly jumping the fence at her mansion. He tweeted the mysterious message the day before -- the next tweet is a happy birthday wish to taylor, along with the photo he apparently took at the nashville bus station. Kulke has a rap sheet that includes convictions for assault and burglary. His laer is calling the incident a misunderstanding and claims kulke had an online relationship with taylor. Taylor is not at home. She's in england with harry styles, her one direction boyfriend. Who gave her 23 cupcakes to mark the day. ?????? ?????? taylor just released her 23rd video and it's getting lots of attention from the fashion press for her edgy new look. The heavy dark eye makeup gives the country cutie a tougher harder look. ?????? ?????? 
>> Deborah: And we'll be right back. 
>>> Next -- the worst school shooting in u.S. History. The heartbreaking images. 

[00:11:36]


>> And banned. 
>> Please welcome hugh grant. 
>> Why jon stewart is calling actor hugh grant his worst guest ever. 
>> Plus, doomsday 2012. You won't believe how many people are bracing for the end of days. Buying protective gear, stocking up on goods this man sells. 
>> The food, the water, first aid, sanitation. 
>> The end of times phenomenon. 
>> Then -- my bodyguards. How close could these guys have gotten to strangling justin bieber with a necktie? 
>> You have to anticipate a potential problem. 
>> "Inside edition" in high DEFINITION WILL BE RIGHT BACK. ?Yo?? 

[00:14:24]


>>> School massacre. Worse than columbine. Next "inside edition," what we've learned about the madman who slaughtered so many innocent kids. 
>>> Then you've never seen a gym like this. It's only for overweight people. 
>> Everyone's in the same boat. It's not just me. 
>> How these supersized members are shedding hundreds of pounds. Watch the next "inside edition." 
>> Deborah: If new jersey governor chris christie does decide to run for president some day he should expect a lot of ribbing from david letterman. The late night host regularly poked fun at the weight and last night he was at it again. 
>> The feud continues between david letterman and governor chris christie. It's been on for months and letterman kept it up last night with the top ten list. 
>> Top ten signs you're too heavy to be president. Here we go, number four -- and the number one sign you're too heavy to be president -- 
[ laughter ] 
>>> first daughter malia obama has her first cell phone. The revelation comes courtesy of barbara walters. Who got the scoop straight from the president and michelle. 
>> Malia has gotten a cell phone. And the president said you know 
-- one of the reasons think that he says one of the reasons I'm glad I was re-elected is that I have the secret service to keep my eye on the girls especially now that malia is getting old enough for boys to be calling. 
>> Malia is 14 and the first lady plans to keep track of just who her daughter is talking to. 
>>> And I just -- 
>> ow! 
>> Wow. 
>> Ouch is right. Someone gave matt lauer a cactus for christmas. And he cut his hands unwrapping it. 
>> Bleeding here. Ow. 
>> Deborah: Those three men who were allegedly plotting to murder pop sensation justin bieber remain behind bars but bieber's bodyguards aren't taking any chances. Paul boyd explains they're taking extreme measures to be sure no one gets too close to the star. 

[00:16:35]


>> Justin bieber fans are still reeling over the shocking reports about a plot to kill the teen idol. But how close could these three suspects really have come to strangling bieber with a necktie as they allegedly planned? In bieber's concert movie "never say never" he's constantly protected by a beefy bodyguard named kenny hamilton. The two are practically joined at the hip. Watch as the bodyguard playfully hoists bieber right off the ground. 
>> It's an uncle/nephew relationship. 
>> And watch how hamilton moves a blond fan out of the way as justin bieber comes through. Security expert lou palumbo. 
>> You have to anticipate a 
>> the anticipation is a critical component if being able to protect people. You have to be able to detect a potential problem. 
>> On a trip to france justin bieber is literally surrounded by bodyguards. They got his back as he takes pictures of himself with his fans. But bieber may want to tone down the profile. He tried the mirrored $120,000 fisker car. Not exactly a low-key way to get around town. 
>> When you're successful in a particular area in life, you t need to go out there and be flamboyant about it. 
>> That's the price of superstardom. You can afford anything. But you always have to be on full alert. 
>> Deborah: Well, most of russian preparing for christmas 
-- us are preparing for christmas and new year's, some people think it's not really coming. In fact there are plenty of doomsday believers who believe the world will be coming to an end in exactly one week all because of an ancient prophesy. Les trent has more. 
>> Is this what your neighborhood is going to look like next friday? These are scenes from the hit apocalypse movie "2012." Based on the ancient prophecy that the world will end on DECEMBER 21st. But for many, this doomsday date is the real deal and they're bracing for the end of time. CHECK OUT THIS YouTube VIDEO Shot last month by a guy who calls himself daniel the prophet. 

[00:18:38]


>> A little bit more than a month left until the end of time as we know it. DECEMBER 21st, 2012. 
>> Business is booming at this emergency preparedness store in los angeles. Sos survival products. Jeff edelstein is the owner. 
>> Usually december is a slower month. But right now with people thinking december 21st might be the end of the world, sales have skyrocketed. 
>> And get this -- many believers think this mountain in france is where aliens will appear to whisk them to safety that day. The peak has been considered a mystical place for hundreds of years. WHY IS DECEMBER 21st, 2012 Inspiring such fear? It all comes down to the fact that the calendar of the mayans an ancient central american civilization supposedly ends that day. The history channel did a whole one hour special on the subject. 
>> Time is running out. Prepare for doomsday. 
>> And what's going to cause the end of the world? Let's consider the options. Some think it will be a cosmic collision. Others say global plague or maybe solar flares. Even the prestigious space agency nasa felt the need to address the phenomenon. They released the video showing what the world will look like. After doomsday. Just the same as every other day. 
>> If you're watching this video it means one thing. The world didn't end yesterday. 
>> Nasa also has a webte section debunking december 21st fears. 
>> This will pass. Christmas will happen. 
>> Michael shermer is the publisher of "skeptic" magazine. 
>> People have predicted the end of the world for thousands of years and not one of them has come true. What are the chances that this is the right one and all the other thousands of predictions are wrong? Zero. 
>> Even so, the doomsday believers are convinced this is what we can look forward to next friday. 
>> Deborah: And no matter what the future holds, we will be right back. 
>>> Still to come -- banned.

He's giving everyone blank the whole time stewart said. Grant appeared on "the daily show" in 2009 to promote his movie with sarah jessica parker "did you hear about the morgans?" Can the actor looked annoyed that stewart didn't bother to see or do anything research about the movie.

=======================================================

Midst of a tense -- with no deal to stop the fiscal cliff and multiple bruises battles on the horizon, the ambassador to the u.N. Didn't want to risk hurting the president, so she withdrew her name for consideration for secretary of state. 
>> Did you want the job? 
>> I would have been very honored to serve in that job, just as I'm delighted to do what I'm doing. But yeah, sure, in my field, how can you not want to serve at the highest possible level? 
>> Susan rice supported him in his election for president. In the beginning, she snt untold hours advising him without pay. The president defended her to the end, she is likely to get another big job in the future when there's an opening and he is meeting with her later today. Here's whate said in the local interview with station kcra. 
>> I hadn't made a decision about who would be my next secretary of state. There's no doubt that susan was qualified. There are people who are qualified as well. Hers interest isn't in serving me but more importantly serving the country. I could not be prouder of her, she will continue to be one of the top advisers of my national security team. 
>> I want to bring in the political reporter for the candidate. Molly, is there any other way she could have played this, do you think? 
>> I think from the fact that she's talking about it gracefully and accepting it and indeed offered herself to pull out, that she's not kicking and screaming, she's not being forced against her will. But it doesn't seem that the administration didn't really fight her when she pulled her name out of contention. 

[00:02:01]


>> Madeleine albright said -- do you think it still had the sting for the president and if it did, what are the implications of that in relationship with the republicans? 
>> I think the president has much bigger fish to fry and fighting looming with the republicans and so I don't really think this becomes a lasting issue. I think that at the end of the day, the administration probably didn't think it was helpful to have a bruising nomination fight where benghazi and libya was going to be litigated day after day at some future point which would probably consume a lot of television and news time. And I think that if that wasn't the case, if we were just talking about some tough questioning, she wouldn't have withdrawn, the administration would have made it clear, you're not going to withdraw, we don't want that. But there are just to many priorities and tough political battles ahead and a sort of uncertain economy, this was something that probably both sides, but I do think the white house deemed as unnecessary. 
>> The whole thing started really as sort of this uproar over her on the part of a few republicans with her appearances on the sunday shows. And brian williams asked susan rice about that. 
>> Why was it you what sunday morning, of all the people in government, why the u.S. Ambassador to the united nations answering questions about the attack on benghazi. 
>> It wasn'ta unusual, I have done sunday shows many times in the past. Secretary clinton had originally been asked by most of the networks to go on. She had had an incredibly grueling week dealing with the protests around the middle east and north africa that it envol lopped our embassy. She consoled the whole state department and greet the families and the boths. She declined to do it. And I was asked by the who is if I would do it, as the next senior american diplomat. 

[00:04:06]


>> Would it have been a whole different thing if hillary clinton had done those shows that day or would there still have been a fight over susan rice? 
>> We can't know, it's impossible to know if something else would have come up and she would have found herself answering for this controversy in other ways. I do think that we saw when susan rice went to capitol hill and attempted to make peace, not only with the senators who seemed set against her like john McCAIN, BUT SENATOR WHO IS Seemed more open to considering her like susan collins, that sort of diplomatic effort failed. She was not able to smooth things over with them and i think that was regarded by the administration as a bad sign for any potential nomination fight as well. 
>> All indications are david to follow up on what we were talking about that the white house and the president are upset over susan rice, susan cutter is upset about the way that susan rice was treated. One article described it as the -- while this does remove one fight in the middle of the other fight, are these lingering feelings likely to get in the way of what has to happen now? 
>> I don't think so, I think there's enough going on to stir people up like that, I think this is really just a drop in the bucket. I think people are upset in the white house on the democratic side about how susan rice was treated. But if she's going to be the next secretary of state, she can't argue that, look, I just went on the sunday shows and said what people told me to say. Either you're in the loop and you're a senior part of the team who's responsible for what you're saying or you're not. This was the consequence of something that didn't go well. It may not ultimately be her fault, but you can't have it both ways and for a position like secretary of state, she would have been subjected to pretty tough questioning anyway. But this became a politically untenable situation for the white house. But they're going to move on and I firmly believe that whatever tension is going to continue to exist, which we know it will between republicans on the hill and the white house, democrats and republicans on the hill, it's going to be about far bigger things than this, that whoever's nominated for secretary of state is going to face a lot of tough questions about administration policy, but will most likely ultimately be concerned relatively easily, but because of the role she played in the benghazi situation, this was just not going to be the case for her. She might have squeaked in, but it was going to be rough. 

[00:06:34]


>> I want to bring in congressman tom cole, a republican from oklahoma. Good to see you again, congressman, good morning. What happened with susan rice, do you think that it is adding to, alleviating some of the tension that clearly is going on between some democrats and republicans over the fiscal cliff or has no impact at all? 
>> Frankly, obviously I don't know if it was susan rice's decision or the administration's decision, but I think she was going to have a pretty rough and tough nomination process, confirmation process, and that's a fight the president doesn't need right now, it would have been a distraction. 
>> Duds he get credit for that? Duds she get credit for that? Okay there,'s a concession that's bn made here. 
>> I'm sure that the president didn't want to make this move or have this made. But again, you can only fight so many battles. He's got a lot of other fightses that are coming. This is one he didn't need, he needs and I think the country would be best served by someone that's a unifying figure and can side step some of these situations. It's a smart and a very clear eyed decision by the white house. 
>> Let me tell you what the president had to say about the ongoing fiscal cliff negotiations in an interview with a local station. Think speaker boehner has a contentious caucus, as his caucus is tough on him, sometimes he doesn't want to look like he's giving in to me somehow because that night hurt him in his own caucus. Is the hard right of your own party still resistant to revenue at all, raising taxes on the rich? 
>> Remember, the revenue, the taxes go up attend of the month. And that's current law, that's not something that by digging in and holding on we can pre-vent. If we could, we certainly would u barks because none of us favor tax increases period. But I think speaker leads this caucus, he's not led by this caucus, ands caucus supports him tremendously. He's in a very strong position right now, and people think he led us through a very contentious election and they think back to some of the tough decisions he made in the negotiations and the debt ceiling negotiations, I think he's been vindicated in those decisions. He's got a line on the republican proposal, so I think actually the speaker's negotiating from a position of strength, but there are limits, obviously, just given the fact that taxes are headed up for most americans at tent of the month. So there's also some leverage only the democratic side. 

[00:09:18]


>> There's also a report that says there is no conclusive evidence between tax cuts and economic expansion. 
>> You can find plenty of economists that would quarrel and disagree with that and there's about as many disagreements on these kinds of things as there are congressmen. But nobody elects republicans to raise taxes. It's just something that most republicans instinctively d't want to do. I never met one who actual ran for office who said I'm running in order to raise taxes. You would be surprise issed if republicans were anything other than totally resistant to this. On the other hand I have never heard of democrats who want to cut spending. That's the issue here. We haven't heard anything from the president in terms of spending cuts and entitlement reform. 
>> Molly, the president and john boehner met at the white house yesterday, we heard that the meeting was, I think that the word that was used was frank, and again the lines of communications remain open, that's the statement that they put out as they did last time. Except that john boehner is going back to ohio this weekend. Is that a bad sign? Is that unexpected? What's going on? 
>> We didn't know much -- i think literally one word out of that conversation was the word frank. It's a good sign that they're talking, I don't think boehner is taking his toys and going home. The congrsman cole has been saying this for a couple of weeks now, republicans are coming around to this idea that they're going to have to give on those rates. They are going to have to have something in return if there's going to be a deal. But on the other hand, I think speaker boehner is going to have the votes to get it through. 
>> Obviously, david, we're now 18 days away, you could argue even less, most people are back in their districts, which is boehner among them. I thought it was interesting that senator olympia snow told "the washington post" that it's bizarre, it's truly bizarre, there's no sense of urgency. Do you sense any concern by members of congress about the optics of all this? I mean I can just say, anecdotally that people say, i don't understand, why aren't they getting this done? Why is the speaker going home? Why are members of congress going home? And you have some members of congress complaining they're totally out of the loop nymph. 

[00:11:46]


>> Until there's a frame work of a deal being discussed, there's no order of business. I would say two things, number one, there is concern, I talked to members this week who are aware that everybody's taxes could go up on january 1, will go up if nothing's done and that dews trouble them. But to your question of urgency, I don't sense a whole lot of urgency because there is not yet a fear that so-called going over the cliff, heading into january without a deal is going to cause some immediate fiscal calamity that's going to send the economy into a tail spin. I think if people believed that would happen rather immediately, there might be more urgency. So people still believe on both sides of the aisle that a bad deal is worse than no deal. And nobody wants to do that. 
>> Is there any urgency at all? 
>> No, but this is congress, they do don't anything until their backs are against the wall. They don't do anything until the deadline is right from front of their faces and strikes the fear of god in them. So nobody's surprised, and frankly I'm a procrastior too, I don't do anything until the deadline is staring me in the face. 
>>> There is a big development to tell you about coming out of the syrian crisis. The u.S. Is sending missiles and troops to turkey to help with defense.

Nato voted for that deployment last week. doing this... ...this... ...and this, dancing in their heads... ...we have these. Home Depot gift cards. Give the gift of doing, in-store or online. Bbb ?? 

[00:16:39]


>>> amid all the talk of fairness or unfairness concerning susan rice, it remains a critical time for president obama on the international front. The u.S. Is sending patriot air missiles and 400 troops to turkey as a possible defense from syria. And a senior official said syria's president bashar assad is losing control. And north korea is celebrating it's most controversial rocket launch. I want to start by asking you about susan rice because you did release a statement, she's meeting with the president today, your statement said the president and country will be denied the opportunity to have one of the nation's most capable ambassadors serve as secretary of state. But just a few minutes ago, your colleague tom cole had this to say. 
>> The country would be best to find somebody who can be a unifying figure. It's unfortunate for the individuals involved but it's a smart and very clear eyed decision by the white house. 
>> Was susan rice too divisive of figure, congressman? 
>> I don't think so. She's a very accomplished public servant and I think the attacks on her were unfounded and unjustified. Gop lawmakers are the ones who made this distraction to begin with, relying on a trumped up attack on her for relying on the cia and following her best judgment. It shows what a difficult town washington can be when someone performing their job with great integrity is attacked in this i think completely unjustified matter. 

[00:18:41]


>> Should the administration have fought harder for susan rice? That's a decision for the president to make, I don't know if ambassador rice was the choice he wanted, if she was the choice for him, he should have fought for her if he wanted her. 
>> Let me ask you some of the things that this new secretary of state will face. As we said the u.S. Is sending patriot air defense missiles and 400 troops to syria. The goal clearly is to show that they're going to make a commitment to deter a syrian attack. 
>> I think so and hope so. I can understand what why turkey would be very concerned and we have seen indications that syria has prepared in some respects these chemical weapons that is deeply disturbing and we have also seen that the mean sheen guns would be fired against the syrian people themselves, so if you have a government that's going to file -- chemical weapons and and as a neighboring -- regime you got to think, if they're willing to take the steps against their own people. I think it was a prudent step to take and I hope that she knows that any step it takes, it's chemical weapons against their own people or others would be met with a severest of consequences. Do you believe his role is almost over? 
>> Well, he's certainly lost control, but this week, we're only stating the obvious. But they can't help but see the deterioration in the position of the assad they're having to resort to more dire measures. It's pretty clear that the assad regime I think will not survive, but weather it will fall in a week or month, or whether we can soldier on for a year, that's very hard to predict. But I think we are definitely beyond the point now where from's any possibility of survival of this regime. 

[00:21:03]


>> Also making news after launching that rocket on wednesday, defying international warnings. Willing to defy the international community, what do you see, congressman, as the risk of that for the, not just international community, but for the u.S. As well. 
>> Not only is this missile technology and their nuclear technology a problem and a threat to the north koreans. We have to be concerned about them assisting the iranians or others in this work which is deeply disturbing, we need china's help, we need china's cooperation. And perhaps the only way that we can get china to cooperate that china understands that the north korean threat escalates a military presence in the region and that's something that china desperately doesn't want to see. But we have to make it clear that as north korea continues to capos a risk to us and a greater risk to us with missiles that could possiblily hit our shores. And that puts significant pressure on china in terms of its fuel supplies to north korea and other leverage that they can act in a way they really need to and they can act responsibly.

>>> With susan rice now out of the picture, there is a domino effect to take over key administration positions. Democratic senator john kerry and former republican senator chuck hagel, just two of the people who used to be in for a move. Joining me now is -- assuming we're all -- john kerry is a lock, will he face any opposition at all? 
>> It's the president's call in terms of which direction he decides to go. Senator kerry I would say is clearly the front-runner, i would say he's got qualifications, he's got support. 
>> He's going to get it, chris, isn't he? 
>> I would think so, I mean who knows? If he's nominated, the confirmation process will be relatively easy. He will face tough questions as they all do. The senator's club is a bit of a club and I have a feeling that they'll be a little bit more act come lating, unfairly I would say, because I think ambassador rice would be a good secretary of state. And she's been unfairly pushed aside and k50i7b of taking the target of all this criticism, the republicans have been just been focused on. But it is what it is at this point. 
>> What happens if expected indeed john kerry is nominated by the president. There's a report out there that duvall patrick has approached vicki kennedy about replacing senator kennedy, she is the widow of senator ted kennedy. What's your reaction to that? 
>> It would be a temporary appointment, because under the constitution, the governor typically--each state can make up its own mind but the governor typically appoints, I don't know what massachusetts law is that you serve until the next general election. But it could be that scott gets back in and tries for that seat. But if we can go back to ambassador rice, she had a chance to fix this, they sent her up to the hill at the end of september so go make nice with McCAIN AND GRAHAM SPECIFICALLY. As it was reported, a 75-minute meeting with susan collins, the moderate republican from maine, and she was really the tipping point, senator collins. Collins came out tremendously unimpressed with whatever went on in that meting and I think at that point the dye was cast for ambassador rice. 

[00:34:01]


>> It's expected that susan rice will get another big job at some point, there's talk about national security adviser if tom donovan leaves. And do you think that the gop could end up regretting susan rice taking her name out of contention? 
>> I don't think this was so much about ambassador rice, this was political, this was about benghazi, this is about the republicans trying to focus on something and making hay out of it. In terms of ambassador rice going up to the hill and making NICE WITH senator McCain. Moses couldn't play nice with senator McCain. If he gets it in his head that he doesn't like you, there's nothing going to change his mind. 
>> The point I was making was that nobody was going to change their mind based upon what senator McCain said or didn't say. 
>> The issue was you -- 
>> you judge a candidate -- if you can't no shut up, then you ought to be ambassador to the u.N. 
>> The point is you need to judge someone on their merits, not make it political and that's WHAT senator McCain did. 
>> We don't know what went on in the meeting with senator collins. He was the person that the white house I think was pointing to try to get the tide changed or at least to help break a filibuster, if that's what it came to, ambassador rice failed in convincing senator collins. McCAIN WAS OUT OF IT AT THAT Point. 
>> Let me ask you about this other talk, and we're going to play nice now. That a former republican senator chuck hagel could become the next defense secretary. What do you think, chris, how would democrats feel about that scenario? 
>> I think it would be a very interesting pick, senator hagel is tremendously respected on both sides. I think at the end of his political career as senator of nebraska, I think he rubbed some of the republicans a little bit wrong. In some circles. He knows the armed services issues, he knows the defense issues very well. I think he would be a very good pick and a very strong one, i don't see any kind of opposition to him if he's nominated. 

[00:36:20]


>> And rich, would it help to mend some fences some of the hard feelings? 
>> I agree with chris here, i think what the president may be looking for is somebody who can run the pentagon, knowing what the issues are on the hill, because the pentagon has to shrink, we all agree on that, and how they go about it and how they do is it very complicated. Because if a defense contractor has a contract to make paper clips for the pentagon, they get those made in about 47 different states, they figure out how to do that. So somebody like hagel who can maneuver through that plus has the history of being on the armed services committee. They're not looking for a battlefield commander, they're looking for somebody to be able to run the business side of it. 
>> Gentlemen, thank you very much. 
>>> We're following breaking news right now, state police are responding to a report of a school shooting in newtown, connecticut.

>> Let me go to a wvit with breaking news about that school shoot issing. Let's listen in. 
>> Respond in an emergent fashion. 
>> Can you give us an idea of what you're calling a platoon of troopers, and it's a fairly substantial department there in newtown, are we talking about dozens of police officers on scene at this point. 
>> You're talking about many troopers and officers on that team right now and I would suspect that the minute we can from that scene, we'll give you a confirmation and update as quickly as we possibly can from that scene. We will hold a press conference from that location. 
>> Thank you for the latest information, this is obviously a situation that is changing by the moment. Here is what we know right now. The breaking news is out of newtown, the entire public school district is in lockdown at this hour. Because of a police investigation and emergency response both state and local police to sandy hook elementary school. Lieutenant paul vance of the connecticut state police confirms that police have entered the school and have begun to evacuation students and administrators at sandy hook elementary. 
>> There's no concrete information yet about any injuries, but we do know that it is an active scene with state and local police on the ground there, they are working tactfully is what we're told by lieutenant vance. 
>> With this kind of situation and with the explosion of social media, we're getting a lot of information into our newsroom that we need to independently confirm before we report to you. So there are a lot of rumors out there about what's gng on here. So the reason we put lieutenant vance on the line is to get a true view of what's going on there at that school right now. We have learned that a reverse 911 call went out from the newtown public schools, to at least the parents of sandy hook elementary school, if not the entire district, went out to parents apprising them of what's going on at this moment. But because it's so new and so fresh, we want to make sure that police give us the proper information, we don't want to alarm anyone unnecessarily about this. But it is a serious situation out there. 

[00:41:07]


>> It is changing by the moment what's going on. We're going to do our best to get the information out to parents who are obviously very concerned. And lieutenant vance said there is a staging area for teachers and for officials. But really, it's probably a chaotic scene there, so the best thing is for parents to just stay informed and really act cautiously. 
>> No question. Let's take you back to the beginning of this. Lieutenant paul vance of the connecticut state police just confirmed that state police received a call for assistance at 9:41. We can only assume that local police responded shortly before that and realized it was a situation that required assistance from the state police. So it happened sometime in the 9:00 hour, this original emergency situation at sandy hook school on dickenson drive in the sandy hook section of newtown. If you're familiar with the area, you're looking at a google map's view, a satellite picture of the building. Can we bring up the road view just to give people an idea of where this is? This is just off of interstate 84 in the sandy hook section of newtown.

>>> Since susan rice took herself out of the running for secretary of state, her supporters have cried foul, her critics believe they have a victory. And this question is being asked anew. Will the president's cabinet have the diversity once promised? Our chief foreign affairs important andrea mitchell. 
>> Maybe it's janet napolitano moving over to attorney general, but among those four top posts, you've got to have more women, you've got to have more diversity. 
>> In washington, marsha greenberger, founder and co-president of the national women's law center. Good morning. 
>> The daily beast lloyd grove suggested their personality played a role in all of this. Here's what he wrote, in the rough and tumble political combat, personality trumps polity. She is frequently described in the press with such adjective as brusque, aggressive and undiplomatic in the extreme. Marsha, if susan rice were a man, do you think it's possible that the outcome could have been different? Do you see any gender bias in this operation? 
>> I can surely tell you we would not be hearing those kind of criticisms. To begin with, I think the attack on her was clearly so overblown and really w foundation, and then to add insult to injury, this kind of rationale, when the original statements that she made on talk shows was patently absurd, really is angering because the idea that women are too brusque or they're to too aggressive is such a drastic put down on questioning the idea that she's not smart. These are the things that drive women crazy and there's been study after study about women in the corporate setting and in every setting, they're damned if they do, they're damned if they don't, if they don't put themselves forward, they're pushovers, they're too wreak, they're not serious.

>> Could there be any kind of backlash, michael, could some of the republicans have already had a problem with minorities and women, if we look at the statistics from the last election, if we could just re-enforce those stereotypes. 
>> I think that's the thing that the republicans in the senate especially who would have to vote on the nomination would clearly have had to take into consideration, that would have been part of the political calculus from the president, can you put an african-american woman forward and does that make it more difficult is that calculation about a backlash make it more difficult for republican senators to oppose her, clearly the president, the white house felt that no matter what pressure they might feel, the opposition was still going to be very strong going forward. 
>> Michael, marsha, thanks for coming on. 
>>> We have this breaking news coming out of connecticut. Again, a report of a school shooting, wti has a parent on the phone, let's listen. 
>> Everything is fine with your daughter, if you would keep in contact with us as you find ow more information. 
>> I absolutely will, i appreciate it. 
>> We want to get accurate information out to people across the state. That was a parent at sandy hook elementary school who at a stroke of luck wasn't there this morning because of a doctor's appointment. 
>> Let's set the stage and go through this. A call came into state police at 9:41, 12 dickenson drive in newtown. Something about that call, police protocol went into effect and a platoon, what's being described to us by lieutenant paul vance of connecticut state police, a platoon of the teachers and the students were evacuated, I believe there's also a staging area that's been set up near the school. 

[00:50:02]


>> Liz, what are you seeing right there at the school? 
>> Hi, brad, we're here on dickenson drive, right on the streets, I have never seen anything like this, the line of cars is endless. Parents have been running down the street trying to get to their children. That staging area you guys spoke about, that triage area is set up behind sandy hooks fire department. I can see that right now. Dozens of ambulances back there, as far as we know, no one's being treated from what I can see at my vantage point, but it looks like they're all standing by. I'm sure you can hear some of the aulances in the background. It's kind of chaotic where we are right now. A lot of parents are trying to getanswers. They're getting as close as they can. 
>> Liz, how far away is that triage area, that staging area that you described, how far away is that actual school? 
>> I want to say that school from the map, looks to be about a third of a mile away from where we are right now. That's where lots of parents are gathering, I'm telling you what I see right now. Parents on cell phones trying to get in touch with their kids. Police officers trying to maintain order here and the fire departments from every single town, I can see lots of people responding to the scene right now, I don't see any children, i don't see any teachers. You can't get too close to the school right now, but we're set up at that triage unit waiting to see what unfolds here, but still a very active scene here in newtown. 
>> Liz, we are looking at live pictures right now, I don't think you realize that, but we have pictures from the scene, i think it might be your partner on this assignment. We can see the mass of cars and people, overhead, it looks like there's some sort of helicopter overhead, I'm not sure if there's a news helicopter or a police helicopter. Is there a sense that those ambulances are coming and going from the scene? Or are they staying? That's obviously key to the situation?

>> Reporter: Yeah, I honestly can't see the school from where we are right now, we just parked our cars and ran as close as we could to this triage unit. But the ambulances are also parked right here behind the fire department, it looks like right now they're all just standing by. But those pictures that you saw earlier did show that chopper overhead. It seems like there's the possibility that they're still looking for one of the shooters. That has not been confirmed by police yet. But a lot of parents here, just kind of waiting, standing by, trying to get answers. But we can't see the school from where we are right now, I don't see any ambulances coming from the school's direction. A lot of them just standing by waiting to possibly treat any kids or teacher who is might need them. 
>> And liz, the kids there at the school, is anyone coming out to talk to the parents? Are the parents getting any information? I can only imagine what is the mood when it comes to the parents? Is it orderly or is it more chaotic? 
>> Reporter: No, a lot of parents are holding their heads, it's only been a couple of minutes since they have been on the scene here. Everybody on their phone, just trying to get in touch with whoever they can. But you guys saw that maze of cars, I mean the parents are understandably rushed over here not knowing whether their kids were all right. Lots of parents embracing each other, trying to support one another. Most of them just gathering at the fire department right now. There's lots of ambulances standing by for anyone who could potentially have been hurt in what we think of this school shooting. 
>> Just to confirm, liz, we see people running around in that area. I can presume they looked like they would be parents in terms of their age and the way they're dressed, they're not first responders, and yet you don't see any children s there a sense that the parents have not been able to make contact with their children? This happened more than an hour ago. 

[00:54:26]


>> Reporter: Yeah, it does sound like that because as shirley said the entire district is on lockdown right now. I see a couple of little children, but they don't look like they would be kindergartners, first, second, or third graders. It seems that everyone is standing by on this waiting game right now. It's not a pretty sight to see out here. Because this is such a rush among the police officers and the parents obviously just want some answers. You did hear a reverse 911 call went out to the parents from the school. But again, in terms of getting in touch with the students, actually physically holding them, seeing how they're doing, it seems to me that all of them are still on lockdown inside thatschool. 
>> It must be such an awful thing for these parents. Brad, you are a parent, I can only imagine what these moms and dads are going through, with such young children as well. 
>> It's the worst-case scenario for a parent is that unknown situation. If in fact these parents have been able to make any contact with their kids and they really don't know what's going on, i have a pit in my stomach right now and I'm 50 miles away from the scene. So the parents there if they're not getting as much information as they need. The information you need is to see your child find to groob them and give them a hug. What we have been told by lieutenant vance, and I don't know if you're seeing any evidence of this, he told us that the troopers when they arrived onscene around 9:45, immediately entered sandy hook elementary school and started evacuating students and staff and administrators, we have to presume that at this point the students are out of the school. I just don't understand why the students aren't with their parents yet. 
>> Reporter: What I can tell you is that it's kind of a maze of cars and the police have them away from that school right now, it seems that police want to keep people away from there as they secure is scene. Obviously they evacuated those kids for a reason. And the parents are all at this staging area, they're trying to keep it as orderly as possible, rather than having people running around the different neighborhoods here, but they're close, tight streets, not so easy to navigate for the ambulances that are trying to get through here. But again, lots of parents, i see here without children waiting to sort of hear what's going on, see their kids, it sounds like they're trying to keep things as orderly as possible. Keep everybody here and calm, but that's not an easy thing for police so far. 

[00:56:59]


>> An active investigation is under way, what signs of that do you see? 
>> I did see what looks like the s.W.A.T. Team here with some big weapons walking up towards the area of the school, I can also tell you that there's lots of local departments here as well. Getting what they need to refurbish that police department's -- we have a lot of people directing the traffic here as well, trying to make sure that the streets are as orderly as possible, but we want to make sure that we get on with you guys live. When I hang up I can show you some live pictures and we'll do a live report in just a few minutes. 
>> Wvit reporter describing a not surprisingly chaotic scene after there were reports of element industry school in newtown, connecticut, shots fired, but we don't know what happened inside. Some reports off of social media, which we have not been able to confirm yet. She talked about parents without kids, not surprising, that parents would rush to the scene. She also talked about little kids who looked like they were younger than elementary. I can tell you that next door to that preschool called the adventure school, so very young children that she may have seen may not have been indeed from the elementary school, but from the preschool next door, but also s.W.A.T. Teams on the scene, emergency vehicles on the scene. Let's bring in clint vanzant, our fbi profiler. The police who would be called in, what would be the first thing they would do? 
>> It seems like we just did this last week and the reality is we did at the shopping mall in oregon and here we go one more time. In these school shootings, once again, we have learned that children cannot wait, to wait for the s.W.A.T. Team to do a tactical -- the first two or three responding officers, local police, deputy sheriffs, they go ahead and make a tactical entry and their whole job is to penetrate into the building and go to the shooter. If they encounter anyone who has been injured, who's been wounded, they cannot stop, they keep moving until they get to the shooter and they have to neutralize the shooter, then they have to care for the wound. There are unconfirmed reports of potentially one or two individuals that don't belong in that school, may or may not be a shooter. There are also unconfirmed reports of injuries. Right now, as you know, it's a tremendously chaotic situation, parents are arriving, children

Announcer: alex"... ...Their son wanted braces. 
Patricia: Patrick said to his dad, "i want braces." It must be a fad in school. 
Judge Alex: Really? 
Patricia: It really must be. I'm serious. 
Judge Alex: It wasn't a fad when I had braces. I'll tell you that. 
Patricia: So, he chooses to talk to his dad about it. 
Announcer: But not everybody was all smiles about it. 
Patricia: I consider the braces, at this point, as cosmetic, and I don't think it's my financial obligation to have to participate financially in that. Dennis: He had been led to believe that he needed the braces by his mother. 
Judge Alex: Where is the evidence from your dentist saying he has to have braces 'cause he s a certain condition? 
Announcer: Today, judge alex drills until he hits the truth. 
Judge Alex: Unfortunately, I'm very familiar with these pictures because I had one when I did my braces. I'm a not a dentist. I'm not an orthodontist. What am I looking at there that is necessary? Dennis: You got me. 
Judge Alex: Why did the orthodontist say, "he must have braces now"? 
Announcer: As a cop, he stood up for the law. As a trial lawyer, he fought for the truth. And as a criminal court judge, he commanded authority. Now he returns to preside over america's courtroom. 
--Captions by VITAC-- www.vitac.com Dennis wilson is suing is ex-wife patricia wilson for $2,757 because he claims she is legally obligated to pay half of their son's dental expenses and she refuses to do so. Patricia wilson says her ex-husband approved the dental work without her knowledge or agreement to pay for the procedure. Therefore, she says she owes him nothing. 
Mason: All rise! This is court is now in session. The honorable judge alex ferrer presiding. 
Judge Alex: All right, thank you. Please be seated. Mr. Wilson, you are suing your ex-wife, mrs. Wilson, because you say that pursuant to your divorce decree, she is required to pay half of your son's medical and dental expenses and she refuses to reimburse you for your son's braces, correct? Dennis: That is correct, your honor. Judge Alex: All right, miss wilson, you say that he did that on his own, your son didn't need braces -- they weren't necessary. And you told him not to do it, and so he's responsible for the full expense. 

[00:02:24]


-Patricia: Correct. 
-Judge Alex: Okay. All right, how did this all start, folks? 
Dennis: Your honor, I first met the defendant in 1993. We met in a bar. About six months later, we moved in as roommates together. That lasted for about a year. She was not an easy person to get along with. 
Judge Alex: How so? Dennis: Very demanding and expensive. 
[ Laughter ] and in fact, she had me move all my furniture out of the house into the garage, and I mainly lived in the garage. I refurbished the garage. Judge Alex: And you preferred him there? 
Patricia: That sounds wonderful on his part. However, the truth is, he smoked, and he also liked a habit of drinking, and I basically -- well, the smoking was the biggest of it all, and I asked him to go to the garage with his la-z-boy chair and park that in with his tv if that's what he wanted to do to watch the games. 
Dennis: When the opportunity arose, we did split ways. I met a friend, and I moved in with him. And she became part of our threesome. You know, we had -- Judge Alex: Define "threesome." Dennis: Friendship. Judge Alex: Friendship, okay. 'Cause there are several definitions. 
Dennis: In the main. There's probably -- 
Judge Alex: So, you all would hang around together. Dennis: Yeah, we would hang around. Judge Alex: But why were you going back to hang around with miss wilson after you said you were looking for every excuse to get away from her? 
-Dennis: Um... 
-Patricia: Exactly. 
Dennis: ...Well, let me explain it this way. As you well know, males have two brains -- one between their ears -- 
-Judge Alex: I got you. 
-Dennis: One is located -- 
Judge Alex: I know where the other one is located. So... 
[ Laughter ] ...You, um, you would -- I'm assuming that you would alternate between using one brain or the other. 
-Dennis: Yes. 
-Judge Alex: Okay. Tell me about when you got back together. Patricia: We got married. We had a child. Judge Alex: So, you started dating again, or seeing each other again, then you just got married? 

[00:04:29]


Patricia: Oh, we had been seeing each other all along. We had definitely been seeing each other all along. We then got married. He moved in with me. We had patrick, which is william -- we call him patrick, by the way. Judge Alex: That's your son. Patricia: That's our son. Judge Alex: And how old is patrick? Patricia: He just turned 11 in june. Dennis: He just turned 12, your honor. Patricia: Excuse me, sorry. 
-Judge Alex:12. 
-Patricia: Okay. Judge Alex: So, you had a child, and this was before the marriage or during the marriage? Patricia: During the marriage. Dennis: No, we weren't, sir. 
Judge Alex: How long were the two of you married? 
Dennis: She told me she was pregnant in early december. I immediately started paying her health insurance premium, AND WE MARRIED ON DECEMBER 27th, After we knew she was going to have a baby. Three weeks later, I realized the mistake I made. 
Judge Alex: And what did you do three weeks later? Dennis: I filed for a divorce. Judge Alex: So, you got married, and three weeks later, you filed for divorce? 
Dennis: Yes, I wanted my son to have a good name. Judge Alex: Is he a good father to patrick? Patricia: Very generous, your honor. Judge Alex: Is that good or bad? Patricia: Not good, your honor. 
Judge Alex: Why? You think he's overly generous? Patricia: Absolutely. 
Judge Alex: Like, what? 
Patricia: Well, patrick had his first iphone in second grade. Judge Alex: In second grade? At age 7? 
Patricia: At age 7. 
Judge Alex: Mr. Wilson, why did your 7-year-old son need an iphone? 
Dennis: So I could maintain contact with him. Judge Alex: But a top-of-the-line, hippest phone out there for a 7-year-old? God, right now, I hate my dad. I never got a present like that when I was 7. Patricia: Well, he spoils him, your honor, to the point where I look like the bad mother. Unfortunately, dennis had called and said patrick wanted to go to a camp. The camp was $1,000. "Would you participate financially?" And I said, "absolutely not." "Why won't you? Patrick wants to go." And I said, "i have other financial obligations," which I do. Judge Alex: Does he tell patrick "mom doesn't want you to go to camp," or what? Patricia: Well, he says that "your mom's not participating financially," so of course, I'm the, "mom, you're so mean" -- I get that a lot. But to have a cellphone -- and then for graduation, just bought him an ipad for graduation in sixth grade. There's a lot of things I can't compete with financially, but I don't want to. I'm a financial person in my home. I have two boys that I'm raising. I'm a single mom. I have my laws and my rules, and I'm not going to spoil him like he chooses to. 

[00:06:46]


Announcer: Coming up, what will happen when judge alex conducts an exam of his own? 
Judge Alex: What does your divorce decree say about medical and dental expenses? 
Patricia: Well, it clearly states that we are responsible, as each other, for medical and dental if it's agreed upon. 
Judge Alex: The judge doesn't usually leave it only up to agreement. Do you have your marital agreement? 
Announcer: And later, will the plaintiff wish he would have kept his mouth shut? Judge Alex: "Here is a check for $1,700." "I propose to and reassure you "that I will make regular monthly payments every month "until the full cost of treatment is paid, and I will go after her for her half that she owes." ? ??? Announcer: back wilson, who's suing his ex-wife patty wilson for $2,757 -- the remaining balance on their son's braces that he says she refuses to pay. But patty wilson says she's not responsible for paying for the braces, considering she never gave her approval for them to be put on her son in the first place. 

[00:10:01]


Judge Alex: All right, so, here we are in another financial matter. What is this one about? S about paying for the braces. Patrick said to his dad, "i want braces." It must be a fad in school. 
-Judge Alex: Really? 
-Patricia: It real I'm serious. 
Judge Alex: It wasn't a fad when I had braces. I'll tell you that. Patricia: Oh, I had braces, too. It wasn't fad back then either, your honor. So, he chooses to talk to his dad about it. Judge Alex: Did your son come to you and tell you he wanted braces? 
Dennis: No, actually, she got the appointment with the dentist without my knowledge or even consent. 
Judge Alex: Did the dentist say that he needed braces? Dennis: Apparently. Judge Alex: What -- "apparently"? Patricia: No, excuse me. 
Judge Alex: Do you guys have dental paperwork 
-from the dentist? 
-Dennis: Yes. Judge Alex: Let me see what you have. 
-Do you have some, as well? 
-Patricia: No. As far as I go, I take him to all his dentist appointments. Never once did a professional dentist say, "your son patrick needs braces." 
Judge Alex: Do you have any paperwork from the dentist? Patricia: Yes, I do, your honor. 
Judge Alex: Let me see yours. Let me see yours. 
Patricia: Okay. Dennis: And she chose the dentist. 
Patricia: He asked me to take him to get an estimate, which I did. If you call the dentist up now, which I just spoke to not too long ago, and I said to her, "do I he any financial obligations to this bill or to these braces?" And she said, "no." 
Judge Alex: What does your divorce decree say about medical and dental expenses? 
Patricia: Well, it clearly states that we are responsible, as each other, for medical and dental if it's agreed upon, and, your honor, I did notgree to the financial end of it. 
Judge Alex: Well, the judge doesn't usually leave it only up to agreement. Do you have your marital agreement? Patricia: Yes, we do have it here. 
Dennis: It's in an order and stipulation. Patricia: I have it here. It's in small print right above the 1,500. 
Judge Alex: Okay. And see what mr. Wilson has, as well. The interesting thing is both of you gave me the same document from the dentist. Just as an aside, okay? You make more money, I take it, than your ex does? 
Both: Yes. 
Judge Alex: You're always going to be able to buy your son more than she will. And if you put him in a situation where dad is always the one who brings him all the good things and mom is not, that may work to your favor right now, but sooner or later, that boy's gonna grow up and he's gonna rze why mom wasn't able to do that, and you're not gonna be looking so hot. Dennis: All right, I think differently. 

[00:12:10]


[ Applause ] Patricia: Thank you, your honor. Thank you. 
[ Applause continues ] 
Judge Alex: Now, I'm looking at your divorce decree, which I have in front of me here, which says "elective medical or dental procedures, as well as psychological counseling" -- covering anything that he might need in the future -- "for the child shall not be entered into without the knledge and cooperation of the other party," okay? So, in order for you to just go forward on your own and get your child braces, which is a considerable expense, and then turn around to your wife who you know -- ex-wife -- who you know does not have the abilit to just whip out that money like you can, in order for you to do that, then you have to show that it is necessary, not just "it'd be nice to get it done at this time." Because, like she said, she has other expenses. Did the orthodontist say, "he needs braces now"? "He needs them." 
Dennis: The next thing I saw was that order from the dentist. I also have a couple of other letters that I wrote to the dentist, okay. Patricia: I don't think he needs them. Judge Alex: Hold on one second. What? What is that? Oh, I know what that is. I've seen ose before. Let me get that. 
Patricia: Okay, I consider the braces, at this point, as cosmetic, and I don't -- if my son said to his dad, "i wanant a new nose," I'm sure he'd go out and get him a new nose. But I don't think it's my financial obligation to have to participate financially in that. 
Judge Alex: That was the point I was making about "necessary," not just elective or whatever. Let me put this up here, and let's cut off the eyes 'cause I don't want your son's face on here. Okay. Unfortunately, I'm very familiar with these pictures, because I had one when I did my braces, and they pull your mouth apart so they can see all the teeth. Okay, I'm not a dentist. I'm not an orthodontist. It's not my expertise. What am I looking at there that is necessary? Dennis: You got me. Judge Alex: Why did the orthodontist say, "he must have braces now"? 
Dennis: I never thought he needed braces. 
Judge Alex: But you didn't think that it was necessary. Why didn't you say, "well, then, let's not do the braces"? 'Cause you apparently went forward and paid for the braces and insisted that the doctor go forward with the braces. 

[00:14:16]


Announcer: Coming up next, will judge alex feel patty's pain? 
Patricia: When patrick asked me for braces, I said, "look at this kitchen. I can't even cook dinner. This kitchen is demo'd." This is my priority over him having braces. 
Judge Alex: It's time for america to vote on today's case. Who do you think I'm going to rule for -- the plaintiff... 
Dennis: She was not an easy person to get along with. Judge Alex: ...Or the defendant? 
Patricia: If my son said to his dad want a new nose," I'm sure he would go out and get him a new nose.

[00:18:11]


Announcer: "Judge alex" returns with the case of dennis wilson, who's suing his ex-wife patty wilson for $2,757 -- the amount of money he says she owes on their son's dental procedure. But patty says she doesn't owe her husband a dime for her son's braces, considering she never approved the dental procedure. 
Judge Alex: Let me see the letter you sent to the dentist, sir, 'cause you said this in your complaint, so I want to see it. 
Dennis: Okay, this is the first letter I sent, and th I wrote one a couple days later to the dentist authorizing treatment. 
Judge Alex: Give all the letters to mason, please. Mason, bring those up, please. Thank you. Okay, so you sent the letter TO THE DENTIST ON APRIL 23rd. In your complaint, you said this. You sent your doctor a letter, and you basically said, "my insurance is covering $1,000. "The balance is $4,290. "According to the stipulation and order," you quoted the language about uncovered medical and dental expenses is supposed to be split 50/50. And, sou say in there, "i phoned your office, dentist, and I told your assistant, 'do not do the braces until we can resolve this issue,'" correct? Dennis: Yes, and I wrote a letter. 
Judge Alex: That, to me, sounds like the most intelligent move right there. "She's not gonna pay for them. Don't do it." Then you send this letter two days later, and in this letter, you say, "two days ago, I sent you a letter "basically telling you, 'don't do the braces.' here is a check for $1,700 as a deposit and basically, it says, "i propo to and reassure you "that I will make regular monthly payments every month "until the full cost of treatment is paid. And I will go after her for her half that she owes." Dennis: That's right. 
Judge Alex: Okay. You told me a second ago you didn't want the braces. What changed in those two days, other than maybe your son coming to you and saying, "dad, I really want braces"? 
Dennis: Exactly. He had been led to believe that he needed the braces. Judge Alex: How old is he? Dennis: His mother took him to -- Judge Alex: How old is he? Patricia: He just turned 12 in june. 

[00:20:12]


Dennis: He's 12. 
Judge Alex: Okay, you have a 12-year-old telling you, "dad, I need braces"? Where is the evidence from your dentist saying he has to have braces because he has a certain condition? 
Dennis: His mother told me he had to have braces. She set it up. Judge Alex: Okay, hold on one second, 'cause now you're telling me she's gonna be your witness for this, and I seriously doubt that. So, ma'am, are you of the opinion that your son needed braces? 
Patricia: I said, "patrick, I have other" -- we have a kitchen that we need to do. I have a picture of my kitchen, and if you saw it, you'd understand where I'm coming from. 
Judge Alex: Did you send in a picture of your kitchen? 
Patricia: I did. When patrick asked me for braces, I said, "look at this kitchen. "I can't even cook dinner. "I have no cabinets, no appliances. "I have no counters. This kitchen is demo'd." I did buy a fixer-upper, your honor, but I got a really good deal on it. However, this is my priority over him having braces because I felt at that time he didn't need the braces at this time. And I honestly explained to him "not at this time." Dennis gives into patrick more than I'll ever... It's amazing what he does for patrick. He truly loves him, but I think he goes overboard. Announcer: Coming up, will judge alex hit a nerve when he asks the plaintiff for proof? Judge Alex: So, then I look at the document both of you gave me, and it says, "what is the problem?" And there are like 20 check marks that you can check off. Guess what? None of them are checked off. What evidence do you have that these braces were necessary? 
Judge Alex: It's time for america to vote on today's case. Who do you think I'm going to rule for -- the plaintiff... 
Dennis: She was not an easy person to get along with. Judge Alex: ...Or the defendant? 
Patricia: If my son said to his dad, "i want a new nose," I'm sure he would go out and get him a new nose.

We'll see you there. Announcer: back wilson, who's suing his ex-wife patty wilson for $2,757 -- the amount of money he says she owes on their son's dental procedure. But patty wilson says she never approved their son getting braces, and therefore, sheoesn't owe her ex-husband any money. 

[00:25:15]


Judge Alex: You brought me a picture of your son's teeth. I look at it. I'm not an orthodontist. The teeth actually look a lot better than mine ever did when I needed braces. But I don't know if there's a reason there. So, then I look at the document both of you gave me, and it says, "what is the problem?" And there are like 20 check marks that you can check. Deep overbite, protrusion, upper molars, lower molars, crowding, missing teeth -- all these reasons you could check off. Guess what? None of them are checked off. There's even one that says "other" where you can fill in an option. That's not checked off. 
[ Applause ] I think that what you are is you're a father -- I think that what you are is a father who really loves his son but has the financial wherewithal that his mother doesn't have to provide him with things that maybe your son shouldn't have, but you want to make sure he's happy. And I'm telling you right now that can lead him down a bad path, as well. So, we're here. It's your burden to prove the braces were necessary so that I can force mom to forego fixing that somewhat demolished kitchen and give the money instead to you to reimburse you for the braces that you put in his mouth, effectively. So, what evidence do you have that these braces were necessary? Dennis: You have what I gave you. Judge Alex: I see that. Okay. All right, folks, well, with that information, there's no proof here that these braces were necessary. That being the case, I can't force her to forego the limited money she has to basically pay half of the braces that perhaps your son did not need at this time. So, on that, it's gonna be a judgment for defendant. Thank you. 
Mason: All rise! 
Announcer: Judge alex has ruled in favor of the defendant and has awarded the plaintiff nothing. 
Patricia: I think the judge's ruling was very fair. I believe that braces were considered cosmetic in this situation and that he more or less wanted him to have them. So, therefore, the judge basically saw what was important. 

[00:27:16]


Dennis: I'm disappointed in the judge's ruling. The defendant initiated this action, got my son all excited about getting the braces. And then when I said she had to pay her half, she refused.

>> Jeanne: A woman gets stuck with a bail bill because of a family's tough love. Cashier casey gray is suing her step-nephew for bail, rent, and a loan. Defendant eric howson says he never signed a contract. Now it's "joe" time. 
>> Judge Brown: Ms. Gray, you're suing -- let's see... I guess this is your step-cousin, mr. Howson. 
>> I'm his step-aunt. 
>> Judge Brown: Step... 
>> ...Aunt. 
>> Judge Brown: ...Nephew. 
>> Yes, sir. My aunt by marriage. 
>> His grandma married my dad. 
>> Judge Brown: Your father is married to his grandmother? 
>> Yep. 
>> Judge Brown: And you're 21, he's 21, and your witness, your boyfriend, is 21. 
>> He's 20. 
>> Judge Brown: Who, him? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown:20. He's 20. All right, now, ms. Gray, let's see. If I read your complaint correctly, you and your witness were living together when you let your step-nephew move in in january of this year. Is that right? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: Why? 
>> Nobody else would, like, take him in. I would rather take him in than him be homeless, so... And so I did that. A few weeks later, a cop came to the door, arrested him for tearing down some light poles in clarksville. 

[00:02:00]


>> Judge Brown: Vandalism. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Where were the poles located -- on the streets? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Okay. 
>> And he was in jail for about a month. I bailed him out for $505. 
>> Judge Brown: The $5 was administrative costs, so what was the bond? 5,000? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: All right. 
>> After I bonded him out, we let him stay back with us in order -- he had to get a job, help out with rent. 
>> Judge Brown: Now is it correct that he was supposed to pay you two $200 a month rent? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: And you loaned him, according to your complaint, $200. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: So you're asking for rent never paid during the time he stayed with the two of you, and the reimbursement for the $200 loan and for the $505 you put up so he could get bailed out of jail. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: All right. Now, when did he leave? 
>> Uh, I really do not remember when he got arrested. But I do know we asked him to leave at the end of march. 
>> Judge Brown: All right. So he came back, and then you had asked him, "please leave. You're not doing anything here. You're not contributing." 
>> Yeah. 
>> Judge Brown: Okay. 
>> When he had left, he also took a bob marley blanket we have, some movies, some clothes, and put scissors into the wall. 
>> Judge Brown: Little malicious mischief/vandalism. Seems he kind of likes vandalistic-type activity from the looks of things. Well, what happened with the hole in the wall? What do you think's gonna happen when you come to move out? 
>> We've already moved out. They didn't say anything about it. 
>> Judge Brown: How long ago did you move out? 
>> UH, APRIL 20th. 
>> Judge Brown: So, you have gotten your security deposit back? 

[00:04:06]


>> We moved into a different place that has the same people. 
>> Judge Brown: Okay. Let's see. You're divorced and have two children, right? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Okay. Let's go to you. Now, you give me your defense. 
>> Well, we never actually had any written agreement on when i was supposed to pay anything back. I do understand that I do owe her the money, but we never had anything written saying that i had to pay it back by a certain date or anything. 
>> Judge Brown: What about the rent? 
>> The rent -- I mean, we've discussed it, but it was just like an average conversation. 
>> Judge Brown: No, but you moved in. You stayed there. You weren't on the lease. Your step-aunt and her boyfriend were on the lease, so that's the two of them. They have to cover for you. Why should he have to pay for you? He doesn't know you. 
>> It ain't like I had a room in the house. I was just on the floor. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, where else would you have been? 
>> I don't know. 
>> Judge Brown: Pushing a borrowed grocery cart with green lawn bags? 
[ Laughter ] finding heat vents? Now, what is it that you're saying? Why should you have to pay back the bond, because you're innocent? Well, the constitution presumes that you're innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt anyway, and that presumption of innocence stands as a witness for you. So, you say the police framed you because you had destroyed light poles in the past? 
>> N one of them actually was my friend at the time. He was the one that they caught him actually breaking it down, and he tried to say that I was with him, and I wasn't nowhere near the scene at all. 
>> Judge Brown: What's happened with the case? 
>> It's been dropped. 
>> Judge Brown: Good. But, now, you spent a month in lockup? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Would you like to have spent longer? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, aren't you feeling a little bit of gratitude for the money put up for your bond? 
>> I told her, whenever I got the mone but, at the time, I wasn't working. 

[00:06:10]


>> Judge Brown: Aren't you claiming now to be a brick-layer? 
>> Huh? 
>> Judge Brown: A mason? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: So, why is it she has to be here for arbitration to get repaid for the bond premium? 
>> Because it's what she chose to do. This has been less than three months ago. 
>> Jeanne: We'll be right back with "judge joe brown." 
>> Did not contribute, try to find a job, help out. We gave him food. I gave him clothes. 
>> But didn't you just said that all that's being reported that i supposedly took out of the house? 
>> Jeanne: And later today... 
>> I don't understand why I'm here. That was back in 2000 and what -- 11, she said? I didn't hear from her. She was hard to contact. If it was that serious -- and i did. I pawned it. 
>> Announcer: It's "joe" time AFTER THIS.?Yo?? You know how painful heartburn can be. For fast, long lasting relief, use doctor recommended Gaviscon????.

[00:09:33]


>> Jeanne: We're back with "judge joe brown." The plaintiff in this case says she took her step-nephew in when no one else would. She said she bailed him out of jail and gave him a home and got nothing for it. Let's see what the judge thinks. 
>> Judge Brown: You say you were thrown out because you didn't like her current boyfriend, and the plaintiff, or your step-aunt, chose to stick up for a random guy rather than family. What's that all about? 
>> That was just what I assumed is the reasoning behind her kicking me out was. 
>> Judge Brown: You assumed. Stand up, young man. Mr. Lamar -- is that it? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: You're employed, sir? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: You have no children? 
>> No, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: You and the plaintiff, ms. Gray, are living together? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: All right. Did you like paying rent on behalf of mr. Howson? 
>> I rather him have a place to stay than be out on the streets. 
>> Judge Brown: He seems to think that it was a matter of a choice between you or him. 
>> It wasn't like that at all. 
>> No, it wasn't. It was more because he didn't contribute, try to find a job, help out. We gave him food. I gave him clothes. 
>> Judge Brown: What about that? 
>> But didn't you just said that all that's being reported that i supposedly took out of the house, and he just now says that he gave it to me. 
>> I gave someclothes to him. 
>> Judge Brown: He gives me a listing. Some of it's stuff that you didn't have given to you. And why, since she's trying to get her way made in the world, does she have to sacrifice her future to let you lay up in her place and his place? You know who john f. Kennedy was, or... All right. He had a line. And to paraphrase it in your circumstances, I guess it would go like, oh... "Ask not what your family can do for you but what you can do for your family." By the way, you were entitled to an extra month of rent. See, you have an active lease. It's a periodic month-to-month tenancy, in your case. When you move in and -- she wants the last month, but you were there for the first month, in january, so you owe for that month, too. So your total recovery's gonna be $1,105 and your costs. 

[00:12:00]


>> Thank you. 
[ Gavel bangs ] 
>> Judge Brown: She didn't get to pick you, but she picked him. 
>> Miss Sonia: This courtroom is now in recess. 
>> Jeanne: The defendant had nowhere to go -- well, except jail, but the plaintiff bailed him out of that, too. No one's coming to his rescue now. Plaintiff wins, and we're on to the next case. 
>> Miss Sonia: Please raise your right hand. 
>> Jeanne: Waitress christie McFall is suing her former friend for the value of a laptop. Defendant maurice adams says he couldn't get in contact with the plaintiff. 
>> Judge Brown: You say mr. Adams owes you the purchase price of a used laptop that you supposedly sold to him. Is that right? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Seems this thing's been pawned in the interim. Is that right? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: All right. Now, let's see. Ma'am, you say that you have known the defendant for 17 years. He was a family friend. Is that correct? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, you allege in your complaint, do you not, that someone gave you -- a friend gave you a laptop. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Judge Brown: So you allege, do you not, that you already had one you used for work, so, having no need for an extra laptop, you decided to sell the item to the defendant. Is that right? 
>> Yes. I had a used computer at home, so I didn't need it. Nobody in my family needed it, so I thought, "well, who can i get in touch with that could probably use a laptop?" So I contacted maurice and said, "i have a laptop. It's black. It's nice." 
>> Judge Brown: You contacted him. 
>> Yes. I called him by telephone. 
>> Judge Brown: What kind of relationship did you have -- just friends or what? 
>> Family. 
>> Judge Brown: Family friend. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Judge Brown: Okay. 700. When did you reach this agreement with him? 
>> This was in november 2011. 
>> Judge Brown: All right. Mr. Adams, you give me your side of things. 
>> Well, judge, this is the thing -- well, first of all, i want to say hi, judge. I'm from tennessee. You're from memphis. 

[00:14:02]


>> Judge Brown: Nashville, yes. 
>> Yes, yes. Nashville. Anyway, I just wanted to say that I don't understand why I'm here. That was back in 2000 and what -- 11, she said? I didn't hear from her. She was hard to contact. So I don't understand why, all of a sudden, she wants to sue me now, and this was back in 2011. If it was that serious -- and i did. I pawned it, because I needed it for a bill. And the laptop wasn't black. It was gold. 
>> Judge Brown: [ Chuckles ] 
>> and she was even late getting here. That's no respect to you. I was on time, so... 
>> Judge Brown: We did have to set the case back because of her transportation problems. 
>> Communication's a beautiful thing, judge. 
>> Jeanne: We'll be back with more "judge joe brown" in a moment. 
>> We dated for a little bit. That's why I don't understand why she was like "friend of the family." 
>> He tried to talk to me a couple times on the telephone. I said no. We never went out. He kept trying. He kept trying. He kept trying. I said no.

[00:16:56]


>> Jeanne: We're back with "judge joe brown." The defendant in this case says a friend gave him a laptop. He says he pawned it to pay a bill. Let's see what the judge thinks. 
>> Judge Brown: You allege she changed her phone number, and you had no contact with her. 
>> Yes, sir. That is correct. 
>> Judge Brown: Let's see. Now, we get this thing that we don't get right now. We get the word "breakup." 
>> We -- 
>> Judge Brown: ...And "involvement." What's this all about? 
>> We dated for a little bit. That's why I don't understand why she was like "friend of the family." We dated for a little bit. 
>> No, we never dated. 
>> Oh, okay. 
>> He tried to talk to me a couple times on the telephone. I said no. We never went out. He kept trying. He kept trying. He kept trying. I said no. Mnh-mnh. No. I didn't look at him that way. I looked at him as a friend of the family, not someone to go out with. 
>> Judge? 
>> And it was a black laptop. It was not silver. 
>> Judge Brown: It's gold, he said. 
>> See what I'm saying? 
>> It was not. No. 
>> Why am I here, judge? Look at me. 
>> Judge Brown: 'Cause she's aggrieved. Now, let's get around to this. It's been raised that you provided for her and her children. 
>> I did help. Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: We have a 4-year-old, 5-year-old, 8-year-old, 9-year-old, 12-year-old, and a 14-year-old. That's six of them. You have none, and you are employed. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: You work in housekeeping at a hotel, ma'am, and you are a part-time waitress. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Brown: Okay. Did he help you out with your kids? 
>> When we were at my grandmother's in dickson, tennessee, he done, like, a little. But as far as ongoing, he didn't do anything. 
>> Judge Brown: What do you mean? 
>> I don't even think he even knew their names. 
>> Judge Brown: There's six of them. 
>> They not my kids. 
>> Judge Brown: They aren't his kids. That's the point. 
>> Yeah, but as far as doing -- 
>> Judge Brown: He doesn't have any. He doesn't even understand. 

[00:18:58]


>> He didn't give money, so i don't know where this is coming from. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, what did he do when you were visiting relatives? 
>> When we visited relatives, we would all eat, get around the table. Maybe he fixed a plate for them. Maybe that's what he's talking about. But as far as anything else -- 
>> Judge Brown: Is that all you did? 
>> No. 
>> He didn't do anything. He didn't provide any transportation, any of t 
>> Judge Brown: Didn't provide transportation. Why did you mention transportation? 
>> I'm not the baby daddy. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, what did you do? 
>> I helped -- paying for diapers, picking her up. 
>> None of them are in diapers. 
>> Judge Brown: You say you picked her up? 
>> Yeah, when she didn't have a vehicle. 
>> Judge Brown: How often? 
>> One time. He picked me up from work. 
>> Judge Brown: One time? 
>> One time. He picked me up from work, and this is when the laptop came into the picture. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, you say you ask him, "do you want a laptop?" Who gave it to you? 
>> A friend of mine. 
>> Judge Brown: Male or female? 
>> Female. 
>> Judge Brown: Okay, so, somebody gave you the laptop, and you promptly turn around and tried to sell it to him. Why'd the person give you the laptop? 
>> Because I was in the business with her. 
>> Judge Brown: So why'd she give you the laptop that you don't even use, you just immediately sell? 
>> I had the laptop for a while before I decided I wanted to go ahead and sell it. 
>> Judge Brown: The 14-year-old couldn't use it in school? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Brown: So you just up and gave it away, sold it. 
>> My mom has a computer. They go to my mom's. I mean, they have their things, and I have a used computer at home. 
>> Judge Brown: So did you tell your buddy at work, "oh, by the way, that computer you gave me, I sold it for $700 before I got home." Did you tell her? 
>> Well, actually, my supervisor at work wanted to buy it, but she asked me after I had already sold it to him. 
>> Judge Brown: Okay, so, one of your fellow workers said, "here, you can have this," and then you cut the deal. The supervisor wants to buy it, and then you offer it to him when he picks you up from work that day. Well, now, does that sound like just one time? This only time you got a ride from him was the day you just happen to decided to offer it to him for sale? 

[00:21:10]


>> I spoke with him before that. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, how could you? That's the day you just got it. 
>> He gave me a ride that night from work. I had talked to him previously about a laptop that I had. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, how many times did he give you a ride? 
>> He only gave me a -- 
>> Judge Brown: One ride, just that one time. He's coming, and you just get the computer. You don't even get it home. "Would you like to buy a computer?" Well, why didn't you tell your friend, "look, girlfriend, i know you're giving me this. But the supervisor wants to buy it for some $700. So, this is your stuff. Why don't you just sell it to her? You can use the money." 
>> She had asked me after the fact, after I had already sold it. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, if you knew you didn't need it, didn't want it, and wanted to get rid of it as soon as you had -- couldn't you just tell your friend, "look, I don't need that." 
>> I could've told her that. 
>> Judge Brown: And why were you late? 
>> Why were -- 
>> Judge Brown: Why were you late? 
>> Oh, I had missed the flight. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, how did you miss the flight? 
>> Someone else was taking me, and they waited till the last minute to tell me, "hey, I'm not gonna be able to do this. I got an emergency." So I had to take the next one. 
>> Jeanne: Judge joe brown makes his ruling after this. 
>> Judge Brown: [ Echoing ] judge joe brown.

>> Judge BrownALL OF THESE Holes, this one dog did? 
>> Yeah, he dug holes all around. 
>> I told her to immediately remove the dog. Two days after that, I was again notified that she had the dog back at the premises. 
>> Announcer: Next "joe." All rise for judge joe brown. 
>> Judge Brown: Whoa! 
>> Announcer: Experience... Knowledge... And a passion for the truth... 
>> Judge Brown: ...Protecting womanhood and promoting maood. 
>> Announcer: ...Bringing no-nonsense justice to americans everywhere. 
>> Judge Brown: If you listen, you might learn something. 
>> Announcer: It's time for judge joe. 
>> Jeanne: Piles of pet feces puts an appraisal in peril. realtor DeAndra hayes is suing her former tenant for rent and cleaning fees. Defendant tiffany sumlin says her deposit covered any damage. Now it's "joe" time. 
>> Judge Brown: Let's see. Miss hayes, you are suing a former tenant, miss sumlin. 
>> Yes, sir, I am. 
>> Judge Brown: You say that's the result of an early breaking of the lease that was in effect and for the possession and keeping of unauthorized pets on the premises, causing excessive damage above and beyond wear and tear -- ordinary wear and tear. And the defense basically, miss sumlin, is to the effect that the plaintiff kept the security deposit and that ought to suffice, and you were led to believe you might have pets on the premises. So, let's see where we go with this. Miss hayes, you first, please, ma'am. 
>> Your honor, I had a property for lease at the end of 2011. The defendant located my property through her realtor. We agreed to a 13-month lease COMMENCING ON DECEMBER 18th. ON JANUARY 17th, I WAS CONTACTED By the insurance agent, and they were unable to take pictures -- I was changing the policy to a rental dwelling -- they were unable to take pictures because -- 
>> Judge Brown: That's when you discovered the problem. 
>> Correct. Well, that it mightbe a problem, correct. So, I immediately contacted -- 

[00:02:02]


>> Judge Brown: We wouldn't be here if it wasn't a problem. 
>> Well, they were a little afraid to enter the rear of the property because they saw the feces from the dog. 
>> Judge Brown: Yeah. They didn't want to step on anything and smear it in, they told you, apparently. But, anyway, go right ahead. Fascinating story. 
>> So I immediately contacted the defendant and asked, you know, was there a dog on the property and she's like, "no. Absolutely not. We don't have a dog." I was like, "well, possibly they went to wrong house." So I had someone check on the property at that time. About five days later, I was notified that she indeed had a dog on the property, so i contacted her again, and she said, "well, sometimes my boyfriend has his dog over there," and that her realtor had told her that, you know, she had written authorization she could have a pet. And I told her that we didn't have written authorization -- just five days pri, she stated that she didn't have a dog -- and that she needed to immediately remove the dog from the premises. And then I assessed her a fine. She didn't pay that fine, and THEN, ON FEBRUARY 22nd, I Received a text message from her asking to come to a written agreement on the pets, because her mom had a pet and her sister had a pet and her kids missed her dog's pet. I told her that we couldn't come to a written agreement. There were several dogs coming at several times. She could easily dispute that. And when I was notified that she had the pet, she was being negligent. They were leaving the fence open while they were taking the trash out, the dog was just roaming, so I refused to come to an agreement as far as the pet was concerned. ON THE 28th, I RECEIVED A Handwritten letter saying that she intended to vacate the property at some point, but at THE LATEST, BY MARCH 31st. At that point, I notified her that I received her letter of intent to default on the lease. She made another payment on -- a PARTIAL PAYMENT -- ON MARCH 3rd. Sent her another letter saying that she hadn't paid any of the fees. 
>> Judge Brown: And I believe that was supposed to -- or, well, it seems that that was accepted with reservation, that part-payment? Or did you even process it? 

[00:04:05]


>> I processed that part of the payment, correct. 
>> Judge Brown: That's one with reservation. Go right ahead, please. 
>> AND THEN ON MARCH 17th, I Went down to inspect the property and put some signs in the yard to get it back on the market and noticed some of the yard damage, some of the interior damage. ON MARCH 30th, I TRIED TO REACH The tenant to make sure she was vacating the property on the 31st -- PHONE NUMBER HAD BEEN Changed, couldn't reach her, didn't hear from her any further from that point. She didn't turn in any keys, didn't give any garage access, so that was the last contact i had with tiffany. Once we went down there, around APRIL 3rd, TO SEE IF SHE HAD Actually left the property, we noticed all the damage she had left -- abandoned property, mattresses, chairs, and tables, the disposal wasn't working. She had even gone and installed a satellite -- putting holes through the rooms and through the roof -- and the yard was not kept, the dog had dug up holes and destroyed the fence. 
>> Judge Brown: I believe there's a provision -- well, not "believe," but it appears there's a provision in the lease about the tenant being responsible for the upkeep of the yard and such other things. 
>> Correct. Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: Keep going, please, ma'am. 
>> And the other damage was just -- the property just wasn't kept. The wall was filthy, the carpet was filthy, she left dishes, she left fruit and vegetables in the drawers, so... Here we are. 
>> Judge Brown: Now... You just kind of got left out of this. She did a good job, but, you know, when your wife's doing all right, let them go. It makes them feel better later on. Okay. More power to you, but you can stand up next to her. "Mr. And mrs." Situation -- i try to promote that. Ma'am, what do you have to say about this, relative to your defense? 
>> Okay. I did move in, in december. I moved in on the assumption that I could have a dog, but i didn't have a dog, per se, as i moved in. My dog -- he just passed away. 

[00:06:07]


>> Judge Brown: You imply, it would appear, that the dogs that were offensive were not your dogs, but those of boyfriend and/or relatives. How does that give you a defense? 
>> It was only one dog that came. My family never came down. 
>> Judge Brown: That's your boyfriend's dog? 
>> Yes. So, when he came over -- he brought it over a total of three times. He came over for christmas... 
>> Judge Brown: All of these holes I'm looking at in the ground, this one dog did? 
>> She did that the very first time. Yeah, the very first day over there. 
>> Judge Brown: [ Groaning ] 
>> yeah, she did. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> Judge Brown: [ Groaning ] 
>> looked like he lived there, to me. 
>> So, yeah, she dug holes all around the front patio, is where she put the holes at, the first day she was there. 
>> Jeanne: We'll be right back with "judge joe brown." 
>> I was like, "there's no one at my house," and she was like, "well, they're saying the dog is there." I'm like, "no. There's no dog there. I'm on my way to the house. There's nobody there. My kids is with me." And she goes, "well, I have to assume that the dog is there. If they're telling me the dog is there, it's there." 
>> Jeanne: And later today... 
>> My income tax came in. I still had the truck. My income tax came in. We agreed to pay him $1,000 down, and then after that, we'd give him $1,000 in two weeks, and then $500 every two weeks after that. 
>> Announcer: It's "joe" time after this. You know how painful heartburn can be. For fast, long lasting relief, use doctor recommended Gaviscon????. Only Gaviscon???? forms a protective barrier that helps block stomach acid from splashing up- relieving the pain quickly. Try fast, long lasting Gaviscon????. Hershey's makes smiles. Smiles make more smiles. When the chocolate is hershey's. Life is delicious. 

[00:09:33]


>> Jeanne: We're back with "judge joe brown." The plaintiff in this case says she discovered her tenant was housing an unauthorized dog on her property. She says she fined the defendant, told her the dog had to go, and then the defendant broke the lease. Let's see what the judge has to say. 
>> Judge Brown: Now... 
>> Okay, so, I had received a call, like she said, in january, asking me, "was the dog there?" And I told her -- no, she asked me if I had a dog. I said, "no, my boyfriend does." And she goes, "well, we don't have a written agreement, so you have to have the dog off the premises." I said, "fine. No problem." She said she was gonna charge me a $150 pet violation. I said, "that's fine." So, turned around, in february, I got another call, and i actually wasn't even at home when she called me. She was like, "my family's there again. They say the dog's on the property." I'm like, "no one's there. I'm in the car and that's when my cousin was with me. I was like, "we're coming from taco bell. There's no one at my house." And she wau like, "well, they're saying the dog is there." I'm like, "no. There's no dog there. I'm on my way to the house. There's nobody there. My kids is with me." And she goes, "well, I have to assume that the dog is there. If they're telling me the dog is there, it's there." So, by the I made it home, and I'm still talking to her on the phone, and I'm like, "no. I'm here now. There's no dog here." And she goes, "i have to charge you another pet violation." And then she said, "and then I'm gonna have to backdate it, charge you a daily fee back from january when I told you the first time that the dog couldn't be there." And I was like, "well, if I'm telling you I just got here and there's no dog on my property, how are you gonna charge me for something that I'm telling you the dog is not here?" I said, "my boyfriend hasn't been here. I've been at work all day. There's no dog here." And she goes, "well, that's what they're telling me, so i have to go by what they're saying." And I was like, "that's fine." 
>> Judge Brown: [ Coughing ] excuse me. By the way, did you check with boyfriend to determine whether or not he had been bringing the pooch back to have her constitutional? 
>> No, he didn't even have a key to my house, so... 
>> Judge Brown: Well, you don't need a key. You just kind of get in the backyard. Is there a lock or latch to the fence? 
>> He lives 45 minutes away. I can't see him coming over to let the dog in the backyard when he's 45 minutes away. 
>> Judge Brown: Be surprised. 
>> So, um... And I think I mentioned that, too. I was like, "i don't think he's gonna come all the way over here just to bring the dog in the backyard." So, I hang up the phone or whatever, and a couple of weeks later, I got a letter in the mail telling me that I owe two pet fines and then the daily rate that she charged me. AND SHE'S LIKE, "BY MARCH 1st." And I was like, "i'm not paying this." That's when I think I texted then with like, we can't come to a written agreement 'cause i personally don't have a dog, but for them to bring their dogs when they come by, I said, "that's the reason I rented your property -- so I can have dogs. I plan on buying my kids one. My boyfriend, when he stays the weekend, he brings his dog. When my cousin comes down, she don't leave her dog anywhere. She brings her dog." And she was like, "no, I can't have these dogs in and out. This can't work." 

[00:12:14]


>> Judge Brown: Can't have a dog doggin' the place out. 
>> Yeah. [ Laughs ] she was like, "i can't have the dogs coming in and out." And I was like, "i have to stay here a whole year. My family comes down quite a bit." So she told me, you know, i can't do it. And though she said, "i would have let you have a dog if it was 10 pounds or less." She said, "but your dog is way over 10 pounds. I don't know what breed it is." Would appear. 
>> Yeah. She goes, "but it's way over 10 pounds, so, no, I'm just not gonna allow any dogs on the property." And I was like, "okay, that's fine." She's like, "and if you have a dog again, then I'm gonna have to go to the steps of evicting you." She said, "i don't want to take those procedures, but if I have to, then that's what I'm gonna do." I was like, "just, fine. I'll just move, 'cause I'm not gonna go a whole year without getting my kids another dog, or he can't bring his dog, and my family can't bring their dog. I guess I have to move." 
>> Judge Brown: I'm looking at the pictures and you are definitelynot in compliance. Anyway, I'm gonna knock out this thing about the late fees and pet violations, 'cause she moved out. So your total recovery... Inclusive of the security deposit -- well, not inclusive, but that's already been accredited... 
>> Correct. 
>> Judge Brown: ...Will be $4,093.19 and your costs. Everybody do better. 
[ Gavel bangs ] 
>> thank you, judge. 
>> Miss Sonia: This courtroom is now in recess. 
>> Jeanne: No doubting the dog dug those holes in the yard, but not as many as the defendant dug when she used and abused the rules and the property. She needs to pay. And we're on to the next case. 
>> Miss Sonia: Please raise your right hand. 
>> Jeanne: Medical assistant melissa burleson is suing a former friend for a down payment and transportation costs. Defendant timmothy sooter is countersuing for repairs made to the vehicle. 
>> Judge Brown: Let's see. Miss burlenson -- or burleson. 
>> Burleson. 
>> Judge Brown: You're suing a former family friend, mr. Sooter... 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: ...Who is counterclaiming against you and your husband, and what the allegation is, is you were attempting to buy a truck from him but he couldn't deliver a title. 

[00:14:17]


>> Correct. 
>> Judge Brown: So you want your money back... 
>> Correct. 
>> Judge Brown: ...Or such as you have tendered to him. Uh, mr. Sooter, your defense is, is that they only made one payment, and the reason they haven't gotten anything is because they didn't pay it off. And you also say for some -- well, I'm not quite sure what this is about, but there seems to be some allegation that one of their minor sons had something to do with some alleged damage to the motor vehicle. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Judge Brown: Something like that? Okay, now, miss burleson, would you please tell me what this is all about from your perspective? 
>> Okay. Um, at the end of january, my -- well, to start off my sent-- my husband and tim were friends. They used to work together. At the time, right after tim was laid off, my husband got an offer to work in colorado. 
>> Judge Brown: Nice state. 
>> Yes. We only had one car at the time, and in talking -- my husband talked to don -- I'm sorry -- talked to tim, and asked him if we could borrow his truck until we could get my income tax to come in, and then we were gonna buy another truck with the down payment from our income tax. In the process of all this, he agreed to let us borrow the truck until mid-february, until I got my income tax in. My income tax came in. I still had the truck. My income tax came in. We agreed to pay him $1,000 down, and then after that, we'd give him $1,000 in two weeks, and then $500 every two weeks after that, but the deal was that if we give him the first $1,000, he had to go get the title loan off, which we knew about at the time. 
>> Judge Brown: There was a title loan. 
>> There was a title loan through a title-loan company there in arizona. He said he owed $800 on it, so we told him we would give him $1,000, he would go get the title out of the loan company, and then when we give him the second payment, he would produce the title. Of course, he would keep the title till we had it paid off, but he would have clear title so that we could go get it registered in our name. 

[00:16:19]


>> Jeanne: We'll be back with more "judge joe brown" in a moment. 
>> Don called me. He asked me if they could make payments. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, at that time, did you or did you not have the title? 
>> No, I did not, but I did have permission from the lender to sell the vehicle.

>> Jeanne: We're back with "judge joe brown." The plaintiff in this case says she bought a truck from a family friend. She says the defendant had taken out a title loan on the vehicle and it complicated the matter. Let's get back to the case. 
>> Judge Brown: Now, didn't you at some point in here consider making a payment directly to the title-loan company? 
>> Yes. Yes, we did. 
>> Judge Brown: What happened with that? 
>> We called the title loan, because first I asked him if we could just go down and make a payment on the title loan so that we knew that he was still... So that our money wasn't going to nothing. So we called the title company, and the title company said we could go down and make the payment but he would have to be with us... Which was fine. So we called him and told him, you know, we'd go make the payment on the truck or even pay it off. He would stillkeep the title, but at least we would know he had the title in hand. He refused. He said by law he couldn't do that. 
>> Judge Brown: What do you mean? 
>> That's just what he told us. 
>> Judge Brown: He couldn't accompany you while you paid the title loan off? 
>> He refused to go down there and let us pay the title loan off. 'Cause, I mean, we had plenty of money to pay for the truck. That was no problem. 
>> Judge Brown: See, you can't buy the truck. Really, in the country, you can't buy anything but one thing -- it's the right to the exclusive use of the thing vis-????-vis anyone else, unless that exclusive use is dysfunctional for the overall society. So all you own is the exclusive right -- the right to the exclusive use. You don't own the thing. You don't even own your clothes. You just have the property rights in them. 
>> Correct. 
>> Judge Brown: Let's go to the defendant. Now, mr. Sooter, you have the floor, sir. Defend yourself. 
>> On january -- the end of january, I don't remember the exact day -- don had asked me if he could borrow the truck. I told him, "sure." I said, you know, I said at the time it needed a water pump. I said, "if you want to use it, re gonna have to put a water pump in it." He did, in fact, put the water pump in it. I did part of the work, but he's a friend. I wasn't worried about it. I had mentioned to him that -- you know, when he said that when his income tax come in, they were gonna buy a vehicle -- i mentioned, I said, well, I was considering selling my truck, and he asked if I'd be interested in selling it to him. I said, "sure." I said, "i have a title loan. I'll have to clear it with them." And, you know, they borrowed the truck. Um...I think it was the first week of february. Don called me. He asked me if they could make payments. 

[00:20:57]


>> Judge Brown: Well, at that time, did you or did you not have the title? 
>> No, I did not, but I did have permission from the lender to sell the vehicle. 
>> Judge Brown: With a lien for the balance of the loan funds that they had advanced to you. 
>> Yes. Yes, they would not release the title to anybody until it was paid. 
>> Judge Brown: Well, still, they had it, did they not? They're gonna give it back to you when it's paid off. 
>> Yes. 
>> Yes.

>> 'cause as I had discussed with don, I was going to make half the truck payment off the first payment and half the truck payment off the second payment. 
>> Judge Brown: So she was loaning money to you to secure the title or have it revested in your own person, so then she could proceed to have something to buy. So that's a loan. Have you the title?

>> Judge Judy: Thank you. 
>> Byrd: You're welcome. Parties have been sworn in. You may be seated. Folks, have a seat.

>> This is my boyfriend. 
>> Judge Judy: Does he have any information with regard to this case?

>> There was one year that he was with her for foster care. Other than that, I'm not quite sure. It's been on and off. But I also would live with her, as well. 
>> Judge Judy: You mean, when he was livi with her, sometimes you would come there to live, as well. 
>> Correct. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, that doesn't mean he was living with you. That just means she was probably taking care of all of you. 
>> No. Uh, we all took care of each other, I suppose. 
>> Judge Judy: No, I don't suppose that. If your son is living with his aunt and you flop in for a couple of months and then flop out, that doesn't mean that you're taking care of him. 
>> No, we would move in there together, like, me and my son and my daughter would move in -- and my mother would move in with amanda, but it was never that i was in and out of his life.

[00:04:01]


>> Judge Judy: Did she have a behavior problem? Is that why she's living with big sisters? 
>> No. I'm not exactly sure why she's there. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. But prior to that, she wasn't living with your mother, either. 
>> That was when my mother was in the house with us. 
>> Judge Judy: Do you know why your mother left? 
>> I don't remember, to be honest. 
>> Judge Judy: Do you see your father?

>> Judge Judy: How much do you receive in disability? 
>> I don't receive anything. 
>> Judge Judy: So then you're not legally disabled. 
>> I've been fighting for ssi. 
>> Judge Judy: So, you are not legally disabled. Who supports you? 
>> My boyfriend. Or the child support that I was using. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, you can't use the child support, ms. Porter. Child support is not for you. There's a difference between child support and spousal maintenance or any kind of maintenance. 
>> I was justrying to get on my feet. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, i understand that you were trying to get on your feet, but you created two children. And this young man seems like a very nice young man, and there's certainly stability in his life, and my sense is that the stability does not come from you. The stability comes from the rest of his maternal family, either your sister or your

>>> Hi, good evening. I just would like to restate some of the information that we made available earlier. We will take some questions but I must preface my remarks by saying this is an active ongoing vestigation, there is a great deal of work to go and there is a lot have things we cannot confirm or discuss as of yet but shortly after 9:30 this morning newtown police department received a call for help at the sandy hook elementary school here in newtown. Upon realizing the intensity and difficulty of the situation, newtown called for surrounding police departments and state police to respond to assist. Upon arrival of law enforcement officers at the school they immediately entered the school as we knew this was an active potential active shooter situation. Their focus was to search for students, faculty, and staff, and remove them to a safe area outside of the school, they did search every nook and crane i, every room, and every portion of that school and accomplished that task. They took the rescue to a staging area to reunite them with family members. The as has been report there had were fatalities. There were 18 children pronounced dead at the school, there were two transported to area hospitals and pronounced dead at the areas hospitals and there were six adults pronounced dead at the scene at the school. As governor has reported the shooter is deceased, deceased in the school. There is a great deal of work going on relative to that, that is why we have not identified him as of yet. By that I mean search warrants, examination of areas of residents, employment and any ancillary things that may be attached to the identity and to that individual. The scene has been secured. Newtown police officers state police major crime units for both western district and central districts have responded and they are working with several agencies to process this scene. It is not a simplistic scene as you can certainly understand. We need to establish identity, we need to document the entire scene and simply stated we need to answer every single question surrounding exactly how and why this incident occurred. As governor said we will be here throughout the night and weekend and we are not even putting a time stamp as to when we will complete this project. We will work with the medicaller examiners office. We have to establish positive identification and again, there is a great deal of work that needs to be done here at this school. We will take some very, again, very brief questions but understand this is an active ongoing case and there are many ings we cannot and will in the discuss at this time, yes, sir. 

[00:12:26]


>> Unaudible. 
>> There is a secondary crime scene here in newtown, that is in fact, correct. There is an adult deceased at that location. I cannot discuss any further information on that at this time. There is assistance being lended to us by new jersey. I don't have the dehe tails on that so I can't answer that I'm sorry. Yes,'am. 
>> Unaudible. 
>> I can simply state that the information that we have right now that we want to publish size that the shootings did take place in one section of the school, in two rooms. One section in two rooms. That is as much as we wanting to in as far as location. Our personnel are documenting that entire scene and we will have literally everything mapped out in a final report, final information and we will bring answers to those questions but right now i don't have anymore detail than that. 
>> Reporter: Unaudible. 
>> Right new is there one shooter but we are looking at every ancillary fact and circumstance related to the deceased shooter at the scene. 
>> Reporter: Do you have any information on the weapons he used. 
>> I don't that have information. 
>> Reporter: Unaudible. 
>> To be determined I don't have the ansr to that he question. Next step is medical examiners office who will assist us in answering those questions, manner and cause of death of all of the deceased. 
>> Reporter: How many injured. 
>> That is it 26 deceased. 
>> Reporter: No injuries. 
>> I'm sorry, one person was injured. 
>> Reporter: Unaudible. 
>> There was one section and one area of the school, that is best I can do on that answer. I don't know specifically how many rooms were involved. I was told there were two but in one section of the school building. Everyone was in that same section of the building. 
>> Reporter: Unaudible. 
>> Section of the building is as far as we wanting to. 
>> Reporter: Did security say how shooter died. 
>> We did not. That is to be determined once postmortem examinations are complete. 

[00:14:33]


>> Reporter: Unaudible. 
>> Twenty children, six adults, and the shooter. Twenty-seven total. That is correct. 
>> Reporter: Just at the school. 
>> That is correct, is there one more we just added a secondary crime scene there is a deceased adult at the secondary crime scene. 
>> Reporter: Unaudible. 
>> To be determined, that is really something that our investigators will to have look at thoroughly and completely and that will take sometime to answer that question. 
>> Reporter: Unaudible. 
>> We have not established any of that, ma'am. We have not made any positive identifications. We are working on. That there is preliminary identification that has been made but we have a great deal of work. That is one thing we have to do is establish positive identification on all of the deceased and that is a time consuming process. 
>> Reporter: Do we know the ages... 
>> I don't, k through four elementary school. 
>> Reporter: When police went in the school were there shots being fired at that too. 
>> I don't know the the time 
sequence: What I would like to do is tell you that thinks a briefing, we will be back in 60 minutes, lieutenant from newtown will be back in 60 minutes and anymore details to some of the questions that you have posed. I will see if I can get some ore answers to provide you with information, and that will be just about 25, quarter to 5:00. 
>> Reporter: Unaudible. 
>> I don't know. 
>> Reporter: Twenty adults, six adults and shooter. 
>> Twenty children, 56 adults, and then a secondary scene with an additional adult victim at the that secondary scene. 
>> Reporter: You said quarter of five. 
>> Yes. 
>> Reporter: Do you have an age range of the children. 
>> I do not. 
>> One thing would I like to say is we have been meeting with all of the family members, it is a very, very difficult scene for family members, for all of the responding first responders. It is a tragic, tragic I can scene. We have been asked by family members to ask the members of the press to respect their privacy and to please leave them alone at this time. They are going through a tremendous amount of grief which I'm sure you can appreciate. I have been asked to ask you that personally by the family members. I will be back in 60 minutes. We will answer any additional questions that we can. 

[00:17:03]


>> Reporter: Unaudible. 
>> I don't know. 
>> Reporter: Give us an idea of the emotions now enveloping the community. 
>> Theommunity has come together, first responders have come together, counselors, it is a amazing how the immense amount of family has shown here in this town of newtown. Everyone is coming together supporting each and everyone trying to answer questions as to how and why this occurred and lend support to the people involved including the victims, okay. 
>> Reporter: How long... Unaudible. 
>> I cannot answer that he question, ma'am. I'll see if I can narrow it somewhat in the next briefing. Okay. 
>> All right. We have been hearing from paul vance with the connecticut state police, again, they are not saying much, they are not confirming a lot because this is an ongoing and clearly very active investigation. What he did confirm is how many people died, and where they died there was a little bit of confusion, there has been milk reports. I would like to break that down so you know where this stands. There are a total of 20 children between five and zero that have died. Eighteen died at the school, excuse me two died at the hospital. There were six adults, in the school that died. We do not know if they were faculty, teachers, administration. We also know that the suspect is dead, we don't necessity how he died at this point that is part of the investigation. We know that there was another adult, who lived with the suspect who is also dead. That makes the total of 28 people, who have died at the shooting in connecticut and that includes the shooter. You heard mr. Vance mention he will be back in 60 minutes about 4:45 with an update and we will bring that to you live. In the meantime get all of the information you need and continuous updates on our web site at my fox philly.Com and we will go wall to wall with coverage on this story on the fox 29 news at 5:00. I'm kerry barrett, with a special report, we will see you back here in about 50 minutes. Friend kevin zichafoose crashed his car while on a food run during a night of partying. 

[00:19:24]


>> Judge Judy: Now, if you exercised judgment that he was, in fact, sober, and then your complaint says he was acting crazy and he was drunk, then you were wrong. 
>> He did he was sober before he took the keys. 
>> Judge Judy: I didn't say "what he said." What?! Stand! Move! 
>> Philip didn't ask him to drive. He had offered to drive. And he didn't give him the keys. He had took the keys. 
>> That is not correct. 
>> Judge Judy: No, no, no. I'm not looking at you. Take your hand off your hip. Do you understand what I said? 
>> Yes, I understand what you said. 
>> Judge Judy: Try to explain to me in my words. 
>> You say it's his responsibility 'cause it's his car, but he's not the one who crashed it and he's not the one who told him to drive it. He had offered, and he was the one who wanted to get food. We all wanted to go get food. He was the one who took the keys out of philip's hand. 
>> Judge Judy: You were drunk! You're not supposed to get into a car. And that's your punishment -- pay for your own car. 
>> He didn't cause the accident. 
>> Judge Judy: [ Chuckles ] I just told you he did. I just told you he did. He caused the accident as soon as he made a judgment while he was intoxicated that somebody else was sober enough to get into his car. 
>> He had no recollection that he was even drinking. 
[ Laughter ] we weren't with him at all during the party. We don't know what he was doing. He was at his cousin's house. We didn't know he was drinking. We just wanted to go get food. 
>> Judge Judy: Where are you from? 
>> Me? I'm from new york. 
>> Judge Judy: Good. Goodbye. Go back to new york. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> Byrd: Parties are excused. You may step out. 
>> I said I wanted to get some food, and he offered to drive my car. 
>> He begged me to go get food. 
>> He was speeding and driving recklessly. 
>> And told me that I was the most sober person there... 
>> We didn't see the median until like the last second. 
>> ...So, obviously, he wanted me driving his car. 
>> We hit the median and my tire blew out. 
>> I'm trying to get directions from them, and they're acting crazy. 
>> I said that I was gonna call the cops when we were changing the tire. 
>> They were the drunk ones, not me. 
>> He said, "no, don't. I HAVE TWO DUIs." 
>> I have all kinds of things on my record. 
>> He said, "i'll pay for everything." 
>> You don't really know a person until you... 
>> And he never paid for any of the damages. 

[00:21:25]


>> ...Crash their car. 
[ Laughs ] 
>> Announcer: And now the next case. 
>> Byrd: All parties in the MATTER OF PACK vs. GOMEZ, STEP Forward. 
>> Announcer:25-year-old christina pack is suing her ex-boyfriend bruno gomez for unpaid vet bills. Bruno is countersuing for the balance on an apartment lease and harassment. 
>> Judge Judy: Let me go through what this case is about. You have a dog. Your dog was hit by a car. You didn't have money to have the dog taken car of by the vet. It was a substantial vet bill. Miss pack put the bill on her credit card. Even after you separated, you paid periodically on the bill so that the bill, which was several thousand dollars, is down to about $1,000. Then you stopped making payments on it. She wants the balance that's due on the credit card. Correct? You say, well, you shared everything when you were living together. You paid for half the vet bill. And you figured when you got to pay for half, you'd had enough and the rest she should take care of. Then you have a nonsense counterclaim, sir. When I say "nonsense" -- if you lived together in 2008 and you're suing her for rent that she was supposed to pay you in 2008 -- is that what your countersuit is about? 
>> No, not exactly. We signed a lease togethernd we got an apartment together and then she moved out and then i was left with the lease. 
>> Judge Judy: So, why didn't you sue her in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011? 
>> Well, the lease was up in 2010. 
>> Judge Judy: So what? 
>> I just wanted to be done with the matter. It wasn't an issue. 
>> Judge Judy: So, then why are you bringing it up now? 
>> 'Cause we're in court now. 
>> Judge Judy: Yeah, uh, your counterclaim's dismissed. It's nonsense. 
[ Laughter ]

>> Judge Judy: You co-ownethe dog. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Judge Judy: And the dog would live with you. 
>> Announcer: An eviction forced his hand. 
>> I called her to store the dog because she does have ownership of him, too. 
>> Judge Judy: So you relinquished the dog to her? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, that's what this says. 
>> Announcer: Then it was the dog that moved on. 
>> Judge Judy:36 days later, she told you...? 
>> I was too late. She told me that she no longer has the dog, that she placed him. 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy." You are about to enter the courtroom of judge judith sheindlin. The people are real. The cases are real. The rulings are final. Captions paid for by cbs television distribution dog trainer michael garcia is suing dog breeder rebecca harris for the return of a pit bull, mental anguish, and dog-training fees. 
>> Byrd: Order! All rise! This is case number 193 on the calendar in the matter of GARCIA vs. HARRIS. 
>> Judge Judy: Thank you. 
>> Byrd: You're welcome, judge. Parties have been sworn in. You may be seated. Why don't you folks have a seat? 
>> Judge Judy: Mr. Garcia, sometime ago -- it looks as if almost four years ago -- you got a dog from miss harris. 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you purchase the dog from her? 
>> I did not. 
>> Judge Judy: Tell me the circumstances surrounding your getting the dog from miss harris. 
>> It's a normal thing. I've been training dogs -- 
>> Judge Judy: [ Raps desk ] 
>> okay. I showed up at the dog show. I was approached by another judge. Introduced me to harris. 
>> Judge Judy: When was that? 
>> This was in '07? And I was asked what I thought about the litter, in particular a dog. 
>> Judge Judy: So you looked at a litter of puppies that miss harris had? 
>> Rht. I was then introduced to miss harris. 
>> Judge Judy: Great. What kind of a dog? 
>> It's american pit bull. 
>> Judge Judy: Now, you did not pay her for the dog. 
>> No, I did not. They approached me -- it's a standard thing. People approach me to take on their dog. If they can't afford my fees, then they do a co-own with me, which means she has breeding rights and I have breeding rights and get to raise this dog. 

[00:02:02]


>> Judge Judy: Did you ever breed the dog that you gave to him? 
>> No, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: Did youever breed the dog? 
>> No, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: So, so far, she's not getting anything out of it. 
>> No. She got something. 
>> Judge Judy: What did she get? 
>> She got me representing the dog and showing the dog and promoting the dog. That has her kennel name attached to it. She got something out of it. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, did you show him in 100 shows? 
>> Not 100. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you show him in 10 shows? 
>> Absolutely. More. 
>> Judge Judy: Did he win anything? 
>> Absolutely -- he's a grand champion. 
>> Judge Judy: So he became a grand champion from her kennel. You have something to show me that that happened. 
>> Oh, absolutely. 
>> Judge Judy: I'd like to take a look at it. 
>> Okay. 
>> Judge Judy: All I want to see is this dog -- what was the dog's name? 
>> Adonis. 
>> Judge Judy: Adonis. With a big -- it's a red ribbon that they get as grand champion? 
>> I don't have anything like that. 
>> Judge Judy: I mean, I have never shown a dog, but I have been to dog shows, and I know that when you show a dog and it reaches granchampion, you have a certificate, you have a picture, you have a something that says that this dog in this particular show in this particulreed was awarded the grand championship in that breed for that show. All I'm asking you is for any proof of that, sir. And if you have none, say, "i have none." 
>> I don't, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: You don't. So that's the answer. Okay. So, there was no consideration flowing to her from this arrangement, so far, in five years. Now, this is what your case is about -- at some point, you could no longer keep the dog because you had to move or something. Uncross your arms. You called on miss harris. She came down, at her own expense, took the dog. According to you, a month later, you called to get the dog back and she had already re-placed the dog. You want either the dog or you want compensation to the tune of $5,000. That's not what happened? 
>> No, it's not what happened. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. Great. Then you tell me what happened. I read your complaint. That's what you say happened. 
>> I was living in a house. I got a 12-day notice to vacate. 

[00:04:03]


>> Judge Judy: Fine. You could no longer keep the dog. 
>> No. I called her to store the dog because she does have ownership of him, too, to protect anything that may happen to him, okay? 
>> Judge Judy: Give me the date, mr. Garcia. 
>> IT WAS AUGUST 20th. 
>> Judge Judy: A year ago? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Go ahead. 
>> Okay, I called her that tuesday, in tears, crying 'cause I didn't know what I was gonna do. 
>> Judge Judy: Just tell me what you asked her to do. 
>> I told her to store adonis there if she had room. 
>> Judge Judy: Great. And? 
>> She told me that she doesn't, she's at her limit, but she would hold on to him as long as she could. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. And? 
>> So, I called her the next day when she came to pick him up. 
>> Judge Judy: Now, she came to pick him up at whose expense? 
>> It was at hers. 
>> Judge Judy: And? 
>> And I told her again that I'm coming for my dog. 
>> Judge Judy: That was in august? 
>> THAT WAS AUGUST 30th, WHEN She came to pick him up. 
>> Judge Judy: When did you call her for the dog? 36 days later. 
>> Judge Judy: And 36 days later she told you...? 
>> I was too late. 
>> Judge Judy: And she had told you before, when you called her, according to you, mr. Garcia, that she could not store your dog. She would keep him as long as she could. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Judge Judy: Now, so, tell me the rest of your story, sir, because now what you want is the dog, after a year -- she's already re-placed the dog -- or $5,000. Keep going. 
>> When I called her, then she told me that she no longer has the dog, that she placed him. Well, there's words of "placing" and "permanent placing." So I made it very clear, "what are you talking about?" And, "did you permanently place him?" She said, "yes." And I said, "you broke my heart," and I couldn't talk to her anymore. I hung up. I started searching for my dog. It wasn't until january -- someone came up and sent me the information where he was. 
>> Judge Judy: Mr. Garcia, i read your papers. You say you trained this dog for four years to be a service dog. That wasn't your agreement with miss harris. Your agreement with miss harris, according to you, was you were going to be co-owners of this dog -- according to you, i haven't heard fromer yet -- that you were going to have co-breeding rights and that you were gonna show this dog to champion and that that's what the agreement was, which is why she gave you the dog for nothing. And so the fact that you trained this dog to be your own service dog is totally irrelevant, to me -- totally irrelevant to this case, because that wasn't your arrangement, according to you, with miss harris. With miss harris, your arrangement was you were going to be co-owners, you were gonna show her dog, which was going to inure to her benefit as the owner of the kennel. That's what you told me. So I don't care whether you trained this dog to fly hoops or whether you trained this dog to be a constant companion. It has nothing to do with the case. The only thing that has to do with the case is whether or not she was within her rights to place the dog, based upon the conversation that the two of you had. Would that be a fair statement? 

[00:06:41]


>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Great. Now I'll hear from you. Go. 
>> ON AUGUST 19th, MR. GARCIA Called me and told me that he had gotten a notice to be evicted, that he was going to be homeless and that he knew he was going to have to relinquish adonis to me per our contract. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you have a written contract? 
>> I do. 
>> Judge Judy: I'd like to take a look at it. By the way, mr. Garcia, how many other dogs did you have when you got your eviction notice? 
>> Two other -- a chihuahua and another staff. 
>> Judge Judy: So, you had another pit bull and a chihuahua? 
>> Right. 
>> Judge Judy: Are those dogs with you now? 
>> Yes, they are, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: What did you do with those two dogs? 
>> They were stored in a rescue place that was offered to me. 
>> Judge Judy: You put them in a rescue place? 
>> Yes, temporarily. 
>> Judge Judy: And when did you get them back? 
>> Immediately. 
>> Judge Judy: When did you get them back? And the name of the place? 
>> I don't have the name of the place, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: You don't have the name of the rescue place that was helping you out? 
>> Right, I do have her number, though. 
>> Judge Judy: I'd like it. 
>> Okay. Oh, did I bring it? 
[ Sighs ] that's what I didn't bring, your honor. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned it. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. 
>> But -- 
>> Judge Judy: Don't say anything else, mr. Garcia. Okay, so, what he was supposed to do is -- pursuant to this contract, he was required to... "Buyer" -- that's you -- "acknowledges that the puppy is being purchased on a show contract and agrees to show the puppy at no fewer than 16 licensed ukc shows -- not weekends -- a year." And you have proof that you did that? 
>> Yeah, he's titled out. 
>> Judge Judy: No. I would just like to see proof that you did that. 
>> No, I don't have that anymore, 'cause he's titled out when he was a year and a half. 
>> Judge Judy: This is your contract, sir. I just want to know what the consideration was for the contra. 
>> I lived up to the agreement. 
>> Judge Judy: I don't know that. How do I know that? 
>> He's a grand champion. 
>> Judge Judy: How do I know that? 
>> I have a document that says "grand champiocali girl's adonis." 
>> Judge Judy: I'd like to see what you have. 
>> Yes, ma'am. 

[00:08:47]


>> Judge Judy: This is your facebook page, is that right? 
>> It is. 
>> Judge Judy: Just a second. So, you wrote this? 
>> I didn't write that, no. 
>> Judge Judy: You need something from -- don't you get something from the akc or whatever it is? And she has everything. 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: Has this dog reached grand champion? 
>> Yes, it has. 
>> Judge Judy: Can I see that? Do you have that? 
>> I don't have proof of that. However, in his new registration to his new owner, mr. Leonard, it does have the "grand champion" in front of his name indicating that he did obtain his grand champion title. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. So, you called back mr. Garcia about a month later. And you had placed the puppy with someone else when? 
>> I actually -- mr. Garcia's dates are incorrect, so I'd like to correct those, if I may. I PICKED UP ADONIS AUGUST 27th. I have vet records indicating, on the 29th in sacramento, i took him to the vet for vaccinations because mr. Garcia did not provide those to me. 
>> Judge Judy: Just a second. Did you ask, miss harris, mr. Garcia for his vaccination records when you picked him up? 
>> I did not. He had a pile of paperwork that he had prepared for me, and it was a 15-hour round-trip drive. I did not go through it at that time other than to offer him a pen to release his ownership on the registration papers. 
>> Judge Judy: Did he sign that? 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Judge Judy: I'd like to see it. So you relinquished the dog to her? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: That's what this says. 
>> That's a standard practice -- to let go. So therefore, when I come for my dog, she just returns him, returns the paperwork. That's an honest person who does that. Your honor, I have it even in here. Here's another contract that says that very same thing -- you got to pre-sign. So when she asks me for it, i didn't hesitate. But I did tell her that I'm coming back for him. 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy" continues in a moment. 
>> Judge Judy: How many dogs do you have now? 
>> I have one -- I have a chihuahua. 
>> Judge Judy: Just a second. Mr. Garcia, I don't believe anything that you said to me because a moment ago you said to me you had two.

>> Right. 
>> Announcer: And later today... >>ge Judy: YOU AND YOUR Friends are pigs. Because you're such pigs, the place was unsafe to live in. 
>> It was unsafe enough that there was an infestation.

>> this is a fox news special report. 
>> From fox news world headquarters in new york, we are about to hear from president obama on the tragic event today in newtown, connecticut. A 24-room and locked into an elementary school this morning and killed 89 children before killing himself, 26 people total 

[00:15:25]


-- 18 young children. His mother was a teacher at the school, the sandy hook elementary, about an hour north of new york city. This is one of the worst mass shooting in u.S. History. It took place in an elementary school which makes it even more horrific. What might the president have to say? 
>> He will certainly offer his sympathy and share the grief of the nation. Aides say the president was informed by his home when security adviser and was kept updated as the investigation proceeded from the day. He spoke with the connecticut governor, fbi director robert mueller. As a father, he would say he feels enormous sympathy for the families touched by this tragedy. He has offered whatever federal assistance is needed and can be provided, both to the state and local police authorities and to the families of the victims. Reporters repeatedly asked the press secretary whether this latest tragedy will kindle a discussion of gun control. He said now is not a time for that discussion. 
>> Again, we're waiting for the president. He is about to address the country in light of the events in connecticut. Let's listen to president obama. 
>> This afternoon I spoke with the governor mali and fbi director mueller. 
-- Governor malloy. I offer my condolences on behalf of the nation in made it clear he will have every single resource that he needs to investigate this heinous crime, care for the victims, council their families. We have endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years, and each time I learned the news, I react not as a president, but as anybody else would, as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know tre's not a parent in america who does not feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children, a beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. 

[00:17:48]


>> They had their enti lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who developed -- the bow to their life to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today for the parents, grandparents, sisters, and brothers of these little children and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well. For as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early, and there are no words that will ease their pain. As a country, we have been through this too many times, whether it is and elementary school in newtown or a shopping mall in oregon or a temple in wisconsin for a movie theater in colorado or a street corner in chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. This evening, michele and I will do what I know every parent in america will do, which is hug our children a little tighter, and we will tell them that we love them and we will remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in connecticut who cannot do that tonight. And they need all of us right now. In our days to come, the community needs to be at our best as americans, and will do everything in my power as president to help. Because, while nothing can fill the space of a lost child or a loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need, to remind them that we're there for them, that we are praying for them, that the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories but also in hours. May god bless the memory of the victims. And in the words of scripture, heal the broken hearted and bind up their wounds. 

[00:20:26]


>> A visibly emotional president barack obama in the white house briefing room, talking about the events that took place this morning in newtown, connecticut were 24-year-old man walked into an elementary school and all 26 people, including 18 children, and then himself. The president saying our hearts are broken today. He said that we are going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent something like this from happening again. He said regardless of the politics, regardless of the politics. Wendell golerst idistng outside the white house. The president mentioned not just the events of today but those of several occasions over the past several months and years where he has had to come out a dog and the country has had to come to grips with a mass shooting like this. 
>> Mass shootings at a movie theater in aurora, colorado, a shooting at a temple, the shooting that remarkably a member of congress survived all the others have not, the president said we have been through this too many times. As you said, he was visibly moved twice, pausing when he noted that many of the children, the majority of those who died or children between 5 and 10 years old. He seemed to find it difficult to go on after saying that. Then he paused again when he said they had their entire lives ahead of them and they left grieving parents, grandparents, sisters, brothers, and that these shootings will touch the lives of children who survived as well and have had their innocence taken from them. As I said earlier, press secretary jay carney conceding that there will be a discussion in this, the president's second term, lightly on gun control -- likely on gun control. He said it is not a time for that. Today is the day to grieve for the victims. As the president points out, we have been through too many of these incidents, and it is unclear what would stop them. 

[00:22:36]


>> Wendell goler in front of the white house, thank you very much. You have seen in live pictures that the flags have been lowered, the president ordering flags to be lowered to half mast until december 18 in memory of those victims. Again, a sugar walking into an elementary school in connecticut this morning -- a shooter killing 26 people, including 18 young children. Please state tend to fox news channel and to this fox station for continuing coverage of this tragedy and for all the breaking news of the day. Of course, you defined as any TIME ONLINE AT?Yo?? 

[00:26:27]


>> Judge Judy: Now, she's not paying you any more money. 
>> Why wld that be? 
>> Judge Judy: Because you maintained an unsafe environment that you allowed her to move into. She paid you for the month. Most of the month she wasn't there. She moved out, you have no lease, you have nothing in writing with her. Is that correct? 
>> No, I have an agreement. 
>> Judge Judy: Let me see it. 
>> This wasn't a lease. It was a subcontract to pretty much protect myself. 
>> Judge Judy: Let me just see it. 
>> The pertinent stuff is on the back. 
>> Judge Judy: Just a second. Actually, what you're talking about is "two weeks' notice must be given in regard to moving out." 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: I view an infestation of bedbugs sufficient to obfuscate this portion of your agreement. 
>> I think "infestation" is an overstatement. 
>> Judge Judy: I don't care whether it was an overstatement or not. It was an infestation of bedbugs that, according to your girlfriend, took a month to take care of. 
>> It was a month more locating it. Once we did, it was literally -- 
>> Judge Judy: She's not paying you any more money. Bye. 
>> Byrd: Parties are excused. You may step out. 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy" continues in a moment. Continues in a moment. And on the next "judge judy"... 
>> I'm disappointed. I thought that she should have paid me for the next month. 
>> I actually shaved my head because of the bedbugs. 
>> But at the time, we were asking each roommate to pitch in $100 so that we could find out so it didn't actually become a full-on infestation, which i don't think it ever was. I think that's an overstatement. She balked at the price and skipped out with three days left. 
>> They also expected me to pay $100 of the extermination fee, four days after living there. I had to leave. 
>> Make sure I have a much more clear understanding in writing. 
>> I'm glad I got to show everybody that you don't need hair to be a happy person.

It Captioning sponsored by 20th century fox television Oops! I dropped my latest issue of Street and And it completely by accident opened to page 47. Street and Smith? Well, don't be stingy with it. Hand it over. "Top 25 Texas Middle-School Quarterbacks to Watch." Oh, my God, Joseph's on the list. Boomhauer: Well, all right, Dale. Dang 'ol way to go, man. I like Joseph. Wow, a "listed" quarterback. This is great news. With Joseph leading our team, Tom Landry may finally have a shot at a winning season. And I will be commended for having spawned such a superior athlete. People will point at my loins and say, "Job well done." Announcer: Denton has taken quite a beating, thanks to Tom Landry quarterback Joseph Gribble. That boy sure grew an arm this summer. Joseph: Hike! (crowd cheering, whistle blows) (whooping) Longhorns win! That's my son! I made him! Heck of a game, Gribble. Nice job. Boy, if the rest of the season's like this, I may start carrying Joseph's picture in my wallet. Afternoon, Mr. Gribble. Mike Gilstead. I'm a recruiter with Spencer Academy. Ooh, private school. Snazzy. What brings you to our little government-funded establishment? Well, your son, actually. We think Joseph would be a great addition to our football program. Really? Why don't you give me 

[00:02:00]


a call sometime? You're not actually considering this, are you? It doesn't hurt to listen. Plus, he gave me his card, Hank. I'm pretty much committed at this point. I present the first victory loaf of the season. (sighs) If Dale listens to those private school people, this'll be the only meat loaf we eat all year. And I love your meat loaf, Peggy. This is terrible! Joseph's my best friend. If he leaves n what'll I do? I can't finish our wall of gum alone. Bobby, you can find a new best friend. A winning football season is once in a lifetime. Dale: Impressive campus you've got here. For future tours, might I suggest a golf cart or a little train? So, what did you think of our library, Joseph? Big, huh? I like that there's lots of places where people can't see you. Let's just cut to the chase, Mr. Gribble. Joseph is a star. We want to build our football program around him and his talents. And all you have to do is say yes. Joseph, could you step outside? The grown-ups need to talk. (door opens) (door closes) You know, I'm hearing a lot about what's in it for Joseph. What I'm not hearing is what's in it for me. Ooh, olive tapenade. Compliments of my friends at Spencer Academy. That's not cheese in that basket. It's payola. That school is trying to buy you off. Uh, nobody's "buying" anybody, Hank. They're simply offering Dale's Dead Bug a 100-year, pay-upfront, no-spray contract. It's completely aboveboard. Dale, I know how confusing it can be when someone sends you gifts and pretends to love you. But are you sure this school's right for Joseph? Are you suggesting he stay at Tom Landry? 'Cause their offer was crap. 

[00:04:01]


Dang it, Dale. This isn't about what you can get out of the deal. It's about the best school for Joseph. Shouldn't he have a say in where he plays football? Are you really concerned about Joseph or just a Tom Landry fan who wants to say, "We're #1!"? Uh... I still think Joseph should have a say. Fine, he can decide. I've raised him well. I have no doubt he'll make the most profitable choice. A bottle of champagne and two glasses. Which one of us will Dale choose? Not you. Joseph: My press conference thingie's tonight, and I haven't decided what to do. I'm all nervous. I got stomach flies. (laughter) Well, you can't leave Tom Landry. Great stuff like that happens all the time! I know. My dad wants me to go to Spencer, but all my friends and all the stuff I like is here. It's so complicated. Joseph, if you're still on the fence about Tom Landry, let me sweeten the pot. You see this key? It opens every door in the school. Every... single... door. Please. Please stay! This is Nancy Hicks-Gribble reporting live from Captain Bear's, home of the ten-pound pizza, where star quarterback Joseph Gribble is about to make his announcement. Spencer or Tom Landry: who will he choose? Uh, how you doing there, Carl? Not good, Hank. Not good. Man: Hush. Shh. (voice echoing): Hi, I'm Joseph. Uh, my head's been full of thinking the past few days. There are many decisions to be made about my future: my football future and the future of my brain. So, uh, in conclusion, that is why I choose... 

[00:06:04]


Tom Landry. Yes! All right! Nice choice, son! Uh... luckily it's not about what Joseph chooses, because he's just a dumb kid who doesn't know any better. I'm his father, and I say we're going to Spencer Academy! helping with family. DAD: Ah, haha. Hey, kids, how are you liking those sweaters? Audrey? DAUGHTER 1: Love the stripes. DAD: Russ? SON 1: Awesome, Dad. DAD: Audrey? DAUGHTER 2: Super cute. DAD: Euro Rusty? SON 2: Rad, Dad. DAD: And, you two. Who are you? GIRL: New Audrey. BOY: And Rusty. DAD: It's bedtime.

ferrero rocher. Make your moments golden. So, are you excited about your first day of new, fancy school? I guess so. Come on. You get to play football. There's some academic perks I can't quite remember. It's gonna be fantastic! Morning, Joseph. Ready to dig in? Not so fast, Mr. Grabby. We have some business to attend to first. Oh, yes, the exterminating contract. I have your check right here. Eh, we're gonna do this nice and slow, Mexican standoff style. Comprende? Easy... Easy... Sha! Morning there, Sam. Tucker Mardell, I'd like you to meet Dale Gribble and his son Joseph, our new quarterback. Glad to have you aboard, son. Mardell, huh? Any relation to the building "over there? Wow, dude, do you live there? (laughing) No, but he did generously donate the funds to have it built. 

[00:10:09]


You bought a whole building?! I went here, and my boy goes here. Spencer Academy has been good to us, so it just seemed right to be good to Spencer. Well, listen I've got a date with 18 holes. Dale, if you're not doing anything... I'm never doing anything! See you later, Joseph. Gentlemen. Wow, Dale, you could be on top of a wedding cake. What's the occasion? I'm going to a gala. That's what we "Spencer families" do. We gala. Look, it's bad enough you stuck Joseph somewhere he doesn't want to be and screwed up Tom Landry's winning season. Can we not hear about your stupid party? Gala. Hello, neighbor! I hear your delightful son is attending prestigious Spencer Academy. Maybe you could write a letter of recommendation for Kahn, Jr. You know how to write, don't you? (laughing): Of course you do, you big Spencer family! But just in case, I typed up a little something. Make your mark here. Did you see the way he was kissing up to me? I will never get tired of that. (sighs) Ho crap, this is fancy. Dang it, I knew you should've worn that fox stole I made for you. It was squirrel, Dale. And it was creepy the way you had each one biting the tail of the next. Dale, Nancy, so glad you could make it. This is my wife, Ashley Rae. But my good friends call me Mitzi. And I can tell by your hair, we're gonna be good friends. (both laughing) Come on, let's get you a drink in that hand. Doug Diamond, Charlie St. Clair, say hello to Dale Gribble. You're Uncle Chuck of Uncle Chuck's Breakfast Meats. Your picture's on my sausage patties! Oh, that's my dad. He founded the company, but I run it now. And someday I'll pass it on to my son. Unless he's still a vegetarian. 

[00:12:11]


Then I guess the girl gets it. Wow. You gave your son a building. You're leaving yours a sausage factory. All I've got to give is my fatherly advice, which is shoddy at best. (glass clinking) Hey, y'all! I'm Kaydee Taylor, Chairwoman of the Fundraising Committee. Congratulations to us for funding our new performing arts center! But now we need some flowers and benches to make it look pretty. So it's time to dig deep, people. I'll kick in for the flowers. Put me down for a fountain. I'll buy a bench! For my son Joseph! (applause) Nice, Gribble. Cohiba? Oh, I could have danced all night. You know, that was a lot of money just to have your name on a bench kids are gonna carve curse words in. Nancy, all these rich guys do things for their kids. I never thought of that before. Joseph's fine. He doesn't need anything, sug. Sure he does. Look at him. (sniffing) If he can succeed in their world, Joseph could have his name on something better than a bench. Maybe a stadium or a country. Imagine it, Nancy: "Josephistan." Dude, what is that thing, a spleen? No, a cherimoya. It's a fruit. We should totally burn it! One time, I lit a banana... Or, or you could just eat it. Well, I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I can't wait for football season to be over. And I bet Coach Kleehammer feels the same way 

[00:14:11]


after last night's game. I cannot believe someone in the stands threw a car battery at him. n at school lately? I didn't want to rub it in, but we did have two fire alarms, and Ramon got one of his crazy nosebleeds. Man, I miss that place. Dale: Joseph! There you are. What are you doing playing with the neighbor kid? You mean Bobby? Whatever. One of your Spencer friends just called. A bunch of the guys are going out on his dad's boat. Did you hear that, Hank? My boy's going sailing with rich people. Don't care. I don't want to go, Dad. Those guys are always talking about weird stuff I don't know like summer camp in Europe. Just fake it. Say the churches are beautiful. Your future is depending on this, Joseph. You need to be on that boat. And if you get seasick, I want you to swallow it and smile. Okay. (country music playing) Another silent auction? (sighs) What are we doing here, Dale? I don't even know what we're raising money for... or against. Joseph's not fitting in because he doesn't have anything to talk about with those Spencer kids. Love the boots, Kaydee! So we need to bid on a fancy, rich-person thing for him to do and then discuss. So, what are we bidding on, a little father-daughter tennis clinic? Uh, my wife and I are bidding on the trip to Brazil. A gift for our son. He's turning two. That's sounds perfect for my son as well. Imagine him speaking Brazilian to all his friends at school. Let me just outbid you here. 

[00:16:11]


Well, that was rude. Stop it! This trip is mine! You're wasting ink, pal. I can do this all night. I've had enough of you... and your pen! Outbid this! What are you doing, sug? We can't afford this! But Joseph needs... We're not rich, Dale. (spurs jingling) (listlessly): Hey. Wherever you just came from, thank you for not inviting me. (sighs) I failed, Hank. Joseph's not fitting in. Have you ever thought that maybe Joseph just doesn't belong at that school? Of course, he does. He has to! Joseph will have a better life if he's part of that world. Come on. You've seen Annie. Well, you know, Dale, a better life means different things to different people. You need to think about what's best for Joseph. You're right, Hank. I know what I have to do. (spurs jingling) (rattling) (doorbell rings) Joseph? I'm supposed to live with you now. What the heck is Joseph doing here? I don't know. His dad just dropped him off. King of the Hill is brought to you in part by: 

[00:20:43]


(phone rings) DALE (on machine): The occupants at this address are not home. Please leave a message. (machine beeps) Dale, Tucker Mardell... again. Joseph's here. Don't know why. We'll feed him dinner, but could you come get him... soon? (sobbing): My son! (eating noisily) (gulping) Dad, can you pass the corn? Uh, why'd you call me "Dad"? My real dad told me to call you "Dad." I guess you're my brother now. Want to wrestle? Okay, let's drive you home. (film projector whirring) (sobbing) (knocking on door) Dale: Joseph. Be strong, Gribble. Dale, I brought your son. I don't have a son! Go away! Huh. Your mom will be home soon, right? Great. See you later, son. I mean, not like you're myson, but, you know, "son" in the gen... Oh, hell, forget it. Just stay. You're still here? No! Go back to the rich people! But, Dad... It's for your own good! Get! (Dale sobbing) I miss you, Dad! You'll forget me soon enough! I can't remember what you look like! I'll always be in your heart. Now go! Go, my beautiful son! (sobbing) Dad?! Uh, hey, Joseph. Everything okay? My dad won't let me in! Oh. (sighs) Uh, want to come over till your mom gets home? (sniffles) Okay. (gasps) Oh, Dale! You scared me, sug. Nancy, I have something to tell you. I am a husband and an exterminator, but above all, I'm a father. 

[00:22:45]


And it's my responsibility to provide the best for my child. That is why I've given away our only son, our precious boy, to be raised by rich people. What are you talking about, Dale? I just saw Joseph at the Hills'. What?! He can't stay with them! They're worse than us! Dad? Joseph? Oh, Joseph, I miss you so o much! Look at you. You grew out your hair! I'm sorry it didn't work out with my new dad. It's okay, son. It's over now. You're back home, and I'll never let you go again. I'm glad. Go on to your room. We kept it just the way you left it. (sighs) I'm so happy Joseph's back. Our house is alive again with the pitter-patter of his giant feet. And I made a decision. I'm pulling him out of Spencer Academy. Yeah, all right. Way to go! That's great news, Dale. 'Course, when Spencer finds out I took Joseph andspent their bribe money, they're gonna be angry. Looks like the Gribbles are going into hiding. That can't be your answer to everything, Dale. But these are powerful people, Hank. I can't cross Mardell Steel or Uncle Chuck. Who knows what they'd put in my breakfast meats or drop on my head? Why don't you just pay them back? I'll give you some money. Then Joseph could come back to Tom Landry, and you won't have to burn off your fingerprints. I will, too. Cross-country is the only got-dang winning sport Tom Landry has right now. I'd pay anything for that not to be true. Yeah, man, dang ol' anybody would, man. That's it! I'll fund-raise my way out of this! If the people at Spencer taught me one thing, it's that if you serve food, you can beg for money. Almost. 

[00:24:47]


Thank you all for coming today and being so loose with your wallets. Because of your generosity and overwhelming desire for a winning football season, my son will be returning to Tom Landry! (all cheering) Longhorns! Fellas, having a good time? You bet. This party's got my two favorite things: barbecue and Joseph back at Tom Landry. Yep, it's a good day to be a Longhorn, I tell you what. (boys laughing) It sure is.

Eighty-six the french fries! (announcer) AND MOST DISTRAUGHT RESTAURANTS In kitchen nightmare'shistory. IT AIN'T HER FAULT. IT'S MY [bleep] FAULT. (announcer) FIRST, WE RETURN TO CAFE HON In hampden, maryland. Could I have everybody's attention? (announcer) THE OWNER WAS CAUGHT IN A NASTY Battle with the community. I was afraid for my life. (Gordon) WHAT? DEATH THREATS? (announcer) AND HER STAFF WAS READY TO REVOLT. You're a rude bitch. (announcer) THEN WE'LL VISIT CHIARELLA'S In philadelphia... Put it up! Let's go! (announcer) WHERE THE FAMILY BUSINESS WAS So bad, that one owner had completely lost his confidence... I just stay in bed 'cause I'm afraid to get up. (announcer) WHILE HIS WIFE HAD COMPLETELY Lost her patience. All right, now I'm getting mad! (announcer) AND LASTLY, CHEF RAMSAY TRAVELS To montclair, new jersey, to get an update on leone's... (Gordon) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES CAN WE CONTINUE To serve food. I'm sad to say that we're closing down leone's for the night. (announcer) WHERE A LAZY OWNER... Major problem here is there's no manager, nobody in control of this restaurant. It's hard for me to really show passion. (announcer) WAS RUINING A RESTAURANT THAT His mother had worked so hard to build. We've already drowned. (announcer) GET READY FOR A NIGHT OF SURPRISING Updates... Can I talk about that? (announcer) AS WE FIND OUT WHO STAYED On the road to success and who veered off, turning a restaurant back into a nightmare. Oh, I'm pissed off. [aggressive surf music] What is that? You're serving rotten food! We could possibly kill them. 

[00:02:00]


Then wake up! You wake up! [coughs] SHUT THE PLACE DOWN! Get out of here! That is amazing! I can't take anymore. Thank you, chefs. As soon as I leave a restaurant, I'm always wondering whether or not they stuck to the plan, and I know you do, also. Tonight, I'm going to show you three restaurants I visited last year, and you're going to be surprised at what I found out. First up, cafe hon, in baltimore. Hampden, maryland, a suburb of baltimore. When I first arrived, I visited a local radio station to find out restaurant owner denise whiting was at war with the community. She had trademarked the term "hon," which is a cultural icon of baltimore. She was threatening businesses with lawsuits. The lawsuits? I mean, it went that far? She demanded legal fees from somebody that was making tourist stuff with just the word "hon" on it. (Gordon) AFTER FINDING OUT WHAT I WAS IN For... I mean, she's almost become the anti-hon. Yes. (Gordon) IT WAS TIME TO GO TO CAFE HON AND Actually meet the owner. All right. I want everybody's attention. Can I have everybody's attention? (Gordon) BUT, BEFORE I MADE IT INSIDE, I Was faced with a giant-- and I mean a giant-- pink flamingo. Holy mackerel. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. I'd hoped that the restaurant wasn't on its last leg as well. I desperately needed to hear denise's side of the story. (Denise) THE PROBLEM IS, I FEDERALLY REGISTERED "The hon" as a-- as a trademark. People scream at me from across the street. Just horrible things. It's got that bad? I mean, I was afraid for my life. Did you not sue anyone? I never sued anybody. You didn't sue anybody? No. Did you threaten to sue anybody? No. (Gordon) BUT DENISE WASN'T TELLING ME THE Truth. I've done my homework before I got here. I did-- i--you know wha- see, you're not being fair now. (Gordon) AFTER SETTING HER STRAIGHT, The next step for me was to taste the food. Then I met my lovely server, amanda. 

[00:04:01]


Amanda, love the hair. Beautiful. (Amanda) THANK YOU. And, oh, boy. Her hair was hon-derful. Wow. Look at you. They sure do love their hairspray in baltimore. The batter's soggy. It doesn't stick to the fish. Sadly, the food was atrocious. It's like a flamingo turd just landed on my plate. It's dreadful. And then these stone cold shrimp. Horrible. He said the shrimp tastes-- had, like, a weird aftertaste to it, like, almost tasted like the refrigerator. (Denise) REALLY? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. This is peect. Perfect? Trust me, they were far from perfect. And I could tell already I was gonna have my hands full with denise. That night, at dinner service... This is asparagus. All right? I'm tired of seeing the asparagus different kinds of ways. You cut off the ends... Oh, my god. And you blanche them. (Gordon) I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW DENISE RAN Her restaurant. Any turkey on the board, eighty-six the turkey. She was eighty-sixing the whole fricking menu. Eighty-six biscuits, you guys. Item... (Denise) EIGHTY-SIX THE POT PIE. After item... Eighty-six the catfish. After item. Eighty-six the french fries. I thought she was going to eighty-six me next. (Denise) EIGHTY-SIX THE STEAK. We don't have steak. Oh, my god. I'm going to die. (Gordon) THAT WAS A DISASTER. How could you let it go this far? After seeing how bad a leader denise was, I decided to talk to her staff about her behavior. She goes up to one-- to the girls, and tells them they're stupid, or she gets up to my face, "tell her to fix her hair." She focuses on a lot of the superficial things. She micromanages. (Gordon) IT WAS CLEAR THAT Her very loyal staff were deeply affected by her actions. It was time to confront denise. Denise, you, um... You're a rude bitch. Ouch. And I'm tired of it. Denise, you're the negative in the restaurant. People don't like you. (Gordon) THEY DID NOT HOLD BACK, 

[00:06:02]


But that is exactly what denise needed to hear. (Denise) I'M SORRY THAT I'VE BEEN A bit overbearing. To lose this business would be for me to lose my soul. And I can only say that this is the beginning of a new day. (Gordon) DENISE'S APOLOGY WAS A STEP IN THE Right direction. But the bigger issue was her relationship with her community. So I hatched a plan. I put together a select group of people that I'd like you to hear from. Okay. (Gordon) OKAY? Please, jump in the car. That's it. Denise was forced to listen. She pushes everyone around. She's focused on denise whiting. And if you don't like it, you're going to be sorry. What would it take for this community to embrace cafe hon again? She has to walk away from the trademark. She has to abandon it. She has to abandon it? Give up all claim to it, say it was a mistake. She does not own it. (Gordon) DENISE HAD A BIG DECISION TO MAKE. Give up the hon trademark, or lose your restaurant. Would she do the right thing? I am so sorry for the animosity and the hatred and everything that trademarking a word, just a word, has done. Please forgive me. (Reagan) THAT MUST HAVE TAKEN A lot of courage, to say that. But you never said you were going to give the trademark back. Yes. (Rn) WOW. THIS IS AMAZING. That's kind of stunning. (Gordon) AFTER GETTING DENISE'S COMMITMENT To change, we were ready to relaunch cafe hon with a new decor... Oh, my god. (Gordon) A NEW MENU... Mm. That's delicious. Really good. (Gordon) AND AN OWNER With a new attitude. Great job. You're doing awesome. 

[00:08:03]


John, thank you. Johnny, beautiful. (Gordon) CAFE HON WAS WELL ON ITS WAY To becoming a fixture in the community once again. These are fantastic. I've been given a great gift, and an amazing opportunity, and I will be forever grateful. Last year, if you wanted to see an angry owner at war with the community, then trust me, cafe hon in baltimore was guaranteed fireworks. Personally, I felt like I was negotiating a treaty as opposed to fixing a restaurant. I'm now back to find out, is there peace? (announcer) COMING UP, Has denise repai her relationship with her staff and her community? Have we got good news, bad news? She wasn't sincere when she apologized. (Gordon) OH, NO. (announcer) OR HAS SHE GONE BACK To being t tyrant of baltimore? (Denise) YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD SOME ISSUES, And it's not a surprise to anybody.

And we've got a special guest this morning. As you may have been reading in the papers, gordon ramsay's back in town. Yeah, we're going to see what baltimore thinks about cafe hon now. Hi, guys. Welcome back to baltimore. Thank you so much. Likewise, good to see you guys. Good to see you again. I'm so happy to be back. Now, the word on the street, cafe hon. Have we got good news, bad news, in between? Good news. (Gordon) GOOD NEWS. The good news is, there's not a lot of news. Okay. Which is really good for denise. So it's not people just violently angry at her anymore. Right, great. There are still people who say she wasn't sincere when she apologized. Right. There are still people who say, "oh, she didn't give up the trademark." She did give up the trademark. We know that for a fact. 100%. So there are people that just aren't going to be won over. But I think the majority of people have come around. (Jojo) THINGS ARE BACK TO NORMAL In that neighborhood, and everything's going okay. And just as importantly, the restaurant. Has anyone been? Any feedback? My wife and I were there a couple of days ago. (Gordon) OH, GOOD. (Reagan) WE HAD THE CRAB CAKE. We had the chicken pot pie. It was good. Right. I saw denise. There was a resurgence in her that I hadn't seen. That was nice to see. Good. Yes. So you're going to head over and talk to her? Yep. Good to see you both. Good to see you. Chef gordon ramsay, thanks for joining us this morning on the jojo and reagan show. Keep up the great work. Thank you, guys. (Gordon) THAT PINK FLAMINGO. They haven't gotten rid of that. Look at you two. Welcome back, gordon. Nice to see you. Are you well? How are you, my darling? I'm great. Whoa, dear. Thank you. Thank you. First of all, this place is heaving. (Denise) IT'S WONDERFUL. (Gordon) LET'S HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES Together somewhere quieter. Let's go over there at the bar in the corner. Wow. That is crazy in there. You look great, by the way. 

[00:14:05]


Thank you. I brought you a little present. Can I open it? (Gordon) PLEASE. I'm dying to see what you think. I thought, because you kept the big one on the outside-- [laughs] I'd bring you something a little bit more intimate. Thank you. It's good to see you, darling. (Denise) IT JUST SEEMED SO SPECIAL. Made me think he was thinking about me other than when he's here. How are you personally? [sighs] WONDERFUL. Don't get upset. I know. Come on. I know. I'm just so grateful. Last time, you cried for a different reason. I have people scream at me from across the street, just horrible things. It's got that bad? I mean, I was afraid for my life. This time, you know-- it's happy cry. It's a happy cry. I felt like, for a whole year and a half, I couldn't be part of the community. Sure. And as soon as we did the relaunch, I went right to a community meeting that monday. And then I just started getting more involved in the community. Which is music to my ears. You know, it's like the restaurant is one thing, but-- I know. Come here. Come here, come here, you. Honestly. As soon as I rejoined the community, I really felt like the weight of the world had been lifted off my shoulders, and I could be me again. Business in general, since I last saw you-- where are we? Since the relaunch, business picked up about 20%. Good. We're still working to regain people's trust and get them coming back again. But we've gotten a lot of new people in the door. And that's-- and people that said, "oh, we stopped coming, and now we're coming again." Good. The food, the service. How are you feeling there? I've been kindoverseeing things a little bit more. Oh, no. But I've been really good. 'Cause, remember, last time, it was interference. It was just negative. Oh, come on, really? What's this, dottie? (Denise) WHY IS IT SITTING THERE? Is this for something? Listen, you look great. The restaurant sounds amazing. Thank you. I'd like you to do something special for me now. Go and cook me a special. I'm dying to taste the food. Okay. 

[00:16:05]


Go to it. Surprise me. (Denise) OKAY. Hi. Hi. Oh, good to see you. (Gordon) LET'S SIT DOWN, HAVE A CATCH UP. How are you, my darling? Hi. You look great. Good to see you. Thank you. Your hair looks amazing. Thanks for the compliment, chef ramsay. I'm dying to ask. How's she been? This is real? It's the truth. Good. And she's not coming in, nitpicking-- no, she's not picking on us. Bitch festing? No. Giving asparagus lessons in the middle of service? Could I have everybody's attention? This is asparagus, all right? (Denise) YOU CUT OFF THE ENDS-- Oh, my god. And you blanche them. That's happened again, I'll have you know. Oh, you're kidding me. But she walked away, gordon. She walked away. (Gordon) SHE WALKED AWAY. Is she still eighty-sixing things? Eighty-six the turkey. Eighty-six the french fries. Eighty-six the catfish. No. Now it's not like that. Now they don't have a reason to hate her. It's-- it is a lot easier for us. Good. How much has she changed? A lot. (Gordon) IS SHE SUPPORTING YOU MORE? She is, and she's also staying home more. She cooked for us, she waited on us. Good. The management got invited home for dinner? Yeah, yes. To her house. (Gordon) WOW. To her house? Denise is a lot easier to talk to. She's more receptive to our comments. She's turned it around. She really has. Now, what is that? It's a guacamole burger. A guacamole burger. Nice. (Gordon) LOOK AT THAT. They love the burgers. Wow. That's delicious. Is it good? (Denise) I GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO COOK FOR Chef ramsay and he really likes it? That makes me feel really good. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm so pleased to see the delight on denise whiting's face, the fact that, not only is she a part of the community again, but you as the locals feel part of this restaurant, as well. Incredible. Thank you.

We don't know what's missing. Customers. I think our food is better than the area's food around here. It's quality, it's fresh. Right. And I stand behind our food. I could tell they were really in love with their food. So what's wrong with the restaurant? I don't agree with the way he runs the kitchen. There's not enough business. This is-- (Dina) THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. (Gordon) AND HIS WIFE WAS SO FRUSTRATED With him and their business. The issue is, you can't better your business the way you're running it. I'm trying.

I mean, come on. While waiting for my lunch, I decided to have a little walk around. What's that? You're kidding me. And what did I discover? A full-blown gym. [grunts] OH [bleep]! Man! What is this guy doing? Tommy? He's in your office. Oh, god. Do you work out in here? Yeah. So what's this? That wasn't me. It wasn't me. There's holes in the wall. He's punched some holes in the walls. He'll say it wasn't him. It was. (Tommy) THAT WASN'T ME. MAN! That wasn't me. And that on the wall there? (Tommy) THAT'S MY GOLF WALL. [bleep]. Not only was it a gym, it was a driving range as well. Fore! That's a shank. Okay. Back to the food. Veal sinatra. Thank you, darling. Man. That's dreadful. It's just chewy. Okay. Let's get one thing straight. The food was not good. That's ghastly. What a disgusting combination. It's like someone's thrown up on my plate. Tommy and dina failed to see that. I still stand by my food. I still stand by our food. The food was disgusting. Well, i-i disagree with that. That's your opinion. Come on! Uh, hello? Can somebody say denial? No. I'm not in denial. You are gonna have to get your head out of your ass. And it went downhl from there. (Gordon) PHILIPPE, HELLO? It's just all swimming in oil. And you weren't going to say anything. But hey, tommy! Throughout dinner, tommy avoided the problem. All right. Tommy, I think you need to go back in the back and check on your cooks. (Gordon) HE LITERALLY RAN AWAY FROM THE PROBLEMS... All right, now I'm getting mad. (Gordon) AND DINA HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO STEP In. Put it up, let's go! I don't know what youse are doing! Give me table ten and give me the pasta special. All right. Here you go. Dysfunctional owners and a dysfunctional kitchen. 

[00:27:03]


I knew if there was any hope of saving tommy, I needed the help of his family-- THE DOUBLE Ds, DINA AND DENAY. I came by here this morning to talk about tommy. We need to get him back. Hey, good morning. Ah. Take a seat. Listen, I love you. I know you love me, babe. I want you back. (Tommy) I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I WAS. In my whole life I've been-- you have to get that person. You gotta reach inside, tommy, and pull it out. We want you to be happy. We love you. We can make great changes, but unless you're back-- it ain't gonna work, I know. I want to fight, yeah. Okay, good. Dina and denay were able to build up his confidence, and finally we were getting somewhere. Tommy was ready for change. The next day, we relaunched chiarella's. (Tommy) COME ON, COME ON. Let's go tonight, guys. Let's go. Come on. (Gordon) IT WAS NOW UP TO TOMMY TO PROVE To everyone he can run his restaurant... How we lookin' here? How we lookin' here? Coming right now, table 20.

it's great to be back in south philly. I'm on my way to chiarella's, an italian restaurant run by tommy and dina defino. Now, last time I was here tommy was so depressed. And dina, she was just a nervous wreck. We made some substantial changes, not just to the restaurant but to the owners as well. I'm back to check in, and hopefully they've kept up that momentum. Hello. Hello! Wow! How are you? Wonderful. Good to see you. Wonderful. Good to see you. Are you well? Yeah, I'm well. You well? Look at this place. (Dina) YEAH, IT'S BEEN BUMPING. (Gordon) THE ATMOSPHERE IS AMAZING. How have you been? Good. Yeah? Yeah. You're quiet. You seem calm. Last time I saw you, you were a nervous wreck. And it was almost like you hated being here. Yeah. It was very stressful. How's the business been?20% better. Wow. So 20% up, which is great news, positive. How do we take it to another level. How do you get up 40%? Um, I think a liquor license. That's what we're working on. Oh, you've been saving? Yeah. Just imagine what the business could do 

[00:33:42]


if it did have that liquor license. We're getting there. Once we get that liquor license, we'll be able to be open later, have a happy hour. We'll be, like, set. And how's the relationship between you and tommy? I don't agree with the way he runs the kitchen. 'Cause you can't better your business the way you're running it. I didn't think she felt like that. On a scale of one to ten. Ten. Ten, seriously? Ten. Seriously. Good. And his confidence is back? Yeah. Thank god. Where is he? I think he's down this way. Once we changed in here... Let me get him. Tommy transitioned into a new person. All right, bobby. Table five, we need five and six. Make the salads up, all right? HOW MANY SOUPS YOU NEED? (Gordon) TOMMY! How many soups? I need 15.

I could do it a couple times, but I'm hurt. Okay. Let me see. All right. I'm gonna do it easy for you. Look at that. Okay, good. IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH? (Gordon) YOU'RE STILL In great shape. I'm telling you. I walk in, the place is buzzing. Last time I was here, it was more than 20% down. You're now 20% up, saving for a liquor license. Yes. So you're putting enough money away each month to save for that? I am starting. We were still-- we're still behind. I mean, you know, the electric and the gas and all that goes first. But we were up from last year, and that's what I look at. 

[00:35:42]


Just as long as we're up, it's positive. Exactly. There seems more control, less anger. Are you happier inside? Definitely. [laughs] CAN'T YOU SEE? I'm definitely-- from before, I'm emotionally in a way better place, way better. You need to get back to work. That place is full up there. I miss you, man. It's not easy to find your manhood when things are going bad, and he put it back for me. Come on. Ahh! Hi! I know, me too. Are you well? I'm well. I'm real well. The place is busy. Yeah, it's been good. I actually like coming to work now. You do? Yeah. I'm so pleased to hear that. Yeah. Tommy looks less stressed. Is he better? Yeah. He's a lot better. Is he? Oh, my god, yeah. He learned how to take control of his business without letting the business take control of him. And that's the biggest change in tommy. Thank you, my darling. You're welcome. Lasagna. That looks amazing. And your chicken piccata. Wow. Tommy, sit down. That looks fantastic. Dina, take a seat, my darling. I'm dying to taste this. When was this made? Today. Today? It's fresh, fresh, fresh. That is delicious-- really, really good indeed. Last time I was here, he was walking around with his head in the sand. You were still giving your food ten out of ten. And I stand behind our food. (Gordon) THE FOOD WAS DISGUSTING. How are you feeling now? I feel that now it's ten out of ten. And I'm happy now. And I'm happy because he's happy. With tommy and I working together, running a business together, raising a family together, we were more confident together. This is the happiest that tommy and I have been, because we're able to communicate better. And I'm not, um, sugarcoatin' anything. Coming back and seeing exactly where both of you are now, it makes me really proud. I want you to really succeed. So I'm personally going to make a contribution... Get out of here. To you both to help get that liquor license. SERIOUSLY. [laughter] We can be 20% up now without the liquor license, get that liquor license-- we're on the road. 

[00:37:45]


Chef ramsay is a great guy, and he couldn't have helped us any more, I couldn't possibly have thought. But for him to make a contribution towards a liquor license is, like, just awesome. It really is. Brilliant. Well, good to see you both. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Chef ramsay coming in here has been more than a life-changing experience. It's been unbelievable. And he really is 100% behind me, which is a great feeling. It's a great feeling. All right, listen. Keep it up, will you? Yes, definitely. Yeah? Seriously? Yes. Well done. Thank you. Okay, bud, look after yourself. Thank you from here, seriously. Take care. Easy one. And listen-- and stop putting those holes in the wall. Ah, man. Okay. Take care. Thank you, chef. I love you. Wow. I am so surprised. I mean, I had my doubts about tommy, but he has really stepped up and taken the bull by the horns. And now he's in control of his business. And dina, she is completely transformed. And as a couple, they're united stronger than ever before. And I really believe that chiarella's now is on its way to being back on top where it belongs. (announcer) COMING UP, CHEF RAMSAY GOES BACK To new jersey, where michael went from the laziest owner to a hard-working manager. I need one cod and one orecchiette. (announcer) FIND OUT IF HE'S STILL LEADING His restaurant... That's so sad. I'm so disappointed. (announcer) OR HAS HIS OLD HABIT RESURFACED? That's coming up on kitchen nightmares revisited. barking ]

(Gordon) MONTCLAIR, NEW JERSEY, Home to italian restaurant leone's, run a mother and son, michael and rose leone. We owe 1,400 for the meat, overdue for the past month. What are you gonna do, michael? You tell me. What do you want me to do? (Gordon) WHEN I FIRST WALKED INTO THE RESTAURANT.. And what's that thing there? That's my old television that I watch all the games on. You watch games on there? Yes, sir. I was absolutely stunned by what I saw. Do you think that's a good impression when the customers walk in for the first time? Michael just seemed clueless-- a lazy owner. Watching telly was bad enough, but the decor was just as hideous. Oh, my god. Is that a baby? Yes. (Gordon) I MEAN, THEY SAY THAT THERE'S NEVER An ugly baby. I think I just found one. BUT THAT'S NOT YOU, IS IT? (Michael) NO, Sir. 

[00:43:47]


How are you? How are you? It's good to see you, sweet. But then there was mama rose. Likewise-- oh, yeah, nice. Chef ramsay's hot. I've been married three times. I need number four. She was quite a character. I can't start to even think about turning this place around until I get to the bottom of the issues. The major problem here is there's no manager, there are no--nobody in control of this restaurant. I take care of payroll, I take care of receiving... Payroll? Doing the menus. Wow. Poor mama rose. She depended on michael to run the restaurant. Basically the staff is running this restaurght now. I-i disagree. He wasn't running anything, except maybe his mouth. Are you here every day? Except monday, yeah, I'm here every day. So you're here six days a week, across those six days a week you're in here, you're here what, 12, 14 hours a day? NO, NO, NO. (Gordon) HOW MANY? I work the dinner shift-- from like 5:00 to 10:00, 5:00 to 11:00. So five hours a day? How many of them do you sit down? DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION? (Gordon) ROUGHLY. Three. So you're on your feet for two hours a day? Yes. Holy crap. In order to get the whole picture, I decided to order the whole menu. Oh, my god. Holy crap. How many items on the menu? Over a hundred. A hundred? I mean physically, the appearance-- oh, come on, guys. Could I have a knife and fork, please? AND MAYBE A BAG-- A [bleep] SICK BAG. And while the dishes looked awful... There's no seasoning in there. Everything's bland-- bland. It's bland. The pasta's bland. They tasted even worse. Aah. DIRT. IT'S LIKE A [bleep] FLIP-FLOP. Now, are you crunching grits? Yes, yes. You think it's good? I had heard enough. Michael was clearly delusional. Be back later, yeah? I'd like to catch a plane out of here right now. Even though I wanted to leave for good, I came back for dinner. What is at? Big mistake. (Michael) I THINK IT'S VEAL, CHEF. YOU THINK 

[00:45:47]


It's veal? Pretty sure it's veal. You didn't put it in there? It looks like meat thrown in a pan. (Michael) BUT WHAT IS IT, THOUGH? I don't know. And it's not labeled. How could you not know? Stuffed what? Mushrooms. Smell that. Smell it! THAT [bleep] OLDER THAN ME. Smell it! Go on! I'd seen enough. The kitchen was so disgusting, I had no choice but to... Shut the place down! Under no circumstances can we continue to serve food. I'M [bleep] EMBARRASSED. Everybody, I'm sad to say, and embarrassed to say, that we're closing down leone's for the night. Leone's never been shut down. I'm very embarrassed by it. Probably won't sleep tonight over this. I'm angry at myself. I think as the boss of the restaurant, it was just irresponsible. We're gonna turn this ship around. My mother put in almost 20 years of her life into this place-- her spirit, her money. I'm crushed that I let her down. And I want to make good, but the truth is, I don't know if I can turn it around. And it's a scary feeling, it really is. Come on. So, with michael's eyes finally open, we spent some valuable time in the kitchen together. A touch olive oil on there, salt and pepper. Cooked on the bone. Why do we cook it on the bone? More flavor. Right. Get that pan nice and hot. How do you know when the oil is ready, chef? A light smoke coming off there. It's got the sear in there. Wow. Mmm. That is unbelievable, huh? (Gordon) IT JUST MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. I think it's time for a change. And I want to be the best italian restaurant in town. (Gordon) FOR THE FIRST TIME, I SAW THIS LAZY Owner making a positive change. Then I knew he was ready to run his restaurant. You may recognize him from sitting on his ass outside watching television. But that guy's gone now. We have a new michael. Let's go. With a new, modern look, a concise menu... We ready to order? Michael stepped up and not only surprised his staff... Right now listen. I need one pork belly, one cod, and one orecchiette. And then we'll worry about everything else. 

[00:47:48]


But that I need now. Yes, sir. But his mother too. Are you happy? Yeah, I'm very happy. Look after your son. I will. Michael proved with hard work he can run leone's. Three important words that I need you to remember, stay the course. Stay the course, chef. I can't hear you. Chef, in my restaurant I'm gonna stay the course. Good. I'm back in new jersey hoping that he's kept his promise, or has reverted back to his old lazy ways. (announcer) NEXT, CHEF RAMSAY GETS TO THE Bottom of what's going on at leone's. Truly, honestly? (announcer) YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS WHAT'S Coming up. Unfortunately, here's the bad news. Ziplogic. We throw out over $500 in food every year. Help save more of it WITH Ziploc Freezer Bags FEATURING SmartZip. Edge to edge protection you can hear. GET Ziploc. AND GET MORE OUT OF IT. [ Female Announcer ] S.C. Johnson. A FAMILY Company. 

[00:51:10]


I'm back in montclair, new jersey to check on the italian restaurant leone's, run by owner mama rose, and her son michael. Last time I was here, all mama rose wanted was for her son to step up and actually run the business. It almost didn't happen, but we finally turned him into a leader. Time to check in if he's continued to make his mother proud. How are you? Hey! Welcome back. Good to see you. Good to see you, sir. Wow, this place is busy. Yes, sir. Love the buzz. That's good. Well, let's step through there and have a little catch up. I'm very excited to see chef ramsay today, and tell him about the progress we've made in the restaurant, and all the beautiful changes we have here at leone's. First things first. Where's the television? That's my old television that I watch all the games on. Seriously? I promise you the day you left, there was no television here. No television? In the entire restaurant, my word. How have you been? I've been doing well. As soon as you left, the buzz around the neighborhood and the food was fantastic. Right. The new dishes flew off the menu. Good. I wake up energized. I'm going to restaurant supply houses, buying all the fresh ingredients. Looking up new recipes, trying new things with me and my cooks. There's a better, stronger relationship there. That's fantastic. I started a delivery campaign. You started a campaign? Yes, sir. I did a menu, mailed 'em out to the surrounding towns, and it's been very beneficial. You have been busy. So this is a complete revolution. You are so much more hands-on now than you ever were before, right? Oh, huge. Big difference, night and day. Dina, is he lazy? Yes. John, is he lazy? Yes, chef. I feel like it's finally my business, and I'm not running my mother's business. That's fantastic. That's absolutely fantastic. And where's the business sitting now? It's probably up 40% since last time. 40%? You are working hard. Yes, sir. I gave you my word. This is a new michael. Energized michael. Unbelievable. Yeah, energized. I mean, you are seriously energized. Yeah. AH, WHAT A LOVELY SURPRISE. [laughs] Hello, my darling. Hi. How are you-- you look great! Thank you. Look at you. Oh, my goodness me. 

[00:53:10]


Come over. I've missed you. I've missed you. You've lost weight. 75 pounds. That's incredible. Well done. Stop, come on. I'm a year older. Hot! You don't want to go chasing men at 45 years of age. [laughter] Michael, I'm hungry. I shall make you something. Good. Welcome back to leone's. How are you? Good to see you. Are you well? Good to see you again. You look great. Yes, I'm great. Thank you. Have you got two minutes? Yes, absolutely. Mama rose looks amazing. She looks fabulous. God bless her. Michael, he told me he's here first thing in the morning, he's here last thing at night. Is he really working that hard? He still shows up at his usual time, 5:30-6:00. Oh, no. Oh, no. Back to the beginning? Why is he lying to me? Maybe he's scared. Unreal. Hello, my darling. How are you? Hi. How are you? I was good, until I just heard that. What? Take a seat, please. I had a chat with michael around the corner, and he told me he's working so hard. What time's he coming in? He comes in at 6:00-6:30. Wow. Wow.6:30. Yeah. I mean, crazy. You can't run a business by coming in at 6:30. You have to set that example to the staff. Is he helping with payroll? No. He doesn't do any of it. Damn. Inventory? No, nothing. No. WHAT [bleep]. So he's not stepping up? We're here at 9:00 today. We swept the floor, we mopped the floors. We set it up. Bloody hell. It's so annoying. And he--he was physically the last one in here. Honestly? AND HE FOUND TVs ACROSS THE STREET. HE FOUND TVs ACROSS THE STREET? WHAT DO YOU Mean? Yeah, at the bar-- in the bar. OH, [bleep]. So he goes across to the sports bar to watch tv? Yeah, yeah. OH, NO. (Trudy) OH, YES. He's still michael. He's still michael? Oh, trudy, honestly? 

[00:55:10]


Yeah. That's so sad. You can paint stripes on a horse, but that doesn't make it a zebra. Like, just because you gave us a little face lift-- he's still the same person underneath. (Trudy) I MEAN, WE ALL LOVE MICHAEL. But unless he steps up, he could destroy it. I'm so disappointed. He did not stay the course. Oh, my god. Oh, I'm pissed off. He needs somebody to tell him what to do. Right. Leave it to me. Thank you. I appreciate the catch-up. I'm hoping gordon ramsay will be able to help michael and maybe give michael another kick. Because michael needs another kick. Okay, chef. Today we have a mozzarella and caprese. (Gordon) NICE. And our homemade eggplant parmesan. Wow. Thank you. Enjoy, sir. Thank you. What a difference. What a difference. WHAT THE [bleep] IS THAT? OH, MY GOD. THE CHILIS--[coughing] Modern, clean, tasty. Are you that involved in the kitchen now? Yes. These are both my dishes, so hope you enjoy them, yeah. That is delicious. That's good news. Unfortunately, here's some bad news. Whilst I'm excited about the buzz, business being up 40%, delivery is working brilliantly... I've just heard from john and trudy. Everything you told me about working so much harder is not what they think. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WHY [bleep] ME THROUGH There? I DIDN'T [bleep], CHEF. Listen, you're notanning up. You changed course the day I left. What time do you come in every day?4:30-5:00. Trudy's saying sometimes it's 6:30. On certain days, chef, not every day. On any day... Mm-hmm. 

[00:57:12]


You've got to be here before the staff. How many times have I said that? Are you scheduling the payroll? Are you helping out with those? No. I kept that as it is. Right now, chef, I'm just more concentrating on the food, the atmosphere-- you cannot concentrate on the food when you walk in at 6:30 in the evening. Mama rose, I'm sorry, but I'm disappointed. You have to be tough. You need to be a leader. You need to be in here before your staff. You need to show that commitment. They're loyal members that have been here for a long time. They don't hate you, they just want a commitment from you. I'm sorry, mama rose. I'm sure you've got work to do. I'm not impressed, michael. Up to now I haven't been staying the course. It's very hard to admit that in front of my mom. I should be more hands-on with the food, with the specials, with the servers, and the overall business. Chef, I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. There is areas I could really concentrate and put more time in. I didn't want to say it in front of my mother. I don't want to make her any more nervous than she is. But I really want to tell you that you are right. I could put definitely more commitment into this restaurant and do a better job. I feel like I'm letting you down. I know, but there's-- there's a lazy streak in you when things are going well. That's when you've gotta work harder. I set an example that I've gotta work harder than my staff. Jump back in there, and nail it. Yes, sir. Please? You have my word. I want to make you proud. Don't let me down. And don't let yourself down, and don't let your mother down. You got it. Okay. Take care. Thank you for coming back, chef. Excellent. I believe that chef ramsay gave me a little bit of tough love today 'cause he really does want me to succeed. He doesn't want to coddle me. He wants me to keep on driving and going forward. Damn. I'm a little surprised to hear michael slipped back to some of these old habits. And his staff clearly need more help. And with that mall opening up shortly, business is going to continue to grow. So my only hope now, he steps up and leads leone's on a path to success. But more importantly, god bless mama rose. (announcer) IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED, Michael kept his promise to chef ramsay, and is putting in more hours at the restaurant. Now, only time will tell if he will stick to his word. 

[00:59:14]


If chef ramsay visits again, he's gonna see a more committed michael that's more in tune with his staff. I'm gonna make him proud and make this business succeed. Three restaurants, three different stories, but so far, all on the road to success. In the restaurant business, you're never out of the woods. The good news is they are all heading in the right direction. Good night. (male announcer) NEXT TIME ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES... Chef ramsay heads to a boston restaurant owned by two sisters. Shut your face! (announcer) THIS DUO BLAME THE STAFF FOR All their problems. Whose fault is that? Yours! No, it's yours! (announcer) AND THE STAFF BLAMES THE OWNERS. This business is not under my name. It's under both of your names. (announcer) CAN CHEF RAMSAY SAVE THIS VOLATILE Restaurant?

Come on, we're gonna be late. I can't go any quicker! Stop it! Come on! Richard B. Starkey and his Aunt Jessica are always arguing about one thing or another. Oh, I'm going! Oh, go! Go on! And what with today being Sunday and the weather looking up, you'd think they'd have given it a rest. For goodness' sake, stop sitting down! All right, all right, what's your hurry? But no -- on and on they go. "Good morning," said Richard. "Good afternoon, sir," said the courier. They were late. JESSICA: 'Allo, Flo, you all right, girl? I'll sit 'ere. RICHARD: Yes, I'll have the window seat. JESSICA: All right, so you'll have the window seat! Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Welcome to Magical Mystery Tours! I am your courier, Jolly Jimmy Johnson!

All my friends call me Jolly Jimmy -- and you are all my friends! Over here is your hostess -- that lovely, delightful, delectable... Wendy Winters! Lovely girl, lovely! And over here, our driver for the trip, that wonderful driver, we hope... Ha ha ha! Alf! Off you go, Alf! Here we go nowlendid! Fasten your safety belts, please. Away-way-way we go! Away we go, Alf, splendid! Very comfy in the back there, is it? Lovely. I say it's lovely. Get your popcorn out! Ha ha! Right hand down. There we are, splendid. And away we go. Anyway, I'll tell you something, you ain't coming away with me anymore. Who bought the tickets for this trip? I did! Yeah, with my money. I gave you the money. I'm taking you out. You're not taking me anywhere. I gave you the money, darling. Remember that. And you've done nothing but eye all the fellas on the coach since we got here. Shut your cakehole! I dunno, since Uncle Jack died, you've never been the same. Of course, 'cause I ain't got Uncle Jack, have I? I remember him. I remember him. If I ain't got him, I've got to get somebody else. You should know, you're old enough at 21! You should do a bit of knitting, do you good. Who for? You? Should I knit for you? No, don't knit for me. [C horn blares] Who is that man? Oh, that's Mr Bloodvessel. He's quite harmless. He comes on all the trips. He thinks he's a courier. Last trip, he thought he was the driver. PAUL: Well, you know, when I saw your first film, I really thought you had something, but it was -- WOMAN: I was only about 6, then. PAUL: Wasn't it "Blue Lady"? "Lady in Blue"? Something like that. WOMAN: How old are you? PAUL: I myself am 30... but I look a little younger due to the Fair Isle sweater. Excuse me, sir. I'd like to take a photograph of the young

??? Day after day     Alone on a hill       The man with the foolish grin       Is keeping perfectly still       But nobody wants to know him       They can see that he's just a fool       And he never gives an answer       But the fool on the hill       Sees the sun going down       And the eyes in his head       See the world spinning round       Well on the way       Head in a cloud       The man of a thousand voices      Talking perfectly loud       But nobody ever hears him       Or the sound he appears to make       And he never seems to notice       But the fool on the hill       Sees the sun going down       And the eyes in his head       See the world spinning round       And nobody seems to like him       They can tell what he wants to do    

[00:10:13]

As the bus leaves the town behind and heads for the country, everything begins to change. Well, almost everything. And already the magic is beginning to work. [Bugle blows] [Speaking nonsense] Ha ha!

Beyond the blue horizon, far above the clouds... in a land that no-one knows... live four or five magicians who spend their days casting wonderful spells. Come with me now into that secret place whthe eyes of man have never set foot. Where's the bus? Where's the bus? Shh! Where's the bus? It's coming. Where's the bus?! The bus?

The bus is ten miles north on the Dewsbury road. Oh! It's only ten miles away. Bus... ten miles! So be here. [ECHOING] The bus, 10 miles away... Oh, ladies and gentlemen, quickly, look to your left! Now there you see the ancient Roman ruins. Now they really have been there an awful long time. They are, in fact, a little difficult to see because they're almost flattened to the ground... Meanwhile, back on the bus, things are happening -- and life lobbles on. Indeed, the magic is so powerful that even Mr Bloodvessel emerges from his shell. He turns to speak. If I may take the liberty, Mister... Be my guest. Give over! My dear lady... My dear lady, doesn't intuition tell you what I feel? Don't interrupt. You bring out my... I... love you! [String symphony plays "All My Loving"] [Gulls crying, symphony continues] Love you! Love you!

(grunts) I mean, "Ah!" Welcome! Today's episodes are all about danger. Danger is when something happens where someone might get hurt. So watch out for all the words about courage and danger, words like "hero," "guard," "protect," "brave" and... Ooh! Hot dog! "Hot dog" isn't a danger word. May I? No? 
(cartoon music plays) 
MARTHA: No. Nope. 
(channels changing) Not that. 
HELEN: That looks g... Uh-uh. Okay. No chance. Oh, that... No way. Okay... Life's too short. No! I wonder if this happens to everyone when their dogs get the remote. Ah! This looks intriguing. That's Courageous Collie Carlo. 
(chorus sings dramatic theme song) "Courageous" must mean good looking. Whoo! Check out the coat on him. Carlo's got nice hair, but courageous means he's not scared of danger. What danger? I'd call that danger. 
(gasps) 
(panting and grunting) The cellar door is stuck! The tornado's coming! We can't escape! We're in danger! Danger frightens me. 
(screams) 
(grunts) 
(barks) 
(screams) 
MARTHA: Oh, no! Carlo didn't get to the cellar in time. This'd be a bad time for Carlo to want to lick his nose. Shh! He might get hurt. He's in danger! Bite down, Carlo! We escaped harm because Carlo saved us. Thank you, Courageous Collie Carlo. 

[00:04:09]


(barks) Wow, Carlo is so strong and brave. I wish I could be like him. Martha, it's a TV show. It's not real. Carlo is so inspiring... 
(dramatic march plays) 
CHORUS: ?????? She's Mighty Mutt Martha ?????? ?????? She's come to rescue you ?????? ?????? She'll pull you out of danger ?????? ?????? And says, "You're welcome," too! ?????? 
(cracking and rumbling) 
(gasps) 
(cheering) 
GIRL: I lost my balloon. 
(sobbing): Oh no! Thank you so much! 
WOMAN: Oh, I need help! Red five on the black six. Thank you, Mighty Mutt Martha! Thank you, Mighty Mutt Martha! You're very welcome. Helen, up until today I've been all talno action, but that's about to change. What do you mean, Marth...? 
CAROLINA: Hey, Helen! Want to go to the Boxwoods' Halloween Spooky House? Unless you're too frightened, like last year. Don't be afraid. Mighty Mutt Martha will protect you. That means you're going to take care of me, right? You bet. Okay. With you protecting me, I won't be frightened. Alice said this year their house is extra?super-mega- ultra-very spooky. Um, you know, let's skip it, because... they won't let Martha in. Why wouldn't they? Well, maybe there's no dogs allowed. And I'm a dog? Their cat and parrot are in there, so I'm sure dogs are allowed. 
(cat meows) 
(gasps) A cry for help! I'm off to the rescue! To the rescue? You mean you're going to save someone? Yes! A courageous dog must help anyone in need. If you can believe what you see on TV, and why shouldn't you, right? But what about protecting me? I think Martha's asustada. She's afraid But we're not afraid, right? No. Yes. No! Right. Not afraid. Ooh, I'm in trouble. 

[00:06:34]


(meows) Don't worry. I'm Martha, your local, brave doggie hero come to the rescue. 
(grunts) I'm here-- whoa! Not a strong branch. Don't move. I'll save you. 
(meows) Hey! What was that for? 
(mews) 
(gasping) Oh, dear. 
(barking) Oh, hello, Skits. I'm sort of in troub. Can't getown. 
(barks) Hey! Where are you going? 
(gasping) 
(siren wailing) Oh, how embarrassing... This dog saved you. He came to the fire station and wouldn't stop barking. Then he led us here. He's a hero. Everyone loves a hero. Especially a doggie hero. Put me down, please. Thank you, firefighter. Norouble at all. And thank you, Skits. 
(barks) Yes, Skits, I have seen Courageous Collie Carlo, and no, you're nothing like him. (gasps) Smoke! A fire! A brave dog must save those people from harm! 
(barking) 
(stammers): No, a brave dog! Not you! Me! Slow down! 
(barking) While he's just barking, it's Mighty Mutt Martha to the rescue! Excuse me, ma'am. Saving the day. 
(gagging and coughing) Hey! Why, I ought to... Uh-oh. Uh, you may want to turn down that water pressure, ma'am. It's kind of strong. , I'll never be as heroic as Courageous Collie Carlo. 

[00:08:43]


(chomping) They gave you the hot dogs that fell on the ground for n wrecking their barbecue?! 
(chomping) No, I wouldn't like a hot dog. Oh, I should have stayed with Helen. 
(spooky music playing) Alice, that's so interesting. I'm going back through a third time. Helen, are you ever coming in? Are you scared? Scared? I want to go in, but Alice was telling me about these great breakfasts she makes. Go on, Alice. Well, I put the bread in, push down the handle, then wait. When it pops up, it's toast! You're getting her recipe for toast? But I burn it a lot. Then the smoke alarm goes off and I get in trouble. Just admit you're scared. I am not scared. Are, too. Am not! Are, too! Why do you keep following me? 
(barks) I don't need help. I am going to help people! 
(gasps) Like her! Four-letter word that means "a person admired for brave deeds and courage..." "Hero"! Oh! Did I ask for help? No. You've ruined the fun of figuring it out myself. Bad dog! 
(groans) Am not! Are, too! Fine. Let's go in. 
(sighs) It's much scarier if you go sola--all ne. 
(gasps) Now I'm really in trouble. Just keep walking. Don't stop. 
(gasps) 
(meows) 
(gasps) 
(wails) 
(squawks) 
(shrieks) 
(imitates Helen's shriek) 
(wails) You didn't even go through the whole thing! 

[00:10:44]


(sighs) Maybe I'm not cut out to be a hero. 
(shriek) That's Hele She's in trouble! Come on, Skits! 
(shrieks) I'm coming, Helen! 
(grunts) 
(shrieks) 
(barks) Helen? Oh, boy, this place is spooky. 
(gasps) 
(meows) (shrieks) Helen! Helen? Admit it-- you're scared. 
PARROT: Helen? That's Martha! She's in trouble! Martha! Martha? Helen! Martha? Helen? Martha? Helen? Martha? Huh? Helen! Arwk! Martha?! No, it's only a parrot. Helen? Martha! Arwk! No, it's only a parrot.

(moaning) 
(shudders) Helen! Martha! What are you doing in here? I heard you yelp and came in to protect you. I wasn't in here. I only came when I heard you yell for me. Uh, so... Which way to escape? 
(moaning) That... way. 
(takes a deep breath) 
(both screaming) 
(panting) 
(grunting and screaming) She did it. Maybe she isbrave. Hear that? We did it! Even though I had my eyes closed. That was so courageous of you to go in there and save me. Thank you! You're welcome. It was heroic of you to go in and save me, too. So now that you've seen it, want to go through the Spooky House again? No! No! 

[00:12:49]


(giggling) 
(channels changing) HELEN: No. MARTHA: Nope. 
BOTH: Nope. 
HELEN: Not that. 
MARTHA: Not that. 
BOTH: Uh-uh. 
BOTH: No chance. No way. No way. Life's too short. Life's too short. 
(sighs) (sighs) Perfect. Perfect. 
BIMMY: This powerful storm will carry our boat off course! We'll never escape! 
(screams) 
(spluttering) Carlo, our only hope is if you're strong enough to bring me the anchor. Helen, I'm starting to think this stuff on TV is just not realistic. Oh, I don't know... 
(giggling) (giggling) 
(dramatic music plays) ?????? He's Courageous Collie Carlo ?????? ?????? When danger's near, he doesn't whine or snarl-o! ?????? 
(screaming) ?????? Oh, "Courageous" means he's brave, oh ?????? ?????? He's not afraid of danger and... ?????? ?????? He'll risk his life and always try to save you. ?????? ?????? So if you are in danger, afraid you might get hurt ?????? ?????? Call the mighty dog who's strong and so alert. ?????? ?????? Call Courageous Collie Carlo ?????? ?????? He'll rescue you ?????? ?????? Unless he's out taking a walk. ?????? 
GIRLS: Brave and courteous... loyal and a friend. A Junior Gopher Scout guards nature to the end. Oh! And remember, troopers, the Flea Island campgrounds are reopening this weekend. So if any of you need to earn your camping merit badge, I'll be available to supervise. Just ask. Ooh, ooh! Yeah! Ooh, ooh! Uh-huh! This is going to be so much fun. Oh! Look! Awesome! Whoa! Whoa...! 

[00:15:15]


(thuds) I'm all right. I'm okay. It'll be great to get the camping merit badge. Then I'll only have five more badges to go. Why do they call them merit badges? Because it's a patch you wear on your clothes, like a deputy's badge. You get them when you learn a new skill. Something useful-? something that has merit. Something that has merit... Maybe I could earn a merit badge for cleaning spills, or-or chasing squirrels or digging deep holes. They don't have merit badges for anything like that. Only for stuff like canoeing or camping or... Whoa! You guys are going camping? (whistles) You are brave. You wouldn't catch me camping. Not with Big Minnie on the lwose. Big Minnie? Wh-Who's Big Minnie! Knock it off, Ronald. You can't scare us. Who'sig Minnie? I'm just saying, if it was me, I'd be really frightened. Frightened? How do you mean, frightened? I mean... 
(shrieks) Big Minnie! Help! Frightened... like that. 
(laughter) Who's Big Minnie? Oh, some monster. 
(gasps) Monster? Yeah. She's supposed to be some kind of abominable snowman or big foot, I forget. Don't let Ronald frighten you! It's just a tall tale. Yeah. There's no such thing as monsters. 
RONALD: You hope. 
(cackling) You don't scare us! We're not afraid. Right, Martha? Martha? 
(panting) Ronald! Ronald, wait! What's all this about Big Minnie? Well... no one's ever gotten a good look at her. Some say she's just a myth. But she's real, all right. She lives deep in the forest over by Dog Head Lake. They say she's seven feet tall and covered in fur. Her paws are as big as a skateboard. And she has these beady, red eyes. And when the moon is full, she howls. 

[00:17:33]


Like this: Aaahhooow! 
(shuddering) Whoa, the troop leader should give them two badges: one for camping and one for bravery... if they survive. I wouldn't have the courage to go camping. 
(gulps) Yeah, well, I don't believe in that monster stuff. See you. 
(whimpers) 
MOM: Big Minnie?! Now there's a name I haven't heard in years. Helen, don't forget your poncho. You see, Helen? You see? Your mother's heard of Big Minnie. She's real! Oh, no. She's a figment of someone's overactive imagination. See? She's not real! At least I think g Minnie is imaginary... What?! What?! Well, when I was a girl, all these strange things happened. Mailboxes knocked over; fences torn down. Everyone said it was Minnie. Who was it, really? We never found out. Probably just el viento, the wind. Or Minnie! Martha! What are you doing? I'm trying to be helpful. Helpful? You're not being helpful. Helpful means you make things easier, not harder. I'm just trying to protect you. It's dangerous. You shouldn't go. I have to-- I have to earn my merit badge. Can't you just say you camped out? Who's going to know? That would be cheating. To earn something, you have to work to get it. That's what "earn" means. Like Helen earns her allowance by doing chores. Which reminds me, take out the garbage, please. 
(sighs): Okay. I'll be fine. You'll see. 
(sighs) 
(nervous whimpering) 
(girls laughing) This is fun. I'm glad we didn't let Ronald scare us out of going camping. 

[00:19:40]


(heavy footsteps) 
(footsteps grow louder) What's that? I don't know, but whatever it is, it's getting closer. 
(howling) 
(screaming) It's Big Minnie! It's Big Minnie! Martha! Martha! 
(whimpers) Martha? Martha! 
(gasps) Helen! Oh, it was horrible. It was Minnie! She was huge! You were dreaming. If you're going camping, I'm going with you. Someone's got to protect you. Oh, Martha. Are you sure it's okay if Skits and Martha come camping, too? I don't see why not. We'll make them honorary Junior Gophers. Honorary? It's when you're invited to be in a club because you're so special. Even though our rules say no dogs are allowed. Woo-hoo! All right! We'll be the most superb honorary Junior Gopher Scouts you ever saw. 
MRS. CLUSKY: Thank you, Martha. Thank you, Skits. It's so nice not to get your feet wet. 
(shouting) 
(barks) Ew, dog stink water. So, what's a Junior Gopher do? I-I mean, an honorary one? A Junior Gopher is loyal and true. Easy. I'm a dog! Loyal and true are my middle names. And brave. Check, again. 
(barks) am not afraid of the vacuum cleaner. 
(barks) Am not. 
(barks) Am not. 
(barks) Am not. This looks like a good spot. Let's put up those tents. This looks like a good spot. Let's put up those tents. 
(grunts) 

[00:21:43]


(groaning) Whoa! We should clear that brush before we start the fire. Well done, girls. And you two have been extraordinarily helpful. You're superlative honorary Junior Gophers. Thanks! (barks) 
MRS.LUSKY: Good night, girls. Sweet dreams. Okay, Skits. We've got to guard this camp. It's up to us to protect those girls. If Minnie shows up, we got to be tough. You hear? Let me see your tough face. 
(snarls) Ah, good. Now let's hear a growl. 
(growls) (yelps) 
(panting) Pretty good. I wasn't scared. I was just practicing the escape route. Making sure you knew where to go. 
(growls) (yelps) 
(teeth chattering) Yeah, yeah, save it. 
(distant howl) Oh! That was really good. You almost got me that time. How do you do that without moving your mouth? 
(distant howl) 
(whispering): It's Big Minnie! We've got to protect those girls. 
(screaming) What's happening?! (howl) Wha-wha-what is that?! It's Big Minnie! How can you be sure? Ronald told me! He did Big Minnie's howl. That's exactly what it sounded like! Wait a minute! Ronald did Big Minnie's howl for you? And it sounded just like that? 
MARTHA: Alice, stop! 
(distant howl) That's not Big Minnie. 

[00:23:46]


(howling) 
(snickering) 
(rustling) 
(growling) 
(whimpers) Oh, no! Aah! 
(yelling) Big Minnie! Help! 
(girls laughing) Way to go, you guys! We got him good! 
(snarling) Skits! You were really frightening! I was almost afraid myself. And I knew it was you. 
ALICE (yawns): What do you say we hit the sack? 
MARTHA: Hit the sack? Why don't you just fold your paper bags? It's an expression. It means "let's go to bed." Why didn't you say so? I'm all for it! 
(snoring) 
(low growling) Hey! Keep it dow...! Wh-What I meant to say was... how do you do, Big Minnie, ma'am? 
(growling) Oh, you can count on us, Minnie. We're Junior Gophers. We'll leave everything just like we found it. 
(growling) ping merit badges were earned by Helen Lorraine and Alice Boxwood. Good work, girls. And then, I pulled back the tent flap, and there she was. Big Minnie, in the fur! 
(all laughing) Oh, Martha. It was your imagination. There's no such thing as Big Minnie. Why won't you believe me? You believe me, don't you, Skits? (barks) You do? Well, tell them! Tell them! 
(barking) Oh, right. You can't. It's okay. At least someone believes me. And I tried to tell them how brave I was, and no one believed me. 

[00:25:56]


(growls) Oh. "Brave" means you do something, even though you're scared to do it. It's a lot like courage. So I s thinking, maybe if you came to town with me, everybody would be convinced that you were really real. 
(growls) Aw, c'mon. Please? There's really good garbage in town. You wouldn't believe what people throw away. Hey! You can have some alphabet soup. Who knows? It might make you talk! Minnie? Minnie?! Why don't monsters ever do what you want them to do? Hi! That was exciting, wasn't it? Let's review some of those words, shall we? A cry for help! I'm off to the rescue! To the rescue? You mean you're going to save someone? How do you mean "frightened"? 
(yelling) Okay, Skits. We've got to guard this camp. It's up to us to protect those girls. So long for now!

=======================================================

T gunman. The second deadliest school shooting in united states history. Officials add that one other adult was found dead at a secondary scene. There is some confusion over the identity of the shooter. Not a surprise given the situation like this. And details about his motive and exactly what firearms were used are evolving. What we do know is that the gunman's mother, nancy, was a kindergarten teacher it he school and is among those killed. With the death toll encompassing many of her kindergarten students, children 5 and 6 years old. An emotional president addressed the tragedy just a few moments ago. 
>> I know there's not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. These children are our children, and we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this regardless of the politics. 
>> The president speaking there of his grief, sharing his feelings as a father as well as a president. As the nation reels from the shock and grief of this unthinkable crime, with young children as the most tragic victims and witnesses. 
>> Well, when I was out in the hall when like everybody hurried. The bullets, they like went into a total panic. 

[00:02:08]


>> And how are you doing? What went on in your head as this was happening. 
>> Whoa. 
>> A small and brave boy's account of this utter horror. The more chilling to know that 18 of his young classmates were killed on this day. Let's go now to our justice correspondent pete williams who joins us from washington. Pete, what is the latest and what can you tell us about this gunman's identity? 
>> Well, you know, we thought we knew it earlier in the day. We had been told and a number of other news organizations had been told by several different law enforcement agencies and officials that the name was ryan lanza, but now it may be, martin, that the person who fired the shots was carrying someone else's i.D. So it may turn out that at the end of the day the person who fired the shots was ryan lanza's brother, adam, and federal officials and local officials are still trying to sort that out precisely which of the two of them it was. But what we're told is that the other person who was killed in newtown, connecticut, is a family member. We don't know what the family relationship was, and we're also told that the mother of those two ryan brothers caught at the , that that was the family connection. We were told that the person with the gun carried two handguns into the school, a 9 millimeter pistol, two of the mo widely available types of weapons in america, and had two other firearms in the car which were not used. One was a rifle and the other is a firearm we don't know what kind it was. Buthe person that fired the shots was dressed all in black. We don't know whether the vest that he was wearing bulletproof vest or just a tactical vest to hold additional ammunition clips. Those are the very broad details. Other people who knew him have been detained for questioning, and cials are still trying to sort through this all, but it is extraordinary, martin, that this many hours after this happened it still isn't clear the identity of the person who fired the shots. 

[00:04:11]


>> And -- 
>> I suspect that will be straightened out shortly. 
>> Pete, there was some suggestion earlier of some additional individual, somebody else who may have been involved, was seen exiting the school, and was subsequently arrested. 
>> Yes. 
>> Has that person been removed from any suspicion? 
>> Detained for questioning i think would be the best way to put it. Was never called a suspect, and I have heard no indication that there was anyone other than one person involved. 
>> So one individual whose identity we still don't know much about. In terms of the actual death toll, that's risen because i understand that one of the state police gave a press conference just a few minutes ago and updated us. What is it? 
>> Right. We initially had been told it was 18 children. That has now been changed to 18 children who were found dead at the school plus two others who died at a nearby hospital. So that's 20 children in all who were killed along with 6 adults who were in the school plus the gunman. So that's a total of 27 people at the school, and then a 28th person, this family member of the apparent family member of the person who fired the shots who was found dead at the family member's home not far away, also in newtown, connecticut. 
>> The ser himself, pete, died at the scene in the school. Was that as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or was he killed by law enforcement? 
>> And we don't know the answer to that, martin. 
>> Okay. Nbc's pete williams. Thanks so much for the moment. Michelle franzen joins us, our reporter from newtown, connecticut. Michelle, this is a small town, 26,000 people. A school which is highly popular because of its success, has a very good reputation. What can you tell us about the scene there now? 
>> Reporter: Well, cerly, martin, we're at the press briefing area, but it's a short distance away from the elementary school where the shooting took place this afternoon or early this morning. This afternoon we received this new briefing from law enforcement who arrived on the scene early this morning saying that they'd practiced for drills like this, but the emotions that are now enveloping this community are great, and he talks about how the community is coming together. They've already held several prayer vigils in this area. Another one scheduled for tonight at 7:00. This community, of course, as you mentioned, very small community. By some standards, 26,000 people, that elementary school was only k through 4. That means 5-year-olds through 10-year-olds at that school that were exposed to this violent and tragic scene that played out today. We've heard and seen the video of parents rushing to that school after learning word of the shooting today. Some of them reunited with their kids. Other parents being sequestered, taken to another location. That is where connecticut's governor met with them this afternoon comforting them and that's exactly what this community will continue to do as the grief really sets in, martin. 

[00:07:16]


>> Yes, michelle. And the governor described this as a tragedy of unspeakable terms, and we now have some sound from a young student who witnessed that horrifying scene. Let's listen to hi 
>> the teacher told us to all go where the library is and get behind something. Since there's a window in the door, nobody would see -- the guy wouldn't see us, and I heard that the guy was wanting to kill everybody and started with the music room and I was close to the music room. 
>> It's deeply disturbing to hear a child describing scenes like this. Michelle, I also understand that very close to the school is a fire station that became something of a triage center, is that right? 
>> Reporter: It was. It was where the families were taken from what we understand that were taken there who were told that their loved ones had passed away, had been killed in that building. That's where the governor met with them and that's where the families were comforting each other during that time. Other family members, of course, reunited with their kids. They were able to leave that area. And, again, this community, you hear that little girl talking about what unfolded in that school and these shootings throughout the country, of course, that we've seen throughout the decades that have prompted many communities and schools to actually hold drills and prepare for this possible scenario like this playing out. Certainly though no one can prepare for the emotions that is hitting this town tonight. 
>> Indeed. Michelle franzen, thank you so much. And we're joined now by nbc's kristin welker who joins us live at the white house. Kristin, I don't think anybody who saw the president speak just now could but be moved because he was speaking not just as the commander in chief of this nation but also as a father, the parent of two young daughters. 

[00:09:16]


>> Reporter: Absolutely, martin. This is really the most emotional that we have seen president obama when he comes out to address the nation in the wake of one of these horrific shootings. He made the point that everyone's heart is breaking as we watch these events unfold in connecticut. Also made it clear that connecticut's tragedy is the nation's tragedy. I thought it was interesting that he made the point that now is the time for meaningful action despite the politics of it. Of course, what does that action mean? What will it look like? That will be revealed in the coming days and weeks. But certainly a call there for some sort of legislative action in the wake of another tragic shooting. President obama also reached out to fbi director muller, spoke with the governor of connecticut, dl malloy. You heard him reference those phone calls and talk about the fact he not only called to extend his condolences to governor malloy, but to make it clear the federal government is standing with connecticut right now and will offer its full support as it begins to deal with this unspeakable tragedy. Now, the president was alerted about these incidents at 10:30 this morning by his national security adviser john brennan. He has been updated throughout the day. The state government is taking the lead on this, but the federal government making it very clear that they are standing with connecticut and offering their full resources, whatever they need as they deal with this situation. President obama frequently visits communities that are grieving. At this point in time the white house not giving us any information about what his plans might be, but certainly that is one of the things that might be under discussion as they watch this tragedy continue to unfold. The president continues to get updates on this situation, martin, but as you pointed out, he's watching this not just as the president but as a father of two daughters, and he was clearly quite emotional today when he spoke to the nation. Certainly the entire country watching this in horror right along with the president. Martin? 
>> Kristin, after the horrific shooting in aurora, we had an outpouring of grief, but the president didn't say taction should be taken. When we had the terrible deaths of six people at that sikh temple in wisconsin, there was another expression of grief from everybody, but the president didn't say, as he has just said, that we have to come together and take action. What do you think he means by that, kristin? 

[00:11:43]


>> Reporter: Well, it was certainly, I think, one of his strongest statements potentially calling for stiffer gun control measures. In the wake of the aurora shooting, a couple weeks afterwards, he was at an event at the urban league and he talked about the need for common sense measures, making it more difficult for weapons to get into the hands of those who might not be mentally stable. Putting more money, more federal funding into preventative measures for those who are mentally unstable. So I think that those are some of the ideas that might be discussed. White house press secretary jay carney today reiterated the fact that the president does support a ban on assault weapons. Of course, we haven't seen a whole lot of action to reinstate that ban, but that is potentially one of the other things that might be under consideration in the coming days and weeks. But I think that we will have to wait and see what the specifics will look like. The white house made the point that while the president did make that statement today, their main focus is on the victims and helping the people of connecticut right now. 
>> Kristin, you and I were at the hofstra presidential debate when a member of the public put that question to the president about an assault weapons ban, and you will recall that he expressed support for that, but nothing has happened, has it? 
>> Reporter: Nothing has happened, and I can tell you it's not just at hofstra, martin. We in the press often ask jay carney about this very issue. What type of action can we expect to see from this white house in terms of backing up some of those words? At this point in time we haven't gotten news that any -- there is any actual action in the near future, but I think that you're going to potentially see that change based on what the president said today, based on the fact he said it is now time for action despite the politics of it. As you know, a lot of members of congress, more conservative members, are opposed to a number of the stiffer gun control measures that have been discussed. So it's certainly not going to be an easy thing to sort through. But I think that part of the president's point today, and you heard him say this in his own words, was that he has seen too many of these massacres of these tragic shootings that have claimed too many lives and today those lives were of children, ages 5 to 10 years old. So certainly he was emotional but also seemed to be resolved to some extent to actually do something about it this time. 

[00:14:14]


>> Indeed. Kristin, he said as a country we have been through this too many times. Kristin welker at the white house, thank you. I want to bring in our panel, msnbc political analyst karen finney and joan walsh, editor-at-large of salon.Com, and also we have democratic strategist and former counsel to the house judiciary committee julian epstein. Joan, I want to get your initial reaction to what has hand today because you're the mother of a daughter. I have met your daughter. 
>> Yes. I called her right away. We've talked several times today. We g chatted for hours. That's your immediate impulse and then you say a prayer for the families that have gone through this loss. But I was very happy to hear the president make remarks about action. He doesn't have to spell out what it is. We don't even know exactly what were the weapons and what were the circumstances that went on -- 
>> so far apparently he had two handguns but a rifle was found in a vehicle associated with him. 
>> Right. But what we do know, martin, is that there are too many guns in this society, and that it is far too easy to get guns. It's far too easy for troubled people to get guns. We also know that there's not nearly enough mental health support, mental health treatment in our culture, and that it's stigmatized for too many people, especially young men. Again, this is a young man who did this presumably. We need to be talking about what are the root causes of that kind of violence and that kind of loneliness and desperation that would lead someone to take these lives. It's really unspeakable. 
>> One of the most shocking statistics is that 40% of legal gun sales do not involve any kind of background check. 
>> Right. 
>> That is astonishing. 
>> It's astonishin these are the kinds of laws that can't be changed because of the stranglehold not only the nra, now we've got the koch brothers funded program in the mix. Last night michigan passed a law making it legal to carry a concealed weapon in a church, in a school, in a daycare center and they also abolished the local county boards that were in charge of supervising the permits that do go out. So we've got these well-funded lobbies, these well-funded efforts to keep politicians on a short leash when it comes to any kind of common sense gun control, and so it's going to take a lot of courage on the part of the president but not just the president, everyone in congress and not just democrats, the nation. 

[00:16:48]


>> Karen, you've worked previously for the new york education department. Give us your perspective on a school like this because, as i understand it, most schools are accessible until about 9:00 a.M., Quarter past 9:00, and then the access is closed. Yet this individual orndeed the school mthe 911 call just after 9:30. 
>> I'm sure we'll learn more about there was some speculation that perhaps this individual may have taught at the school or had some kind of access to the school. And I also heard reported there were new school safety measures that had just been implemented. We'll learn a lot about that. 
>> And he may have been known to staff because his mother is a teacher. 
>> Exactly. When I worked at the new york city schools after 9/11, we needed to take a very wholistic approach to this as we move forward and think of the needs of the children, this community, the teachers. This is going to be a long process of healing. There will be all kinds of great resources for people in terms of how do you talk with your children, how you move forward, how you answer their questions. Certainly the school district will have to look for additional resources. Joan and I were just talking about this. I hope nobody says that the school doesn't deserve whatever it is that they need to make sure there are counselors available so everyone can move forward and, you know, across this country children are going to have questions and parents are going to have to figure out how to talk with their children about what's happened. When children see something like this, they experience it very differently than we do as adults. Keeping an eye on your children, if they have questions, responding to those questions but having that wholistic approach in terms of how we move forward and how we help this community heal. 
>> Joan, we understand that new york city mayor michael bloomberg has said not even CHILDREN LEARNING THEIR ABCs ARE Safe, and he, of course, has been campaigning rentlessly about gun control and some kind of control. As you look at the litany of these events and this year, it struck me when the president was speaking that even he has now run out of patience with this. 

[00:18:50]


>> Well, this is his fourth national speech about a gun-related tragedy. I think it was ft. Hood, it was aurora, it's this, and I'm missing one. 
>> Gabrielle giffords. 
>> Of course, my god. I think it's got to try his patience and jay carney, unfortunately, made an unfortunate statement today that it's not the day to talk about gun control. It is the day. It's got to be the day because these things happen so frequently if we can't talk about them on the day there's gun violence, then there's so often gun violence -- 
>> I think with as so many things, there's no control. After this many incidents, we're not controlling anything. We need to have a conversation about gun safety because I can't imagine there's a person in this country who doesn't -- isn't for gun safety. And as we have that conversation to the point you were making, that means what are the laws and the regulations that determine who gets a gun, who has access to a gun, but also in terms of the mental health issues that will come out of this and how do we ensure that we have the proper systems in place to ensure that people who have mental illness don't have access to guns. 
>> Let's listen once again to something the president said. Here is the president. 
>> As a country we have been through this too many times whether it's an elementary school in newtown or a shopping mall in oregon or a temple in wisconsin or a movie theater in aurora or a street corner in chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children, and we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this regardless of the politics. 
>> If I can bring in democratic strategist julian epstein. Julian, we've learned those children who survived were told to hold hands and close their eyes as they walked out of the school. This is devastating enough for adults, but for children? 
>> It's devastating for the country, and if you consider the age of the victims involved here, martin, this is probably the worst school shooting that we've ever experienced in the country's history, and as bad as it is, we have to keep in mind that this kind of tragedy is occurring every single day in the united states. Every single day 30 americans die from handgun related homicides. That's 200 a week. That's 11,000 a year. That's the equivalent of a jumbo jet airliner going down every single week of the entire year. And if you compare it to our counterparts say in the united kingdom, in germany, in france, in south korea, in japan, all of whom have very strong gun control laws, you see that there are probably somewhere between maybe only a couple dozen to a couple hundred handgun related deaths a year. So we have a handgun vie -- a gun violence epidemic in this country that's unlike what is occurring anywhere else amongst our industrial counterparts, and you consider the arguments that the nra makes, the principal argument they have made to hold up legislation for 15 years is people need guns in their homes for self-defense. This has been studied by countless study all of which have found the same thing. Guns inside the home are used very, very frequently, a tiny percentage of instances. Almost all the times when guns inside a home are used, they are used in a suicide or in a homicide or some other kind of assault. And I remember when we were trying to get gun violence legislation passed in the wake of columbine. I remember being invited to meet with president clinton inside the oval office, and he said to me as we were walking out the door that day, he said, you know what? The american people are with us on this gun violence issue. Just get a bill to my desk. His exact words were I would be willing to go into new hampshire in the middle of hunting season and make the case for gun violence legislation because when people hear the data and when they hear how many holes there are in the gun laws, whether it is unlicensed dealers being able to provide automatic weapons to terrorists and mentally unstable people and a whole host of other gaping loopholes, when people hear that, they revolt. When they hear the incredible statistics about how awash this country is in gun-related violence, the public will be with me. That's exactly the case that president clinton made. I think that's the case that president obama is hinting at. And I'm very hopeful, as joan said, that we will talk about this today and that democrats, particularly our party on the hill, will find the spine and the backbone to do something about this national epidemic. 

[00:23:30]


>> I have to say, julian, I'm relieved you mentioned europe. If I had done that I would be told to go back to britain. I was born in a country and lived for over 30 years in a country where there are very strict laws and as a consequence firearms are not used to resolve domestic disputes, arguments between partners, a so on. Whereas having lived here for the last almost nine years, i have become -- it's almost commonplace this kind of event. 
>> In the uk I think the deaths in the last year or so were 60 gun-related homicides in the entire year. In a country that has very, very strong gun control legislation. Compare that to 30 a day, 200 a week, 11,000 a year. I mean, the data is just overwhelming in this case. 
>> And yet, joan, notwithstanding what julian has just said, in places like michigan the legislature has actually promoted bills which allow people to carry concealed weapons into church, onto school premises, into colleges. 
>> Right. 
>> Notwithstanding the evidence. 
>> Notwithstanding the evidence, and they did that right after the clackamas shooting which also use assault weapons. You know, we had a murder -- a tragic murder/suicide with guns in a situation that might not have escalated to that kind of violence without guns. You know, what does it take in just the span of a week to get us to move? I was also really glad that the president brought up chicago because we can't only be focused on this tragedy in this particular community, but we have to look at the toll that guns are taking on our cities and the city of chicago is particularly besieged. This is a tragedy that crosses class lines, crosses racial lines, and we've all got to be in it together. 
>> Karen, one of the arguments i keep hearing is that if people didn't have guns, they'd simply use a knife. 

[00:25:31]


>> Which is absurd. That's an absurd response -- 
>> explain to me why that's absurd. 
>> Because that completely denigrates what the real conversation should be about and that's gun safety, right? We're not talking about stabbings. We're not talking about drownings. We're not talking about jumping off a building. We're talking about something we can control. We can actually have control over gun violence in this country, and, you know, if you think about the ways that the nr a -- and we've learned after each tragedy we learn a little bit more about the ways they manipulate the laws so, for example, after the aurora shooting, we learned we don't even have a national database that can talk to itself so if someone who is buying large amounts of weaponry and ammunition in one place and then does it in another, law enforcement doesn't -- can't even know about that. Why? Because we don't want to impose on the rights of the gun owners. You know, we have to view our rights, our constitutional rights, as responsibilities as well. And I think it cannot be in the domain of a political conversation that keeping our children safe, keeping our communities safe from gun violence, that can't be a political conversation. 
>> Karen finney, joan walsh -- 
>> can I amplify.

[00:29:48]


>>> If you're just joining us, we are following the latest developments in today's horrific shooting at an elementary school in newtown, connecticut. For more lets go to nbc's michelle franzen who is live for us in newtown. Michelle, what information do you have concerning the identity of the shooter? Because there appears to be some confusion about the name of the individual. Can you tell us more? 
>> Reporter: Yeah, there is some confusion, and, martin, I think that it could be that law enforcement are still looking into those details. There's a possibility that we heard in the last few hours that the shooter may have been carrying another person's i.D., another relative's i.D., So we are expected to hear back again from law enforcement in the next half hour and hopefully they will have that information. Again, they said that they were sorting some information out on that investigation. Of course, the elementary school still a very active investigation scene there with a tragic details of that shooting just playing out early this morning. And what we do know is that police say it appears that there was one shooter, one shooter who somehow entered the elementary school building this morning after classes had already begun and this elementary school where k through 4th grade students were meeting, ages 5 through 10, and the shooter went into the school and they received a 911 call, and law enforcement said that they went into that school immediately. Knew that they had an active shooter situation there and began going from classroom to classroom checking for students, checking for teachers and other staff members before all of this tragedy unfolded, and then, of course, we have seen the visuals that were occurring outside the school once parents received word those reverse emergency callat came to them telling them they needed to get to the school to pick up their children. Some of those parents, of course, were met by their children who were released from the school, and other parents sadly were sequestered off into an area of the firehousehere the governor met with them today and, of course, I'm sure counselors and the families comforting each other as these tragic events unfold here in this town, martin, this community is coming together. Vigil is expected to be held in the nearby church tonight at 7:00. They've already been gathering, already been comforting. You can imagine anytown, usa, would be doing the same today, tonight, and in the days to come. 

[00:32:20]


>> Michelle, the shooter himself shot hi mother who was a teacher of the kindergarten class. There was also another crime scene at a property nearby. Another relative of the shooter? 
>> Reporter: Well, what we do know is we are hearing word, police have not confirmed that the mother was shot. We do know that the mother worked at the school. I think there are details with the identity of the shooter that we're still trying to work out with those details. What we do know is that the shooter that they believe played out and took these lives, that his mother did work at the school, so we're waiting for that sort of confirmation and who exactly may have been or was the target at the school, and, yes, another crime scene unfolding in the new jersey area where the potential shooter that police think actually took the lives here again may have also had another situation with other relatives in new jersey. So a lot of those details, martin, still trying to be worked out as law enforcement executes search warrants throughout the day, interview family members, and try and pinpoint who exactly the shooter was, if he was, in fact, carrying somebody else's identification. 
>> Nbc's michelle franzen in newtown, connecticut. Thank you so much,michelle. Let's go back to the white house and nbc's kristin welker. We want to play some sound from the president today who spoke just over an hour ago. Take a listen. 
>> Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well. For as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them truly, and there are no words that will ease their in. 
>> Kristin, you were present as a very emotional president talked about what happened. What more can you tell us about his reaction to this devastating tragedy today? 
>> Reporter: Well, martin, this is really the most emotional that I have seen president obama in the wake of one of these massacres, these tragedies, and, of course, has spoken after the shooting in aurora, colorado, in tucson, arizona. All of them equally tragic but clearly this shooting is different, as he pointed out, because there were so many young people who lives were taken. Ages 5 to 10 years old. He made the point that he was watching this unfold not just as the president of the united states but also as a father. He was alerted about this shooting earlier today by his -- by john brennan, his national security adviser. He's been getting updates throughout the day, and he reached out to the governor of connecticut not only to he can tend his condolences, but also to make it clear that the federal government is prepared to stand with connecticut as they deal with, respond to, and begin to heal from this unspeakable tragedy. The president really making the case that this is not just connecticut's tragedy, this is really the nation's tragedy. One thing that stood out to me, I know it stood out to you, martin, was the president making the point that in the wake of this shooting, it is in his words, time to take meaningful action to try to prevent another tragedy like this from happening again. What does that specifically mean? We'll have to wait and see for the details to come out, but clearly it is a referen to some type of stiffer legislation when it comes to gun policy. President obama has ordered the flags flown at half-staff. The national flag here at the white house, the flags at the capitol also flown at half-staff as well as all of the flags on federal buildings here in washington, d.C. Reerating the point that the federal government is standing with connecticut as it begins to deal with this tragedy. Martin, I can also tell you that an impromptu vigil is beginning to form right outside the white house. People just coming together to mourn because I think so many people are mourning today for the victims in connecticut and also to send their prayers and their condolences. So that is happening right now outside of the white house just beginning to gather. We're going to monitor that and brick bring you any developments. But the president continues to monitor this situation, continues to make it very clear that the federal government will offer its full support, it's full resources to the people of connecticut. Martin? 

[00:36:41]


>> Kristin, as the president said, as a country we have been through this too many times. Kristin welker, thank you so much. Let me bring in two of my friends d colleagues, the host of msnbc's "the cycle" toure and crystal ball. Krystal, what was your reaction. Off youngaughter and you are pregnant. 
>> It's been a very emotional day. I think I feel the way the president feels, the way that patients feel, the way that most americans feel. Not to state the obvious, but there's something about it being such young children, 5-year-olds, these were babies, that really makes it just very hard to cope with emotionally. It seems so senseless, so unbelievably tragic and unfathom that you just don't know how to wrap your mind about it. Put aside the fact that he also apparently took the life of his own mother, another monstrous incomprehensible tragedy. So it's been a tough day for me as it has been for many americans. Nothing, of course, compared to what the victims are going through. 
>> Of course. 
>> Absolutely. All of that. Your child is 4 my son is 5, my daughter is 3 1/2. We walk through these hallways similar to the gunman did today, and I can very clearly visualize the path he would have taken and going into this room and a lot of young children's classrooms, there's one door so the teachers can stay in control of the room and the children. So if you just block that door, you have total control of this room and there's usually three adults in a large group of maybe 20 or so children. So I can only imagine the horror of these people as this is carrying on for several minutes. As krystal said, he committed two of the most unhumane things a person can do, killing your mother, killing children. But as we prepared for the show, I felt like change the nouns, but the same veshs. We've done this show before. We've seen other crazy, depraved killings like this, and it's like how many more dot we have to go through until we say we need to do something. I almost feel like there is no tragedy large enough that would make america go, yeah, we need to make a change. It seems like we just accept this as part of being in america. 

[00:39:00]


>> If I can, I'd like to read something that michael bloomberg, the mayor of new york city has said in response to today's shooting. He said this, we have heard all the rhetoric before. What we have not seen is leadership, not from the white house and not from congress. That must end today. This is a national tragedy, and it demands a national response. My deepest sympathies are with the families of all those affected and my determination to stop this madness is stronger than ever. I imagine you share those sentiments. 
>> I certainly agree with that sentiment, but I do want to be careful about one thing. You know, when we talk about gun control, stricter gun control, i think it's important that we be specific about what we mean, and right now in this particular case we don't know the details. We don't know if there was extended capacity magazine clip, for example. We know it wasn't likely assault rifles. We don't know if he obtained the guns legally or illegally. We really have no way of knowing exactly what would have pretented this tragedy -- 
>> but krystal, 40% of legally owned firearms in this country are purchased without any form of backgrou 
>> absolutely. And that's an important -- i mean, that is an important debate to have, but I just think it's important we be specific because otherwise the message that law-abiding gun on owning americans here is we want to take away your guns and that's not what we want. We want to try to prevent tragedieke this but I agree with the sentiment we should get the details here first so they we know what we're talking about and what we're advocating for. 
>> To krystal's point though, toure, there is often ager to demonize the law abiding who use weapons in an appropriate manner at the same time as demonizing an individual who has perpetrated such a wicked and unspeakable act like this. 
>> I don't want to demonize responsible gun owners like krystal's father, like my father, but we know also that guns do not make you safer. When you have guns in the home, they are far more likely, 43 times more likely to be used on a friend or family membern an intruder. They consistently make angry arguments turn into violent deaths, so we cannot just act like because we have many responsible gun owners then that absolves all the other people. I think the attitude really comes down to well, wackos will figure out a way to do harm so there's nothing we can do. One of the big differences I see in today versus the mood around the aurora shooting was the gun control lobby people, bloomberg perhaps is an early leader of that, is starting to stand back up. When aurora happened it was nobody can talk about gun control in this day. That's inappropriate and the gun control lobby continued to stand down and the nra controls the whole discussion, and now gun control people are starting to say, no, today is an important day to speak up. We must speak up now and a valuable tweet looking forward to national time to talk about national gun control day which is always tomorrow. At some point it's got to be today. 

[00:42:10]


>> Here is what the president said. We are going to have to come together aake action. The president said that. 
>> On this day. That matters. 
>> Because? 
>> Because now is a time to talk about it. If we can't talk about it now, when do we talk about it? We talked about that brilliant jon stewart piece the other day. When we're having these shootings, then it's inappropriate to talk about it. Of course, the gun rights lobby wants it to be inappropriate on their most embarrassing day. When do we talk about it? That one day when the nypd says there's no shootings today. Then it doesn't seem important to talk about it. The gun control debate must happen and it can't be cowed by, well, that person was just a wacko and it's really mental health. 
>> We're watching live pictures at the moment of an impromptu gathering right outside the white house now of people gatherin together to express their sympathies for what has happenedn connecticut today. A shooting happened earlier today. 911 call from the school at 9:30 this morning where children, 18 children, were killed, staff members and six adults in total, 27. The gunman himself w killed. We're not certain as to whether that was a self-inflicted gunshot wound or whether he was killed by law enforcement. Krystal, the secret service conducted a survey in 2002 and it found 68% of attackers obtained guns from the home or that of a relative. And this idea we keep hearing argued that people should have a gun in the home for self-protection is challenged by a stat tick like that, isn't it? 
>> Certainly it is. But I mean, here is my stance. If we're going to infringe on someone's liberty which is what we are, in fact, talking about when you're talking about gun control, there has to be a really pressing onus of proof that doing that thing, taking away that liberty, is going to have a measurable impact. So I'm with toure, I'm with you. This is a debate we need to have. I just think we have to be very careful about the terms of that debate and the specifics and bringing forward the evidence that these measures are actually going to have an impact. That's my position, and I think in this case we just don't know enough yet to know what would have prevented the situation. 

[00:44:28]


>> We're expecting a press conference I should say from the location in about exactly an hour where we'll be updated obviously -- sorry in one minute. A press conference at 4:45. Forgive me. You were going to interrupt. 
>> Just quickly, this is not what the founders envisioned when they wrote the second amendment. These sort of school shootings, movie theater shootings, shoot up your whole family in your home. This is clearly not what they were thinking about when they were talking about giving people the power of militia. When we're talking about the freedom of speech and these sort of things, yes, we have to be very careful what we take away. Guns are ultimately very efficient killing tools. 
>> So are you advocating for a complete ban on guns? I'must wondering what spically are you advocating for? 
>> I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not -- I'm certainly not understanding why people need to have assault rifles, why we need to have large magazines. You know, I'm not sure why people are able to go to gun shows and get guns without background checks. I'm not sure why the nra is against any sort of control on people having guns. I don't think it's enough to say that laws don't prevent people from getting guns because that's just saying -- 
>> I'm not saying that. 
>> I know you're not but a lot of gun rights lobby says that. It's like there's nothing we can do, call uncle, and we have to live with these killings week after week. 
>> And I agree with everything you just mentioned there. The assault weapons, extended magazines, the gun show loophole, I agree with all of that. I just think when we speak in broad terms, when we use statistics about gun violence, it sounds to a lot of people like we want to ban guns completely, and we have to be smart and strategic if we're going to win political battles. So that's why I'm urging caution in terms of the way that we talk about this and being specific about what it is, what solutions we're proposing because I think there's very few people out there who would say, complete ban on guns or even complete ban on handguns. So that's my only word of caution in this particular -- 

[00:46:31]


>> we either go toward more guns in society or less, right? Certainly more guns is not what you want, rit? 
>> But, toure, isn't there also a gaping need for psychiatric services, particularly for men, and for this to be opened up as a discussion point given that in so many cases and fbi experts tell us that there are signs and signifiers that an individual doesn't perpetrate a crime like this out of nowhere, and that often times there might have been interventions of some kind to prevent a disaster happening like this. 
>> Absolutely. And the stigma tieization of being in therapy, especially for men, we need to move away from that so people who are in trouble can get help. But it becomes a sort of equation of when you have a mental health problem plus you can get access to a gun, then something is going to happen. I don't want to ban alcohol. I don't want to ban cars, but when people put those two things together then that can be a problem. And if -- 
>> but that's to krystal's point. You're supporting krystal's position which is it's not simplistically an issue of the weapon. It's a multifactorial problem. 
>> Well, yeah, you make some sense, but there's only two things that we can use guns for. Killing and practicing killing, right? So why else do we have guns in society? 
>> Okay. Well, we are awaiting, as i said, a press conference. We were told it would take place at 4:45 p.M. Eastern time. We'll bring it to you obviously live. We still have democratic strategist julian epstein watching and with us on stand by. Julian, you heard a fairly conflicted discussion there about controls. You're a lawyer yourself. What's your view of this? 
>> And I spend many years of the judiciary committee trying to close up some of the gaping loopholes in the federal laws. I mean, I tend to be closer to where toure is on this thing and I'll tell you why. It's not just the data that we spoke about in terms of how much gun violence there is in this country, which is just exponentially more than in other countries, industrialized countries with sensible gun laws, but when you look at how -- you look at the nature of the loopholes. And terrorist groups like al qaeda have been the ones that have commented on how ridiculously lax the u.S. Laws are and how relatively easy it is to get things like assault weapons and 50 millimeter rifles that can blow a foot away of concrete from a quarter of a mile away. The amount of loopholes that are in the laws right now make me wince a little bit when people say we should be very cautious and very specific aboute want to go. Just consider some basic things. I mean, a terrorist can go into a gun show today and buy -- or any other unlicensed dealer and get assault weapons and get extended magazine clips. That's just a simple place where one could start to close down just kind of basic gaping loopholes. If you look at the data on concealed weapons and the problems that concealed weapons are creating in states that have concealed weapons laws, if you look at basic things like the justice department that's wanted to use microstamping to help trace laws, there's at least -- to trace gun crimes, there's at least a half a dozen to three-quarters of a dozen major things we could do that would at least reduce the incidents of these kinds of massive tragedies but I think toure -- 

[00:50:06]


>> julian, to your point, you're talking about very specific measures which is exactly what i think we should be doing. My ox is when people speak in broad terms and don't break it down to solutions. Here is what we want to do because I think there's a lot of people out there, gun owners included, who support a lot of the measures you're talking about. Nra members even who have been surveyed who support a lot of those common sense measures. What I object to is the language that sounds very broad and very unspecific that sounds like we want to take everyone's guns away, and that's at least not my position and I don't think that it's the positionf you or toure either. 
>> Julian, what can we do even if we introduce legislation when there are 300 million firearms available in this country? They're loose in this country. There are 350 million people, 300 million firearms. 
>> Well, so let me answer both of those questions. To krystal's point, it is a fact that the nra has opposed closing the loopholes on unlicd dealers and putting any controls on unlicensed dealers like gun shows. 
>> Certainly they have. 
>> It's a fact that the nra has opposed extending the ban which pired in 2004 on assault weapons -- 
>> but julian, the reason they're able to keep such a large membership and to scare their members into thinking that we want to take their guns away is because of broad rhetoric being used. They have done surveys of nra members, and I'm not talking about the leadership, I'm talking about the rank and file members ofch there are many, and they actually support a lot of the basic common sense things that you're talking about. So that's why I'm saying, you know, when we use broad language about gun control and we don't boil it down to those specifics, they're able to use that as propaganda that liberals want to take away your guns. 
>> Yeah, y know, I hear what you're saying, krystal, but i would say every time there has been a specific debate about the areas in the gun laws where there are gaping loopholes, again, I just cite two, the point that martin raised in the beginning of the program about how many guns are boght without any background checks and they're bought not just at gun shows but at other unlicensed dealers. There are thousands all over the country. Anytime that issue has been raised or the issue about assault weapons, martin, to your question, I think the existing ones need to be taken off the streets. We don't know the details about what happened today but we know that that would solve a lot of these kind of mass killings, anytime even those two issues, and that's just a place to toure's point where you start. There are many other places to go beyond that. But even where you start, you have not seen with all due spect, krystal, much respect from the membership, much support from the membership of the nra and certainly steadfast opposition from the national rifle association, and, again, if you look at even what the handbooks from al qaeda and terrorist groups have said, they've said because these laws are so lax, it is so easy to get these assault weapons that can kill dozens, hundreds of people in very short periods of time, this is where you want to go to the united states to get your weaponry if you want to commit some kin of heinous crime. 

[00:53:35]


>> Okay. Well, we'll continue this discussion in a moment but at 3:15 today the president gave a statement from the press room at the white house. Here is what he had to say. 
>> The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today. 
>> The president also said we're going to have to come together and take action. What do you think that means? What does he mean by that? 
>> I think he likely means gun control. I do think -- jay carney earlier in the day said today is not the day to talk about it, so the president did not mention it specifically, but the implication is clear. He has made clear in the past that he supports a renewed assault weapons ban. I would expect that's another direction he goes in, although it wasn't assault weapons used in this particular attack, but i would suspect that that is what he's referring to. 
>> Indeed. The president's press secretary has made a statement about the president's schedule. He says in the aftermath of the tragic shooting in newtown, connecticut, today, the president's event plans for wednesday in portland, maine, has been canceled. What would you like to see the president do in terms of action? 
>> I mean, I would like to see the assault weapons ban renewed. Some of these sort of things we've already talked about in this conversation, but I don't expect anything to happen. I expect sort of rhetoric to happen, and then nothing. He didn't campaign on this. The left does not push him on this issue. Maybe the far left, peopleho read "the nation" and watch martin bashir and "the cycle" -- 

[00:55:52]


>> I have to interrupt you. There's a press conference starting right now. 
>> Okay. What I'd like to do is I'd like to give you an update, a briefing on some additional details hopefully to answer some of the questions you may have. Again, as I stad before, this is an ongoing crimi investigation. We are limited as to some of the details that we can give out to you for obvious reasons. First, let it be stated that i have told you the number of deceased in the building, at the hospital, and at the secondary crime scene. It's our policy and protocol that we have to establish sitive identification of those victims. That is a time consuming process. It's something that's going to take a great deal of time. The medical examiner has already arrived on the scene. He's going to work closely with us to expedite that and get that done as efficiently as possible. The families have been assigned a trooper or an officer as a line of communication. That was done specifically to ensure the families that they have constant communication with this ongoing investigation, and they won't have to sit and watch television news or anything else. They will be the first to know any of the progress that's made as this investigation continues on. As I stated earlier, the assets that were utilized initially were certainly when the call came in, newtown police department iediately responded and immediately called for help. Surrounding local agencies sent officers and the connecticut state police sent all off duty and on duty troopers to respond so they could immediately gain access to that building and begin that search process that i alluded to before. We had the state police tactical team, k-9 teams out here, certainly trooper one in the air and it was probably to keep some of your helicopters away, quite frankly. But we had every possible asset came o to this scene the minute that this alarm came in or this call came in. And it was certainly to do everything we could to protect certainly life and property. The community has been outstanding in supporting this effort. As you can see, you have taken over their park and they're showing up, they're offering condolences. They're doing everything they possibly can to support the victims, the victims' families of this horrific tragedy. The fbi crisis management team has offered to respond, is going to respond here tomorrow to assist in crisis management, to assist not only with the families and the family members, but with all the first responders, the police, fire, ems, all working at what i described before as a very horrific and difficult e. Certainly local mental health crisis intervention teams had been on scene and have been here all of the day working and assisting and helping. I just want make it very clear that there were 18 children who were pronounced dead at the scene. There were two children who were transported to area hospital and were pronounced dead at the hospital. There were six adults that were pronounced dead at the scene. And obviously the shooter was also pronounced dead at the scene. I don't have much more detail about that secondary scene, but there is a related scene that we discovered as we were continuing the criminal investigation and specifically investigating the shooter, and you probably saw and someone asked me on the way in here about the bomb squad and, yes, we brought all our assets in in case they were needed, and when we went out with newtown officers to search or to execute search warrants or to examine other possible secondary scenes, we took all those assets with us to ensure that they were right there immediately so that we could react if it was necessary. That's about all I have as far as details are concerned. I want to give you one more briefing probably just before 6:00 we'll try to get back up here for one more briefing. I'll take a couple brief questions but I must tell you there are certain things we

>>> Well, at the top of the show, we asked you, why are you awake? John tower. 
>> Something that needs to be addressed on twitter, today's tie puts you at the top of santa's naughty list immediately. Melissa writes bill's tie and shirt combo is giving me a terrible headache. Back to bed. 
>> Paisley. Okay. Thanks for watching. Does anyone have any scissors? "Morning joe" is starting right now. 
>>> I made the decision that it was the best thing for our country for the american people that I not continue to be considered by the president for nomination of secretary of state because I didn't want to see a confirmation process that was very prolonged, very politicized, very distracting and very disruptive because there are so manyngs we need to get done as a country. 
>> Okay. We'll talk about what really happened there. We also should tell -- who tells bill karins about paisley? Donny. 
>> More of a blue-on-blue thing. 
>> More philbin 1997. 
>> Bill -- 
>> ukrainian. 
>> Bill's weeping. 
>> Your viewer was correct. Just take it off. 
>> I'll take it off. 
>> Yeah, take it off. 
>> You want me to take it all off? 
>> No, just the tie. 
>> What's wrong with you? 
>> Just the tie. Yeah. 
>> He's hiding. 
>> Give a guy moving consecutively, that's what happens. 
>> Good morning, it's friday, DECEMBER 14th. Welcome to "morning joe." With us on set, we have msnbc political analyst and vice president and executive editor of msnbc.Com, richard wolffe. 

[00:02:05]


>> How did we get him? 
>> So elegant. Here's the chairman of deutsche incorporated, donny deutsch. 
>> Incorporated. 
>> Exactly. And in washington, nbc chief foreign affairs correspondent and host of "andrea mitchell reports," andrea mitchell. She is a huge fan in jane heller. 
>> Jane heller said she looked extraordinarily elegant last night. 
>> You were remarkable last night on television. 
>> When andrea mitchell is involved in anything, it upgrades the elegance. 
>> Made me feel better. 
>> We had to counter you somehow. 
>> That's why we brought her on. So under fire, rice ends her bid to succeed hillary at state. And this is the lead. President obama knew before he picked up the phone on thursday afternoon what susan rice, his ambassador to the united nations, was calling about. She wanted to take herself out of the running for secretary of state and spare him a fight. And that's exactly, mika, what she did. 
>> So brian williams asked her about this, and here's a little bit more of her explanation of how this happened. Oh, we're standing by because -- what? You guys don't have the sound bite? Okay. 
>> I guess so. 
>> So let's roll it. 
>> I've done sunday shows many times in the past. Secretary clinton had originally been asked by most of the networks to go on. She had had an incredibly grueling week dealing with the protests around the middle east and north africa that had enveloped our embassy. She had to deal with the loss of our four colleagues in benghazi and the state department, greet the families and the bodies, and she declined to do it. It wasn't what I had planned for that weekend originally, but i don't regret doing that, brian. I think when you're a diplomat and a public official and a tragedy happens and it is related to the work that you do, it's our obligation to try to explain it as best we can to the american people, and that's what I did. 

[00:04:09]


>> Did you want the job? 
>> I would have been very honored to serve in that job, just as I'm delighted to do what I'm doing. But yes, sure. How can you not want to -- in my field -- serve at the highest possible level? 
>> I tell you what, hillary clinton, I'm sure she was tired. We all get tired. She works around the clock. But you know what she was doing. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Hillary, that's the political experience. You see it in the corporate world, the political world, the pros that have been around the block a few times. 
>> Decline. 
>> They know when to step aside. An this is -- I've seen this happen in washington time and time again. I saw it on the house level. I saw it at the white house, you know. Friends that worked at the white house where the white house wants you to do them a favor. Go out. And it's the eager ones that jump out front and the smart ones that slowly just go into the background, donny. She wanted to help the president. She wanted to help the white house. 
>> I don't think she could say no. 
>> Yes, actually, that's what hillary knows. 
>> No,no, no, I was talking about susan rice. 
>> No, but I'm saying, though, susan rice could have said no. I'm not criticizing her because she did what the intel community told her to do. But hillary dodged a bullet on that one. 
>> Financial impropriety at a big bank, you rarely see the ceo or the chairman front and center. I think the good news for rice, I think her brand is stronger than ever. I loved her answer, yes, i wanted this job. You want to serve at the highest level. We all know, we've talked about this ad nauseam. All she did was deliver the information, and they shot the messenger. This is not the last we've heard of susan rice. And I think choosing the next secretary of state, it puts the republicans back on their heels. It obviously gives obama a lot of room on the offensive end to make the moves he wants. 
>> Richard, did it bother you by how this went down? 
>> Oh, it's disgusting, the whole thing. I know you were making another comparison, but the impropriety, she was -- she has been measured for sticking rigidly to the talking points. 

[00:06:16]


>> Yes. 
>> Delivered by the cia about what was a cia operation. One of the reasons people don't want to talk about this is because not only do you have an ambassador who was taking risks, who, sadly, passed away, you had cia operatives in the middle of this. No wonder the cia was all over this. You had a witch hunt not measuring a potential secretary of state on her diplomatic credentials, on her service, on whether she could serve. It's been, let's face it, part of a witch hunt that has been driven by the conservative echo chamber. It's been effective. There is a lot of personal animosity -- 
>> but richard, can I just -- 
>> I'm just saying, this has denied the president what was clearly his top pick. 
>> Yeah. 
>> A president who just won re-election, and nobody has been able to say, susan rice would have been a bad secretary of state. It's come down to talking points on a sunday show. That's not a measure. 
>> You don't think she was maybe given a bit of disservice by hillary herself by being hung out to dry on the sunday talk shows? You don't think this was at all self-inflicted? 
>> Self-inflicted? 
>> Yeah. 
>> By the administration? I think when you have a major national security event that has really serious questions -- I'm not saying there weren't serious questions in the middle of all of this, but you have a major national security event, you've got to talk about it on the sunday shows. 
>> I don't disagree with you. I'm just saying bring some balance to this. You think this was a solely disgusting takedown by the republicans, nothing else? 
>> I don't think anything about this has been proportionate. If you want to go and investigate the security lapses in benghazi or look at what the ambassador or his security detail were doing in benghazi, you don't go after someone for that performance on the sunday talk shows. 
>> Mika's point is the culpability of the democrats as far as putting her forward in the first place versus hillary. 
>> I think, richard, you use a word that I've been thinking about a good bit as it relates to susan rice, and that's proportionality. She could be criticized. 
>> Of course. 

[00:08:17]


>> For going out and blindly following talking points which i would just say were approved by the intel community. I would be far more disturbed, and most republicans would be far more disturbed, if she was a cowboy and went out there and said a lot of things that the intel community had told her not to say. But she isn't blameless, but the proportionality is absolutely ridiculous. To judge a woman -- and you can judge her -- there's a "new york times" article saying that she is a controversial figure in washington. You can judge her for many things. You can say maybe after the 17th day on the road, maybe she would bristle a little bit more than you'd want your secretary -- we don't know. If you wanted to make that argument, you could. But to disqualify a woman on her work when she was following the TALKING POINTS fOT OF THE OBAMA White house but of the intel community, there's no proportionality. 
>> And by the way, if you're john McCain and you're hawkish about intervention on foreign policy, you want a susan rice, not a john kerry. You may feel like john kerry's my friend and who knows if I'm going to get access to susan rice, but john kerry is not your interventionist like susan rice is. 
>> No. 
>> If you want to harm rebels in libya or syria, susan rice. 
>> Since you've been covering this so closely, take us through the evolution because president obama and the white house were so defiant. And remember that one press conference where he came out very sternly talking about how much he admired ambassador rice. How did we get to yesterday? Was this all from susan rice, or was there a little nudge from the white house as well? 
>> Well, it's unclear as to whether there was a nudge, but certainly she was reading the tea leaves. And it was pretty clear for the last two weeks that the president was not as forceful as he was on that day, november 14th. WHEN john McCain had said very bluntly on the hill, she is not going to get confirmed, and the president then had his first news conference after being re-elected and just came out so strongly, dramatically and emphatically, he was angry, and they're still angry in the white HOUSE ABOUT THE way McCain and company, they think ganged up on her. I was also told that he might not have stuck with her as long AS HE DID BUT for McCain. He did not want to appear to be backing down in the face of a CHALLENGE FROM john McCain. This was a really messy episode. Whether or not she was the best nominee, I mean, joe, your point is exactly right, I think. That the benghazi issue, first of all, was not front and center. It's not her portfolio. So she was put out as the highest ranki diplomat to speak that sunday. And I think it was a job audition. I think they welcomed the opportunity to have her go out on five shows and, you know, show her stuff. And she stuck to those talking points. I was in the green room that day because I was on the same show, and we were listening and watching. And it did seem immediately to those of us watching that it was not adequately conveying the full complexity but, you know, you understand when someone is going out nervously and sticking to those intelligence points. She would have been criticized more if she hadn't. As you said. 

[00:11:32]


>> Again, listen. Her argument wasn't credible. I understand why replicans were upset with that performance. Four days, five days after we found out from general petraeus. They knew that al qaeda was involved. It was a terror attack. But let's just strip this down, richard, and talk about what it was really about. Politics. 
>> Yeah. 
>> They were upset. And you could -- you take it to the debate. And candy crowley getting it wrong on what the president said and what he said it. The white house was trying to say, in the middle of a campaign, we've got al qaeda on the run. This wasn't terrorism. And they were juggling and trying to have it both ways. Hey, did the bush administration ever play politics with intel? 
>> In 2004? 
>> It's a rhetorical question. 
>> I'm sorry. 
>> Calm down. Can we get the oxygen out? Because when richard wolffe is taking everything literally, we're in trouble. But I will say, what about colin powell? Let's say it again. I've got deep, abiding respect for colin powell. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> I do. He is my type of republican on foreign affairs. He's a realist. He urges restraint. He, more than anybody else, over the past quarter century, delivered a speech in the most critical of moments in american history and botched it every wa he could. We went to war in part because of what he said at the united nations that day. And not one republican stood up and said, colin powell is unfit to be secretary of state. 
>> And what colin powell would say today is that you should have seen the stuff that he took out of his speech that people in the cia and the broader intelligence community wanted him to say. So there are always defenses. When you are the front person and you have to deliver that, for him, that's still the blemish on his career. 
>> There are countless republicans, by the way, that have gone on sunday talk shows and blatantly screwed up or said things that didn't work out the right way. That's not even the issue. Andrea, on something you said earlier, was susan rice the most appropriate person to be talking about benghazi? I'm just wondering. 

[00:13:48]


>> It was not even on her -- she's not responsible for this, and I think you're going to see next week, when hillary clinton is at least now scheduled to appear before the senate and the house, to explain the benghazi investigation, that independent vesks led by mike mullen, i think you'll see the focus revert to the state department which is going to have to answer some tough questions about why there wasn't better security. Part of this goes to the point that it was a cia annex apart from the mission. That second building was a cia outpost, and they most likely didn't want to draw a lot of attention locally among the militias putt-putting huge amounts of security there. One other point. There is some blowback from this. The white house seems to think that because the republicans took down a woman and a woman of color that this will, you know, continue the narrative during the election campaign and hurt them in their attempts to reach out and rebrand. But I think there's another effect. I even ran into some very high-ranking women from the obama administration at the cabinet level last night. And people are upset. And this was family. Susan rice was one of those loyalists. She had worked during the campaign. And the women in this administration, at least some of them, are very upset that he didn't fight harder for her and that some of the republicans might feel that he can be rolled now because he showed weakness in withdrawing the nomination before it was even made. 
>> Go ahead. 
>> I was just going to say, president obama, I actually spoke about this last night, said rice would remain a close member of his cabinet. We don't know what yet. Maybe something on national security adviser that doesn't require senate confirmation. Here's the president. 
>> Susan's going to continue to be an outstanding u.S. Ambassador to the united nations. I hadn't made a decision about who would be my next secretary of state. There's no doubt that susan was qualifd. There are other people who are qualified as well. Her interest is in serving me but most importantly serving the country. And she's done an outstanding job. I could not be prouder with her. She will continue to be one of the top members of my national security team. 

[00:15:52]


>> We talked about the next choice. It's interesting to watch the dominos fall. A lot of people saying john kerry now is the choice. All these same senate republicans who were challenging susan rice said john kerry will breeze through. It will be an easy confirmation. Then that opens up a senate seat in massachusetts. Could scott brown come back? This opens up a whole new series of conversations. 
>> To andrea's last point, you kind of wonder if it's only six weeks after a very, very resounding win in the election and obama was not pounding his fist standing strong, you wonder what the next four years will be. 
>> He was angry. 
>> He could wen a fight and not have to back down and say this is a moral imperative on my end, it's strange. 
>> The white house was terrible defending nominees the first time around. Here you had someone who wasn't yet a nominee. They had no defense -- there are a lot of people around susan rice who are very unhappy that there was no concerted communications effort to push back against this until very, very late last week. Number one. And by the way, sources tell me there's no wink and a nod about anything. I know there's a lot of speculation, well, rice will get something else, that's not how this played out. She took herself out. There was no hint that there's going to be another job down the road. I'm sure there probably will be. She can continue in her current job, but there's not a promise she'll be national security adviser. Tom donelan who has that job right now has a good, strong hold on that job. 
>> Andrea? 
>> They do have to figure out, this team -- I think chuck hagel is going to be nominated for defense secretary. So now you've got john kerry and chuck hagel. There's going to be a woman there somewhere. Maybe it's treasury, maybe it's janet napolitano moving over to attorney general. But among those four top cap net cabinet posts, you've got to have more women, more diversity to meet the commitment that this president has made and that he wants to make. I think there were people -- there were advisers very close to the white house telling the president, this was not a fight with republicans that he could have won it. But this is not a fight he needed right now when he's got to focus on working with them to come up with agreements, obvious agreements, on budget, taxes and cuts. 

[00:17:57]


>> Andrea, what can you tell us about the dynamic between hillary clinton and susan rice? Because we'll be reading about this in the future at some point. 
>> Sure. 
>> There's no doubt, first of all, hillary stepped aside, let susan rice go out, get blindsided. And then she sat on the sidelines and said nothing in her defense. The silence was deafening. Was this payback for 2008? What was it? 
>> I actually don't think so. Hillary clinton does not do sunday talk shows. I can't recall the last one she did. If you want an interview with hillary clinton, it's either "barbara walters 10 most fascinating people" or on the road. But she does not do that round. Yes, I think it was very smart politically not to go out that weekend. 
>> Smart politically, but we lost an ambassador and three other people. And I was surprised to see susan rice sitting there, I've got to tell you. 
>> It was not the most logical choice at all. But I think that she did it willingly because she wanted to, as I say, it was a job audition to see how she would do because she knew she was the front-runner. She was his first choice at that point for secretary of state. I think that dynamic is complicated. They have worked very well together. Susan rice will tell youhat she had plenty of defense from hillary clinton both privately and publicly. I can recall four or five occasions because she was on the road so much, a lot of what she said was overseas so you didn't see it here, but she was saying it anytime she was asked, praising susan rice. You know, there's never going to be that close personal connection between samantha powers and susan rice who were with obama in '08 and hillary clinton, the person who ran against him. This is a team of rivals which has come together at the top between hillary clinton and the president. But the people in the national security team and a lot of those others who worked in that campaign are not that close with clinton. 
>> And susan rice will remember and probably can tell you how many days, hours and minutes it was, before hillary clinton would come out and actually offer a word of defense. I think the scars of 2008 are still there. Why else would you -- 

[00:20:07]


>> something else. 
>> -- Let somebody twist in the wind like that? 
>> How long did it take for john kerry to say anything? 
>> Well, I mean, that's obvious. Come on, tt's obvious. 
>> It's ironic, too, you know. 
>> What's that? 
>> It is irony, too. 
>> That's not irony. That's pretty basic, straightforward, I want the job of secretary of state. 
>> Now he feels for her. 
>> Does he? He's shocked and stunned and deeply saddened. 
>> It's painful for everyone. 
>> It is painful. 
>> All right. We have a lot of other news to cover. Coming up, former deputy campaign manager for the obama campaign, stephanie cutter. New orleans mayor mitch landrieu. "The washington post's" eugene robinson. Also "fortune" magazine dubbed her the new queen of wall street. We're going to talk to alexander lebenthal on how she quickly became one of the most powerful people in new york. 
>>> Up next, though, one of the most powerful men in washington, mike allen with the top stories in the "politico playbook." 
>>> But first -- 
>> oh, no, dude! It's about contrast, okay? If you're going with a dark -- no. 
>> No? 
>> The funeral director look? That's not what you wanted? 
>> I think you've gone from ukrainian to bulgarian. 
>> Bill, I get the feeling on your time off you wear hawaiian shirts and shorts and flip-flops. 
>> That's usually more than what I wear. Yeah. That's good. 
>> Here we go again. He can't help himself. Give this guy more than three consecutive minutes on the air, suddenly he's hef. 
>> All right. Let's just get the forecast for the weekend. Shall we? 
>> Let's do that, why don't we. New tie. Good morning, everyone. We have sunshine out there this morning. It's going to be a beautiful afternoon. Just like yesterday throughout the east from new england all the way down through the mid-atlantic. And as we continue to watch the forecast progress, a heads up to new england and throughout the south. Saturday is the better day. Sunday we'll have a chance of more rain, possibly snow mixed in with northern new england. Sunday afternoon especially, a little more gloomy. Saturday looks really nice. The storm that we're going to be tracking this weekend currently raining. It actually poured in the deserts last night through arizona and heading into new mexico. Then as we go through friday afternoon, maybe a shower or storm. Dallas, san antonio to houston. West coast also a little damp. Then the weekend forecast, as i mentioned, east coast, you look really nice on saturday. It's sunday that that storm that's up there for chicago and minneapolis saturday, that heads through the great lakes and then goes to the east coast. Overall, though, doesn't look like any big snowstorms. Even that storm I was talking about for tuesday on the east coast next week, just a big rain and windmaker for new england. It's tough to get snow this time of year. Ski resorts are hurting. You're watching "morning joe" brewed by starbucks. Honey... Ya? You notice something different about these toys?

>> From our "parade of papers," "the los angeles times."

>> It's a must-read. 
>> I like the cover, why every kid should read. 
>> Mike allen has a look at the "playbook." Hello, mike. 
>> Happy friday, willie. 
>> Let's talk immigration because the president has said this is next on deck once we get through this fiscal cliff question and the debt ceiling. Will be the next big undertaking for congress sometime in 2013. How does it shake out? 
>> Yeah, well, "politico" has learned that the president plans to really step on the gas on this. You know, the other day tom friedman was saying that we have to change our mindset about new administrations. It's not the first 100 days when you look at the agenda. You only have 100 days to get something real done in the current environment. And so the president is very much taking this approach. You know, we've been told that as soon as they get past the cliff talks, immigration was going to be what they're doing next. We're told now that the president hopes to pass it by june. That within six months, the administration would hope to pass a comprehensive immigration plan. So senator chuck schumer of new york is part of a gang of eight. Washington and the senate love their gangs. That's working on immigration. Early in the year they'll have principles. By march they'll have immigration. So already, we're told, the white house is starting to reach out to the hispanic groups that were very helpful to it during the election campaign. Also are going to work with business groups. Business wants much of the same immigration agenda that the administration does, try and put together a coalition. And as we talked there on set the other day, republicans, more than ever before, are willing to talk with the president about it, even work with him about it. They know they have to do something about this, too. 
>> And mike, what would it look like -- and this is a very detailed conversation that will require a lot more time than we have right now -- but what would a good immigration reform package look like to the president? 
>> Yeah, it's not complicated. There's two basic choices. One is the president's approach, what people in washington have called the big enchilada, the big bill, a grand slam which would not only include a guest worker program but would have some formal way for people who are now in the country illegally to get on a path to being here legally. Also would take in the dream act, young people who were born here, fix their status. The republican approach is to go more piecemeal, to do parts of it that they think that they can get passage on rather than taking the risk of a huge bill like with health care. The republicans will draw the health care analogy and say, you would have had us for lots of parts of it. It wound up beinguch more partisan by being a bill bill. That will be the fight of how to go. Democrats, we're told, are going to be very tough on republicans and say if you really care about this issue, if you really have hispanics' backs, if you really want to get well on this issue, you need to go for the big bill. We're not going to let you get away with just doing these little pieces. 

[00:31:38]


>> And andrea, republicans don't want to roll over completely for the president, but given the spread we saw in the election among latino voters, this is also something they don't want to be seen now as standing in the way of. 
>> Absolutely. And you know, the moment is so ripe for them to join the president and come up with a big approach. Because doing it piece by piece is not going to get any of them the kind of political leverage and the legacy advantage that certainly the white house is seeking. This is the moment, but it will take the kind of political skill that they lacked -- the white house lacked -- in trying to push for health careinitially. They have to reach out and be much more creative as they try to build this coalition. 
>> And mike, as you say, this is something business leaders want, too. There's a big economic question there. Mike allen with a look at the "playbook." Mike, thanks so much.

>>> Time for some sports. The eagles' dismal season continued last night against the bengals. In the first quarter, mat McBRIAR TRYING TO GET A PUNT Off, but it's blocked by his own teammate who was pushed back into the punter. The bengals recover just outside the 10 yard line. Oh, no. 
>> Come on. 
>> That rivals sanchez. 
>> The butt fumble? 
>> The butt fumble. martin McNutt pushed back. Bengals down three in the third quarter as we jump ahead. Andy dalton makes a move, 11-yard touchdown gives the bengals the lead. End of the third, bryce brown takes the handoff, simply leveled by pat sims. Wallace gilberry. Bengals scored 24 unanswered in the second half. They win 34-13. They're now 8-6. Cincinnati holding down the last wild card spot in the afc. And the misery in philadelphia continues. 
>>> Baseball now, josh hamilton finally got the big contract he was looking for -- 
>> by the way, chateau marmont, the suite, not going to be available for the next couple years, I'm told. I just checked. 
>> Booked up? 
>> Yep. 
>> Five years. 
>> Why could it be booked up? Who is going to rent out the suite for five years? 
>> Let's see, the los angeles angels reportedly have signed josh hamilton to a five-year deal worth 125 million bucks. 
>> He's going to l.A. That explains a lot. 
>> Second highest salary in the big leagues behind only a-rod. A-rod has the hhest salary in major league baseball. 
>> That's worked out well. 
>> They've confirmed that news, hamilton leaving texas but said hamilton did not give the rangers a chance to match the angels' offer before he took the deal. One former angel upset, his former club didn't pull out the checkbook for him, torii hunter now with the detroit tigers tweeted yesterday, "i was told money was tight, but I guess arte had money hidden under a mattress. Business is business, but don't lie." That's torii hunter, the former angel, complaining he thought he should have been. So hamilton joins pujols and mike trout in l.A. They missed the playoffs last year. We'll see if they make this year. 

[00:39:10]


>> Do you think they have something? In the contract? 
>> He's all good now. 
>> I thought he had an episode last year. 
>> We all have our episodes. 
>> That's a bad sign. His body is a lot older than his years. Bad sign. 
>> Well, and he phoned it in during the playoffs last year, and he had an episode last year, if remember correctly. 
>> Yeah. He had a lapse. 
>> Yeah. 
>> But he's been -- 
>> it was at arlington. 
>>> Great game at the garden last night if you're a knicks fan.

>> Carmelo anthony, donny was there, unstoppable in the first quarter. 'Melo had 22 points in the first quarter, five fewer than the entire lakers team.

[00:46:07]


>> Another dissolve. Ah. 
>> That was nice. That was nice. 
>> Great. 
>> That was. Right now, everyone's open to the idea of change. The party can either go the way of the whigs or they can straighten up and fly right, get serious and make their philosophy feel new again and pick candidates who can win. But party leaders should -- come on, guys. I'm reading a serious column here, don't laugh. Everything moves faster now. There's no particular need to let positions evolve because they've already been quietly evolving for years. Though people didn't always feel free to say so. Okay, that's good. Thank you. Here's the money line, willie. 
>> Here it is. 
>> Here's the money line. For the past ten years, the party has operated under an ethic of questioning the team is disloyal, dissent is disloyal, as is criticism. There has been a recipe not for peace but for disaster, which is WHAT WE SAW ON NOVEMBER THE 6th. Now, if we can dissolve back to the capitol. Look at that. He was ahead of me. 
>> Joe, I know I'm just a guest. Have you ever tried to track under the conversation? You guys, can you kind of roll the music as we're talking? 
>> Like we do during sports? 
>> So people there's a piano player off to the left. Give it a little loungy feel, yeah. 
>> So richard wolffe -- thank you for that, donny -- this is what I've experienced for the past ten years. I love my party. I don't think they've been conservative enough when it comes to spending over the past ten years. I've been critical of that and foreign policy, critical of a lot of areas saying they're not conservative enough, actually, and I've still been killed, right? Peggy's line here, for the past ten years, the party's operated under an ethic of questioning the team is disloyal, dissent is disloyal, as is criticism. This has been a recipe not for peace but for disaster. I could pick seven different times since september where i said we're in trouble, guys. We're in trouble. Hey, guys. I started in early september. I said the convention was bad. Having clint eastwood talking in primetime while the democrats were killing us. And every time you stated that everybody knew outside the washington political class, you got killed. You got killed on talk radio. Any conservative did. You get killed on the blogs. You get killed even in some mainline publications which is really distressing to me, not because of me, I don't care because I knew I was right and i knew they were wrong, distressing because, you know, the conservative sort of thought, you know, institutions were just blindly lining up behind a guy who had a terribly flawed campaign. And that's been our problem for ten years. 

[00:48:54]


>> Yeah, look. The litmus test things, the worry about the primaries, it's understandable in some ways, but you've got to be more inclusive. When you think about how rahm emanuel and nancy pelosi built up that big democratic majority 2006 on, you're looking at a bigger group of people, more centrists, more conservative democrats coming into the fold. That's how you run these regional races, where you have to have candidates who have a different line, whether it's gun control or tax cuts or abortion rights. I mean, the democrats had to open it up to get a bigger, stronger coalition together, and that's how they could get some things done. 
>> And that's what the republicans need to do because donny, you know, as far as marketing goes, what works in northwest florida for me does not work, as I've said a billion times, in the suburbs of philadelphia. 
>> Right. 
>> In parts of the i-4 corridor, in all the swing areas that republicans now are losing. 
>> Let's go back to -- let's rewind the clock and you're playing to south carolina and you've got a primary, and 20% of the base of the fringe votes. So how do you play that game, though? 
>> Listen, you're a strong conservative. That's the thing. You stand up to the freaks on the far right. 
>> And you say okay, I'm pro-choice -- 
>> no, no listen. No. But I'm not pro-choice. >>Okay. 
>> Right? And a lot of times, it's not about these social issues. It's about extremists coming in and saying, you know, that barack obama is a marxist when swing voters know, he's not a marxist. They may disagree with him thinking the federal government should be involved, but somebody goes out and says oh, he's a communist, a marxist, a racist, he's this, he's that. 
>> What's your response? 
>> You say, I've got great respect for the president. 
>> Okay. 
>> All the things I've said here every day, I like him as a man. He's a great father. He's a great husband. I just disagree with him on policy. 
>> Pro-choice? 
>> I think he's wrong. What? 
>> Pro-choice? 

[00:50:55]


>> No, I'm not pro-choice. 
>> That's where you then get into trouble. 
>> No, no. Donny, no, it doesn't. You need to stop going to manhattan cocktail parties. Chris christie's pro-choice, and he's got a 72% approval rating in new jersey. You can be pro-choice and still win. Just like you can be a democrat and be pro-life and still win if you know how to reach out to your people. 
>> On a national stage. 
>> Let me tell you something. The chattering class is obsessed over social issues. But, you know, I will say this. This is one thing that george w. Bush got, richard. He understood, he could be pro-life, he could be against gay marriage, but it was important for him, he started his campaign -- I remember back in 2000, it confused a lot of people, he went from one minority neighborhood to another minority neighborhood to another, and it wasn't because he thought he was going to get minority votes. It was because he was sending a message to suburban white women, saying I'm not a hater. I want to reach out to all americans. And that has been so absent from this party. 
>> Hard to remember, but his first piece of domestic legislation, maybe his biggest, ted kennedy, education reform. 
>> Education reform. And again, I didn't like it, but you know what? A lot of swing voters said, okay, here's a guy who barely won an election, but he reached out to ted kennedy, a liberal lion, and passed this. Republicans have lost the ability to do that. 
>> The next primary will be interesting to watch, given the way mitt romney tried to swing right and then come back unsuccessfully. It will be interesting to see if a presidential candidate in the republican party does what you're saying. 
>> Yeah, why not? 
>> They have to. 
>> And I was in the district that jerry falwell called the most conservative in america. Every time I went up against people on the far right who said irresponsible things, I may have lost one or two voters on the far right. I picked up five or six in the middle. No democrat ever challenged me, the district that had never voted for a republican until i got elected. It's because of all the independents voted for me. All the conservative independents voted for me. That ain't happening on the national level for a lot of republicans because it's more of a tone thing, donny. 

[00:53:08]


>> Complete tone thing. And basically, people want inclusiveness, and they have to get it. They have to get it. 
>> I hope so.

And in washington, nbc news chief white house correspondent and political director and host of "the daily rundown," chuck todd. Good to have you on. 
>> Stephanie, you've recovered. How do you feel? 
>> You look rested. 
>> I'm totally recovered. 
>> Totally recovered. 
>> It's only a month ago, but it feels like years ago, doesn't it? It could have been yesterday, it could have been ten years ago, but I feel great. 
>> How do you think david looks without his mustache? 
>> He still looks like david. 
>> Without a mustache. 
>> I think it's an improvement. 
>> I think he looks a lot younger. 
>> Yeah. 
>> A little less like surviving members of the village people. I think it's really good all around, stephanie. So stephanie, I want to follow up on something I read -- i forget where it was -- but you said you were surprised that the romney people didn't push back more on thain capital attacks. You're not alone. That was the centerpiece of your campaign. He basically said, I've got gis business experience. I can fix the economy. You guys undermined that. Have you talked to anybody on the other side, why didn't you guys push back a little bit more? 
>> You know, we've talked and, you know, I certainly respect a lot of people on that campaign. 
>> Yes, of course. 
>> I still don understand, you know, he ran for senate in 1994 against kennedy. Bain was an issue. 2002, bain was not as much of an issue, but he made a pretty big declaration there that he had left the firm in '99 to go to the olympics. So he was setting down a mile marker. He ran in '08. The economy tanked. He was planning to run in 2012. His sole credential was his experience at bain. He understood the economy, he knew how to fix the economy, but they never figured out how to tell that story. You know, the attacks came, telling what we would call the real story behind bain, was never countered. In any way. 

[01:03:52]


>> What would be the counter? If you're playing for the other side, what's yoideal counter? 
>> Exactly. There were probably hundreds of deals that mitt romney was involved in. And you know, it's a presidential campaign, so your opponent picks out just a half dozen. 
>> Give me your counter. Right now, you're reporting on tv. 
>> That's kind of awkward. 
>> It's easy. Let me try -- 
>> okay. 
>> He did it during the first debate when he did so well. And I think it was his best moment of the campaign where he goes, I've been in business for 30 years. I have no idea what you're talking about. Everybody laughed. Made the president look like he was totally clueless on business. Listen. They're accusing me, not you guys, but burton saying if somebody's accusing me of killing their wife, then I've got no problem being condescending and going, hey, listen, I understand, you have absolutely no idea how to c a job. You've never paced your office in your small business at 10:00 at night on a friday night trying to figure out how you keep the doors open on the weekend. I understand you want to raise taxes because you don't have a clue. 
>> He never paced an office in a small business. That's the problem. Listen. Let me finish. It's always going to be framed as him being a big business wall street guy. It has nothing to do with good deals/bad deals. 
>> Here's the perfect example of how romney didn't get his message across. The one thing that shocked me during this campaign was every time I talked to democrats that knew romney on wall street, behind closed doors, they'd go, he was incredible. What he did at bain was revolutionary. He changed the way we did business. I've never seen a guy put together deals like him. I was flying with a woman that worked in the business that said, listen, I would never vote for him in a million years. I have never seen a man in 20 years on wall street pick winners like mitt romney picked winners. It was bizarre. He had this sixth sense. 
>> That's not appealing to a voter, deals and picks winners. 
>> Donny, he knows how to fix things, okay? This was a message. 

[01:05:56]


>> They just conceded the argument, I agree with you that it was a very good argument for us that he's part of the problem and not part of the solution. Look what people like him did to our customer a few years ago and we're still digging out from it. There was a way for them to at least lessen the blow. For every deal we pointed out, there were probably 20 other deals. They turned that company around and now it's profitable and boosting communities. And there are examples of that. And, you know, he should have just been up front about it. 
>> You're still an investment guy, not a builder. There's a difference. 
>> They just backed off bain altogether, but it was a core piece of his biography. You couldn't back off. They tried to touch it at the convention. And had they given that more lift, the guys that were telling the story, you know, they could have made an indent, I think. 
>> All right. Chuck todd, I'm going to give you a choice. Susan rice or fiscal cliff? 
>> You pick. What have you guys been enjoying? 
>> I think the major shake-up in the administration has been the talk of the morning. Susan rice made her case with brian williams last night as to why she ended up on "meet the press" doing those talking points that seemed to have touched off a firestorm that ultimately ended her nomination. She backed out. Here she is talking to brian williams. 
>> I withdrew my name because i think it's the right thing for the country, and I think it's the right thing for the president. And putting those things together, that makes it the right thing for me and my mily. I've, all my life, been a public servant. I'm not a political person at my foundation. I just want to, as I've had in acaia a think tanks and two temples in this administration of this government tried to do the right thing, and that's what I'm going to continue doing. 
>> Did you want the job? 
>> I would have been very honored to serve in that job, just as I'm delighted to do what I'm doing. But yes, sure. How can you not want to -- in my field -- serve at the highest possible level? 
>> Chuck todd, she -- you just heard her say she really wanted the job. What do you think happened? 
>> Oh, I think she -- I think she and I think some of her friends told her, this is going to be hard. That it wasn't clear-cut. The president was leaning her way. I'm not saying he was leaning against, but I think that one thing that I would caution folks on, I don't think this was a -- there's been this assumption that this was a done deal, that the president's first choice was susan rice. I do not get the sense that that -- there was certainly a contingent of susan rice supporters. Inside the white house. I think that there is a lot about susan rice philosophically when it comes to her toughness and where she's -- where her passions lie in diplomacy. She's, in many ways, a little more of an interventionist than john kerry. I mean, the irony of all this when it comes to the folks that were the most critical of susan rice in the republican party in the senate, in particular john McCAIN AND LINDSEY GRAHAM, IF You look at the records of susan rice versus john kerry, you would assume that ideologically susan rice, a little bit closer TO a McCain or a graham, a little more of an interventionist, if you will. Think about where she was on libya. Where john kerry, much more cautious, as many veterans are when it comes to military conflicts, when it comes to u.S. Intervention. So I think that, you know, the president certainly was getting advice saying, this is going to be a tough lift. You can get her confirmed. But just keep that in mind. You've got a lot of issues to go through, congress. And if you don't think she is the best person over and above everybody else, ask yourself whether you want that kind of fight or not. So look, I think that susan rice handled this very well. And now his position -- the next big opening is hers. 

[01:09:44]


>> You're our political director, chuck. What does this do to the republican party? Who got absolutely skewered in the last campaign, especially among voters who were women of color. What does this do? john McCain, lindsey graham, kelly ayotte picking this fight with susan rice for basically following the talking points the intel community gave her? 
>> Well, I do think there are going to be some hardcore supporters of susan rice who believe that this was done unfairly. That she was a victim of this. That she was a victim of a feeding frenzy of a group of folks, whether it was on talk radio, whether it was on other conservative outlets who were attempting to make her the story, make her the issue instead of going where it should have been, which is there clearly was some sort of intelligence breakdown. A problem in the intelligence community. A problem in the intelligence community that we thought we were trying to solve post-9/11. That was the issue here. She was just -- got turned into a punching bag. Did it go over the top? And I think that there might be some introspection there. I don't think there's any long-term hits on that front. I do think what's interesting for the president is the three big jobs now openings, treasury, defense and state. The front-runners are all white men. John kerry at state, chuck hagel at defense, jack lew at treasury. I've talked to senior officials who said he is going to have a cabinet that is both highly qualified and that looks like america. 
>> I mean, that looks like parts of america. 
>> It certainly looks like parts of america. 
>> Like republican parts of america. 
>> I wouldn't be surprised if you see them saying, are there some women candidates that we didn't vet as closely maybe for defense, michelle florinoy, if she gets a second look. Brainerd who's got geithner's old job at treasury, if she gets a second look, laura tyson, somebody from the clinton years. 

[01:12:00]


>> Stephanie, you have done these confirmation battles before. You're not part of the administration now. 
>> That's right. 
>> But two questions for you. One, could the, should the white house have mounted a more vigorous defense or any kind of defense of susan rice beyond what the president said at the start of that cabinet meeting? And secondly, haven't they opened themselves up to the next battle? Because republicans have got some blood in the water here. They can go after the next nominee, right? 
>> No. Well, I think in terms of the defense of susan rice, let's not forget how all of this happened. It started in the heat of a presidential campaign. She was clearly being used as a scapegoat to get at the president. And the president made it clear that he wasn't going to let that happen. But I think that susan saw the writing on the wall and didn't want to make this about her. And there were too many things that we have to get done. She did the right thing. And the incredibly honorable thing. Are we all mad about it? Absolutely. You know, she's amongst the most talented people that we have in this government. And we can't afford to lose her. In terms of the next battle, i think, actually, they've weakened their hand. This is the battle. And it just ended. 
>> They won't do it again? 
>> I think certainly if they do, they do it at their own peril. 
>> How about, stephanie, the point being -- and obviously the president has bigger fights to fight, particularly the one coming up over the next couple of weeks. The one criticism from his base, from the first term, was he wasn't strong enough. He didn't smack these guys back. And here he's coming with this incrible gust of wind at his back coming off an election that he won in a much more commanding way than anybody thought. And kind of people were almost rooting for him, no, do not give up on this one. I want to see what you'll look like in your second term. How about the people like my parents? I was watching them watch tv. They were disappointed. What are you doing, man? Now you got it. Why are you backing him up? 
>> On the particular susan rice issue? 
>> Yes. 
>> It seems to me that she's the one that made the decision to back off. 
>> Yeah, but his support was a little less vigorous. 

[01:14:03]


>> He hadn't made a decision on who he was going to pick as secretary of state. He has two very, very qualified people, susan rice and john kerry, that are reportedly to be the front-runners. He hadn't made his decision. He wholeheartedly defended susan rice. Her capability, her knowledge, her record. She was an incredibly important member of the administration. And she's not going anywhere. She's part of the team. 
>> I'm talking about setting a tone, you know, as a ceo, setting a tone. Even if it was a fight he didn't want to have, take the fight. Just a point. 
>> He said don't go after her, come after me. That's pretty strong. 
>> I think she ended up in a bad position and is handling it so honorably. 
>>> Let's go fiscal cliff now. President obama and speaker boehner met face to face for about an hour last night at the white house in what both sides would only describe as a frank conversation over the fiscal cliff. It came after boehner earlier in the day accused obama of dragging the negotiations out. 
>> I've been pushing all year for us to address this problem. But here we are at the 11th hour. And the president still isn't serious about dealing with this issue right here. It's this issue. Spending. 
>> If we go over the cliff, will you permit a vote to decouple that and then fight again on the debt limit? 
>> Ifs, ands and buts are like candy and nuts. If that were the case, every day would be christmas. Listen, my goal is to get to -- I know, it's going to be here real soon. My goal is to get to an agreement with the president of the united states that addresses this problem. 
>> House minority leader -- 
>> hold on a second. 
>> I really want to see this. 
>> I've just got to say this. I've got to say this. I have been very critical of the president and the president's people for going on campaign trips and not sitting down and talking with john boehner unless the president told him, hey, if it helps you go out and kick me around a little bit, do that. The president didn't give him that, okay, I'm going to check it out, that is every bit as reckless and irresponsible at this stage as I thought the president was going to pennsylvania to campaign before sitting down with boehner. Why do you, if you're john boehner and you want to avoid the fiscal cliff, why do you beat up the guy that you're going to be negotiating with later in the day? 

[01:16:14]


>> It's kind of awkward. 
>> How does that help? In fact, I'm going to start e-mailing people, see if the president gave him a pass. That's ridiculous. That's not how you do it if you want to avert the fiscal cliff. Maybe the president said, we'll play good cop/bad cop. 
>> House minority leader nancy pelosi weighed in on the negotiations, taking one important area of medicare off the table. 
>> Don't even think about raising the medicare age. We are not throwing america's seniors over the cliff to give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in america. We have clarity on that. 
>> See, now, that doesn't work either. 
>> That's not clarity. 
>> I don't think that works. 
>> You're talking about, by raising taxes on the rich, let's say they raise taxes 39.6%. 39.6%, richard wolffe. 
>> Yes. 
>> You raise $80 billion a year. 
>> Hey, that's not chump change there. 
>> Okay, but it's not even -- 
>> you know where I'm going here. That pays for eight days of how the federal government spends their money. Medicare and medicaid together, everybody that has a calculator will tell you is what bankrupts the country over the next 20 years if we don't slow down the massive rate of growth. That's just reckless and irresponsible. 
>> Over the next 20 years. 
>> That's not a long time. 
>> No, I'm not saying it's not a long time. I'm saying there's an immediate deficit issue that they have to deal with. And there's a longer-term issue they have to deal with. You could lump them all together now, but right now they can't even come up with a common talking point. 
>> You've kind of got that backwards, with all due respect. I know you're very angry and upset today. Valerie jarrett told me she's never seen you so angry, lost your head. Peterson and most of the markets will say it's not the short-term deficits we're worried about, it's the long-term debt. This economy is so massive, we can withstand trillion-dollar deficits for the next few years, but we have got to address -- stephanie, I'm sure you'll agree with me -- we've got to address the long-term debt. 
>> Should that be off the table? 

[01:18:16]


>> I think you have to do both. I think peterson and others would agree. I also think they agree you have to address the balance in our tax code. And it's fairly imbalanced now. If you are going to achieve deficit reduction, this is what the president has said since the beginning of this discussion, at the beginning of the famous debt limit discussion, all three the campaign trail, that we need to reduce our deficit, but we have to do it I a balanced way. And that's essentially what leader pelosi was saying. Don't even think about -- 
>> is that what she was saying? 
>> That's what she was saying. 
>> You're good. 
>> Don't even touch medicare if we're going to do this to pay for tax cuts for the rich. 
>> I think boehner has said, chuck todd, that the rich will be taxed. There's a question how. Can you answer the question, chuck, why john boehner went out and criticized the president while these one-on-one negotiations were moving forward? What was the play there? 
>> But they weren't moving forward, joe. That's the point. You know what last night' meeting was about? Trying to figure out how to negotiate. The most absurd part of this week is that these two guys still don't know how to talk to each other. It really is like that horrible relationship book that everybody read 30 years ago, "men are from mars, women are from venus." Obama's from mars, obama's from venus, they don't know how to talk to each other. They don't even know how to negotiate. Last night's meeting was as much trying to figure out about how are we going to do the process of this, because we seem to not trust each other. They were insulted by each other's counteroffer they thought the other side was giving them the proverbial middle finger with their offer, and the white house was totally shellshocked by this, to be honest, by the reaction of boehner to their counteroffer because they thought sunday, the first time this week that the two of them met one on one went well. So they thought, okay, they'd move. Then boehner would move. Then they'd move and boehner would move and there would be this back and forth and it didn't happen that way. These two have to figure out how to talk to each other. I don't know. Maybe they need a therapist. 

[01:20:22]


>> I was going to say. 
>> They don't know how to negotiate. 
>> There are a lot of lawyers that mediate every day. 
>> This needs a mediator. 
>> They really do need a mediator in the middle. 
>> Bring in kenneth feinberg. 
>> If you go to the other room, I'm going to sit here now and talk. Lawyers do it in insurance cases. 
>> I understand why they do what they do in public, obviously, and it's politics. But when you say they don'tw how to talk to each other. 
>> They don't. 
>> These are two smart men. I don't understand the concept, as I said, literally whether it is a mediator, what do you mean, they don't know how to talk to each other? There's a billion conversations a day going on between two people who have different opinions. And obviously, this is the high-stakes -- I don't understand what that means. 
>> It's more of the -- one doesn't -- so you have boehner who doesn't understand why the president won't just help him out of his own box. And you have the president that doesn't understand why boehner won't come and list the entitlement. This is all about -- I mean, to get into a policy position here a minute, this is all about who's going to actually write the entitlement cuts? The president's going hey, man, not me. I'm not doing it. You want to have medicare and medicaid, you do it. I might sign it. I might agree to it. And boehner's sitting there going, you're going to make me say uncle on tax rates? I'll agree to tax rates, probably. Don't make me say it. But boehner's going, I don't want to write these entitlement cuts either. Because by the way, they're not very popular in the republican party. I mean, if you want to talk about the fundamental -- the problem here, it's who's going to own the entitlement reform piece of it. 
>> Who's going to own the bad news? 
>> Yes. 
>> Stephanie, by the way, anybody that's worked in congress, worked on the hill, worked on either side of the hill, there is, for the most part, a huge cultural disconnect between republicans and democrats in washington. I was one of the freaks and voted one of the most conservative records, but i always sat with democrats. I was alone over there. And democrats never came over to talk to republicans. There's, like, a huge cultural divide. 

[01:22:33]


>> Yeah. I mean, it's not -- it's not the washington that we remembered. 
>> Right. 
>> Where people worked across the aisle. I worked for ten kennedy, and i was always reaching across the aisle. One thing I'll say to address what chuck was talking about, the president has put entitlement reforms on the table. 350 billion worth over the course of the next ten years. It's more than simpson-bowles. So his details, ours, I'm not on the campaign anymore, his details are on the table with some pretty tough decisions on how to reform entitlement, medicare and medicaid. Now, boehner wants to take that further. So he has the burden to show where he wants to take it further. He wants to take cuts further. We've already cut $1 trillion out of the budget. He wants to take that further. He has the burden to show where he wants to take it further. So I don't think -- these guys might not know how to talk to each other, but I don't think boehner has any idea how he's going to put something on the table and bring his caucus along. I think ultimately that's where the problem is. Because details have been shared from the president to house republicans. It's now their turn to come back with some details of what they're talking about. 
>> All right, stephanie cutter, thank you so much. Great to have you. 
>> Thanks for having me. 
>> Good to have you back on. Chuck, we'll see you on "the daily rundown" right after "morning joe." 
>> Chuck, who do you have on? 
>> My exit interviews on, retiring senator jeff binghamton on, all these guys have interesting takes on what's wrong with today's senate. Why ain't it like the good old days? 
>> They say always more when they're leaving. 
>> Yes, they do. That's why I love these. Finally you get the truth.

>>> I've done sunday shows many times in the past. Secretary clinton had originally been asked by most of the networks to go on. She had had an incredibly grueling week dealing with the protests around the middle east and north africa that had enveloped our embassy. She had to deal with the loss of our four colleagues in benghazi and console the whole state department, greet the families and the bodies. And she declined to do it. It wasn't what I had planned for that weekend originally, but i don't regret doing that, brian. I think when you're a diplomat and a public official and a tragedy happens and it is related to the work that you do, it's our obligation to try to explain it as best we can to the american people. And that's what I did. 
>> Welcome back to "morning joe." Here with us now from washington, the moderator of "meet the press," david gregory along with pulitzer prize-winning columnist eugene robinson. And here in new york, from bloombgaret carlson along with donny deutsch and richard wolffe. We were talking with andrea mitchell about the interview on "meet the press" that really, i guess you could argue, led to this moment, althoughhere are other counterarguments that maybe she wasn't as much in the running. Having said that, I felt watching that -- I didn't understand why susan rice was chosen to do that interview. And andrea mitchell seemed to back that up saying it wasn't purview. 

[01:29:11]


>> I have a slightly different view. I've had ambassador rice on the program prior to that on national security matters. I mean, she's a key member of the national security team. This is all borne out by what we know about how close she is to president obama and that what an early adviser on foreign policy he was to her. So she's always been in the room. She's always been a key player. I think in this particular instance, it was a very tricky time. Don't forget, there were a lot of questions about whether the administration was soft pedaling what the attack in benghazi actually was. Why weren't they calling it a terror attack? Was the criticism that was coming from a lot of different quarters. So you're right, secretary clinton declined to come on that morning. It's often difficult to get secretary clinton on the program on "meet the press" or any sunday program. And ambassador rice was available. So I don't think it was unusual that she was there, but it doesn't detract from the fact that she was in a difficult position. Her defenders said it again last night. She was very clear to caveat what she was saying about what was not known. If there was a sense that she was putting her thumb on the scale describing this as a spontaneous protest rather than a terror attack, I've talked to people inside the white house who say, look, that's on us. That's on how we decide it as an administration to communicate this, this isn't on her. But in the end, the criticism that stuck to her that would have made this such a tough process is that she, according to critics, played this as more of a political operative and not just purely as a diplomat. She vigorously pushes back against this, as do others, but that's what really sort of prevailed at the end of the day. And I think what would have made this nomination very long and potentially costly to the white house. 
>> Eugene robinson, just your take, if you could, on the events of the past 24 hours and pain your instinct on what you think really happened. 
>> Well, susan rice went on david's show and on other shows just to recite the talking points that had been given her by the intelligence committee. That's a completely bogus reason, I think, for her to have had all this grief and ultimately to have to withdraw. So I don't blame her in this, really. I wonder why the white house, if president obama really did want susan rice as secretary of state. I'm not convinced that he had made that decision. You know, why didn't he make the nomination? Then she would have had a posse around her. She would have had the weight of the administration around her and I think would have been in a much better position to survive these sort of attacks. And if the president hadn't made up his mind, why didn't he, given the fact that his close adviser for a long time now was in this situation? I think he could have -- he could have or should have done something to avoid this sort of end. 

[01:32:03]


>> Margaret carlson, I just want your take, first of all, on what's happened but also just touching on the conversation we had before we took to the airwaves in the break about women and being aggressive and how we need to -- and there's a lot of successful women are extremely aggressive, but it was interesting in the days after the "meet the press" interview when her name was coming up as a potential for secretary of state, everybody described her as so in your face, aggressive as if it was so surprising. 
>> Yeah, sharp elbowed. 
>> Could be that way, it has nothing to do with what happened here. What is your take, and do you think, as I feel, that she was put in a bad position when she went on "meet the press" that day. 
>> You know, in other fields, as a woman, you can be sharp and aggressive and blunt, as she was described. But you really can't so much in politics. The model is to be more conciliatory. In fact, there's -- 
>> is that hillary clinton? Would we describe hillary clinton that way? 
>> More than susan rice. I think, yes. 
>> She's pretty blunt and in your face. 
>> Really? 
>> Hillary? 
>> Yeah. 
>> I think at the very beginning hillary's problem was that she was blunt and in your face. And that all went away. I don't think she's that way now. At all.Y cases who goes on the talk shows. And hillary clinton is not a talk show person. 
>> Yeah. 
>> It just seemed -- you know, the reaction was so disproportionate. She's on a talk show. She hasn't been nominated. and McCain and senator lindsey graham decided to make her this cause. 
>> David? 
>> Yeah, I think -- well, i think that's true, that there's no question that all of the arrows about benghazi got era of foreign policy and national security. These are the big philosophical questions. Not about what the talking points were. And everybody involved in this will concede that. I think where she got caught up in this particular area is as somebody who became prominent in describing this in a way that a lot of people felt was totally soft pedaling what actually happened. The president never answered completely what was going on. He said there's an investigation. We'll wait for that. So there was not, as gene points out, a vigorous defense of susan rice in her particular role while these questions kept mounting. And there's one other element of this. You know, in this town, there's also the role of some personal diplomacy and falling on the sword and whatnot. Susan rice went to capitol hill to meet with key senators. And apparently those meetings -- not just apparently, I can tell you, they did not go well. Who's to blame for that? I can't say or make a judgment about. But that gambit did not work. When susan collins came out and was another voice even separate from McCain and graham said, look, she appeared to play more of a political role than a diplomatic role, and I've got a problem with that. That only fueled this further. 

[01:35:29]


>> Richard. 
>> Margaret, you've known john McCAIN FOR A LONG TIME, WRITTEN About him for many years. You know, there's a lot of speculation that maybe he was getting worried about losing his chairmanship on the armed services committee and the many requests he gets for himself to be on the sunday talk shows. Why did he do this? 
>> You know, he has some leftover anger, perhaps, from his own campaign. And did you see him blanch -- i mean, this is a small washington moment, but when john kerry made -- you know, he made the little joke about john kerry, calling him mr. Secretary, revealing what he wanted. And kerry says, "thank you,r. President." And he's ashen. That's still, I think, roils senator McCain. And so this anger kind of spills over. Not to diminish talk shows. I mean, this is the most important place in the universe, right? And "meet the press" as well. But she said these things on a talk show. And they became as big as colin powell before the u.N. Or condoleezza rice and the mushroom clouds. I mean, when these figures are testifying. It was such a -- you know, they WERE LOOKING -- senator McCain was looking for something. 
>> He didn't run against susan rice in a presidential election. So why take it out on susan rice? 
>> She's obama's surrogate in this case. 
>> Right. 
>> David? 
>> Richard, I know the point that you're making -- and again, this is not about the merits -- but McCain and graham and then senator ayotte, I mean, they were looking and are still looking to blame this administration about what happened in benghazi, they do not feel they've been forthcoming. There's huge policy issues with how we went into libya. So I'm not surprised that they went after a surrogate of the president to not only go after those particular points but the broader benghazi approach. I mean, the idea that there's a proxy for the president who, you know, is getting a lot of the blame, I don't know that it's particularly surprising. Again, that's not a judgment about the merits of this particular case. But, I mean, I think that part's not surprising. 

[01:37:30]


>> Gene, really quickly, a lot of people around the table said she did this completely on her own. There was no nudge from the president, no potential deal going forward. I'm a cynic. I believe there had to be a little nudge here. 
>> Maybe there was a nudge, maybe there was a wink, maybe a shrug of a shoulder, I don't know. But clearly I think she was reading what she perceived to be writing on the wall. And, look, there was the fact that she hadn't yet been nominated. So she keeps looking over her shoulder, and the reinforcements don't come. And so she's just hanging out there. You know, one other interesting thing about this is how the senate tends to prot its own and to lovitz own. And the obvious question, i think, that benghazi poses is about security at state department insulations in dangerous parts of the world. And that's a queion for hillary clinton. Secretary clinton to answer. And it's not being posed in the same sort of sharp way towards its former member of the senate. For that matter, the senate seems to be terribly eager to confirm one of its own, john kerry, as the next secretary of state. So it really is an exclusive club. 
>> Mika, I also think if the president really wanted to take her out of this state of limbo and double down on her as his pick, even his potential pick, he probably could have come out in the last couple of weeks and really answered a lot of these questions, tried to take some of the heat off of her. I think it had to be clear to her that he was keeping some options open, did not want to be penned in. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> By them sort of daring him to nominate her. And I think that had to factor into her thinking. 
>> And hillary clinton 
>> right, until last week when she did come out rather notably to defend her. Some people think that was too late, but she was there doing that. 
>> She did say she's my indispensable partner, but it was a little late and she was hanging out in kind of a limbo. 

[01:39:30]


>> It was rough. 
>> I learned today hillary clinton doesn't have sharp elbows. Amazing. 
>> There are sharp elbows and there are sharp elbows. 
>> Razor 
>> she's very sensitive, mika, to elbows. 
>> You don't even know it's happening to you when hillary clinton's doing it. David, thank you. Who do you have on this sunday? 
>> Also, as you know, secretary clinton testifies on benghazi next week, so I'll talk to lindsey graham who led the charge against rice and senator dianne feinstein has been not too happy with the way graham has described some of this with rice. Also, who's going to blink in the fiscal cliff. We'll get into that.

>>> let me tell you something, the mayor of new orleans invites you down, donny, you go. 
>> I'm in. 
>> You don't say no. 
>> We've got the super bowl, we've got jazz fest. 
>> I'm in. 
>> Here with us now, democratic mayor of new orleans, mitch landrieu. This weekend, new orleanians are bringing some southern hospitality to new york to help hurricane sandy victims. It's really good to have you on the show. 
>> Thank you very much for having me. Good morning to you. 
>> Let's explain what we were talking about before, your dad, famous legendary mayor of new orleans, director of hud. 
>> How old were you? 
>> That's a good question. I was 10 when he became mayor. And then I was 18 when he finished. I was up in washington in college when he was there, so it was a great time. A lot of fun. 
>> We probably went to the easter egg roll together. 
>> Well, we may have be 
>> I bet you guys were. So let's talk about it. Let's move beyond the very, very small bubble of washington elitism and expand it out a little bit, mr. Mayor. You know something about suffering. Your people, the people of new orleans know something about surviving the impact of a devastating hurricane. Before we talk about sandy, let's talk about new orleans. How are you guys doing? 
>> We're doing great. Katrina, you know, as you know, just upended everybody's lives. We had 500,000 structures damaged, 250,000 people lost their homes. The whole city was flooded for a long time. 
>> A lot of people left. 
>> A lot of people left. It upended everybody's lives. The rest of america came out and said we can't lose the soul of america, and this country dug down deep and helped us a lot. And the people of new orleans always remember that. We have in the past seven years done amazing things. The people of new orleans -- and you'll find the people here are going to be the same way -- they're tough, resilient, not going to give up, and they're going to keep going. And we're rebuilding the city. And we're getting accolades for the work that we've done. We're getting ready to host the super bowl in a couple of months. We've hosted more super bowls than any other place. And the city of new orleans is steaming we have won accolades for the work we have done. The people in new orleans really feel like they want to pay back what happened. I mean, one of the interesting stories is one of the first thing is to help with the rockaways, folks up here steamed down to new orleans. So the people of new orleans wanted to say, we understand the agony better than anybody else, but we want to pay back what you have done for us. So we had a concert. We had 800 linemen from our energy company up here and we have had firefighters working for the past couple of months. So we're heading to the rockaways tomorrow with our chefs to help feed people are the rockaways. Just to say don't give up, it's going to get better. 

[01:51:01]


>> It's really a nightmare what these people are going through, and in new york city, after 9/11, you can go two blocks and it's two different worlds. You go to these places and my husband covers it for new york city, and he's all the out on staten island in new york and it's like the day after. 
>> The media, the parade passes at some point, but yet the devastation is there, and the devastation is there for you guys still seven years later. 
>> What was is there's the big event, then there's the rescue, then there's the immediate after the rescue, and then there's the rebuild. It's shattering the confidence that they had and what life was going to bring them and rebuilding that takes time. Here's the wonderful part about it and I think people here probably experienced the same thank we did. In the darkest hours, you find really bright lights of people ing things and the courage that you see in people helps you to keep walking. When you're saying be patient, means have the faith and the courage to know, just hang in there and it will get better. 
>> One of the pieces of reconstruction, is it's taking a long time for new orleans. And obviously people just want things back to the way they used to be and it never quite happens that way. So mistakes made for people in this area, what should they do? 
>> The first thing we learned, we learned it during katrina and we relearned it during isaac is that the nation as a whole is not nearly as resilient as she should be. Ricity and the energy grid in the united states is everything. All three of the governors in this area and the mayors in congress right now talking about relief, they're not just talking about the amount of money that they need, but the mechanism of how to get that money to the ground faster is something we have to get better at. Fema is much better than it was after katrina, but getting the money on the ground when it matters, that's another one. The third thing I would say is that you need to kind of take a minute and step back, is because your first instinct is to grab that which you knew, that's all you want, you want to go back to ly like it was. Build it back like it always should have been, but not what might have been built because of bad planning. In new orleans, one of the fundamental things that we did, and by the way, it took us a while to get there because people's homes were destroyed and it was hard. But we got into the conversation that we were not going to build new orleans back like she was, as wonderful a city as she was at the time. Katrina didn't cause all of our problems, it just brought the problems to light. We decided that we were going to take a step back and build a city that new orleans always should be. So we're rebuilding to our 300th anniversary in 2018. When it's cold, the poor are colder, and when it's hot, the pore hotter. And the people who have get back faster than the people who don't. You all watch out people dance around each other and get to a better decision.

>>> Good friday morning, it's 8:00 a.M. On the east coast, 5:00 p.M. On the west coast. Taking a live look at new york she did. 
>> Brian williams asked her about this and here's a little bit more of her explanation into how this happened. 
>> I have done sunday shows many times in the past. Secretary clinton had originally been asked by most of the networks to go on. She had had an incredibly grueling week dealing with the protests around the middle east and north africa that ha enveloped our embasies. And she declined to do it. It wasn't what I had planned for that weekend originally. But I don't regret doing that, brian, I think when you're a diplomat and a public official and a tragedy happens and it is related to the work that you do, it's our obligation to try to explain it as best we can to the american people and that's what I did. 
>> Did you want the job? 
>> Wld have been very honored to serve in that job, just as I'm delighted to do what I'm doing. But yes, sure, how can you not want to -- in my field, serve at the highest possible level. 
>> I tell you what, hillary clinton, I'm sure she was tired. We all get tired. She works around the clock. But she knew what she was doing. Hillary, that's the political experience you see in the corporate world you, see in the political world, the pros that have been around the block a few times, they know when to step aside. I have seen this happen in washington time and time again. I saw it on the house level, i saw it at to the white house, know, friends that worked at the white house, where the white house wants you to do them a favor. Go out, and it's the eager ones that jump out front and the smart ones that slowly just go into the background, donnie. And she wanted to help the president. Shwaedo help the white house. 

[02:05:18]


>> I don't think she could say no. 
>> Yes, actually that's what hillary knows. 
>> I was talking about susan rice. 
>> Susan rice could have said no. I'm not criticizing her, because she did what the intel community told her to do. But hillary dodged a bullet on that one. 
>> When there's impropriety at a big bank, you rarely see the ceo answering questions. I loved her -- we all know we have talked about this ad nauseam, all she did was deliver the information and they shot the messenger, and this is not the last we have heard of susan rice. And now choosing the next secretary of state, it puts the republicans on their heels. 
>> Were you bothered by what went down? 
>> The whole thing, it was disgusting, but the impropriety, she's been measured for st ing rgidly talking about this. No wonder the cia was all over the talking points. And on top of this, you have what is sadly an effective witch hunt, not to mention an measuring a potential secretary of state on her -- there is a lot of personal animosity. Dry? You don't think this is self-inflicted? 

[02:07:31]


>> By the administration? I think when you have a major national security event, that has seriousquess, I'm not saying there weren't serious questions in the middle of all of this, you have a major national security event, you've got to talk about it on the falk ows. 
>> Do you think this was solely a disgusting take down by the reblicannd nothing else? 
>> I don't think anything about this has been disproportionate. If you want don't go after someone for that performance on use a word that I have been thinking about a good bit, as it relates to susan rice and that's proportionality, she could be criticizededy going out and blindly following talking points, which I should just say were approved by the intel community. Most republicans would be far more disturbed if she was a cowboy that went out there and said a lot of things that the intel communi had told her not to say. But that said, she isn't blameless, but the proportionaly is absolutely ridiculous. To judge a woman, and you can judge it in the "new york times" article saying th she is a controversial figure in washington. You can judge her for many things, you can say maybe after the 17th day on the road, maybe she would bristle a little bit, more than what you want your secretary of state to do. We don't know. But ifou want to make that argument you could, but to disqualify a woman's life work based on what she said on a sunday talk show when she was following the talking points, not of the obama white use, but of the intel lens community? 
>> IF YOU'RE john McCain and your hawkish on foreign policy, you want a susan rice not a john kerry. John kerry is not your interventionist like susan rice is. If y want to arm rebels in libya or syria, susan rice is your person. 

[02:09:49]


>> Take us through the evolution a little bit because president obama and the white house were so deiant and they said they were yesterday. How did we get toyesterday? Was this all from susan rice? Or was there a little nudge from the white house as well? 
>> Well, it's unclear as to whether there was a nudge, but certainly she was reading the tea leafs and it was pretty clear for the last two weeks that the president was not as forceful as he was that day, and the president had his first news conference after being re-elected. And just came out so strongly, dramatically, emphatically, he was ang and they're still angr the white hse about THE way McCain and company they think ganged up on her. I was told that he might knot have stuck with her as long as HE DIDUT for McCain, he did not want to appear to be backing down in the face of a challenge FROM john McCain. This was a really messy episode, and whether or not e was the best nominee, your point, joe, is exactly right I think. E benghazi first of a was not front and center. Sohe was put out ashe highestng diplomat to speak that sunday. I think it was a job audition, i think they welcomed the unity to have her go out on five shows to show her stf. She stuck to the talking points. I was on the same show and we were listening and wating and it did seem immediately to those of us watching that it was not adequately conveying the full complexi, but you understd when someone isoing out nervously and sticking to the she would have been criticized more if she hadn't. 
>> Again, listen, her argument wasn't credible, I understand why republicans wer upset about that performance, four days, five days after they found out from general petraeus that they knew that al qaeda was involved, that it was a terrorist attack. But let's just strip this down and talk about what it was really about, politics. They were upset and you take it to the debate and candy crowley getting it wrong on what the president said and when he said it, the white house was trying to say in the middle of a campaign, we have got al qaeda on the run, this wasn't terrorism, and they were juggling and trying to have it both ways. Hey, did the bush administration ever play politicsith intel? 

[02:12:24]


>> In 2004? 
>> It's a rhetorical question, calm dow can we get the oxygen out because whenichard wolf is taking everything literally, we're in trouble. I wil say, what about colin powell, I will say it again, i have deep, abiding respect for colin poll. He is my type of republican on foreign affairs, he's a realist, he urging restint. He more than anybodylse over the past quarter century, delivered a speech in the most critical of moments in amecan history and botched it every way he cld. We went to war in part because of what he said at the united nations that day and not one republican stoodp and said colin powell is unfit to be secretary of state. 
>> And what colin powell would say today is that you should have seen the stuff that he tk out of his speech that people in the cia and the broader intelligence community wanted him to say. So there are always defenses when you are the front person and you have to deliver that, for him, that's still the blemish on his career. 
>> And republicans when they go on suny talk shows and blidn' work out the right way, that's not even the issue. Andrea, is susan rice the most appropriate person to be speaking on benghazi? 
>> I think you'l see next week when hillaryon is now at least scheduled to appear before the senate and the house to explain the benghazi investigation, I think you'll see the questions revert to the state department where they're going have to answer questions about why this was-apart from the actl mission, that second building was a cia outpost and th most liky didn't want to draw a lot of attention locally among the militia by putting a huge amount of security there. And because the republicans took down a woman and a woman o color, that this will continue the narrative during the elegation campaign and hurt them in their attempts to reach out and rebrand. I think there's another effect. I even ran into some very high rag wom fro the oba administration at the cabinet level last nig and people are upset and this was family, susan rice was one of those loyalists, she had worked dun the campaign and the women in this administration, atst o them are very stayed rice would remain a close member of his cabinet, we don't kwhat yet, maybe national security susan conversations. 

[02:16:17]


>> And you kind of wonder if it's only six wee after a very, very resounding in the election, you wonder what the next four years say this is a mor imperati 
>> the white house was terrible defending nominees the first time arnd, he had someone who wasn't yet a nonee. He no defense. There are a lot of pple around susan rice who are very unhappy that there was no concerted communicatns effort to push ba agast thi very, very late lt week. An the way, sources tell me there's no wink and a nod about anything, there's a lot of speculatn at susan rice will get something else. That not how out. She took herself out, there was no hint that there would be anything else down theroad. 
>> And when we come back, a new u.S. Intelligence award says by 2030 u.S. Is not going to be the d's only superpower, what countries may be stepping to make a challenge. 
>>> Also ahead, she's bee called the new queen of wall street and one oth most powerful people in new york city, ie, maybe she c get us some balle tickets. Seriously, if she is that powerful alexandra hal will be here. And the weekend forecast, let's hope, willie,an that weather pattern tt was moving across. 
>> This is three for three now. It all started as like an tiullyincaai the weather channel online. As far as the wther go, heading into yweeken this is a big weekend to get those errands donfor the holidays. Ge stm,ook at the size of that all that bright white clouds coming off the pacific, new mexico, up into texas. 'S aretty bigstorm, dumping rain ohtn areas from x, this is the desert southwest.

So c is the most remarkable owth story i economic history. And this chart shows I back in , if you can't see it, but that'she w at the left-hand side of the graph, . Is othto25% of the world omy. And china is 2% of the world economy. And then lookt china's soaring rise, becathey have been growing at about 10% per year, where hen g at about2% 3%er year.

Economy,re investments are going, this is a pretty fundamental change, it hasn't happened in the last two century this is way. 12kw4r didn't people say the same thing about japan rising up IN THE EARLY '90s. A lot of angst in america about japan rising up. Maybe china isn't going to be on the same path at all. But america's influence is bigger than just the size of its economy, isn't it? 
>> No, of course it is. But america is 5% of the world population, it isn't 50% of the world population and when you have these megaeconomic growth rates in other places, it simply means that the u.S. Doesn't dominate in the way that many americans came to expect. But we have already seen this now, this has been decades of declining relative influence, but we have to get used to more of this, because the technology key which is the main driver of economic life is now spread all over the world.

>> Remember that? That was jim lebenthal. And according to fortune magazine the new queen of wall street. Fortune says this about alexandra, she's now arguably the highest profile woman on wall street and typically a sober suited button up female suited executive on wall street. How would you describe your mode of doing business on wall street? 
>> I think that I'm passionate, I'm outspoken, I wear my heart on my sleeve which I think is a good thing and I don't like to fade into the background. 
>> Nothing wrong with that. And you don't like to fail, i take it? 
>> I do not. I don't like hearing the word now. It doesn't filter through my brain. 
>> Did your father teach you that? 
>> He taught me passion and going out and doing whatever you wanted and doing it excellently. 
>> I want to ask you about being a woman in the position that you have and on wall street. But first let's talk about the fiscal cliff. Where do you think it should be going? 
>> I'm as disturbed as anyone else is. 
>> Are you hopeful? 
>> I'm always hopeful and right now hearing what's in the background does have me worried. And if we do go over the cliff, s him pact for all the municipality. That's going to affect every municipalities. 

[02:37:08]


>> Who do you think will bear more responsibility if we do go over the cliff? 
>> I think it will be equal, I'm just struck by how washington seems to be so distanced from what the afternoon person thinks. So I think that they're really discourage. 
>> There are a lot of families who are following this, richard, and who find it like they're a speck out in the middle of the universe and what is washington doing to them? 
>> And they're playing politics. They're all of us positioning, but there will be real impacts on the economies, real impacts on cities an states, they will have their budgets cut. And there's the markets which you know so well. Everybody talks about certainty in the market. This president wants certainty out of this, he wants a deal done. Should we not hear more from wall street saying, guys, you've got to stop messing around with the debt ceiling and everything out there? 
>> I know there were a number of high profile wall street executives that came out on tax increases. I think what will happen if we go over the cliff is exactly what happened a year and a half ago when markets tumbled. We were on the verge of going back to what we had seen in 2009. People don't like the uncertainty. The markets don't like the uncertainty. And when you see the stock market, that erodes welt. 
>> No matter what side you're on and what you would like to see happen, don't you think that they have to think of something and republicans need to get in in a way that they would not prefer to and obviously the president is trying, but we're not hearing that he's giving enough as well, but at this point, jobs will be affected if they don't? 
>> Yes, I'm obviously someone who you can imagine is in a higher tax bracket and I'm fully prepared to pay higher taxes. I would like to see significant spending cuts. But I'm in to help the country. 

[02:39:18]


>> On the cuts, do you think they should come up it together? That that's the hard part to break to the american people? 
>> I think so because so many entitlements have been ingrained into us for a long time, whether it's social security or whatnot. But we're so distanced from doing things together so I'm just not -- 
>> richard, I feel like the republicans have been hung out there a little bit on taxes. And they're looking at ways to give. Why wouldn't therein the next tactic be to come out together on real, serious cuts and entitlement age issues and stuff like that. 
>> I don't know that they have actually committed to the specifics of taxes. They have said, yes, in theory, we want revenues and we think we can get to it through deductions and allowances. It not clear you can in any meaningful way. I think the first step, they haven't a agreed on that first step. And yet, democrats have said yeah, we'll deal with entitlements and they haven't been as specific as they should be u but you've got to get through the first step, which means everyone has to deal with the first step. The president won that argument, move on already, republicans can get something much bigger on entitlements if they give up something much less on taxes. 
>> I'm sure they have to hang along with it. 
>> This is a republican party that the dug itself so deeply into the corner and it still hasn't taken a very clear step out. And until it does, it's very hard to say anything on the other side. We have a 7% of a gop budget deficit and republicans have come up with a half a percent in revenues, maybe, but no change in tax rates and I think what alexandra said is very straight forward, she's right, tax rates have to go up, she's ready to pay for them as many, many people are. And this is sanity at this point. We have a tiny cohort that's holding the company economically hostage right now and that has to end, then we can start talking about some other things. 

[02:41:40]


>> Fair enough. Alexandra, having grown up in the wall street atmosphere, growing up with especially men-- 
>> even though I worked with my dad, I was lucky enough to work with my grandmother as well, she WORKED INTO HER 90s, AND SHE AND I went a year working with her when she was 91. So I think I got as much girl power from her than anyone else. And if you're a woman, you're one of the few people in the room, so take advantage of it. So people are going to listen to you. They may be a little bit surprised at first, but take advantage of it. I like standing out in the mode of the way I dress or just standing up and getting people to listen.

>>> The most absurd part of this week is that these two guys still don't know how to talk to each other. It really is like that horrible relationship book like everybody read years ago, "men are from mars, women are from venus." They don't know how to negotiate. 
>> We need to bring in a meeting, 40 past the hour, business before the bell, brian sullivan, you're just back from washington, what's your take on whether the negotiations stand right now? 
>> Nowhere. You know, you have mentioned negotiator and actually there is one and david cody is the ceo of honey well, right, huge company, he's been part of the president's ceo council, but new reports really this week have come out that cody is taking a much more active role between boehner and the president. He's sort of trying to mediate from a business person's perspective between the two because I think that chuck is right, I mean there's a lot of disconnect there on what the two sides want. I did my show from washington earlier this week, we spoke with a number of congress people and they are entrenched and I came away feeling like, at least by the end of this year, that there will be no full deal done. 
>> No full deal. 
>> That's just my own take based on these conversations. 
>> They're agreeing not to get it done, that's a sign of hope that at least they agree on something. Is that what we're going to have all over again? 
>> The previous discussion that you guys had because I was listening in, there's a proposal that says do the half pass, tax the tax cut for people below $250,000. Then work on the tax rates for the top 2%, the entitlement cuts, whatever, I think that's a good idea. Just get that out of the way. The analogy I used on my show yesterday is this, if you loan me a dollar, and I pay you back a nickel, I still owe you 95 cents, but if 95% of our discussion is about the nickel and not the 95 cents, that's the analogy of what we're talking about. Because everybody knows that the tax cycle on the wealthy, which I have argued for just to get it auf the table is such a fractional a lot of our problem, but it doesn't make any sense. Pass it and it it done, because we have so many bigger problems. The tax cut by the way is already spent multiple times over, the u.S. Post office is $15 billion in debt the fah is $2 billion in debt. 

[02:48:55]


>> It's the easy part at this point. The question is how then to get the hard part through, which would be legitimate spending cuts, changes to our entitlement programs which make them more solvent. And the only way that happens is to do it together. That they don't lay it on the other. Who of the two do you think has the guts to do that? 
>> I don't think either of them do. I spoke to some of the congressmen about this, either offrecord or offcamera. And I said, guys, it seems clear that both parties don't want to be the one to tell the american people the truth. When you talk about health care, you're talking about people's lives, their mothers, their children, their grandparents. So they don't want to be -- they don't want to be the one to say we're going to have to cut back on health care for mom. That's why I worry. Nobody wants to be the grown up in the room to deliver the bad news. And I'll leave you with this, in 1967, a couple of years after medicare started, it spent $3 billion which is about $20 billion t$25 billio today's dollars, now it's about $100 billion a year. We have $63 trillion with a t, structural deficit for medicare by 2025. With a t. Have a great weekend, everybody.

Tassess,r one, do they have the shooter identified and have they dealt with him and is there a potential of a second person who doesn't belong there who may have something to do with this alleged assault? 
>> It is the top of the hour, 11:00 here on the east coast where this incident is taking place, clint vanzant, if you will hold on the line. I'm chris jansing with jansing and company. 
>>> We'll continue to watch here on msnbc, what is happening in newtown, connecticut, it's about an hour away from hartford, connecticut, the capital of that state. Right now what we know, 9:41, a call for police according to what we're hearing from state police, they said they got a call from newtown police and they have sent state police to that scene. 9:57, a reverse 911 call went out. We'll go back to wvit where their reporr liz dahl reporting just moments ago what was happening on the ground. 
>> This is a photo just in to our newsroom of students being evacuated in the last hour or so from sandy hook elementary school. Looking at that, that's a snapshot in time literally. It looks like it was done in a fairly orderly fashion. And for the sake of the kids, it doesn't look like it was done in a way where there will be a residual emotional effect. What you want to do is give them the sense that everything is under control. 
>> We're talking about kindergartners to first graders, we're talking about very young children. Investigators did go room by room to evacuate the school to make sure that these kids are out. 
>> Let's go back now to our liz dahlem, with the school shooting information. What do you have, liz? Liz, can you hear me? 
>> Reporter: It's very much an active scene out here, we have got lots of parents looking for their children, just waiting for worth as to whether or not they're okay. I want to show you what it looks like out here on the scene, you can tell that state police are out here, they have been using their -- they have their weapons standing by and the choppers also above the school. That's where the school is located, further down dickenson drive. Now that chopper's been sitting up there for the past couple of minutes now, we're told the children inside that school were evacuated a short while ago. I can tell you that parents have been out here all morning just sort of walking the streets. They can't get any closer to the school than we are right now. You can see the parents just sort of running up the streets, everyone here is just trying to get -- 

[00:02:58]


>> again watching live coverage there come out of newtown, connecticut. Clint vanzant what's been watching this coverage with us, as we're getting more reports and information from liz who is on the ground and watching, what is your sense about what is happening inside the school? 
>> Well in a situation like this, richard, the state police and responding law enforcement officers have a number of responsibilities. First and foremost, if there is in fact an active shooting situation, they have to get to the shooter and they have to, the word we just heard this last week in the portland mall shooting, they have to neutralize that shooter, they have to stop him from firing one way or the other. Then they have to start identifying any victims who have been injured, they have to get those victims out of that school and then as they hear the local reporter talking, they have to organize ways to get those children out of that school. 
>> We're listening to live coverage coming out of that school there from wvit. 
>> We're obviously having some technical difficulties with liz's shot, we will try to bring it up as soon as possible. 
>> Looks like they're having some kind of technical difficulty with their reporter there on the site in newtown, connecticut at that sandy hook elementary school. We're an hour and a half as i mentioned there, clint, since the first report. What is key, you had said that there were reports of one or two individuals that were at the location that were not authorized. What were your intimating? 
>> The suggestion is that there is at least one shooter there, perhaps two. Realize this a chaotic situation like that, one lone shooter, which is what we have, and if we have a shooting situation, worst-case scenario, a mass shooting scenario, we have about 20 or more of these in the united states every year. But this could be the second such situation we have. What law enforcement is trying to do right now, is to identify the shooter, make sure they have person in custody or dealt with. They have to evacuate the children in an orderly fashion. And you and your listeners have to realize too, if police have to do a very cautious room by room search because there could be another individual allegedly working with the gunman. There could be teachers and students who are hunkered down, this is what they're taught to do, if they can't escape the building, they have to hunker down indoors, hide behind furniture, in closets so state police have to do a room by room search to find any other injured, any other children that are hiding out. 

[00:05:53]


>> As a result of what might be a shooting there, as we are try fog get information out of newtown, contract at sandy hook elementary school. We do realize right now is they're holding the ems units, asking that no more come to the school. But at the danbury high school close by, we do not know whether these are students or whether these are administrators, whether these are teachers. But they are holding and asking that no more emsb brought there. We also understand they had other units requested by other towns but now they're being held back. We have three patients at danbury hospital. We got the first call for help about an hour and 20 minutes ago. And they are now saying to withhold anymore ems units. Is this mean that they are close to understanding the breadth and depth of this emergency? 
>> I think you're right, richard, I think this may well be a situation that just transpired in a very manner of minutes. There are unconfirmed reports of injuries, as you suggest now, we have got confirmation in the hospital. We're told the shooting may have taken place in the main office and that at least one shooter may be down. Again, everything appears to be inundetermined at this time, but by stopping any further ems units from coming, it indicates that they have -- if the shooter is under arrest, he has been dealt with by the police. 
>> Let's go back to wvit. 

[00:07:56]


>> Reporter: Good morning, guys, I just spooky to a parent and shirley had been asking me, had any parents been reunited with their children yet. I did speak to one woman who had been reunited with her daughter there at the staging area. She said she got a reverse 911 call telling her there had been a shooting at her daughter's school, sandy hook elementary. When he got here, she parked on the street and she was frantically look for her daughter. 
>> We're having trouble with liz's report. The school in a residential area as many schools are in connecticut. We want to go right now to a business owner who owns a place right near that elementary school, her name is tammy daugherty. What have you observed there in the area of the business, in the area of the school over the last hour and a half today? 
>> It first started as just a bunch of police sirens and basically we were just like, oh, my gosh, something big is going on, we had no idea, and then when we started finding out things on facebook and twitter, I'm just panicking, I feel like I can't even stand. 
>> What time did this all start? Approximately what time? 
>> I want to say it was like quarter to 10:00, maybe 9:30? 
>> We are looking at live pictures of the scene right near the sandy hook fire department, I'm sure you can picture where that is, how far is that from you right no. 
>> Him looking right down the road and I can basically almost see all the cars there. 
>> What we're starting to see which is a great sign is children being reunited with their parents, which is something we hadn't seen in the last 15, 20 anyones since we have had these live pictures. That's a great sign. Give us an idea of the kind of school sandy hook is, is it a neighborhood school? Are all the kids that go to the school from that area, can you tell? 

[00:10:13]


>> We have a lot of elementary schools. My husband helps me out at the shop and that was his elementary school. And he's beside himself. He's like I can't believe this is happening at the school i went to. 
>> Is this a close knit community, do you know a lot of the people who work at the school? Do you know a lot of the parents? >Know a girl who's a teacher's aid there and she was already evacuated. I know the music teacher, I know a lot of people there, and my kids are friends with kids that go there. 
>> Is the teach your talked to, did he or she fill in any of the blanks of what's happened there? What did they tell you happened at sandy hook elementary school? 
>> I texted her briefly and asked if she was okay and she said yes, she was evacuated and I didn't hear anything further from her. 
>> Thanks so much for your perspective. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> We want to go now to -- 
>> we're working on getting some more information from another business owner at the scene, but as we're looking now, there is some indication, as you can see there on the bottom left of your screen, you see parents walking through the scene right now, with children that look to be the right age for a k through 4 school. That's a greet sign. You can see liz interviewing a mom right now. 
>> Let's listen in. 
>> She locked the door, she had the keys with her, thank god, and they moved to a corner and they didn't move. The principal was killed and several people were shot. 
>> Do you know how many shoot issers we're talking about here? 
>> I know another friend of mine said that -- 

[00:12:14]


>> you just heard a report from a parent there at sandy hook elementary school that the principal was shot this morning at at elementary school in newtown. Can we listen to it again? 
>> And things this incident began, this is really the first in the past couple of minutes, this is the first time we have seen parents reunited with children. 
>> That's a very good sign of course and we're hoping that the damage from this was limited. This is a little girl from sandy hook, let's listen in. 
>> Ms. Martin closed the door and we went to the corn if. 
>> How many shots did you hear? 
>> Lots. 
>> Lots. Like 12, 20, 30? Do you know? 
>> I heard that he opened fire. That's all I heard. 
>> And someone saw children bleeding? 
>> When I arrived, I just pulled my car up and they said there was a little girl, a little boy. 
>> Okay, we're working on getting more information on this interview, but you heard that one parent. 
>> Such a difficult thing for these children to go through. I can only imagine. We're now going to go to -- 
>> again, live coverage coming out of newtown, connecticut, wvit our affiliate there, and if you're just joining us, we're covering breaking news coming out of newtown, connecticut, that's about an hour outside of hartford, connecticut. What we know from a resident on the ground, reporting of something happening at sandy hook elementary school. That school has k through 4, we're talking about kids from 5 to 10 years old. 9:41, there was a call for help. 9:57, a reverse 911 call went out to the residents in the area that there w something happening at that elementary school. Now an hour and 45 minutes later, we're watching what's happening coming from these live pictures from cameras on the ground, what we understand floor three patients at a local hospital. We are unsure as to whether they are adults or are children. Clint van zandt has been watching this situation with us. Clint, when I look at these pictures, and just a second ago, we're listening to a very young girl speak and trying to describe what she saw. Was there blood, how many shots did she hear? We often associate high security areas with high schools. But we're talking about an elementary school, we're talking about 5 to 10-year-olds, we have seen metal detectors in high risk high schools. But are there elementary schools that are equipped to handle this sort of situation? 

[00:15:08]


>> I will tell you the answer is normally no, richard. As you suggest, the higher level of security we see is usually at the higher grades where you have a police officer, a deputy sheriff in some situations stationed there. Otherwise, metal detectors. But in this case, when you're dealing with kindergarten through second, third or fourth grade, we don't -- we try never to associate any act of violence with something like this. Now, listening to the local affiliates, the local reporters talking, suggesting that the principal may have been injured and some of the children may have been injured. And there's unconfirmed reports from local immediate media that the sheetder has been shot and is down. There was a suggestion that two shooters may have been involved in this situation. Many times that earlier information turns out wrong because people are reporting or double reporting what they're seeing. But it appears if we take the experience of those inside, somebody went into a school with a gun, a confrontation took place it appears in the office of the school and the principal of this grade school was critically injured if not killed. The shooter may be down and there may be injuries to children as law enforcement continue to try to sort this out on one more sad day in america. 
>> Part of our reaction, clint, yours as well, is certainly emotional and when we look at these kids and this age group of five to ten years old, kindergarten through fourth grade, we don't see these story lines at this level of school, good thing. But take a step back for us, you know the full context in terms of these sorts of tragedies nationwide. Can you do that for us? 

[00:17:16]


>> We can, richard, we have seen approximately 20 incidents like this, into an environment like this, into a school, into a shopping mall, into a movie theater. What worries me, sometimes, richard, is that we're seeing so many of these, we have become somewhat numb and we don't realize the terrible emotional pain, the physical pain that's suffered, and realize again, this is something these children, their parents will carry. And it's one more place where we thought our children were safe. Where reality has at least in this school has proven that's not the case. 
>> Clint talk to us, what we're seeing right now, this is a staging area, looks to be we have some law enforcement officials, high-powered rifles, whether they're coming or going, looks like they're going at the moment. But what sort of unit is this and what might they be doing? 
>> We discussed earlier, first responders are almost always going to be uniformed officers. They're the first to respond to any situation. 
>> Clint, stand by, we understand we have a reporter from our affiliate speak right now. 
>> Reporter: You heard from that mother firsthand that she heard that it was the principal, that has not been confirmed who was shot in this shooting. I just spoke to another child who kind of gave us -- they were in morning meetings when these shottings were fired. The children were path gathering inside their classrooms. The teachers locked the doors, the school was put on lockdown. Once it was secure, we're told all of the children were rushed down here most of them to the fire department and that's where parents are now reporting to pick up their children. Every single parent who is here showing up needs to bring proper id, because it is a very chaotic scene, and they want to make sure every child ends up in the right hands. A lot of kids did tell me they saw a couple of students injured. Two of them evidently bloody, and this was obviously a very dill situation for their kids, being shaken up. It's an absolute nightmare for parents who are in this area. I want to tell you that we are still seeing lots and lots of children coming out to the fire department here. We also heard reports that kids were being taken to area homes when this story first broke, just making sure they were taken to safe places. But again, you can see parents hugging their kids, making sure everyone is okay. Lots to uncover here, we're going to continue talking to parents and student who is witnessed this all firsthand. 

[00:20:05]


>> We're watching a live reporter there coming out of wvit in newtown, connecticut. Chris jansing is still with us and clint van zandt is still with us. We're reporting the principal being involved in this shooting, occurring during morning meetings, the children were gathering in their classrooms. 
>> I have talked to clint on a number of these occasions, they flash in your mind, going back to columbigiffords, the first thought I had one, who go into a school with a bunch of little kids and opens fire? Again, I don't want us to start talking about things that we have not had confirmed. But if indeed, somebody who was shot is an adult in the administration there, would you just put on your profiler hat, is this likely a workplace situation? A domestic incident? I mean god forbid somebody goes into a school and is trying to shoot little kids. 
>> I you're right. And unfortunately chris, that has happened in a number of european, in japan and a number of other locations we have had in japan an individual went in with a knife and started stabbing people. This was somebody with a severe mental illness. We don't know what we have here. We don't know if in fact the principal was a victim of this believed shooter. We don't zero if this is something that related to the school. Something outside of the school. But there seems to be a profile when we see most of these shootings, though, chris, it's someone who's angry, who's frustrated, who's rageful and who blames others for problems that they have in life and unfortunately, believe that they have almost a right to go and take out their anger and frustration and rage against another person. Years ago we thought children they needed to get under their desks and hide because we were afraid of a nuclear threat from russia. Now we have to teach children in kindergarten and first grade what they have to do if a shooter come into their school. This is an anomaly, but if this happens more than -- 

[00:22:39]


>> we're just hearing from wnbc's jonathan dietz, hess reporting that there's one apparent shooter dead, he appears to be an adult. It'sunclear how many other adults have been injured. There's no reports of any kids injured and he does not know if there are other adults injured. And also two handguns recovered. To both you and chris, one apparent shooter dead and he is an adult. This as we understand right now, according to state police there, they are going room by room, still at that location. Of sandy hook elementary school and they will be holding a news conference at about 1:00 p.M. Eastern time. We also again want to report that two handguns have been reported. And just the timing here to the both of you, I mean sandy hook elementary, we were getting some sense of timing earlier that they were hearing shots around 9:00, and 9:05 is when the kindergarten starts and when they gather. So that's consistent with what we were reporting earlier. Again, grades 1 through 4, this is a town about 60 miles from new york city. It covers, newtown about 60 square miles, it's the fifth larger town in the state. Back to chris and clint, we know what's happening inside according to reports, but also outside, they have requested that parents come and gather their kids. The question to you, clint, might be, is now the right time for that and what does that tell you, the fact that they're asking parents to actually come to the site? Is there the children are going to be scared, frightened, they don't know what took place, unfortunately, even though our children see murders take place, see shootings take place on television, this is real life. So I think what they want to do is satisfy the urgent need for parents, number one, 20 know their children are safe and to put those children back in the arms of their parents, their care givers again so that family situation, that loving family situation can help get them past this. There's going to hallenges, children are going to suffer ptsd in this. 

[00:24:56]


>> Stand by one second, clint, as you know, we're getting information coming -- let's listen, the mayor's on phone with vwvit. 
>> We're ordering in our early 4:00 to 12:00 shift to put more officers on the street right now. We also, our hospital is with the victims right now. And are working obviously. Doing the things that they need to do. A difficult time and I just wan to complement all the public safety personnel that are out there working. Our offices right now are assisting newtown pd in anything they need in terms of crime scene investigation and other things that are going on. A tough time, we want to reach the parents of this school districts are on top of this, we have all been communicating and everybody's monitoring this closely to make sure their children are safe. 
>> We have learned that three people have been rushed to danbury hospital, can you tell us anything about the victims and nature of their injuries? 
>> Right now, I can't confirm that there are multiple victims and they're being treated at danbury hospital. I can't confirm who those folks are, obviously next of kin needs to be notified, those kinds of things and I cannot confirm in terms of what relationship they had within the building, whether they were student, whether they were an administrator or somewhere in between. 
>> We are now getting our first live pictures from above the scene. This is chopper pictures from our sister station in new york, above the scene here in newtown, where there has been a shooting at sandy hook elementary school, in the past two hours, we are -- have been continuous coverage for more than an hour on this situation. What we have learned is that the principal was the targeted person, this is not officially from police, but from one parent of a child at sandy hook elementary school. And we also learned some inrmation that there is one person dead and we have been led to believe that was the shooter who initiated this emergency situation. These are live pictures from above sandy hook elementary school in newtown. This is having a larger efblgts on newtown. All the schools in newtown are on lockdown. All the students in bethel have been locked down. And you just heard the -- 

[00:27:19]


>> a very sad day in the greater danbury area. 
>> We have been seeing pictures from on the ground and above, and one thing is clear, there are dozens upon dozens of police officers and firefighters within this really small area, neighborhood around both sandy hook elementary school and the sandy hook fire department, a section of newtown. There's a staging area, active local fire department there, where they have ambulances at the ready, where we saw what appeared to be parents being reunited with students from sandy hook elementary. And we just got the information in, that any parents who have not picked up their child from sandy hook, can go do that at the staging area which is right near the school at the fire department. 
>> The newtown school's superintendent has just informed us that parents with children or a child at sandy hook elementary, they can go to that staging area to pick up their child. But the other schools in newtown, they are still in lockdown mode, but class is in session. 
>> We have seen first responders, police and ambulances and fire from a variety of towns, both local towns all across western connecticut and state police, we got confirmation from lieutenant paul vansz of the connecticut state police, now about an hour ago that troopers from his agency responded sometime after 9:40, to sandy hook elementary school and begun the process of evacuating all the students and staff. 
>> And described as a platoon of connecticut state troopers on the scene going room to room, classroom to classroom to make sure all the teachers and students and personnel were evacuated. 
>> We go to our sister station, wnbc, thanks for checking in with us, what are you seeing there over the school? 
>> Reporter: Well, shirley and brad, as we get our first overhead pictures of the school here, you can see obviously a large police presence, police are now surrounded the school and we were hearing a little bit earlier that they may or they not still be searching for a shooter in the area and then just a couple of minutes ago, we did get confirmation that that shooter has been shot dead. We'exactly sure where all this happened. As I come out a bit wider, you can ski the school. Lots of police activity there. You can seek toward the center part of your screen, they have set up a staging area, we have local fire departments, along with local police and state police and other officials who are on the scene. And also they did receive several patients at danbury hospital, unconfirmed who the patients are and whether any additional patients will be brought over there. It looks to me like things are starting to calm down here. Can't confirm exactly what is taking place down there on the ground as far as law enforcement is concerned. But it does look like things are beginning to calm down here, we're continuing to follow this story from the ground and also up here. Shirley and brad? 

[00:30:31]


>> Thanks so much from our sister station wnbc, giving us live pictures from above the scene. We have just learned that another town in the greater dang bury area, near newtown brook ville schools, newtown schools are all in lockdown mode at this moment. 
>> We have some breaking news just in, brad and shirley. Nbc "nightly news" is reporting that the apparent shooter is an adult. This is new information, we have one shooter dead that we know and two handguns recovered from the scene with that person. So the apparent shooter, an adult, dead, two handguns recovered from the scene. That is the very latest from nbc "nightly news" on this, of course still tense situation, police not talking as they're still actively working this scene and a school shooting in an elementary school, which is very rare, we have seen them at high schools, but at this sandy hook elementary school. So apparent shooter dead, it was an adult. More information as soon as we receive it. 
>> We ant to go to nbc contract's amanda reuss who's also on the scene. 
>> Reporter: We're actually seeing some parents bei able to bring their kids, one mother was just so emotional, she couldn't even talk, you could tell she was crying, her little son was all right. She's very shaken up, probably what would be a parent's worst nightmare, getting a call that there was a shooter inside the building. Now outside here, we are still seeing a very big police ppresence, we have police surrounding the school, some of them with canines, we also have them with guns drawn, every time we seen try to approach a little bit closer, we're pushed back. What they want to do is make sure that people are not outside, as you guys know, this school is really in a very residential neighborhood. Right next to the school in back of it you have homes, right across the street you have homes so they want everybody to stay inside their house. We're seeing a little bit more calm right now, there's not as much running around, but earlier today, we did see that running, we saw them searching woodpiles, and there was this maintaining a police presence at least right now. 

[00:33:04]


>> Amanda, we just learned from lisa carberg right now that an adult shooter is dead and they recovered two handguns from the scene. But from what you're seeing, would it appear that they're looking for another suspect? 
>> Reporter: It doesn't appear that they're searching for anybody, but they're not standing by just yet. They are still in the sustained positions they have been in for, you know, as long as we have been here. So at least, you know, 20 minutes, half hour. They're still waiting, they're stationed at different areas outside the building, so it doesn't look like they're going anywhere any time soon. 
>> We're looking at live pictures from our chopper in our sister station wnbc. Right now, colleen, who's a former student at sandy hook elementary school. Joins us live on the phone, she has been there at the scene for the better part of the morning. Colleen, thanks fortunately being with us. What have you heard and seen this morning? 
>> I'm actually down the street, I work at a local toy department near the school. It's just sickening. I used to go to elementary school there and I'm literally in shock right now. 
>> Can you describe for us what kind of school this is? Any problems there before in the past? 
>> It's just such a friend lid environment and we're in just a sleepy part of connecticut no one ever could have thought this could ever happen. 
>> We heard from one parent there at sandy hook whose child is currently a student that the principal had been targeted, do you know the principal inside sandy hook. 
>> I have heard that the prince has changed since I was there, but I also heard that the principal was targeted. 

[00:35:09]


>> Okay, we're watching live pictures from a shop chopper cam, as well as wvit, wnbc covering that story. We're giving you the very latest information as we do get it in from all of our affiliates as well as our resources and if you are just joining us, at 11:35 eastern time, it is at 9:41 a.M. Eastern that we understand a 911 call came in about a shooting at sandy hook elementary school, there in newtown, connecticut. So two hours, roughly two hours ago, that call came in. Sandy hook elementary school, and newtown. Now newtown, is about an hour outside of hartford, about an hour and a half outside of the new york city. Then we got reports later on in the morning as information started to come in that there were three individuals taken to a local hospital. Later an apparent shooter dead, an adult. Also two handguns recovered at the scene and we have a 1:00 news conference coming up. We're going to take a short break, we're going to continue to cover what's happening there live on the ground in newtown, connecticut. Is surprising her with one. Save the surprise.

[00:39:30]


>>> We are two hours go an dins end that we have been watching here on msnbc coming out of newtown, connecticut. Sandy hook elementary school, a school that has 5 to 10-year-olds, a shoot agent that low case. Apparent shooter dead. Police on the ground still going room to room in this school that had about 39 teachers. We have a camera in the sky. Cameras on the ground. Clint van zandt has been watching this with us. Clint, earlier on, we saw on this chopper cam view, a space that was both yellow and red or orange. What was that space? 
>> Well, in a situation like this, richard, they set up individually both a triage area, where they can first deal with any injurended people, as well as emergency response needs to set up their own area. In a situation like this, you normally have local, county, state and federal law enforcement authorities. I'm sure there are well over 100 to 200 law enforcement officers somewhere in this vicinity right now. And of course, in a situation like this, you send everything you have, that's the first call. Send us everything, every person, every vehicle you have and then at the scene, we'll figure out what we need, if we don't need them, we'll call them off, but we would rather have police, fire, emergency services on scene than have to call them later. 
>> If that were to be a triage area, in the chopper cam picture on your left, it sits below it farther to the right in terms of what I was alluding to. You're looking at the pictures as well as the law enforcement officials there in front of the school. From what you see the number and the pace and the way they are moving around, there is that space we were talking about a send ago, yellow and orange. What's your thought about what's happening? 
>> I think right now that law enforcement as best they can are comfortable that they understand the situation, that they have identified the shooter, we're told the shooter is dead. We don't know whether that is because of a confrontation with the first responding law enforcement officers, or if that was a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the time. That's still to be determined. But we know that law enforcement is comfortable that one shooter is down and the initial suggested reports of potentially a second shooter, we don't see the level of activity that you would normally do if in fact you suspected a second gunman there. What I do find interesting, richard, in this terrible situation, is as you have reported, two handguns have been recovered. 

[00:42:10]


>> Look at this picture right here. We have a cordoned off car that is unlike all the other cars in this parking lot. What might you make of it? 
>> I think it's likely to be the shooting suspect's vehicle. Just like law enforcement did in portland, in the shooting at the mall the other day, they very quickly have to identify the shooter's vehicle, determine what's in there, if that presents a threat to the immediate area. And now you'll have law enforcement, oncthey have identified him and his vehicle, they will be going to his house, computers, friends, relatives, everything that has to be done, you have to make sure there's no associated threat that may be going along with the shooting incident that's taken place this morning. 
>> Watching these live chopper cam pictures. On the left, what appears to be a car that's been cordoned off, a black vehicle, live pictures from the ground. We have got dr. Neiigan what can you describe for us in terms of what you're seeing? 
>> On the road that leads up to sandy hook school has been closed off by the police and emergency vehicles. So on that road, there are as reported many, many first respondsers on the scene, ambulance, police, fire. I don't know anything specifically about any casualties. I toured the hospital, the level two trauma center, an excellent facility and I'm sure they're going up to handle anything that's is going to happen. 
>> Let's talk about those children, that you saw an hour ago, in terms of the current situation of where the children are moving. 

[00:44:12]


>> The sandy hook's firehouse is right near the school. That is the staging area, I have been told the children will be moved there to reunite with their parents there. The pastor at -- 
>> I want to ask you about this if I can, danbury hospital, we have reports of threetients right now. What can you talk about that facility, it's ability to handle such situations. 
>> We're a level two drama center which is one of the highest levels. We have a world class emergency department. It's a 371-bed hospital. We are trauma surgeons and, you know, we're equipped, I think for anything. 
>> Have you spoken to any of youolleagues there? 
>> No, I have not, I have a call in just like everybody else. 
>> Definitely keep us up to date on that you said you have the monsignor there? 
>> Yes, the monsignor of the catholic schools here in newtown. 
>> Thank you for handing the phone to him, I appreciate that. Monsignor weisz, thank you for being with us, your school is under lockdown as well. Tell us about how you heard about this situation and what were the detailing? 
>> We were notified through the alarm system that's in our town, through the school system. We were told to -- our children were actually at mass, so we kept them in the church for quite a while. And then we sent themver where they are still 20g9 as one group. And we're just awaiting word from the officials what we should do from here. I'm more concerned about the parents who are here just waiting to find out happened to their children. Because the majority of these children are parishioners of ours and it's a terrible scene. It's just too much anticipation of what might be going on and what happened to their children. And of course there's no reports coming out yet. And children who witnessed this are terribly traumatized, they're crying, they're trying to hold on to their parents, they want to go home but they don't want to leave their friends. It's a critical situation here, I'm in a room filled with parents who can't find their child. And the anxiety in this room the just overwhelming. So we're here just to support and enkurj them. 

[00:47:14]


>> Mon seen your weisz is a religious leader, I know it's an emotional moment but they're lucky to have you there to help them through this. Monsignor--they seem to be holding -- the school itself is fairly isolated, at least surrounded by a lot of shrubbery. When you were looking at those pictures as they were scanning that offsite area, what were your thoughts? 
>> I think that law enforcement has to satisfy itself that there's no one else who may have been involved in this terrible situation. Perhaps from the shooting aspect, but in a situation like this too, richard, sometimes there's this helter skelter, where potential verdicts, students, teachers will and rightfully so will exit the building an run, and law enforcement has to service themselves that no one else has fled from the building, either who may have been directly involved in the shooting or who may have been a potential victim that they could still be out there too. I'm hearing a report from one of the ambulances in the local area. That one of the victims was a parent who had been shot and was taken to a local hospital. But unfortunately, there appears to be other victims too. 
>> We're going to go for a quick break, clint, when you come back, as well as the monsignor, perhaps dr. Culligan who is there on the ground, we're going to step back on the timeline here, we're about 2 hours and 15 minutes since this tragedy about an hour and a half outside of new york city.

>>> back to breaking news out of newtown, connecticut. About an hour and a half outside of new york city. We continue to get more information. The very latest is that we have one apparent death of a shooter, two handguns recovered with that shooter. Three individuals in the hospital right now. Watchilong with us has been clint van zandt as well as veteran news anchor and reporter chris jansing. Chris, I want to get your thoughts and, clint, please, as well, do pipe in. 
>> I was very taken, as I'm sure everyone who was listening was by the monsignor at the local catholic school who was observing the parents and the students who were obviously extremely traumatized, and the description that he gave was that obviously these children are clinging to their parents, but they also don't want to leave their friends, and, clint, obviously many of these schools have counselors. You and I having covered so many of these, recognize that you don't have to have been shot to be a victim in a circumstance like this. What kinds of people can they bring in? What kinds of tining can be brought to bare to help both these parents and these very young students who have seen something horrific this morning? 
>> Well, you're right, chris. This is going to be a challenge because it's going to take men and women who are specially trained in dealing with traumatic situations with children. 
>> What was observed at the scene is when police were evacuating the school, because these children were so young, such a tender age, they had to make sure that a teacher, a police officer, somebody was with these children sometimes one-on-one because of the shock they were going through to take them on this relatively short trip, fortunately, which is from the school to the fire department across the street where they were staging children hoping to quickly reunite these children with their parents. Chris, you know, we know the challenge many america. Many times we have botharents that are working, so now we have parents who may be in new york city trying to find their way back again to get somebody to come pick up their children in this terrible situation, and we don't know yet, chris, who all victims are. We know that the shooter is supposedly shot and killed. I have seen one report that a teacher was wounded. We've had other suggestions of sightings of children with blood on them, so we don't know yet the full course of the injury, the damage that's been sustained by the school by the people -- 

[00:54:42]


>> one second. We do have sound from one of the children on the scene. Let's take a listen. 
>> I was in the gym, and I heard a loud -- well, I heard, like, seven loud booms, and the gym teacher told us to go in the corner, so we all huddled, and i kept hearing these booming noises, and we all started -- well, we didn't scream. We started crying, so all the gym teachers told us to go into the office where no one could find us, so then a police officer came in and told us to run outside, so we did, and we came in the fire hit-or-miss and waited for our parents. 
>> Such difficult video to watch. We're talking about 5 to 10-year-olds describing a shooting. It's about 600 students that had to go through this this morning, according to what we have been watching. 39 teachers. We're talking about kindergarten through fourth grade. This incident now about two and a half hours old. Very difficult and emotional. If you have children in your family, if you have nieces, if you have nephews, you cannot help when you see these pictures to understand the ram fiction, the depth of what we're seeing here happening in newtown, connecticut. Stay with msnbc. We are going to continue to cover this breaking story coming out of newtown, connecticut, and sandy hook elementary school. ?????? Don't know what I'd do ?????? ??????

=======================================================

Deceased inside the building. There's a great deal of work that is undertaken immediately upon locating the shooter and there's a great deal of search warrant activity, a great deal of law enforcement activity both in and out of state to ensure we cover all the bases relative to that specific individual. Suffice it to say the scene is secure. State police major crime squads, danbury state's attorney and many agencies are working together to answer all of the questions surrounding exactly what happened. 
>> That's, again, the very latest of state police there in connecticut. Pete williams, our justice correspondent, also reporting that a second suspect is in custody. We are told a suspect is being questioned with the shooting. We don't know his relationship is to all of this. Amanda ross is with wvit, nbc affiliate in that area. She is standing by with the very latest. What can you tell us? 
>> Pretty much what you heard there. We do have reports of now confirmed several students and staff were killed inside that school. The shooter also found dead inside that school. As you heard from connecticut state police lieutenant paul vance, they're now going through the process of dealing with searching that school, issuing a search warrant and going to collect evidence there. What we are told right now is that the governor of connecticut, governor dannel malloy is meeting with families and not releasing the information that we need right now is because the governor wants to make sure that the families get that information first. And of course, as we've heard, we have sources that say that we have dozens killed. So they're probably dozens of families that the governor is meeting with right now. 
>> Amanda, what can you tell us if anything about the relationship between the shooter and that school? Was he a father of a student there? Did he have some sort of connection to a staffer there? Do we know anything about this 20-year-old shooter? 

[00:02:09]


>> All that we know right now is that there is a possible connection. We don't know if, like you said, that person had a child in the school. We actually even don't know how the person was able to get in to the school because here in connecticut what typically happens is a lot of the doors are locked. If they're maybe not the main entrance one to go in and go to the main office but a lot of the times the school's doorways around the building are locked so there's still questions about how he was able to get in to the building. 
>> Describe the scene for me right now around you. A short time ago, we continued to see the images of parents arriving to pick up their children. We have seen understandably lots of hugs, lots of parents pulling their children in very, very tight. What's happening right now? 
>> Well, I think it's a still thing. There's very much a sense of shock in this community. We hear this over and over again but many people saying how could it happen here? How could it happen in the small community? I'm sure no matter where you go, when there's a mass shooting, people say the same thing. It's very, very emotional here. Not even just the parents emotional. We saw them coming to pick up the students, hugging them tight and starting to cry because of all of this happening here. We also know that the first responders were breaking down. We saw firefighters who were tearing up and now we actually might understand why. When we see, you know, the large complexity of this and how many people were affected here. 
>> Amanda, do stand by for me. We have got some sound from folks who are at the scene at sandy hook elementary school around 9:30 this morning. Let's take a listen. 
>> I was in the gym and I heard a loud -- well, I heard like seven loud booms and then the gym teachers told us to go in the corner so we all huddled and I kept hearing these booming noises. And the -- we all started -- well, we didn't scream, we started crying so all of the gym teachers told us to go in to the office where no one could find us so then police officer came in and told us to run outside so we did and we came in the fire house and waited for our parents. 

[00:04:36]


>> That little girl's chilling account of what went down inside that school. Amanda, I imagine you've heard lots of similar stories on the ground there. Are all of the children accounted for? 
>> What they did was they said that they went in room by room and available to evacuate the students and take -- evacuate the building room by room and bring the students to their parents. As the little girl described, we are talking to other little girl that is said that they were escorted out of the hallways and when their teacher was like lining them up to bring them out, they were told to cover their eyes so that they wouldn't see what was going on there. They also -- and this is a little disturbing, heard screams over the loud speaker before the loud speaker was turned off so you can imagine the painic of those elementary school students. 
>> Folks, you are looking at -- you are looking at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. We are told that scene is secure at this point. The public is not in any danger but there are lots of families in that community who will be scarred forever. 26 dead. 18 children. Eight adults. This is the second worst shooting -- second worst school history in the history of this country. Amanda ross is our reporter with wvit on the ground there covering the story from the beginning. Amanda, tell me about the fire station nearby and the role that it played in all of this. 
>> Well, the fire station when we first got on the scene and more of like the triage station and where everything was set up and now told by the other reporters with us over there is that that is most likely where the families are stationed. We heard that the governor went in to the building and the fire station and hasn't come out yet. We think that's where he's meeting with the families, briefing them, he's telling them what's going on. He wouldn't even actually come out and talk to the media because he was so focused on getting the families that information first so I think that's what the fire house has to play in that -- in this story here. 

[00:06:49]


>> Again, for folk who is are just joining us, we heard for the first time from state police about 15 minutes ago. Their news conference very brief because as amanda just indicated there, the priority right now for officials on the ground is to notify all of the families who have students in that school to make sure all of the families receive the information first. But again, a short time ago we did hear just a few details and basically 9:30 this morning, police got that 911 call on duty troopers, off duty troopers, all responded. They entered the school. They started an active shooter search of the building. The main objective at that point was to evacuate as quickly as possible any and all of the students, all of the faculty, as well. How large is that school? 
>> How large is the school? 
>> Yeah. How many students. 
>> Is that what you said? 
>> Yeah. 
>> I'm not exactly sure on how many students are in that school but it is a neighborhood school so right around it is -- it's stuated in a very residential area. When they didn't know what the situation with the shooter was, they had police stationed all around the school. So people didn't -- 
>> I think we may have just -- we just lost amanda ross there. Nbc affiliate in that area giving us the very latest, very latest what's happening on the ground there. Christin welker standing by at the white house now. We heard from jay carney a short time ago. White house spokesman indicating that today was not the day to start the conversation about gun control and perhaps tightening gun control laws in this country. Any indication at this point, any indication about when and if we might hear from president obama? 

[00:08:50]


>> White house press secretary jay carney saying it's likely to hear from president obama later on today. As you know, craig, it is customary when we see a tragedy such as the one unfolding right now in connecticut happen, president obama will often come out an give his reaction, express his sympathy so that's something that white house press secretary carney saying is likely today. President obama was informed about the shooting at 10:30 this morning by the national security adviser john brennan. He has been updated on this situation throughout the day. The white house at this point in time not revealing the president's reaction. They say it's too soon. They say the president is still getting information. So they're really going to wait until they have a little bit more information before he comes out and talks. I was sitting in the briefing a short while ago with carney and he was questions about whether or not this tragedy would reignite efforts on the part of the president to enact stiffer gun control laws. Carney saying today is the day to really focus on the victims. I can also tell you that he said that the president is watching these horrific events unfold as a father, as much as the president. He made phone calls to fbi director mueller and the governor of connecticut and he continues to be updated on the horrific event that is run folding throughout the state of connecticut. Craig? 
>> Christin welker, thank you. We can expect to hear from president obama at some point on this friday afternoon. I think we have amanda ross back. Wvit on the ground there in newtown, connecticut. Amanda, we were just talking about the process by which authorities were able to get the children out of the school this morning. What more can you tell us? 
>> Well, what they did was when the police were called in, they wept room to room and they took the children and then led the children out of the school. They then walked them out and we did already have quickly parents waiting for the children. They lined up as we were saying earlier, there's a little girl who said that she lined up and actually had to cover her eyes so she wouldn't see anything on her way out of the school and then of course parents waiting for them outside. 

[00:11:09]


>> My understanding, amanda, also is there were a number of neighbors living close to the school and took in some of the children, as well. Is that true? 
>> You know, that's the first that we are hearing of it. A lot of neighbors we spoke to had siblings in the school so they went over to get their siblings but I don't know if they actually went to the neighbor's house. It could have happened in the front of the school but what police were really watching for is they didn't want anyone even in the area. I was in the back of the school for a while and what they did was people were even coming out of their doors. They would push them back in. They didn't want anyone out in the open, you know, just in case when they didn't know that that shooter was dead inside the school. 
>> We don't know a great deal at this point about the shooter. We do know that he was 20 years old. He was wearing all black. Our justice correspondent pete williams standing by on top of the story from the beginning. Can you tell us anymore at this point about the shooter? 
>> Well, what I can tell you, craig, law enforcement officials tell us as they have been looking in to the past of this young man who did the shooting, they've been serving swashts at addresses he's connected with and have discovered within the last couple of hours here that one of his parents was fatally shot at the parent's home in new jersey. I don't know whether it was the mother or father. I don't know where in new jersey this was. But that one of the young man's parents was faly shot, presumably this morning before the school shooting and the body of that adult was found at the adult's home, at the parent's home in new jersey. Now, craig, one other thing here. There's been a question about whether just one person was involved in the shooting or whether there could have been potentially two. There was a second person in custody being questioned who was seen at the school around the time of the shooting but it appear that is that is not going to be the case, that this person was there coincidentally and not involved in the shooting so that second shooting -- the second adult prospect seems to be fading. 

[00:13:22]


>> Pete, at this point, based on your understanding and the folks you are talking to, this gunman acted alone? 
>> It may be a little too soon to say that definitively but things are pointing in that direction, yes. 
>> This morning, parent of the gunman killed, found dead inside their home in new jersey. And then hours later the gunman thought to be the gunman involved here. Correct? 
>> Yes, exactly. 
>> We have heard reports that he was wearing all black, heard reports perhaps he was wearing a bullet-proof vest. Can you tell us more about that ? 
>> Yes to all black. I don't know about the vest. 
>> What about the weapons found at the scene? 
>> As far as we know, he had two handguns. Two .9 millimeter guns. One made by glock, one made by sig sauer. We have seen a report of a rifle but none of the law enforcement officials I've talked to heard about a rifle. Only the two handguns. These are two of the most commonly available handguns in america. The pistol semiautomatic and fires a round every time the trigger is pulled. They're ubiquitous in america. Nothing extraordinary about the weapons. We are waiting to hear whether the gunman had high capacity ammunition clips which would allow firing a number of shots at once. The only other thing to say, craig, it appears from the initial investigative reports that the gunman focused most if not all of the attention on a single classroom. Firing in to a single classroom and that may be where the majority of the victims were. 
>> Pete, at this point, what can you tell us about the relationship between the shooter and that school? 
>> I don't know what it is. None of the officials I have talked to is aware of any. Don't know why that particular school was chosen. It's just not clear. 

[00:15:25]


>> But -- and the search warrants that are being according to state police, search warrant issued in and outside of connecticut. What can we make of that? 
>> Well, the fact that his parents lived in new jersey, he may have been living with his parents. We don't know. He was 20 years old. 
>> Okay. 
>> But we had been told almost from the beginning that there was a new jersey connection here. 
>> And again, that second person that was in custody, that the point, just appears as if that was a coincidence. He was just at the school at the same time? 
>> That's what it appears to be right now. 
>> Justice correspondent pete williams giving us the latest, thank you so much. Do come back if and when you get some new information. Pete williams, reporting that at this point it appears as if the gunman who was found dead inside sandy hook elementary school, that gunman, one of his parents, at this point we don't know his mother or father, one of the parents found dead at their home in new jersey. Just hours before two weapons found. One of them a .9 millimeter pistol and law enforcement trying to figure out whether high -- what type of ammunition was used. Also, according to pete there a few moments ago, it appears as if right now the shooter focused his attention on one single classroom. I'd like to bring back amanda ross, our reporter on the ground there, reporter with wvit. 
>> I can hear you. Just fyi. Roy just showed back up. 
>> Oh, okay. I think we just lost amanda there. When we get her back, we'll go back to her and recap. According to pete williams, just a short time ago, we are gradually starting to learn more about the shooter. 20 years ago. All black. One point we had heard there's a second person in custody. That second person thought at one point to have a connection to all of this. Pete just telling us a short time ago, law enforcement officials no longer believe that that second person was in any way connected to this. At this point, according to law enforcement, it appears that gunman acted alone. Christin welker, standing by with the very latest from the white house. 

[00:17:39]


>> Reporter: Well, craig, we expect president obama according to officials to speak this afternoon and address the tragedy. He was first alerted at 10:30 this morning by john brennan. He has been updated regularly about the development that is are unfolding right now in connecticut. I'm also told that he spoke with fbi director mueller. He also called the governor of coecticut malloy to extend condolences and offer sympathy and any help that the federal government might be able to provide at this point in time. White house press secretary carney they would daily briefing today and asked about this situation. He said that the president is monitoring this situation quite closely. When we asked him what the president's reaction was, he said it was too early to really answer that but here's a little bit of what he did say about the president watching the developments unfold. Take a listen. 
>> I think it's important on a day like today to view this as i know the president as a father does and I as a father and other who is are parents certainly do which is to feel enormous sympathy for family that is are affected. 
>> Reporter: Carney was asked if the events in connecticut reignite president obama's efforts to try to get stiffer gun control enacted and carney essentially said that today is not the day for that discussion. He said today is a tragedy and that this administration, this president right now, focusing on the victims in connecticut. Focusing on what the federal government can do to aid the state and local officials there working so diligently with that community right now. President obama notified 10:30 this morning by the national security adviser john brennan. He's been getting updates throughout the day. Craig, it is customary when something this tragic or devastating occurs for president obama to address and the nation and today the white house saying it's likely he'll do that again. 

[00:19:50]


>> Quick question. What's the president said about gun control? What's president obama's position on gun control? 
>> Reporter: Well, he supports a ban on assault rifles. And carney specifically asked about that, as well, today. He said the president still supports that ban. You might remember over the summer president obama talked about the importance of stiffer gun control after that tragic shooting in aurora, colorado. He said there are just some common sense measures that can be put in place to try to prevent weapons from getting in the hands of people who should not have them. Since then, very little has been done from this administration, from congress, quite frankly, to do anything to enact stiffer gun control, so he's made some strong statements and in terms of what we might see in the second administration. That remains to be seen but the administration saying that today's really a day to focus on the victims in connecticut and not policy. 
>> Kristen welker, thank you again. We can expect to hear from president obama some point this afternoon. We are looking, this is a live look at newtown, connecticut. Sandy hook, elementary. We are told that the scene is secure. That the gunman, the man who's thought to be responsible for the death of 18 children and at least 8 adults, the gunman dead inside that school. We are starting to hear stories from inside the school and starting to hear from a number of parents, even some students who were inside when all of this went down. Here's reaction now from the brother of one of those students. Take a listen. 
>> With me right now is bargeem baru. You were there. Talk about what you saw. 
>> Well, I mean, the first thing I saw was three injured children. All three of them female and one of them had -- was very bldy. Had a very bloody face and two others carried out by a state trooper. They were not moving and they looked -- I thought it was my sister at first so there's not a lot of security and got near to get a closer look and unfortunately it was -- they looked very pale, very injured, very -- it was bad. 

[00:22:04]


>> Now, you went there to actually rescue yr sister. Right? What did your sister tell you about the situation? 
>> Well, I mean, again, she was very frightened when she came out. She was crying. All the other students were crying and the thing she told me was that it really started when she heard gunshots. She heard scream screams on the intercom. There were screams. And, you know, the school went on lockdown and based on what she said, she was in art class and hiding in a tiny closet bundled up and hearing screams and horrible. 
>> Earlier, you told me you find the situation to be disgusting, that anyone would do anything like this. 
>> It is. It's sickening. You know, horrible that some people, you know, think that they can do this stuff and unfortunately it's a growing trend here. You know, in the united states. And it's just horrible. 
>> And again, you also told me that state police actually told your sister and her class to close their eyes. Describe that scene to me. 
>> Correct. When they were leaving the schools, the school has really one big hallway. Shaped like a square and leaving the school, the state troopers and, you know, the fbi or whoever was there, they were telling all the children to hold hands and close their eyes until they were outside so, I mean, it was what they -- what was in there must have been very gruesome and my sister said she -- what she saw was just police everywhere with -- police with guns and every corner. 
>> All right. Back live here. Let's listen to our nbc affiliate here, wnbc with some new information regarding the relationship between the gunman and that school. Let's listen in. 
>> Opening fire with at least two handguns and there's questions about whether it's some sort of rifle or other weapon and that one law enforcement official saying his mom worked as a teacher in that school. 
>> Jonathan, did your source know whether there were any survivors from that kindergarten classroom? 
>> Don't know. Don't know but the source said that that's where most of the victims were. In that bun classroom. 

[00:24:09]


>> I'm going to triplelarify here. We know that there's a body at a location in hoboken. 
>> We believe there is. 
>> You believe there's body. 
>> In other words, the information we are hearing and i think pete williams was reporting this with the associated press that his parents are dead. 
>> Right. 
>> And so that, you know, maybe it's his dad in new jersey. 
>> Right. 
>> And the mom. You know? I don't know who, you know, in terms of specifics. All I know is there's a scene in hoboken, new jersey, now where they're searching the house where the suspect is from. Believed to be ryan lanaza and that he went up to where his mom worked in newtown as a kindergarten teacher. 
>> Did you have a name just now? 
>> From three sources is ryan lanza. The records match. I think the age of the producer told me was 23. So, you know, we're out. We have crews on the way. Mark santea and thompson heading to new jersey to the suspect's home. Where we'll learn more so again this is all from one law enforcement source. It is a very good source but i just want to -- 
>> all right. We were listening there, again, to the chief investigative reporter with wnbc. The suspect's name at this point we can go ahead and tell you, ryan lanza. He is 24 years old. Again, according to jonathan deantz there, a body was found in hoboken, new jersey. That body at this point, it appears as if, it appears as if it would be the body of his father in new jersey. His mother was a teacher at the school. Sandy hook elementary school and that this point it appears as if he focused on one classroom in that school. We do not -- we do not know whether it was his mother's classroom but we do know that his mom, according to wnbc, his mom a teacher at newtown elementary school. The body of his father found earlier at a home in hoboken, new jersey. Authorities are searching that house we are told. At this point, according to our justice correspondent pete williams, we know that he was wearing all black when he walked in to that elementary school. Two guns were found. One of them, a .9 millimeter handgun. We're working the find out what type, how much ammunition, how he came about the guns, as well. All questions to be answered over the next few hours and days. But again, at this point, his name is ryan lanza. He is 24 years old. He is the person who is found dead inside the sandy hook elementary school, as well. Also, the person who killed 26. 18 children, 8 adults. Maybe nine. But at this point, the death toll is at 26. It is the second worst school shooting in american history. We continue to gather information. Our richard lui is following the nuts and bolls of this. What can you tell us? 

[00:27:32]


>> You know, we look at this here, craig, the reaction is hour five since the first reports of this tragedy coming out of newtown, connecticut. I want to share what some of the concerns and some of the thoughts that have come out. Democratic leader nancy pelosi issued this about 20 minutes ago. She says, quote, no words can console the parents of the children murdered at sandy hook elementary school or describe the pain and shock of an unspeakable tragedy. No words can comfort the loved ones of those brutally taken from us today. All americans share our prayers and our grief over the horrifying events. Again, that's democratic leader nancy pelosi. Also, a statement from governor on connecticut saying with a heavy heart and deepest of sympathies I learned today of the shooting of connecticut. My thoughts and prayers to the families of those impacted by the events transpiring today and teachers, emergency responders and all others touched by the tragedy, unfortunately virginia has our own painful memories of the tragic shootings at virginia tech in 2007. And then finally, for you here, craig, this reaction coming from senator lieberman about 30 minutes ago. And this is coming from his spokesperson. Saying, quote, senator lieberman and his staff are closely monitoring the situation in newtown, connecticut. The senators and prayers go out to those affected by the tragedy today. What's important now is to give it the first responders and local authorities support as it changes and keep the community safe. Just five hours in right now, craig. Still getting information. 
>> All right. Reaction of capitol hill for us, thank you so much. Do appreciate that. Clint van zant is standing by, former fbi profiler and a nbc news contributor. Clint, you have heard the information as it's trickled out here. Over the past few minutes, over the past few hours. Based on what you have heard so far, what can we make of the gunman? 

[00:29:46]


>> Well, as a fbi agent, I was involved in a situation once where an individual killed his mother and father and went in to a bank and started killing people and we finally had to kill him. And what we find -- you know, the worst possible crime, not withstanding the killing of innocent children is an individual to kill a mother or father. When you have that, that person is then so emotionally wrought that he or she is capable of just infinite crimes and infinite evil. And I think we have seen the combination of that today. The most evil crimes we could think of, killing your own parents and killing innocent children and teachers, all came together at this terrible day. 
>> For folk who is are just joining us here at 2:30 on the east coast, we want to update you. 9:30 this morning, in newtown, connecticut, 911 calls started coming in. Law enforcement responded. When they got there, the first order of business to search sandy hook elementary school. They searched the school. They got out as many of the kids as they could. They got as many of the teachers as they cod. That emergency call made, again, about 9:30 this morning. Shortly thereafter, word started trickling out that there were some deaths. P at this point, 26. There were 26 dead. 18 of the dead are children. Eight or nine are adults. That school, by the way, roughly 600 students there. K-4. The ages, anywhere between 5 years old and 10 years old. And about an hour we're told of another news conference. Connecticut's governor expected to hold a news conference. We heard of state police 45 minutes ago. They didn't give a great deal of information telling us that the priority to the families of the children that died there and trying to make sure they get as much information as possible. The shooter dead inside the school. At this point, according to law enforcement, it appears as if he acted alone and told his name is ryan lanza, 24 years old. We are also told some time before his father found dead in hoboken, new jersey. The school, sandy hook elementary school, that school is where his mother is a schoolteacher. We're also told that lanza focused most of his gun fire on one classroom. We do not know whether that was the classroom of his mother. But again, father found dead in hoboken. Law enforcement executing a number of search warrants but we do know that his mother was a teacher at newtown -- sandy hook elementary in newtown. Ryan lanza, 24 years old. Now officials saying that the gunman's mother, a teacher at the connecticut school found dead at the school. This information just coming in to nbc news. Law enforcement -- this is according to pete williams, justice correspondent, now confirming that the gunman's mother was found dead at the school. Earlier law enforcement accounts, earlier law enforcement accounts that a parent was found shot at home apparently not correct at this point. According to our justice correspondent, pete williams, earlier law enforcement accounts said a parent of the shooter was found shot at home. That apparently not correct. I believe we have some sound now from connecticut's governor. Let's take a listen. The governor is horrified by what's happened. He is meeting with the families right now. His chief concern is to get the families, the information they need as quickly as possible. 

[00:33:33]


>> All right. Again, you are looking at the scene above. Sanity hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. We're told it's secure and that the public is safe. But there are a host of questions that we suspect we'll get answered at some point over the next few hours. Clint, there were indications that he was wearing all black. We've confirmed, in fact, that the shooter was wearing all black. He had at least two guns with him. What else can you tell us based on what you're telling us about the shooter? Clint van zandt, are you there? 
>> Yes, I am. We have two pistols. Earlier reported .9 millimeter semiautomatic pistols, a glock and an sig sauer. They're the most popular weapons. Law enforcement, local police, fbi, people who like to be around guns, they're easily available and most of the weapons have at least a 15-round magazine and one in the chamber so realize that the individual with two handguns had at at least a 30-round capability and we have heard reports of 50, 60 rounds or more that were fired that would suggest this man may well and likely would have had to have reloaded perhaps multiple times as he continued to shoot the innocent life that ran before him and then it's overwhelming to think that someone could have that capability. Number one, to shoot anybody. But number two, to harm a child, this 24-year-old, we can only imagine how twisted, how turned and how dark his mind must have been to allow him to do what he did today. 
>> Clint, do stand by for us. I want to come back to you and recap for the viewers just joining us. A short time ago we learned the gunman's name. Ryan lanza, 24 years old, we're told. Law enforcement confirming a short time ago the gunman's mother is a teacher at sandy hook elementary school. That is the school where it went down. That's the school you are looking at right now. We're also told that the gunman's mother was found dead at the school. Justice correspondent pete williams standing by for us now. Pete, a parent was found shot at home, am I understand to the accounts not correct? 

[00:36:04]


>> I believe that's the best assessment that we have at this point. That was the initial word that we'd gotten from a couple of law enforcement officials but it is not unusual in a situation with information coming in so fast there are these miscues and that's apparently one of them. The best information we have is as you just said that the gunman entered the school before 9:30 this morning, went first to the principal's office. Fired a number of shots there and then went to the classroom taught by his mother and focused the brunt of his firepower there with apparently devastating effect, with 18 children killed. Eight adults. Potentiay nine if you count him. Adults killed so it's either 26 or 27 fatal shooting victims, the worst school shooting in recent u.S. History. The other question is whether it was just one person or two. The best information as of this hour is that it's just one. There was a second person taken in to custody for questioning but we have seen no indication that the person was involved in the shooting. Just happened to be there coincidentally and the authorities were questioning that person to see what additional information that he uld provide about the shooting. What the movements were of ryan lanza before the shooting, we don't know precisely when we acquired the guns. I'm sure we'll know that shortly but that's the detail to work out now. 
>> All right. Justice correspondent pete williams there for us in d.C. Do want to ask you just a couple of questions. What's happening at that house in hoboken, new jersey, right now? What can you tell us? 
>> Any address that he's been connected with, police are searching. This is a standard thing to d in one of these situations. As soon as you find out the identity of the person, you immediately get search warrants to search their car, their house to see what additional information you can learn about the motive for the shooting, whether other people were involved. It's important investigative work and going on right now. 

[00:38:06]


>> Pete, did the gunman take his own life? 
>> We don't know the answer to that question yet. 
>> All right. Justice correspondent pete williams, thanks so much. We know you continue to gather information. We'll let you go. Once you have some new information, come back. Thank you, sir. Again, ryan lanza, 24 years old. Pete just confirming that the classroom where most of the shooting happened, he went to the principal's office first we're told. Fired off some rounds there. Went to his mother's classroom. His mother among the dead. One of the eight or nine adults who is dead at sandy hook elementary school. Also just getting a note now. We're told that lanza lives in new jersey. Went to the connecticut school where his mom was a teacher. That is the connection at this point. One point he went to the school and his mom -- where his mom was a teacher. Michelle franzen just arrived at the scene. What can you tell us what about's happening on the ground there right now? 
>> Hi, craig. We have been moved about two miles away where the briefing was held in the past hour. So we're about two miles away from the elementary school. And what we learned at that press briefing was that governor malloy is meeting with those families at this hour, comforting them. Trying to prepare them for what's ahead and also investigators still back on the scene, obviously, they'll have a very dire situation to deal with in the next few hours as they enter that school, as they pour over the crime scene. We have also, also heard that they're executing several search warrants in this area. What police haven't confirmed but we're hearing from other areas at this briefing was the death toll. We're hering that the governor wanted to make sure he was with the families first. That they wanted to make sure that they have those numbers firmed up on their end and that is their priority. Meeting with families here. We mentioned this town, newtown, connecticut. It is a very small new england community about 26,000, 27,000 people. There's a small main street as you drive through up the hill is where that elementary school sits. We're hearing how the community now is also coming together. Short time ago, we have heard that they have already held a prayer vigil at a nearby church and of course in the coming days hearing more of that support system going on. Not only for the family that is are now coping with inevitably the losses to hear more about but also the other students to go through this experience today. And the parents who rushed to their aid, rushing to come find their children today. We have had a producer on the scene earlier and just commented on how the parents were just rushing up to that hill after getting word of the shooting. 

[00:40:55]


>> Michelle, I want you to -- i want you to stand by here and listen in to our nbc news special coverage here. Let's listen in. Take a listen, folks. 
>> From this newtown school, went up to the school this morning, opened fire. Unclear why he decided to target his mom and her class and those young children. What made him snap. What made him do this. The fbi and state police and hoboken police are out at his home searching that apartment now. Meanwhile, up at the crime scene, a massive crime scene and search where he is dead along with seven other adults and at least 18 children. Along with three others taken to the danbury hospital. Children or adults. But just a tragic situation. A lone gunman. Some reporting earlier of a second man in a van nearby. We are told that person was picked up for questioning. Unclear if he has any connection to this but amid the chaos of the scene and the massive response, police, fbi, atf all doing all they can to try to get to the bottom of what they can and said earlier appears to be the work of a lone gunman. Son of a woman who worked as a kindergarten teacher and that he went and opened fire in the principal's office and then the classroom and inside that room of kindergartners where the casualties took place. 
>> Kindergartners. 
>> And the image is not -- it's heart breaking. I live up near that area. I mean, this is a suburban community where parents move to get good schools and great -- you know, little grass for their kids and get a good educion. And they -- you know, just saw the images of the parents rushing to learn what happened. 
>> Imagine getting that call. 

[00:42:56]


>> And they're running to this section where parents are being reunited with their children and some of the parents according to witness who is are giving accounts to some reporters up there is standing saying where's my child? That is how they've got the first indications that something terrible happened and that's why it took so long as the state police went room to room and talking about checking every crevice as the panic, you know, we heard some stories of a gym teacher that huddled all their kids in the corner to try to protect them and shield them as they heard the shots ringing out inside that school and these are sort of the tale that is we are hearing, unspeakable. That little children would be gunned down in their classroom by a crazed gunman armed to the teeth. He was dressed all in black, lester. We are told maybe perhaps a green military type vest with pockets perhaps for extra ammo. 
>> How did he die? 
>> That's I'm waiting to hear back. A self-inflikted gunshot wound or police responded and took him out. Unclear. That part of the investigation continues but the two weapons were found near him. So -- 
>> but you have cleared up one of the issues in terms of new jersey connection. New jersey was where he currently lived. 
>> Hoboken, new jersey, the address and the fbi and state police in hoboken police there assisting connecticut authorities in this investigation. Originally there was confusion reports that his parents or a parent killed and the belief was that crime scene in new jersey was a result of that but then it was cleared up that, no, the mom was a teacher up in newtown and that is why he went up there and targeted that school. He, the suspect, lived in hoboken, new jersey. The mom worked as a teacher in that school, kindergarten. 
>> It is -- I don't know. I don't think we have any words for it. Jonathan, thank you. Let's go to chris hansen now on the phone with us making the way up to the scene. Chris? 
>> Hi, lester. How are you? 
>> Good. Yeah, chris, you're on the air now. Are you at the scene now? 

[00:45:01]


>> I'm not at the scene, lester. I pulled over to speak with you for a little bit here. I can tell you -- I don't want to repeat what colleague jonathan said but obviously we now know that the suspect is ryan lanza, 20 years old. Teacher at the school. Sources are telling me that lanza had besides the military style outfit. Three guns, a long assault type rifle and two pistols. In terms of the crime, it appears that so far and coming from two different sources and fluid investigation that a lot of the 18 children might have been in the very same classroom. And that it was a classroom that, you know, his mother worked at when they started tracing the addresses back that's when authorities found his mother dead earlier today so they're still processing that crime scene. They're still obviously a lot to do at the school and figure out why 20-year-old ryan lanza would out in such a god awful way. 
>> Let's go back to pete williams. Pete, it was interesting that in that news conference, maybe an hour and a half ago, they did not deal with casualty figures although it's been widely reported from sources that 26 dead. Is it a process where right now 
-- 
>> we've been listening to nbc news special coverage. Michelle franzen standing by on the scene for us. Standing by right now for us. Michelle, I assume that you heard from jonathan there and you also -- kristen welker I'm standing by. What do you have? 
>> Reporter: Craig, I can tell you, there's increased activity here in the briefing room. That is because we are just learning that president obama will speak at 3:15. So really in just a few minutes from now. About this tragedy unfolded in connecticut. Of course, it is customary for president obama to come out to address the nation when this type of horrific event happens and what will happen today. and president obama was initially told about this shooting at 10:30 this morning. Alerted by his national security adviser john brennan. He is updated throughout day. He also made phone calls to fbi director mueller as well as the governor of connecticut malloy to offer his sympathy, to offer his ccondolences. Jay carney was asked about reigniting the efforts of stiffer gun controls law. He said today is not the day to talk about policy. It is a day to focus on the victims and those obviously suffering so much in connecticut. So again, we expect president obama to arrive here in the brady press briefing room and address and respond to and react to the tragic event that is have unfolded in connecticut. Craig? 

[00:48:10]


>> All right. Kristen welker from the white house, stand by for me. Want come back to you in a second. But the news, of course, president obama expected to address the nation at 3:15. 26 are dead. 18 of them are children between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. At sandy hook elementary school. That is school about 600 students. Kinder garden through fourth great. We heard of jonathan deantz based on law enforcement's initial assessment, it appears as if 24-year-old ryan lanza 9:30 walked in to the school, started in the principal's office, fired off some rounds there and made the way to his mother's kindergarten classroom. Her kindergarten classroom and opened fire and quh the shooting stopped by the time it stopped, some 18 children lie dead. I don't have any children. But I do live about 15 minutes from the school. And this is -- this is a tough one. This is a very difficult story for a lot of folks in this building. One of our directors has a child who goes do this school and before we came on the air, he was rushing to that elementary school. His child was okay. But a lot of parents, a lot of kids in newtown, connecticut, are not okay. And will not be okay perhaps for the rest of their lives. It is, again, at this point very early in the investigation. We do not know precisely how the gunman got in to the school. We do know based on a number of initial reports he was wearing a vest. He was wearing all black. He had at least two, possibly three weapons. There were pockets. There were pockets inside the vest perhaps for additional ammunition. We're also starting to hear, we heard a few moments ago and starting to hear some amazing stories of survival. The gym teacher that managed to huddle student it is protect them. Also hearing from survivors, as well. In fact, here's ssound. Take a listen. 

[00:50:24]


>> I am here with erin and her son 8-year-old bear. A third grader. He was right there as it unfolded. I really wanted to talk to you. You experienced a lot today. Tell me what happened, where you were when you heard all this happen. 
>> Well, I was coming -- I was going back to my classroom, then I heard something like a person was kicking on the door. Then I turned around and I saw smoke and I smelled smoke. Then bullets whizzed by. Then -- no. Teacher pulled me in to her room. 
>> Bullets whizzing by. Did you see where those bullets were coming from? Did you see the shooter? 
>> Well, they were coming from the right and going to the left. 
>> And take me through how many gunshots would you say you heard as you were in this hallway while walking with an assistant? 
>> Well, I think it was something like ten. 
>> About ten bullets. And your teacher pulled in to the classroom, got you to safety. What was it like? What were the students and teachers saying? What was the scene there? 
>> Well, when I was out in the hall when -- like, everybody heard the bullets -- 
>> yeah. They, like, went in to a total panic. 
>> And how were you doing? 
>> Again, the third grader who was inside sandy hook elementary school this morning shortly after 9:30 when all of this went down. Pete williams, our justice correspondent, standing by. Down in d.C. With the latest on the investigation. Pete, what do you have? 
>> Craig, well, we have now been told we were -- there's been a sort of confusing bit of information about a potential shooting away from the school. And we've now been told by a couple of sources that another family member of ryan lanza, the shooting -- the gunman here, another family member was found shot to death at the family member's home in newtown, connecticut. Now, I don't know what the relationship was. What the relative -- whether it was a parent or a sibling or what of ryan lanza but the second person, because I say second, because authorities tell us that he shot his mother who taught at the school. But that apparently a second family member has been found sot to death at the family member's home in newtown. Now, initially there were some reports as I say it happened in new jersey. How we are told it was in newtown, connecticut. But we don't know what the relationship was and we don't know, of course, the time frame. Obviously, this happened before the school shooting but authorities are not saying at this point who shot this person, although they strongly suspect that it was the same person who committed these school shootings but that appears to be the totality of it here now. It's just been -- taken a while to get the hands around this rapidly developing information. So the numbers, apparently will be the 18 children at the school. Eight or nine adults, still isn't clear to us whether the shooter is concluded in the eight or not and then another victim off campus at the family member -- the family member of ryan lanza at that person's home in newtown, connecticut. 

[00:54:00]


>> Pete, not to further complicate this thing, what's happening in hoboken, new jersey, right now? What's the connection to that home? 
>> There's an address associated with ryan lanza. I'm not sure what the association is but there are searches going on at any addresses he has any connection with. 
>> Okay. 
>> So that's the action in hoboken bu, you know, the initial report that someone was shot there, as far as we know, that information isn't correct. 
>> Pete williams, justice correspondent with the latest on the investigation, pete, thank you so much. The news there. That the death toll at this point has risen. The death toll is up by one. Again, there are three people still in the hospital. We do not know whether those are three adults, whether they're three children. We know at least three people in the hospital right now. We are eecting to hear from president obama at 3:15. He is going to address this tragedy. We also just found out a short time house speaker john boehner ordered the flags on capitol hill at half staff to honor the victims and y can see there the flag not at half staff but some point here that flag and all of the others on federal buildings in the nation's capital lowered to half staff. Dr. Ian smith joining me now on the phone. Dr. Smith, I understand that you are from newtown, connecticut. For folks not familiar with that small town, what can you tell us about it? 
>> I'm from danbury, connecticut, right next to newtown. You know, the reason people are so shocked by this is this particular area in fairfield county is such a bucolic and rural and peaceful area. It's one of the places where people in new york city particularly want the move to because great school systems, lots of grass. In fact, my wife commented seeing the video how big the school was for just 600 elementary school kids. Sandy hook is a small village which is part of newtown. It's a place that for when i grew up there didn't have a movie theater. It's that kind of a place. It's a very quiet bedroom community. Very close-knit community. Not a lot of activities. Because it is so far in to a rural area. But, you know, when I heard on the radio that this happened in newtown, connecticut, I was shocked because not that it can't happen anywhere but these things don't happen in this kind of an environment. You know, my town, danbury, my hometown, they were on lockdown. There's places like new fairfield and new milford, my mother lives in oxford ten minutes from the school and imagine a state that's not accustomed to type of disaster is really up in arms over and just fear. I mean, I'm a father of two boys. And the first thing I thought of was, I can't imagine a parent going up to school, particularly in this area, finding out your child is dead so my heart and words go out to the parents. 

[00:57:08]


>> Dr. Ian smith, thank you so much for joining us from danbury, connecticut, right next door to where all of this went down. Aaron boyd joining me now, with patch.Com for folks not familiar with it, it's a hyper local website and I understand you also have a connection to the area. Where are you right now? 
>> Right at this moment I'm at a park in newtown. It's maybe a quarter of a mile from the school right around the corner where all the press are gathering for a second press conference coming up. 
>> What can you tell us about when's happening on the ground right now? What are you seeing? 
>> Sure. Down at the school, things are starting to calm a bit. They're -- the police are starting to move people away and trying to clear the scene some. Earlier today, it was a lot of panic, a lot of parents coming in just trying to get to the school, parking wherever they could. Just trying to find out some information about their children and what was going on. 
>> Aaron, we know at this point that connecticut governor dan malloy and meeting with these families. Do you know whether all of the children are accounted for at this point? 
>> The children, locked down the schools immediately after it happened. I don't have an official word on whether they have a head count but I would be confident they went through the procedure. The students I know were escorted from the school once everything was settled by class. In order to account for everyone. So I can't speak officially on the record to that but I would say that those considerations are being made. 
>> How's newtown, the psyche, the people there, how are they holding up? 
>> The people are in shock. I have talked to parents, parents that have kids in higher grade levels, everyone is just horrified and shocked and trying to comprehend how something like this could happen. 

[00:59:10]


>> Aaron boyd, patch.Com on the ground there in newtown, thank you so much. As we approach the top of the hour, we want to go ahead and update the viewers just joining us. President obama expected to address the country. At 3:15. At this point, the death toll, the screen says 26. According to justice correspondent, 27 dead right now. At least 18 of them are children. It's a fairly -- in addition to beyond sad, incomprehensibly sad, just as complex. Over the past hour, we found out that 24-year-old ryan lanza, he was found shot to death. In the school. We also found out that some family member, one of ryan lanza

>> This is n.B.R. I am suze ra, this is the eve of a critical weekend for retailers, will stores be filled with buyers or just browsers? The answers will decide how this holiday season turns out. 
>> Good evening, I am tom hudson just in time for the holidays, cheapers gasoline and the prices could keep falling, they could at all below $3 a gallon in the new year. 
>> And why a new program to hell student l borrowers could be a big win for high earners with graduate degrees. 
>> That and more tonight on nbr. 
>> We begin the friday broadcast with the count down to for christmas and the retailers. 
>> So far this holiday shopping season is really looking rather ho-hum. 
>> There is still plenty of time to give retailers and their investors a green season, but it is not clear shoppers will turn into buyers in time. Susan pratt reports. 
>> It doesn't 
>> Reporter: It doesn't get more festive than this. Or this. Or even this. But, just because we've decked the halls, doesn't mean we're hitting the malls. In fact, it looks like u.S. Consumers are doing what they do best in mid-decmber: Procrastinating. How are you doing on your holiday shopping? 
>> Pretty poorly to be honest with you. My wife typically takes care of most of it. Last year, I was definitely ahead of the game. I'm probably 75% to 80% done. Fantastic. Haven't started yet. Hoping to get a jump start on it this trip. 
>> Reporter: Retail expert mike niemira says only half of americans polled recently have finished their holiday shopping. 
>> The consumer is behind on their completion. That means we rely much more on the next few days for it to pick up dramatically. 

[00:02:06]


>> Reporter: Because of all the fiscal cliff doom and gloom, retailers are worried. And perhaps they should be. After all americans think their personal finances will take a hit next year. And that might mean fewer gifts under the tree. 
>> We believe that the post black friday lull that we've seen in the last three weeks that consumers are spending at a very restrained rate simply because they don't have the money and there's a little bit of a fear factor out there. 
>> Reporter: But, there are those who say it's wrong to credit the fiscal cliff for the lackluster holiday shopping season. More likely they think shoppers are playing a game of chicken with retailers, waiting for more stores to drop prices. If that's true, shoppers may be disappointed. 
>> Will retailers react to the softness we've seen, the typical lull? I don't have a sense that that's happening. But, the industry is very fragmfnted. 
>> Reporter: Tomorrow is considered a crucial holiday shopping day. Here in manhattan the forecast calls for sunny skies and cool temperatures. Perfect for a little spending. Suzanne pratt, "n.B.R.," New york. 
>> Well, if you driving to the mall, you are paying a lot less for gas, pump prices are plunging dropping seven and a half percent in november. The national average for gasoline is now $3.30 a gallon. 
>> And that is the main reason consumer prices were down last month. The index of consumer prices which includes everything from the cost of milk to the price of a haircut fell three-tenths of a percent, that is the largest drop since may. 
>> But here on wall street investors ignored that up beat news and were fixated on the stalled talks in washington about the fiscal cliff. 
>> The dow lost 36 points, the nasdaq down 21, the s and b 500 fell, s&p fell also. 
>> Looking at the outlook for gas and oil prices, we turn to an oil analyst, founding partner at again capital. 

[00:04:11]


>> You know, john, I was thinking looking over these numbers a few weeks ago here in the northeast we were paying close to $5 a gallon for gasoline, of course it was because of hurricane sandy and standing in line, gas lines, and now this. I know it is a special situation, but what is going on here? 
>> Well, that was a special situation, it was incredible disruption of the supply chain to the northeast, if you recall, only northern new jersey had to endure the odd, even rationing it shows you how isolated that was, but what is going on here, suze is that the united states is in the process of becoming energy independent, it is in the process of surpassing saudi arabia as the world's number one producer of oil. Because of the shale drilling that going on, mostly in the middle of the country. There is also a massive expansion of a big refinery down in texa that the saudis are working on with royal dutch shell and the industry is refiguring the infrastructure zero to get more of that mid continent middle of the country oil down to the gulf coast where we could see a tremendous price break next year. 
>> That is really amazing stuff, let's look at some of the numbers on gas and oil and your outlook, I will put them up here for gasoline prices. They got as high as almost $4 a gallon in april, they are now at $3.30 as we were reporting, you are predicting $2.85 in 2013, so getting below that critical $3 level. Looking at oil prices, the high this year, $110 a barrel, they are now hovering in the mid eighties, you are calling for $70, maybe $60, I see some estimates for $50 oil, how realistic is that? 
>> It is very realistic. You know, it is funny, we are so accustomed in the past decade or so to being on the edge of the oil equation and by that I mean, we are just -- things are tight, shortages almost if there was any kind of upset in the middle east prices would react violently to the upside but i have been doing this a while and I don't want to date myself but back in 1998 when oil prices fell to about $10 a barrel that was because there was over production, saudi arabia was battling venezuela at the time for market share here in the u.S. And when you talk about 70 or I think merrill lynch's $50 a barrel call, potential call, it is that kind of environment, it is that one I can't there is oil that is being produced really massively in the middle of the country, makes it to the gulf coast, where we see the production in iraq continue to arise, we see the saudis trying to hold on to market share and others that will force this price down, break the back of the entire prices. 

[00:06:52]


>> Just to wrap it up here i want you to put it in perspective because consumers and businesses will be very happy with the low energy prices but it also means that prices are down because the economy is not doing so hot, both in the u.S. And globally, right? And that's not a good thing? 
>> That's right. That's the dark cloud to this silver lining, in that part of this equation and this is not just me forecasting this, opec is worried about it, he stated it, so has the iea if china continues to slow down and they likely will because europe their biggest customer goes into a full-blown recession if not worse, that is going to spell trouble for the global economy, people won't be needing energy and just like we saw in 2008 with the financial crisis, oil gets hit, the prices get hit in that environment, like you said, though, it is a counter cyclical so it is stimulative to the economy, more money in consumers products hopefully to buy and sustain the economy. 
>> Complicated equation there, john, thanks a lot for coming and explaining all of this, have a great weekend. >> 
>> still hot on this friday night, u.S. Manufacturing staying afloat, the luxury boat business made right here in the usa. 
>> It is called pay as you earn, it is a new obama administration program to pay off student loans, the starting date to sign up is next friday. But it looks like the plan favors graduate students who get bigger paychecks than low earning workers. 
>> In the state of 

[00:08:54]


>> Reporter: In his state of the union address almost a year ago, the president announced a change to the way some people pay back their student loans. It seemed like a small change. Instead of paying 15 percent of their income over 25 years, people who enroll in income- based repayment will now only pay 10% of their income over 20 years. But critics say the new program has a big problem, an accounting flaw that could lead to a big windfall for high-earning graduate degree holders. 
>> You've got a moral hazard. You've got an incentive to borrow away knowing that you're not going to have to pay it back. 
>> Reporter: Here's how it can be a problem-- graduate students can borrow an unlimited amount of money to pay for school. They start their careers with small or moderate salaries, making monthly payments of 10% of their income. But remember, grad students often become very high earners, like doctors and lawyers. As their salaries increase, the monthly payments on the student loans are capped based on the borrower's debt at graduation. That means when the debt is forgiven. There could be a whole lot left. 
>> Cutting off payments after 20 years and forgiving your remaining debt is not long enough to essentially claw back the benefit that they got when their income was low. So the system never really rights itself. So if you earn a middle or low income and you have a lot of student loan debt, but go on to earn a high income later in your career, it never catches up with you. 
>> Reporter: Since the program is new, this theory hasn't bee tested. But financial adivsors are telling graduate students to take a close look at the program. 
>> There will be people that are that the new program applies to that the old program did not. There will also be people that are able to have forgiven debt through the new version of the program that the old program did not. 
>> Reporter: Advocates of the program agree the new system does have some holes, but they think the vast majority of people who enroll, even graduate students, really do need the help. 
>> If you are someone who is initially taking advantage of income-based repayment, it's because one of those factors hasn't worked out for you in the immediate short term. 
>> Reporter: One thing to remember-- all debt that is forgiven through income-based repayment is taxable. So without major policy changes, borrowers who do enroll in the program need to plan to pay uncle sam. Sylvia hall, "n.R.," washington. 
>> Out of europe today, regulators took a step toward con pistol indicating oversight of banks, the european central bank says it is taking charge of banking supervision overseeing at least 150 major euro zone banks, ucb says the move will help make the region's financial institutions more secure but more needs to be done to keep europe's debt crisis from escalating. >> 

[00:11:35]


>> fewer smokestacks and tail pipes may be seen in u.S. Skylines in the coming years. The environmental protection agency is tightening standards for soot pollution in a decision that could open the door to more emission limits, the rules come on the heels of a federal decision that cuts back the amount of soot that can be in the air. 
>> This will help decrease heart and lung problems, critics say it will discourage investment. 
>> Speaking of investment, the biggest sharehold search getting more time to buyback the company he founded, richard schultz now has to the end of february to come up with more bank financing. That extension sent shares down almost 15 percent, closing at $12 and reversing yesterday's gains. 
>> Schultz is expected to offer as much as $6 billion for the world's biggest electronics chain. 
>> Well, a lot of back and forth here on wall street, fiscal cliff, fiscal cliff, that is the conversation no matter what is happening with apple, best buy, you name the company. 
>> If only there was more cversation about fiscal cliff, toward a solution maybe, suze, we will see these markets get a bit more volatile. 
>> Really calm markets overall on this friday, in our market focus we did see the major indy the major stock indices saw small losses again today, but continued to trade in narrow ranges. The s&p 500 spent the entire session in negative territory, getting no buying momentum from the drop in consumer inflation. The worst level of the day came less than an hour before the closing bell with the index finishing down 0.4% volume was 672 million shares on the big board. 1.8 billion on the nasdaq. Today's drop erased the gains for the week. The dow fell 0.2% this week. The nasdaq slipped the same. And the s&p 500 is 0.3% lower tonight compared to a week ago. The technology sector led the losers, falling one percent. The sole sector in the green was the materials sector, up 0.9%. Apple was one of the culprits of thakness in the market. Hitting the stock today was a research note from investment bank jefferies indicatiome apple suppliers have received cuts in their orders. It could be adication production bottlenecks for the iphone five have not been solved. Shares fell 3.8%. Volume was heavier than usual. Tonight's close takes apple shares below their mid-november low, falling to their lowest price since february. There have also been concerns about reports of a tess than spectacular launch of the iphone five in beijing china. And some key apple suppliers were caught up in the selling. Qualcomm makes the wireless semiconductors for the iphones. Qualcomm dropped 4.7%. Volume tripled. Jabil circuit shed 5.5% on heavier volume. At least 10 percent of jabil's sales come from apple. And cirrus logic makes audio semiconductors for iphones. Its stock fell 6.7%. Software company adobe fought against the weakness in technology. Adobe is known for its photoshop and other design software products. Last night it reported stronger than expected earnings leading to a stock rally today. Shares rallied 5.7% as volume jumped almost six fold. This is a post-recession high for adobe. Meantime, in the materials sector, steel stocks were the flavor of the day thanks to stronger than expected manufacturing data out of china. U.S. Steel led the gains, shooting up 6.8%. Volume more than doubled with the stock finishing at its highest price since may. And iron ore miner. Cliffs natural resources jumped 5.2%. Iron ore is used to power steel- making furnaces. Many of these steel-focused stocks have been under pressure over questions about chinese demand. The early flu season this year has claimed the corporate outlook for centene. Centene is a medicaid managed insurance provider. It cut its 2012 financial forecast thanks to a more intense jlu season pushing its costs up. That hit its own shares, falling 9.5%. Competitor wellcare also was hit falling 7.9%. Of the five most actively traded exchange traded products were lower. The ging markets fund was the lone gainer up 0.4% and that's tonight's market focus. Ok through the fiscal cliff, not to the fiscal cliff, that is the advice from our friday night market monitor, sandy lincoln back with us, the chief strategist, from the cme group in chicago, sandy, it is great to see you again. 

[00:16:33]


>> I appreciate it. 
>> Are you suggesting investors ignore all of the fiscal cliff worry and the threat of that cliff? 
>> Well, I don't know what we are going to do with the obsession about the fiscal cliff ever goes away, but I think you do have to sort of look beyond the fiscal cliff, not just to the fiscal cliff. There is a lot of obsession about it for understandable reasons, if they dig in their heels there is real fiscal drag involved, we don't think that is is that is the likely scenario, wthink it is much more likely they downsize the size of the cliff and maybe knock half of it off and work on the rest in early 2013, but the more important thing, tom, I think is the secular things they can do in first half of 2013 to improve the trajectory of what we are doing with our entitlement programs and with tax reforms, and if they do that, that is what I mean by looking through the cliff, if those things happen, 200013 could set up and trigger a lot of good catalysts not just in the u.S. But around the world. 
>> Yes that's the big enchilada you are talking about with entitlement reform and tax reform, what lies beyond the cliff or for that matter, you know, what with relooking at in terms of the economy beyond it? 
>> Well, I think if you look at three big factors, tom, europe has gotten better by far, we have got much lower interest rates than europe, much more resolve, stock markets are up nicely there, china which was in free fall, started to rebound, manufacturing started to rebound, gdp is rebound, use of electricity is starting to rebound, exports rebound, you filter all of those in the u.S. Whe you siin the u.S. With a consumer that has got five-year high of consumer confidence, we have got housing inventories that at a four-year low, housing prices up 11 percent year over year, double digit growth in autos and auto loans so to me it looks like the consumer is poised, corporations are lean on the balance sheet side, it looks like if you trigger good secular things and trajectory on the fiscal things in the u.S. You could have a heck of a second six months in 2013 in the market. 
>> A lot of optimism and you are playing it at a movie theaters and begins with lions gate entertainment whomplts knew you were a teenage vampire fan with the twilight movie series, the stock has done nicely this year, how much more do you see the run? 

[00:18:43]


>> Well, I think there is more in it. You know, they not only own the twilight saga and hunger games which are begging obviously for sequels but big tv production studio as well, have mad men, weed, anger management, a lot of food renewal seasons ahead for those and lots of sequels on the movies, the stock is only 11 times earnings, we think there is more to go, although the name has done well. 
>> Aqua financial a new pick here, ocn. 
>> This stock shot more than double this year, 34 and change, how much higher in the next twelve months, do you think? 
>> Well, I think it can go higher, it had a little pullback today and I think it is attractive on pullback, they are the low cost producer of servicing mortgage debt, particularly the low quality sub prime mortgage debt, new york banks want out of that, they have gotten the book from j.P. Morgan, morgan stanley, goldman sachs, they are the low cost producer provider, only sell nine or ten times forward earnings, the valuation expensive and I think the stock has room to go and maybe another two or three years to it. 
>> You have positions in both of those shares, sandy? 
>> The firm has position in the small growth and mid growth mutual fund. 
>> From the cme at sandy lincoln, with bmo asset management. 
>> Coming up next week on nbr, monday is free shipping day, more than 1,000 retailers are expected to pick up the delivery bills and we will tag along with ups delivery truck and on monday we talk with the ceo of giovanni this yogurt companies makes up half of the greek yogurt market and growing. 
>> The china economy is also growing again, a new survey shows chinese factories have been busy this month with manufacturing activity hitting its highest level in more than a year, this could signal china's economy is on track to grow as much as eight percent in the fourth quarter that, is much higher than expected. 
>> It wasn't just china, u.S. Factories also humming ago in november, humming along in, especially with manufacturers in the northeast being idle thanks to super storm sandy, auto parts helped pick up the pace. 

[00:20:45]


>> Industrial public shun in the u.S. Jumped 1.1 percent in november. 
>> Described as widespread across industries, and that is pretty good news for american manufacturing workers, including those in the boat building business. 
>> Reporter: A 42-foot cigarette racing team boat gets pulled out of the plant on its way to biscayne bay for a tesrun in atlantic ocean. This is the end of a months long process for cigarette racing boats, one of the better known american-built luxury boat manufacturers. Don't let the name of the company fool you. They don't actually race boats anymore, at least not formally. But with four engines pushing 1,200 horse-power behind them, these are six-figure performance boats, capable of topping 70 miles an hour on the water. 
>> Our biggest customers are lifestyle addicts. People that like something that is very special, very unique and very custom for them. 
>> Reporter: C.E.O. Skip braver has owned cie racing team for the past decade, weathering the rough waters of boat- building. 
>> When the marine industry was in the worst shape we were putting more and more money into retooling like this boat, building new boats and so what our opinion was to put more money back into the economy to build better things to keep our people working and get more people working in the market was a good time for us. 
>> This is beginning to take the shape of what will be about a $750,000 cigarette boat. This is the deck part. It's actually turned upside down. You'd wind up standing on the bottom side. They turn it upside down. All this is made with american workers here in south florida. They take the deck part and then they put it into a hull which they've manufactured separately. It all it's about 5,000 man hours process to get a finished boat. About four or five month manufacturing time but business has been good enough there's actually a wait list. It's different for american mega-yacht builder trinity yachts. It's tough to callhese boats with prices in the eight figure range or more. Sales have slowed for its customers. 

[00:22:46]


>> In uncertain times, they tend to become a bit more financially conservative. Unfortunately, the other thing we feel is that we feel that there's class warfare. It's making some of the clients reluctant to be seen purchasing an asset like this. 
>> Reporter: It may be difficult to think of these high-priced luxury items as helping the economy but the builders argue it's not about price, but where that money is spent. 
>> Because of this whole one per cent, class warfare and everything, I think its critical that the public understand that these yachts-- forget who the owner is and everything- that's not the important thing, the important thing is that because they're buying these boats, it gives us a chance to have manufacturing jobs. As one person said, if were really interested in redistributing the wealth, a yacht is one of the most effective ways of doing that. 
>> Competition can be tough, no matter which field you work in, but one way to get ahead is by standing out, this week lucid thinking abo street sweepers, here is author and educator lou hef her. 
>> What have you done recently to astonish your customers? 
>> One of karl sewell's car dealer ships in dallas he was concerned the street out in front of his dealership was not as clean as he thoht it could be. 
>> The city street sweepers didn't come often enough so he bought his own street sweeper and has one of his staff people take care of that frequently. It is a be bit extreme I know that but at some level it has to register with his customers and pay him back in many, many ways, as I travel the world I love spotting examples of great customer service and hospitality, such as the coffee shop who writes, enjoy with whip cream on the top of a the bellman who goes to a neighboring hotel to find a foam pillow for me. The water dish for pets outside a bakery in our neighborhood. None of these is going to win a major business prize, but they 
do this: They separate themselves from the competition and give us a reason to keep coming back. I don't know what business you are in, but I know lots of other people speak and write like i do, I am always looking for ways to offer something that others do not. Ask your staff, ask your customers, what's our version of street sweeping? I'm lou heckler. 

[00:25:06]


>> Finally tonight, the story we have to acknowledge, many of us with kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews here, suze, this horrific tragedy that developed in n connecticut, a gunman opened fired this morning, 20 school children, six adults are among the dead, just an awful scene playing out there today in connecticut, and certainly this evening our thoughts and prayers tonight are with those victims and their families. 
>> You know, tom, just no words describe the senseless, tragic, traumatic for everybody involved and for those of us watching all of this, I just hope law enforcement officials and lawmakers do something that we only hear about these things in the future as,at is happening much too often and we are hearing the stories of uncommon heroism coming out of these stories again. 
>> In is nightly business report on december 14th, have a safe weekend, suze.

>> My tears came to my eyes immediately when you know your child is okay. 
>> Inside the school, stories of incredible bravery, the teacher who locked her small children in a bathroom and some who would live to see christmas. 
>> I told them they would be okay. You're going to be all right. 
>> At the white house, today the president grieving. 
>> The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of five and ten years old. 
>> Our abc news team here to bring you the latest on the worst shooting at an elementary school in american history as "world news" begins tonight. 
>> Good evening and welcome to a special edition of "world news." Right here in newtown, connecticut. The site today of a mass shooting and gunfire aimed at elementary schoolchildren. Here in front of the newtown united methodist church where people are gathering and tonight details are still pouring in. 27 victims, 20 children, seven adults. We heard about the incredible response by teachers inside the school, which is considered one of the leading schools in the nation. And also tonight, we have a new image of the suspected shooter as we tell you everything we know about who did it, what kind of weapons and why. We begin all of this with "20/20" anchor chris cuomo. 

[00:02:26]


>> What we know so far is inside this elementary school a group of young kids protected by their teacher. There was one deranged man who decided to take it all away. This morning the sandy hook elementary school was full of kids concerned about christmas and then at 9:40 a.M., Shots rong out. 
>> All unitings, the individual they have on the phone is continuing to hear what he believes to be gunfire. 
>> Inside, little kids are under attack. 
>> We heard all this racquet in the classroom. 
>> Horrible things are happening. Teachers make sure they're safe and then do the unimaginable. 
>> Reporter: What did the teacher do then? 
>> She brought us some books and we talked about things and we played little games in there. 
>> Reporter: Did you hear any more bad noises? 
>> Um, yes. 
>> Reporter: The teacher's calm matched by a storm of police activity, word of two shooters sparked searches in the surrounding area. Children are rushed out of the school single file hand in hand, eyes squeezed shut. 
>> We got in a line and we had to close our eyes. 
>> Reporter: How did you find your way out with your eye clos closed? 
>> We put our hands on other people's shoulders and then our teacher hold the first person's hand and she led us out. 
>> Chaos, nobody knew where anyone was. It was a mob scene of children and police and adult it is. 
>> Reporter: Dozens of family search for their kids as information trickles in. 
>> I heard children were taken out bloody. 
>> I'm very scared, worried about my son. 
>> It was terrifying. I'm still terrified, in shock about it all. 
>> Reporter: A situation that couldn't be any more terrifying, kids at the mercy of a deranged gunman, and yet it keeps getting worse. 

[00:04:28]


>> I need uts and the school. I god bodies here. 
>> Among the dead, adam lanza and his mother. He came way bulletproof vest and four guns, including two semiautomatic handguns and possibly an assault rifle. He killed so many of the kids she loved. 
>> It's a very difficult scene for the family members for all the responding first responders. It's a tragic scene. 
>> Reporter: Yet many more survived, like little ella, who will still have a chance at a merry christmas. 
>> It's over, okay? 
>> Yeah. 
>> It was all the survivors, they're so young, it makes it so tragic. Yet the families are hoping they're young enough that they'll be able to forget and move on with their lives. 
>> Tell us the latest details about why and motive of the suspected shooter? 
>> It is always so important to us because that's the one thing we can learn in the situation, what drove this person to this horrible situation. Yet now it's getting more confusing. Authorities now believe that the gunman's mother was found killed in her home, not at the school. So the question remains now larger than ever, why did this man go to this school? Why did he attack these kids with such intensity? 
>> Details are still coming in, and we'll bring you up to date throughout this hour tonight as we are in this special broadcast. As we drove into town, you know you saw the beautiful hills coming into this incredibly wonderful town and tonight we see the flags at half staff right here in newtown and across the country, the flags are also at half staff, as today president obama addressed the nation tearing up as he talked about the grieving parents and their small children. 
>> The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of five and ten years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them -- birthdays, graduations, weddings. The kids are gone. 

[00:06:50]


>> As we've said all day, we have met people who remind us what teachers do, how much they care, even in the face of terror. I sat down with a first-grade teacher at that school, caitlin roric, she heard gunfire, large windows exploded in her classroom. He got 15 small children into a tiny bathroom to try to save their lives. 
>> I put one of my students on top of the toilet. I just knew we had to get in there. I was telling them it's going to be okay, you're going to be all right. I pulled the book shelf before i closed the door in front of it. 
>> Did you tell them to be quiet? 
>> Oh, yes, I told them to be absolutely quiet. Because I was just so afraid if he did come in, he would hear us and start shooting the door. I said we have to be absolutely quiet. And I said there are bad guys out there now. I just wanted us to be okay. And I was so so saddened that there are people who in this situation are not okay. And my heart, my heart goes out to anyone who knew them and was part of their lives. I can't imagine. 
>> Did they cry? 
>> If they started crying, i would take their face and say it's going to be okay. Show me your smile. Like I really tried to, you know, and one of my students was saying, I know karate, so it's okay, I'll lead the way out. 
>> They said, we want to go home for christmas? 
>> Yes, yeah. I just want to hug my mom, things like that that were just heart breaking. And in my mind -- because you're hearing -- I've never been a part of something obviously anywhere near this traumatic. And so I'm hearing the gunfire in the hallway and I'm thinking in my mind, I'm the first classroom, why isn't he coming? In my mind, I'm thinking as a six or seven-year-old what are your thoughts? I'm thinking that I almost have to be the parent, like I have to tell them -- I said to them, i need you to know that I love you all very much and that it's going to be okay because i thought that was the last thing we were ever going to hear. I thought we were all going to die. I don't know if that's just teachers, but I wanted them to know -- I wanted that to be one of the last things they heard, not the gunfire in the hallway. It's just horrible. 

[00:09:37]


>> How did you know you were going to be okay? 
>> I didn't. What finally happened, the gunfire stopped. It wasn't that long. I said, no, we're staying here until someone comes to get us out. So what happened was, the police came and started knocking and obviously, I mean, I was completely beside myself. I said, I don't believe you. You need to put your badges under the door. So they put their badges under the door. I said, if you're really a police officer, then you would have a way to get in here with a key or -- you would have found the keys. So he had the keys and unlocked the door and then they brought us out with the rest of the teachers and students waiting for parents to come and pick them up. 
>> I think there are a lot of people wish -- want all the teachers to know how much it means to them, how much they care about their children. 
>> How could you not? You know, thank you. 
>> And she only spoke, she said, because she wants us to know this is a school of teachers who care so much about each other and their students. She wanted to pay tribute to all of them tonight. And she is praying for all those who are grieving. And as chris said earlier, we are still getting new details about the suspected shooting, so many questions about who he was, what drove him to do this. Brian ross has been tracking these reports as they come in and he has the latest. 
>> Tonight, police have identified the shooter at 20-year-old evan lans a seen here in a picture taken seven years ago and provided by a family friend. A relative said adam was obviously not well, something we also heard from family friends in newtown, who described the young man has troubled, described his mother as very rigid. This tall took place in this tiny town, a shooting spree that ended at the elementary school, but began at the lanza family home nearby. Police said his mother's body was found in the family home. State and federal authorities believe his mother once worked at the elementary school where he went on his deadly rampage. But she was not a teacher, perhaps a volunteer. As part of the investigation, authorities searched the new jersey apartment of adam's older brother in hoboken. Police initially identified him as the killer until he tweeted, it isn't me, I was at work all day. Police are kneing him and his father at a police station and they want to know what caused it and how and when did he accumulate such an array of weapons and ammunition. 

[00:12:34]


>> Thank you, brian ross. And of course it's an incredibly somber task to talk to the families of the victims one soo senior from a church here in newtown is one of those speaking with the families and today he talked about just how difficult it can be. 
>> The reality is settling in that these 20 children are with the lord now. They've been taken from them too young and too innocent. We just told a little boy about his sister now. I'm so sorry. A lot of these people are from our parish, which makes it pretty heavy for me. I baptized some of these children and they were getting ready for first communion. 
>> An entire community doing what it can tonight. Still ahead here on "world news," a question, american families across the country are grappling with, how to talk to children about what happened. Dr. Richard besser here to weigh in with the one thing that might help heal them tonight. ] day news starts with arthritis pain and a choice. Take tylenol or take aleve, the #1 recommended pain reliever by orthopedic doctors. Just two aleve can keep pain awll day. Back to the news. But when I was in an accident... I was worried the health care system spoke a language all its own With UnitedHealthcare, I got help that fit my life. So I never missed a beat. That's health in numbers. UnitedHealthcare. Questions? Anyone have occasional constipation, diarrhea, gas, bloating? Yeah. ONE Phillips' Colon Health PROBIOTIC CAP Each day helps defend against these digestive issues with three strains of good bacteria. Approved! 

[00:15:18]


[ Female Announcer ] LIVE THE REGULAR LIFE. Phillips'. 
>> And tonight all across the country american families are seeing those images of tragedy. Small children hearing what happened at an elementary school. So we asked abc's chief medical editor, dr. Richard besser, for a guide on what you say to your children. 
>> Just as adults scrambled today to protect children, there are things you can do tonight to protect children from the vubl emotions from the tragedy affecting us all. How you do that will depend on their age. If you child is seven or under and is sitting with you right now, my advice let them go into another room. If they haven't heard about the shooting, they don't need to know about it. You know your child best. If they're between 7 and 12, talk to them about it. Don't lie, don't evade, tell them they're safe. Something like this, where someone hurts a child in school, is an incredibly rare event. It never happened to mom or dad or anyone we know. And the man who did it is gone now. It's over. Ask how they feel about it. Tell them it's okay to be sad, too. Support whatever they feel and tell them that you'll keep them safe. But sharing extra hugs will have more effect on their body chemistry than asking over and over if they're all right. For teens, watch to see how they react. Ask them to talk about it. You can use this toe a real conversation. Why do they think it happened? You might want to direct them to some volunteer work, so they feel they can be working to improve things. For all kids, keep your routine. Children are reassured if their world continues in a normal way. Bedtime is bedtime tonight, soccer practice happens tomorrow. It shows them the world is still normal. If they want you to take them to school on monday, that's fine. But going back to school on monday proves to them that you're not worried, so they won't be. If you're a parent, this can be traumatic for you as well. Reach out and ask for extra hugs, talk with your friends. You have to take care of yourself to be there for your children. 

[00:17:45]


>> Tell us about the signs of something wrong, even if your child doesn't tell you. 
>> It's normal to have a stress reaction, a child who is not sleeping, not eating, who can't focus. A child who is hyperworried, they can't think about anything else, who's not able to return to normal activities after a week or two, they need to get special help. 
>> And don't assume because they say nothing they're not feeling something. Thank you, rich. Coming up, we kept hearing about the training the teachers received inside the sandy hook elementary school they never dreamed they would have to use it, but you're going to hear how they were trained and what they did today. ] bob, a regular guy with an irregular heartbeat. The usual, bob? Not today. 
[ Male Announcer ] BOB HAS AFIB: Atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem, a condition that puts him at greater risk for a stroke. 
[ Gps ] turn left. I don't think so. 
[ Male Announcer ] FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN, And made a monthly trip to the clinic to get his blood tested. But not anymore. Bob's doctor recommended a different option: Once-a-day xarelto??. Xarelto?? is the first and only once-a-day prescription blood thinner for patients with afib not caused by a heart valve problem, that doesn't require routine blood monitoring. Like warfarin, xarelto?? is proven effective to reduce the risk of an afib-related stroke. There is limited data on how these drugs compare when warfarin is well managed. No routine blood monitoring means bob can spend his extra time however he likes. New zealand! Xarelto?? is just one pill a day, taken with the evening meal. And with no dietary restrictions, bob can eat the healthy foods he likes. Do not stop taking xarelto?? rivaroxaban without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping may increase your risk of having a stroke. Get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of bleeding, like unusual bruising or tingling. You may have a higher risk of bleeding ifou take xarelto?? with aspirin products, nsaids or blood thinners. Talk to your doctor before taking xarelto?? if you currently have abnormal bleeding. Xarelto?? can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. You are likely to bruise more easily on xarelto??, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop. Tell your doctors you are taking xarelto?? before any planned medical or dental procedures. Before starting xarelto??, tell your doctor about any conditions, such as kidney, liver or bleeding problems. Ready to change your routine? Ask your doctor about once-a-day xarelto??. For more information including cost support options, call 1-888-xarelto or visit goxarelto.Com. 

[00:20:50]


>> As we said, the teachers at the sandy hook elementary school had been trained to react to a threat never expecting to use that training. Abc's amy robach is with us now and she tells us what the training was and exactly what they did. Amy? 
>> That's right, we're here at danbury hospital where the medical staff toldis they thought it must have been a lot like 911 because they had their entire staff waiting here to receive the injured. Only three arrived. The death count unimaginable, but as you mentioned, so many people are attributing that number to the heroic acts of teachers. If it weren't for their bravery, many in the community believe that number would have been even higher. 
>> Reporter: For the nearly 700 students who attend sandy hook elementary school, it is the teachers' words they follow day in and day out. Today, those words might have just saved their life. 
>> His teacher went and checked, locked and closed the door. They went into a corner until they were recovered by police. 
>> The teacher put them in the corner and they weren't allowed to move until the police came. 
>> Rita has been serving pizza there for more than 30 years. 
>> They're all heroes. 
>> It doesn't sound that the teachers did everything humanly possible, down to risking their own lives to protect the children in this connecticut school. Elementary schools across the country have been preparing for lock down drills, evacuations, and other security measures since columbine. 
>> Reporter: Just this year, sandy hook put into place a security plan. Making it mandatory for visitors to ring a door bell. And if staff didn't recognize the visitor, he or she needed to present picture i.D., Sign in and only then would be let into the school 37. 
>> Eefr time we went to the school, you had to press the button, they'd ask who you are to come in. I don't know how anybody could walk in. 

[00:22:54]


>> This tweet from teachers. 
>> My cousin is the assistant principal at the newtown shooting and was shoot twice. 
>> This face telling it all, this woman's sister, one of those teachers inside the school, her whereabouts unknown. 
>> There's no words that I could come up. You don't know the details of the violence and you can't do anything to help them or protect them. That is a powerless and terrifying experience. 
>> Reporter: Speaking of powerless, I just spoke to one of the doctors here who was at danbury hospital when they received the initial call of multiple shots fired he amassed 80 doctors and nurses waiting to receive any potential victims and injured. Within the first ten minutes, they got those initial three injured and they were waiting for more. They were told as many as two dozen they would receive. Within 30 minutes when they didn't show up, that's twh they felt the gravity of the situation because they knew they weren't coming, they were at the school and would stay there forever. It was a very disturbing moment for all of them. They said they're still going to be dealing with this obviously for months and years to come. This community is forever changed. No one here hasn't been touched by this horrific tragedy. 
>> And no one in the country, amy. Thank you so much for porting tonight. When we come back, we have been receiving incredible images from this day and we're going to show you some of t latest. We just received this. That was ME... the day I learned I had to start insulin for my type 2 diabetes. Me... thinking my only option was the vial and syringe dad used. And ME... discovering once-daily Levemir?? FlexPen??. FlexPen?? is prefilled. Doesn't need refrigeration for up to 42 days. No drawing from a vial. Dial the exact dose. Inject by pushing a button. FlexPen?? is insulin delivery... MY way. Levemir?? (insulin detemir [rDNA origin] injection) is a long-acting insulin used to control high blood sugar in adults and children with diabetes and is not recommended to treat diabetic ketoacidosis. Do not use Levemir?? if you are allergic to any of its ingredients. The most common side effect is low blood sugar, which may cause symptoms such as sweating, shakiness, confusion, and headache. Severe low blood sugar can be serious and life threatening. Ask your healthcare provider about alcohol use, operating machinery, or driving. Other possible side effects include injection site reactions. Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines you take and all of your medical conditions. Get medical help right away if you experience serious allergic reactions, such as body rash, trouble with breathing, fast heartbeat, or sweating. With FlexPen??... say good night to vial and syringe. Ask your doctor about Levemir?? FlexPen??. Covered by 90% of insurance plans, including Medicare. Find your co-pay at MyFlexPen.com. is work. And his new boss told him two things -- cook what you love, and save your money. Joe doesn't know it yet, but he'll work his way up from busser to waiter to chef before opening a restaurant scializing in fish and game from the great northwest. He'll start investing early, he'll find some good people to help guide him, and he'll set money aside from his first day of work to his last, which isn't rocket science. It's just common sense. From td ameritrade. silver. it. Then I read an article about a study that looked at the long term health benefits of taking multivitamins. They used centrum silver for the study... So I guess my wife was right.

El pais esta de luto, hoy ocurrio una de las peores masacres de su historia, entre las victimas 20 ni??os de una escuela primaria, y 6 adultos de newtown, el agresor tambien resulto muerto, entre las victimas esta su madre profesora de la escuela sandy hook. La tragedia sacudio el pais derramando lagrimas incluso del presidente obama, tenemos una amplia cobertura. Comenzamos en newtown, esta en vivo blanca rosa. 
>>> Jorge, buenas noches. Y este pueblo esta totalmente conmovido, y el pais entero con los datos que conocimos, y de estar frente a una tragedia de dimensiones que no habiamos visto. En el transcurso tuvimos tres conferencias de prensa, esperamos que se produzca la ultima conferencia de prensa por esta noche. Las autoridades han dicho que no van a darnos la relacion oficialmente de las personas que han perecido, entre ellas 20 criaturas, y 6 adultos que sean algunos de los 50 profesores. Veamos un recuento de este tragico dia para estado de connecticut. 

[00:02:25]


>>> Un dia tragico en la historia de estados unidos, todo comenzo aproximadamente a las 9:40 de la ma??ana, un joven de 20 a??os ingreso al salon en la escuela primaria sandy hook y disparo contra los ni??os. 
>>> Cuando llegamos no habia mucha seguridad, salieron tres ni??os y uno con el rostro ensangrentado, y otros dos en brazos de policias, tenian los rostros muy palidos, dijo el hermano de una estudiante, el balance inicial 18 ni??os muertos en la escena. Ademas mato a otros 5 adultos. El pistolero esta muerto dentro, hay mucho trabajo por hacer para encontrar toda la informacion acerca de este individuo. Segun los primeros reportes mas de un centenar de balas disparadas, ni??os testigos relataron como se escondieron dentro de closet y ba??os para escapar de las balas como este peque??o que dijo... "Yo vi como las balas me pasaban hasta que un profesor me jalo". La policia dijo que todo ocurrio en una sola seccion de la escuela. La directora y el sicologo de la escuela estan entre las victimas. 
>>> Mi vecina escucho el tiroteo, llame a la escuela, y cuando nadie respondio tome mi auto y vine hasta aca. 
>>> La policia habria hallado muerta una persona dentre de una casa en connecticut que se presume que es un familiar. Newtown esta a 80 millas de hy, y tras conocerse la noticia los padres llegaron para reconocer a los peque??os hasta demasiados fueron trasladador, los padres de al menos 20 de ellos no pudieron abrazarlos. 

[00:04:52]


>>> Hay dos compa??eros de clases de adan lanza que es el principal sospechoso que estan siendo interrogados, preguntamos si hay un vinculo con estos dos ex compa??eros de el, solamente que lo conocen desde peque??o y eran amigos, y que le resultaba dificil comunicar algunos de sus planes. Con respecto a los familiares, a los padres de la criaturas que han perecido esta tarde se encuentran en una habitacion que esta bastante lejos del acceso de la prensa, y repitieron que primero le van a dar los nombres a ellos, y que despues van a hacer oficialmente la lista y la van a dar a conocer a nosotros. Un dia tragico. 
>>> Gracias. Y otro escenario vinculado a esta matanza es hoboken donde la policia tiene acordonado un edificio donde vive el hermano del pistolero. Alex nos trae la mas reciente informacion. 
>>> Buenas tardes, evamos aqui toda la tarde en esta ciudad que esta al norte de nueva jersey que resulto involucrada en esta tragedia, en este lugar esta acordonado por la policia, varias cuadras a la redonda donde aparentemente vivia ryan lanza, el hermano mayor de adan lanza, y dijo que el compotamiento de adan es de una persona que tiene problemas de comportamiento y que sufre de autismo, fueron interrogados varios de las personas que vez vivian en este lugar, y podemos ver que las autoridades presuntamente van a dar un comunicado luego de varias horas de espera, y resulto involucrada. Y aqui vivia ryan lanza, hermano mayor que fue entrevistado, y que dijo que el asesino tiene problemas de autismo y de comportamiento. Estaremos pendiente de lo que ocurra en esta rueda de prensa en esta ciudad al norte de nueva jersey. 

[00:07:36]


>>> Muchas gracias. 
>>> Y como dijimos anteriormente, fue impresionante verlo, el presidente hablo al pais y no pudo contener las las lagrimas, y dijo que habra acciones significativas para que no vuelva a pasar. 
>>> Las banderas de estados unidos ondean a media asta, y las instalaciones militares alrededor del mundo por orden del presidente obama. Visiblemente tuvo que secar sus lagrimas en un discurso sobre la matanza de hoy y sus victimas, nuestros corazones estan rotos. Lindos ni??itos, peque??os, de entre 5 y 10 a??os, tenian su vida entera, cumplea??os, sus propios hijos, tambien habia maestros, hombres y mujeres que dedicaron sus vidas a ayudar a que realicen sus sue??os. Llamo para expresar sus condolencias y hablo con el director del fbi. Aludio a la pregunta de muchos, el facil accesoas armas de fuego, estan bajo la proteccion de la segunda enmienda que garantiza el derecho a portar armas. 
>>> Vamos a tener que unirnos y tomar acciones significativas, sin importar la politica. No se podido renovar una prohibicion a la venta de armas largas, en gran parte por la gran influencia de la asociacion nacional del rifle. 
>>> El presidente debe reconocer que fuera de la tragedia que estamos viendo, el sabe bien que los votos no estan ahi para tratar de hacer drastico para revocar la segunda enmienda. 

[00:09:40]


>>> Aquellos que buscan mas controles esperan que haya un cambio. 
>>> Esto no es un problema politico, es de salud publica. 
>>> El portavoz de la casa blanca dijo que ya habra tiempo para discutir lo que este evento significara. El presidente visitara newtown en los proximos dias aunque no se confirmo cuando. Dijo que su primera reaccion a noticias co estas es como padre y no como presidente, y que haran lo mismo que todos los padres del pais, abrazaran a sus hijas un poquito mas fuerte y les diran cuanto las quieres. 
>>> Gracias lourdes. 
>>> Seguiremos con mas. Y tenemos un recuento de las masacres mas significativas en los ultimos 20 a??os. 

[00:14:34]


>>> (Hablan en ingles). 
>>> (Hablan en ingles). 
>>> Dificil de recordar un momento en el que un presidente de estados unidos llora de esta manera. Durante las coberturas de los sucesos en vivo suele ocurrir que los datos que se divulgan cambian en cuestion de segundos, fue el caso de esta tarde nre que se origino un dato erroneo sobre el nombre del sospechoso. 
>>> Minutos despues de la masacre la nacion conocia la cara del sospechoso, la prensa utilizo facebook para identificar el nombre de ryan lanza, pero el problema es que no era el responsable. 

[00:16:46]


>>> Como antes se difundia un rumor en un peque??o pueblo ahora es mundial ya que estamos conectados a personas en todas partes del mundo y pasa instantaneanticipadamente. 
>>> Despues las autoridades dijeron que su hermano adan lanza era el responsable. 
>>> Una informacion falsa es provista por alguna persona y es mas facil decir voy a repetir esta informacion que tratar de ver la fuente. 
>>> La policia dijo que el que se quito la vida en la escuela es adan lanza. Los medios sociales demostraron ser una importante herramienta de comunicacion, pero la instantaneidad tiene sus riesgos, lo que ocurrio hoy es un buen ejemplo, y seguramente no sera el ultimo. El san francisco, luis mejid. 
>>> El propio presidente lo dijo esta tarde, hemos pasado por demasiadas tragedias como esta, y lo decimos en nuestra cobertura, son 23 masacres en los ultimos 20 a??os. Lourdes preparo un recuento sobre estas matanzas, desde 1999 cuando tuvo lucar la masacre de columbine. 
>>> Este martes 11 de diciembre en un centro de diciembre, jacob de 22 a??os comenzo a disparar matando a 2 personas que estaban realizando compras. Y en septiembre 27 un individuo entro a un centro labaroral mato a 5 personas. Y en 5 de marzo de 2003 en un templo sij un hombre mato a 4 personas. Y en un cafe un hombre entro y mato a 5 personas. El 2 de abril de 2012 otro masagre. Y recordemos la masacre en el que hicieron a la congre sista gabrielle giffords. Y un siquiatra del ejercito comenzo a disparar en fort en texas. El 16 de abril del 2007 en virginia tech un estudiante le dispara a 56 personas matando a 32 de ellas. El 20 de abril en el que ocasiono mas muertes en la historia de este pais, dos adolescentes matan a 13 y hieren a 21 en la triste celebre masacre de columbine. Y verdaderamente los ultimos 30 a??os desde 1982 en este pais ocurrieron 61 asesinatos masivos, la tasa de homicidios en estados unidos es 6.6 veces mas alta. Y la de homicidios con armas de fuego es 19.6 veces mas alta. Los numeros son sorprendentes y dan miedo. 

[00:21:08]


>>> Impresionan las estadiscas, mueren mas personas en estos hechos que en guerras. 
>>> En todo estados unidos hay 300 millones de armas. Y 38% de los hogares en estados unidos tienen armas. 
>>> Esta en noche una vision mas consolidada. 
>>> Esta noche saldra a traves de de telefutura porque transmitiremos por univision el teletonon, tendremos la informacion desde connecticut, por esta masacre en la escuela de newtown, y ademas un reporte exclusivo sobre el avion en el que viajaba jenni rivera y que involucra a la agencia federal antidrogas del pais. Con esto y mas por telefutura 11:30. 
>>> Gracias. Regresamos con mas en instantes en esta edicion especial del "noticiero univision." ??? ??? ??? ??? 

[00:25:49]


>>> imagenes de la masacre. Entre los 20 ni??os hay una ni??a de origen puertorique??o. Y en newtown al menos un 3% son hispanos. 
>>> Vamos a regresar hasta esa poblacion, ahi esta blanca rosa. > 
>>> buenas noches, un dia tragico aqui, y tenemos que reportar que la primera victima oficial se trata de la nieta de la hermana del alcalde de maunavo, jorge marquez, es que oficialmente comunico esta noticia, la peque??a ana grace marquez tenia 7 a??os y es una de las 20 criaturas que han muerto hoy. Es un hecho lamentable, y que curiosidad que la primera victima oficial sea una ni??a hispana, algo que enlutece a toda una comunidad, a la comunidad latina que tiene una presencia notable en esta ciudad, hemos conversado con personas que se han referido a la comunidad latina y a su presencia, con respecto al colegio nos informaron que en el transcurso de esta noche nos van a decir las autoridades oficialmente alrededor de las 9 de la noche los nombres de las victimas. Tambien ya se estan congregando algunos residentes del area en el centro de la ciudad para poder hacer un homenaje a las victimas, se trata de una congregacion en los alrededores de una capilla en esta ciudad, y donde estas imae ges en vivo nos pueden dar la idea de la profunda conmocion que hay aqui, la reunion fue citada para las 7, pero desde las 6 se estaban congr congregando. Algunas son personas que han logrado sobrevivir. Y que puso de luto al pais entero. Y que hemos podido observar y escuchar los testimonios de los sobrevivientes, es curioso y realmente doloroso escuchar los testimonios de criaturas de 5 a??os que decian que eran sonido de puertas, sino ruidos de balas. Algo muy conmovedor. 

[00:28:47]


>>> Gracias, blanca rosa. Y al final veremos si cambia algo despues de columbine, de virginia tech, y dicen que las cosas van a cambiar. 
>>> Lo que cambio es que los padres nos sentimos mas vulnerabres. 
>>> Es la percepcion de hoy, a cualquiera nos pudo ocurrir, y por eso nos toca de una forma especial. 
>>> Gracias por haber estado en esta cobertura especial. 
>>> Es la obligacion, pero es la realidad. 
>>> Gracias, buenas noches. ??? ??? ??? ???

=======================================================

Zandt. Clint, give us your read, your assessment, on this situation? 
>> Well, we know that the shooter is dead. We don't know whether that is by law enforcement action when the first responding officers went in and confronted him or whether, as we saw in the portland, oregon, mall shooting this past week, whether the shooter actually shot himself committing suicide. We know that at least two handguns were found. You know, that takes us back to april 2007 when the shooter at virginia tech, in that case, who killed 32 and wounded 15, also had two handguns. What it does suggest, though, is that this individual went in there with carrying two handguns and perhaps other ammunition. He went in there apparently to confront someone. We're told that confrontation took place in the office of the school and may have spilled out from there. We're still trying to understand the number of victims and the level of inju 
>> clint, you know, when we talk about these shootings, first off, they are mentioning that it's happening with a frequency that is absolutely horrifying in temz of the fact that this is something that seems to be recurring, an actual nightmare that keeps happening. In terms of the ages of the students here, this -- up until now most of these shootings have happened on college campuses. A few have happened at high schools. The fact that this took place at an elementary school, what is your read on that? 
>> This is a new low, unfortunately, for us. Now, we've seen this take pce overseas. Weave seen it in asia. I recall one situation, I think, was in japan where an individual went in with a knife and stabbed a number of children around this tender age too, but you normally don't see this, but we do see, unfortunately, about 20 mass shooting incidents which may well turn out to be. We'll see an average of 20 of these per year, and, unfortunately, that number doesn't go down, and at least this year it appears that it's gone up. 
>> Clint, wnbc is reporting that there may be more bodies in the elementary school. Essential this is an unfolding tragedy. I want to bring in our panel here, and also joining us on the phone -- sorry. Joining me today in set in new york city, the golden strip, michael eric dyson, host of nbc, melissa harris perry from the nation, and ari melbourne, columnist for the washington post and msnbc contributor jonathan capehart. This is, unfortunately, something that is tha has happened a number of times this year. An ongoing national nightmare, these shootings that take place. I guess my first question is an unfolding situation. Certainly we are getting more details there. There may be more bodies in the school. We don't know yet. Melissa, I go to you first as a mother when youear about this, and, you know, the ages of these children here. We're talking about an elementary school. It is a moment, obously, for self-reflection, but also a sense that when is enough going to be enough in terms of violence in this country? 

[00:03:05]


>> We have to be careful because this is an unfolding event. We don't know what all the stories are, but essential as a parent -- but not just as a parent. For every one of us who sends, you know, our mom off for the day or our spouse off or our kids, you know, this idea that we live in such a contingent environment where at any point, you know, your child might be shot at a gas station or might be a victim of violence in a school, that is about the availability of guns, so let's just be really clear. You know, we live in a world where bad things happen in a ton of different ways. In the american context, the idea that someone you love or yourself could be the victim of gun violence, particularly if it's random gun violence, is because of the availability of handguns in this country, and it's hard to imagine being about any other thing. 
>> Also, there's the question -- michael eric dyson, we talked about institutional failure in a political context, but here you have schools, right, which are in and of themselves supposed to be a sacred place, that have become places where the students are victims effectively, and what does that do to essentially -- of national confidence? What does that do to a sense a sort of despair in the american -- in american society? 
>> Well, the national psyche is bombarded by these kind of elements. Melissa has already indicated, the arbitrary random character of that violence points to the fact that the ecology of violence in this culture breeds this kind of random assault upon the targets that are available when somebody gets pissed off, mad at work, but schoolchildren, especially, even more you think about synagogues, churches, and temples, which have been the victim where we've seen victims mowed down, but the school is the national, if you will, altar of our collective civic consciousness. Everybody doesn't go to church. Everybody goes to school, or mostly everybody does. This is where our national vult meets the widest possible population of americans, and it does say tha we feel out of control. We don't know how to control it. We talk about it, but we can do some things. That is, talk about gun violence. Talk about the ready accessibility to those guns and how those guns are distributed, how it's easier to get a gun license than it is to vote. That's the reality of america, and we have to be honest about it. 

[00:05:19]


>> Your assessment in the situation when you first heard about it, in terms of both the political side, the gun control question, the institutional side, the failure of an american sort of system in terms of protecting its own from a legal perspective. There are also a number of different sort of ramifications for this. 
>> What we do know is it's a tragedy, as you are reporting. We don't know a lot yet about what happened. Mr. Dyson was talking about what it means when we have our schools attacked and people in our schools, our students, our children, it's obviously incredibly stressful and traumatic, and we have seen that in school shootings that we've had repeatedly. Not speaking specifically to this incident because we don't know enough, but speaking more broadly, we donow that we have a lot of rules about keeping guns out of schools and gun-free zones. We know that we have mass incarceration because we have more people many prison than any other nation. What we don't have from a policy perspective, speaking broadly, is a lot of restrictions on the access points to the weapons themselves. I think you can say that as an observation about where the policy balance is without necessarily going further into what people worry about, which is, well, is that political? Does that mean there's only one thing to do? No. There's more than one way to look at this from a policy perspective. There's no doubt that the access to the weapons is a part of the policy puzzle here, and if we're going to take it seriously, we have to look at that a well as the other issues, the mental health issues, the incarceration issues, and whether we are doing all that we can so that when we look up at a tragedy like this, we know that we've taken the policy steps that are possible. 
>> Jonathan, you live in washington d.C., And I grew up in washington d.C., And i remember actually going to d.C. Public school system. I was in the d.C.P.S. For my entire life up until graduation, and I remember there was in the 1990s THERE WAS A LOT OF Violence in the city, and there were metal detectors many schools, and it was optically an unpalettable thing. You are sending high school students through metal detectors. It was an open acknowledgment that schools were a place of violence. The fact that this is happening at an elementary school, i think, it takes that to another level in terms of where we have come as a society. 

[00:07:36]


>> Right. This gets to what I was going to say. This is not the first school shooting that we've had to endure. Think about columbine and the school shootings here in new york city and washington d.C., in chicago. Places all over the country. It was students. People prone to students in the student body. This is a high school. This is an elementaryschool. This is apparently clearly someone from the outside coming in last night elementary school must be that, and this is what's so chilling about what's happening here today in connecticut. 
>> Clint, I want to go to you before we have to go to break, but in terms of the reverse 911 call, do you have any details on how that happened, that we know that the first 911 call was made at about 9:40, 9:41. The school then seemed to alert students who might still be home or were not yet at school or their parents about what was happening. Do we have any more details on that? 
>> No. You know, that's been a very -- that's been a very good system for the schools, for colleges to be able for parents to subscribe to that service to let everyone know. In america we have about 285 million guns, so the gun problem that's not going away, but today in china a man with a knife stabbed 22 children and a teacher in an elementary school in china today, so this is -- the gun violence may be unique to america as far as acting out on our schools, but violence against children, against schools, again, 22 children stabbed in china today. In 2010 28 children and two teachers were stabbed in china, so this level of violence, both in china situations were in elementary schools. We have to deal with the overall concept of violence because it can, obviously, be done with handguns, as we saw today with knives as china was today. 

[00:09:53]


>> Clint making a very important point that this is not simply about guns and gun control, but a cull toor of violence that is, unfortunately, international. We are expecting a news conference from connecticut state police at 1:00 p.M. Eastern. We will bring that to you live ahead, but, first, we are going to get a live update from wnbc's jonathan dietz, more breaking news after the break. cold.

[00:13:31]


>>> Welcome back. We have the latest -- we have some updates on the shooting at sandy hook elementary in newtown, connecticut. We are first going to go to jonathan dietz. We are sorry. We are -- we have clint van zandt, an fbi profiler and criminal expert on the phone. Clint, for some more updates on this, do we have anything else to report? There was wnbc unconfirmed report about more bodies that has since been retracted. Is there anything else many terms of by way of details on this? There is one person apparently dead. He may or may not have been the unarmed shooter. Do you have anything more you can share with us? 
>> Number one, I always appreciate the caution that msnbc uses to not report things until they're actually fact. The newspapers in that area are reporting that at least one teacher was shot m foot and that there may well have been other injuries sustained likely by students. He extent we don't know yet, we do know from the mayor in the local area that at least three people have been rushed to the local hospital. He also made reference that he couldn't get names or conditions until the next of kin were located. When we hear terminology like that, that makes us think the very worst, but, again, we'll hold off until we know for sure. 
>> Thank you, clint. Our own chris jansing is standing by with some new information. Chris, could you give us an update? 
>> What we do know from pete williams, and you reported this earlier, that there were some reports, and he got this from a federal official that, some children had been shot, but we are getting descriptions from people on the scene that are as horrifying as you could possibly imagine of doors being, you know, kicked down and federal officials as well as local officials going in with tir guns drawn. Obviously, trying to secure the situation. There were also reports that at least part of the shooting took place in a kindergarten classroom, so we're talking about 5-year-old kids who are facing such a horrific situation and, finally, we will tell you that governor malloy is being updated both by state police and by federal officials, but an absolutely horrendous scene being described as some of these early reports are coming in from people who are in there, alex. 

[00:15:45]


>> Chris, in terms of this, we've been talking a little bit about this reverse 911 call, which makes it sound like some students were not at school yet or the school was trying to take every measure possible to insure that parents were informed as to the situatio which seems to be a very quick response on their end in terms of getting the information out there and trying to calm understandably very concerned parents. 
>> This is something that technology has done that is tremendously helpful in situations like this, that they have this reverse 911 situation set up because, obviously, previously, and I remember this from having covered the columbine shooting very extensively, a lot of the information would come out at that point anecally that parents calling parents and even more chaos could enshoe because people don't know what's going on. At least the initial bit of information that gets out there to parents is information that the school is rabl to control isible to get people there who they want there, where they want them to come, so it gives at least officials on the scene not only more control of the situation, but it also allows them to control some of the chaos, and in a situation like this, which, again, as we were talking to clint earlier, alex, we have not seen here but in other countries where you have a shooting like this at an elementary school, obviously, you want to get parents there because this is so traumatic for such young kids that they're able to control the situation, get the kids reunited with their parents, and at least help them to calm down a little bit and on both sides, on both the parent and the teachers -- rather, the parent and the children side. This is one instance where this technology, reverse 911, helps everybody involved in a situatn that is so horrific. 
>> You are a professor, and the thing we haven't talked about this, the other piece of this dynamic, there's obviously the law enforcement, the parents, the children, the teachers who were in the classroom, so who, you know, in terms of the role they represent in the lives of students, and in the situation like this, we certainly don't know any of the details, but one can assume a teacher in that position seeing someone with a gun coming in to do harm to a school, I can only imagine how a teacher sort of deals with that, and many of these cases, people end up being heroes and play a pivotal role. We get more details, and the role that the teachers in this elementary school played, especially with children that young. 

[00:18:24]


>> There's no question about that. Because they are so young, you feel an even greater obligation to try to protect these vulnerable children. Let's talk about what the real deal here is. When we see something like this, we're talking about an act. Let's be careful here. I mean, the technical definition of terror. This is something where we recognize no noncombatants. Gu into a school, and everybody is vulnerable. We're not talking about ethnicity here or -- we're talkinout ink baiting at the heart of american culture is an addiction to violence that renders us all victims on any given day of random acts of being pushed in front of a subway, of being shot in an elementary school, and the authority figure of the teacher, the psychic scar on a child is even doubled. Not not just are you being -- the teacher is being attacked as well. That destroys the psychic infrastructure of a child for how many years to believe that no one can actually protect them? 
>> Melissa, you are a professor as well, so I'm sure you have thoughts on this. 
>> Yes. I guess part of what I was thinking is that point was so well taken. Both chris's story about the trauma that you undoubtedly see as a result of this, no matter what ensdz up being true about injuries to children, physical injuries, the trauma that the young people are going to experience is extreme, that this community is going to experience, but I want to pause because what an opportunity like this is, as horrifying as this moment is, is to remind us that there are children living in cities where they are experiencing this kind of trauma on a regular basis, and you talk about it briefly when you were talking about guns and growing up in washington d.C., Living in new orleans my daughter goes to chicago in the summers. The fact is that that sense of vulnerability and violence and the post traumatic stress that it generates for young people, who live in these conditions, so we're going to see it in this hyper-focused, horrible moment of this tragedy, but the fact is that we are seeing it for a whole generation of people all across this country. 

[00:20:26]


>> A very fair and well made point. W nbc is reporting that an fbi spokesman in connecticut says fbi agents are on the scene offering assistance and support to state and local authorities. The fbi is defefring all comments about the incident and investigation to local authorities. We are also getting word of two news conferences within the hour. One from the danbury hospital and one center state police. We will have more information after the break.Blind taste tests, even ragu users chose prego. Prego?! I've bought ragu for years. 
[ Thinking ] WONDER WHAT OTHER QUESTIONABLE Choices I've made? I choose date number 2! Whooo! 
[ sigh of relief ] 
[ Male Announcer ] CHOOSE TASTE. CHOOSE PREGO. ??????

>> We are back with more developments. Sandy hook is a school of 600, 5 to 10-year-olds. The apparent adult shooter is dead. Police have recovered two handguns. The scene unfolded earlier today when a 911 call came in at 9:Had 11 a.M. And at 9:57 there was a reverse 911 call to the homes of students informing them that there was an incident at their school. Parents are currently being reunite the with their children. Police are on the ground inside the school searching room to room. Connecticut state police have scheduled a news conference for 1:00 eastern. We are getting record of two news conferences within the hour. One from the danbury hospital and one from state police. Wnbc's jonathan dietz joins us now. What is the latest? 
>> Well, the latest is that at least one gunman is dead. There are some unconfirmed reports that there may, may have been, a second suspec and that is why there is this enormous lockdown in and around the neighborhood. That, again, is unconfirmed. There were some reports about a van being found a few blocks from the scene, and that was being checked out. What we do know is that one gunman is dead, and that two .9 millimeter handguns were found at the school near him and it is unclear if he took his own life or if he was taken out by the responding police. Newtown police, connecticut state police, the fbi, atf, among the many agencies responding to this scene, and we are told from hospital officials that at least three people have been transported there. They are not saying if they are adults or children, and police are not saying whether there are victims missed that school at this hour. The 911 calls began flooding in to police about a shooting both in and around the school campus there, and there was a massive response. Not only is there a lockdown at that school, but there are a lockdown in place at all community schools and the community has a precaution. There is some concern, some connecticut newspapers are reporting that at least one if not several children are victims. We do not have that information. We are waiting this news conference to get some numbers. We have spoken to a couple of law enforcement officials who are voicing concern that this shooting is worse than the information that we have at this time. The information we do know is that two guns were recovered. At least three victims were transported to a area hospital, and that police, fbi, attf all on scene at that school going room to room searching everywhere for anyone who may still be inside and to make sure that things are secure. Also, there is a scene in and around the area of the school as police search as a possjbility if there was a second gunman, but, again, there is no confirmation to that, so, again, one gunman dead. At least three injured, and the question now is the casualty toll going to rise from here? Unclear. As of now gunman dead, three injured. That's the best we know right now. There is some reports that at least one child, if not more, have been injured. That's m connecticut post and the hartford current newspapers. Back to you. 

[00:27:21]


>> Jonathan, we hear that governor malloy is on his way to the scene. Do we have any sort of -- do we have any sense of how these events unfolded? We know that the first 911 call was about 9:45 this morning. Was there any sense of how things -- you know, the series of events that led to that 911 call? 
>> There is some reporting from the parents that are coming out. Again, they're rushing to the school to find their children and the children were escorted out by police and teachers to a secure area where anyone who is not injured and children were reunited with their parents. Some of the parents have told reporters -- it appeared the principal and others in the school may have been the target. Again, police are not confirming this information. The only word really what three hours into the shooting incident, so they're still trying to piece all this information together and, remember, sometimes the initial reports are wrong coming out of a chaotic scene like this. If you are asking what led to this, perhaps the principal and other administrators may have been the initial target of this. Unclear. That is from parents at the scene. That is not from law enforcement. Take that with a grain of salt as police prepare for a news conference. 
>> Our own chris jansing with new information. Chris, what's the latest that you have? 
>> We are being told that governor malloy is coming to the scene, so obviously as they do in suations like this, they are mobilizing counselors for the students that survived this tragedy. To melissa perry harris's point this year in two circumstances i was reminded about how much these things linger in communities. If you recall the shooting in february in charton, ohio, where three students at a high school were shot and killed. I was back there because that's near my hometown about a month later. There was a memorial in the town square there. People were still bringing flowers. There was a lot of emotion, and the sense of security that people have in that rural community had been shattered. In that situation the weeks that have passed have not changed that at all, but maybe even more vividly when I was in aurora, colorado, for the shooting there where 12 people were killed in the movie theater that's very columbine. Another story that I covered. It was amazing to me how many of the young people there grew up with those stories. How shaken they still were, obviously, about the closeness of what had happened. Some of them told me, you know, you have a sense, well, it happened at columbine, so it's almost like we're safe here, and how vivid the memories were for the people who had lived through columbine because we interviewed a number of those as well, so i think, alex, to the point that we often look at the numbers. We look at three people who are killed in chardon or 12 people killed in aurora, and there will be a number assigned to this shooting as well that the breadth of the bakt is so much broader than that, alex. S. 

[00:30:30]


>> A very good point when we talk about this being a moment of national tragedy. It's also a moment of national trauma many terms of how we recover from these things and what it does to a community. Certainly, I mean, when it -- i remember columbine specifically because I was close to that age and I remember thinking, you know, it's the self-identification thing, and certainly with a community where you never expect something like this to happen and it's laid at your doorstep in such a way, it's not just the children at that school, it's children at other schools in the area who not convince dentally are on lockdown. 
>> Right. That's the psychological impact. We talk about what children can process and then what that does to the order and the safety of the people generally taking for granted if you are in a relatively safe community. You know, I went to a school where we had a shooting of a student who shot two other students during school hours. I was about 15 years old. We never got over that. You saw kids getting shot. No one was actually murdered in that case. Both people who were shot lived. Having lived through that in my own personal experience, you don't get over. It's not something that simply because it moves forward and in many that case the justice process did move forward. The person who was a minor was caught and tried and served time and was ultimately let out. If you go back, that was garfield high school in seattle. You go back to that community we're talking over ten years later, everyone remembers it, and that's unfortunately what we see in this community is this is something everyone is going to live with for a long time. 
>> Jonathan, do you have an update for us? What are you hearing, jonathan? I know this is a fluid situation, and it's rapidly unfolding. 
>> Well, it could provide some calm for some of the parents of newtown because we just got this e-mail from the newtown public schools. It was forwarded to us from a parent I know in the town there. I'll just read it to you. The loukdown has been lifted for newtown public schools. Your children will be coming home on their normal bus run today. That e-mail just went out to parents in newtown who have children in the high schools, middle schools, the other schools in the area, so what that suggests is whatever situation has been going on there that police now believe they have it under control. Again, what we've been told is one gunman is dead at that elementary school with two weapons recovered, and we're still waiting for an accurate casualty count as to what went on inside that school, but if this e-mail from this parent in the newtown public schools suggests anything, it's that the police now confident that the situation is under control and that children in the school districts, they will be able to go home on the normal bus routes back to their families after the tragedy at that one elementary school. 

[00:33:11]


>> That is certainly some welcome news. We are also continuing to monitor news from our affiliate wvit in connecticut, and awaiting two news conferences one from the danbury hospital and another one from state police. We're back with more breaking NEWS COMING UP NEXT.0y0y3??o????????yPA ?? momts. When you lost the thing you can't believe you lost. When what you just bought, just broke. Or when you have a little trouble a long way from home... As an american express cardmember you can expect some help. But what you might not expect, is you can get all this with a prepaid card. Spends like cash. Feels like membership. 

[00:36:33]


>>> We are just getting new information in from nbc's pete williams. He reports that two officials, federal and state, say initial reports indicate many children at the school were shot. Perhaps at least 20. Chris jansing is standing by, but, first, let's go take a listen to the press conference happening now. 
>> We offer our heart felt sympathies to all those who have been affected by this tragic shooting. We have received three victims of that shooting. We are actively providing care and support to all those who have come here. The e.P.A. Is currently under lockdown, and the reason for that is really out of an abundance of caution. We want to be sure that we allow the e.D. Team to focus on the work at hand. There will be -- I'm told that there will be a press conference at 1:00 from the state police out in newtown, and to the extent that there is further information, we would offer them as a resource for additional details. I would like to have pat roderick and chairman of the emergency department speak to you briefly about this morning. 
>> Thank you. 
>> First of all, we would lik to send our prayers and thoughts to the family members of those that have been affected by the terrible tragedy at sandy hook elementary school. That's our primary concern for the family's well being. We did receive three patients in transport via em san francisco after this shooting. All of those patients have been evaluated and managed by our trauma service. We had received some prenotification, so we had our teams on stand-by and we're ready to care for those patients. In deference to the needs and the respect of the privacy of the family and those patients, i cannot disclose any patient-specific information at this time. Once we have gone through the proper discussions with the family, we will be able to give you further information through our state command center at the local command center in sandy hook. At this point many time as dr. Murphy mentioned, due to cautious and control of the environment, we have put the hospital emergency department on a lockdown status, so only those critical people that need to be in the department will be there. We continue to care for those patients in the emergency department unreemtd to this incident, so this is not affecting patient care or had an impact in any negative way. We have many staff members who live in the sandy hook area who have been impacted by this. We have set up crisis services that we have mobilized to the sandy hook firehouse to be of assistance, but we have been in communication with ems command center on the scene, commissioner of health, state medical examiner's office, so we have been in constant communication with those at the scene and have been lettingll the support that we can. At this point in time as i mentioned, out of respect for families and patients well, can't disclose any specific patient information, but that will be made available when available. 

[00:39:48]


>> Can you tell us generally, did you receive adults, children, the general -- are these injuries critical? I mean, what can you share with us? 
>> We received three patients as a result of the shooting. I can't give you any more specif information than that until we've had discussions with family, et cetera. 
>> Can you describe the situation in the emergency room as these people started to arrive? Obviously, you are prepared for emergencies for situations such as this -- 
>> as you might expect, we are prepared for any emergency that could happen. We have an abundance of staff available. We went into immediate lockdown. We cleared four of our trauma rooms to be able to take care and in communication with the prehospital care providers. We were ready and waiting. We had a team -- teams assembled in the room for when the patients arrived so they could get the maximum medical and surgical care that they needed. 
>> Can you tell us how many patients you've treated here? 
>> We have only treated three parents here that we have received in transport from the scene. 
>> Are you aware of there being other people shot? 
>> We don't anticipate that there will be any more patients transported to the hospital at this time. The state policee been managing the dissemination of information from the school there. We have received some additional information, but at this point in time I'm not in a position to disclose that. 
>> Do you have any information on the fact that more than two dozen people were shot and killed at the school? 
>> I can't verify that manufacturings. 
>> And that 14 were children? 
>> I cannot verify that information. I'm going to, again, refer you to the state police who have taken charge of the situation there given the gravity and the impact on that community. 
>> And as you said, they will be giving a press conference. We've been led to believe that they will be giving a press conference at 1:00 p.M. And will have the latest facts and figures and updates, and we would suggest that that be the resource for any further detailed information. 

[00:41:52]


>> Thank you very much, and i would just ask that you all pray for the families and the victims of this terrible tragedy. 
>> Why is it that you are on lockdown? 
>> Precautionary. 
>> Just to control the flow of people that are concerned about the well being of the staff and their family. Just to really protect the confidentiality of the patients, to allow the staff to do their work uninterrupted. Thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> You were listening to a live -- 
>> that was a news conference committee hospital in danbury, connecticut. We are just getting word from a white house official, president obama was notified about the shooting at 10:30 a.M. And he continues to receive updates. We're going to take a listen to jay carney at the press conference now. 
>> Information becomes available about this incident, and as the day proceeds, if we get more information and as we get more information, we'll certainly provide it to you. I do not have anything to confirm for you at this point. The fbi is supporting state law enforcement, which has the lead as well as local law enforcement as they respond to and begin to investigate this incident. As I said, the president will receive regular updates as the day progresses. Take your questions. 
>> One follow on that. Can you relay to us the president's reaction or thoughts? Obviously, the shootings are all of them are tragic. We're hearing some heinous numbers, and the fact that children were involved in this. 
>> I would rather not relay reactions at this point because I don't have any confirmation to give to you about what exactly has happened there or potential victims, so at this point i would rather just inform you that the president has been informed about the shooting, was informed at 10:30 and is being given regular updates as more information becomes available. 
>> Any thoughts on whether we'll hear from him today? 

[00:43:54]


>> You know, we'll just have to keep you updated as more information becomes available. 
>> Two other topics. In the abc news interview the president was asked about the legalization of marijuana in a couple of states where voters have sounded off on that and essentially said that -- 
>> that was white house press secretary jay carney giving the latest update from the white house on the shooting in newtown, connecticut. Chris jansinis standing by with more information. Chris. 
>> I think it's useful at this point, alex, thank you, to just update people on what we know because in these situations it is so chaotic, and there are so many conflicting reports out there. Let me tell you what nbc news has been able to confirm. There was this shooting this pmorning at sandy hook elementary. In newtown, connecticut, about a half hour outside new york city. The shooter has been killed. We know a number of other people were injured. We just heard the update from a hospital. That is a level three trauma center there. According to the folks at danbury hospital, they've received three patients. We don't know their conditions. State, local, and fbi all investigating this, all on the scene. The entire area schools had been on lockdown as well as the hospital just over an abundance of caution, but this obviously a disturbing new report that we are getting from pete williams based on conversations with both federal and state officials that as many as perhaps 20 children at that school have been shot, and we are just 15 minutes away from an update. We are expecting that news conference, alex, and they we may get more information, but we do know that there have been multiple injuries and that the shooter has been killed. Alex. 
>> Chris, thanks for the update. Jonathan, I have a list, a horrible list, of the deadliest u.S. School shootings. Columbine, of course, killed 12 students before the two shooters took their own lives. We're hearing reports now that up to 20 children may have been shot. It is hopefully -- we say this every single time we cover one of these things, a line in the sand. There has got to be a measurable xhank, some kind of reaction. One would hope that there will be some political capital to report in the way we handle gun and gun violence in this country. 

[00:46:07]


>> What's so traumatizing, beyond the trauma that we're already experiencing is the fact that we're talking about the possibility of multiple children dead. Not high school students. Want college students. Not pedestrians on the street. Grown adults. We're talking about children who went to school today, you know, starry-eyed, going to school with all the hope and joy that comes with that. Especially in this holiday season and to now learn that a gunman went into that school. Someone from the outside. I mean, just we don't know who this gunman is. We don't know if this gunman had a relationship or some kind of connection to that school, but thidea that someone came in from the outside into that same space and not just shot adults, but shot children, I think, if that doesn't sear the consciousness of political leaders from the president on down, I don't know what will. 
>> Also I think there will be as a patient he, you know,e keep coming back to the parent question. You know, it's one thing to send your high schooler off to school. There's an assumption that they are sort of able to act in a more independent fashion. For these children who are in third and fourth and fifth grade to be -- to, a, bear witness and to be victims of this. I mean, I think the parental outcry from a moment like this has to be almost deafening. 
>> I think we won't know what the outcry will be until we know more about the facts of the case. Undoubtedly, it is the great fear of any parent at any point -- from the very first day that you do that drop-off, that's part of what those tears are, right, is that sense that now this is an independent person walking around in the world, and you are not looking at them at every moment. What I would caution -- I think it's part of the lesson learned as parents and that we have to learn also as a country visa vi our children, is that we cannot make them safe at all times, and so we have to be careful about the reaction being let's build a moat and a wall and a metal detector around our whole world. We can change the structural realities that make them safer because there would be fewer available guns and less guns. I think what worries me is that in a moment like this we think draw the children to you, make them -- make your individual child as safe as possible, and -- 

[00:48:30]


>> which is a natural reaction. 
>> Certainly. Which is a completely natural reaction, but I think we have to -- it's part of our we can't lead exclusively with our heart. You must also lead with our heads as we start thinking about reasonable reactions to this. 
>> We are getting some new information from nbc news, pete williams and msnbc's richard lui. We will go to them live coming up next. ring...

We're more than 78,000 people looking out for more than 70 million Americans. That's health in numbers. UnitedHealthcare. Zimplt nbc news chief justice correspondent pete wmsz joins us now. What is the latest information that you have? 
>> Well, I think we have to be very cautious here and say this number is undoubtedly going to change as we go through the next few hours here as the authorities in connecticut finish going through the school, but this is appearing -- this looks like it's going to be the worst school shooting in recent u.S. History. We have been told that the number of shooting victims is around 20. That's children and adults. There are indication that is it's going to be higher than that. We just don't have a firm number at this point, but I think the point is that there are a number of children that were shot, a number that were apparently killed. This will be the worst school shooting here perhaps in u.S. History. 

[00:53:14]


>> Thanks for the update. Pete, I want to go now to a local reporter on the scene who has some updates for us. Liz, can you tell us what you have learned? This is obviously a fluid situation. If you could give us the latest. 
>> Good morning. I can tell you the latest now is that governor malloy has just arrived on scene and is getting briefed right now by emergency officials inside of the sandy hook fire department. He just walked a little bit closer up to the school, but this is the staging area that has been set up all morning. I want to walk you through what happened here around 9:30 this morning. The children were inside their classrooms for morning announcements when they heard those gunshots being fired. The teachers knew exactly what to do. They locked the doors, sent the children to the corners of the rooms. Once this scene was secure, they were all brought down here to the sandy hook fire department and this is where parents had been reuniting with their children all morning. We were one of the first crews here on the scene. It was chaotic. Parents running down to try to get to their kids as fast as they could, but, you know, trying to keep as much order as possible. Now, we're noticing that starting to thin out this scene, it might not look like it from this vantage point, but not a lot of children or parents here at this hour. Mostly just emergency officials. We see the fbi, state police, as well as local departments coming in and out of that fire department briefing the governor. We're expecting to learn a lot more about what led up to this shooting. The question parents want to know, how did this shooter get inside the school? Is he somehow connected to the school? Those are all things parents arementing to know here in newtown after this tragic school shooting. We are life this morning. I'll send things back to you guys. 
>> I want to bring in richard lui who has been looking into past school shootings in elementary school. Richld, the fact that there is a protocol as liz reported that the teachers know they need to sort of take certain steps is a testament to just how violate schools have become. 

[00:55:16]


>> My mother is a k through 4 teacher, and at her school they have protocols as well in san francisco, california. You had that list earlier of how many shootings at schools that happened in the past. I have it here as well, highlighted. Unfortunately, there are so many in recent years. If you just take out the elementary schools specifically and you look back in history, it's not too long ago, I'll take you to tacoma, washington, first, february 26, 2010, there at tacoma elementary school a teacher there was shot and killed on school grounds. No children were present at the school when that shooting took place. I'll take you back to a report february 29, 2000, in flint, michigan. There a 6-year-old boy brought a gun to buelle elementary school in mount morris township. He killed his first grade classmate kayla roland. That's in flint, michigan. I'll take you back to 1979. San diego, california. Fortunately, there, alex, brenda spentser, at the time, 16, pulled out a .22 caliber rifle from her family's house across the vietnam and said after she had shot se students, I just don't like mondays. This is really a tough and emotional story to watch when we listen to some of the children what they have to say here, alex. We think of these places as safe havens, and, unfortunately, today it was not. 
>> Nbc's -- nbc -- msnbc's richard lui. Chelg -- I don't know what the word is to describe this. Horrifying, chilling, a moment of national tragedy. You know, the culture -- we talk about violence. It's not something that is just happening in schools. It's not something that's just happening 234 movie theaters. We were talking during the break about violence that's happening in chicago. These are record numbers of shootings over the past two years. 
>> It's no doubt, and the words fail us. That's why we can't speak because speech is inarticulate in the face of ooel. This is evil. The trauma that has been rendered has been exacerbated by the fact that some people are highlighted and some people fall into a black hole where they are undiscovered, where no governor comes, where no president responds, where no school official speaks, where there is only hand-ringing and blame. There is cultural empathy generated around these kind of events, rightfully so, and others bear the cvlture of stigma. They are blamed for their own duress, blamed for their own stress, they are blamed for their own failures if a moral culpability on their part has led to the consequence of their being shot or murdered or mugged or attacked or assaulted. That is something, for which we have no words, and, yet, as melissa harris perry said, we want to build this moat and say we want to be -- have a response, a natural response to what appears to be a supernatural reality when we can do the stuff we can do. Stop the flow of guns. Stop the ready accessibility of guns and, guess what, black and brown communities deal with this trauma on an every day basis, and they have nobody to speak for them and nobody to defend their children, and it's another tragedy that has tobacco knowledged as well. 

[00:58:18]


>> We're talking about systemic failure, right? 
>> Across the board. 
>> Systemic failure in our society, and certainly it's not just days like today that we should be looking at this. This should be a part of the national discussion. We have to leave it there. I want to thank you for hanging with me through this. Andrea mitchell will have continuing coverage of the shooting in newtown, connecticut. Stay with us. 
>> And thanks very much. Right now on "andrea mitchell reports" a horrifying scene unfolding in connecticut at an elementary school. A shooting at a newtown school leaves multiple dead, including, we believe, the gunman. Here's how one child described what happened. Connecticut state police are still on the scene after leading children from sandy hook elementary school. Witnesses describe the scene saying it was horrific. Any moment from now we are expecting a live news conference from the connecticut state police. We'll bring it to you live as soon as it begins. As we continue here live in washington, I'm joined by pete williams and our nbc newsroom. Pete, you've been hearing from federal and local officials, state officials, that, in fact, there are numerous children. Pete's information that is that there are as many as 20 possibly 20 or more children who have been shot. With me here at the table is david gregory, host of "meet the press" and also susan paige, bureau chief with usa today. We are told that the gunman is

That's why I'm so excited to bring you a machine that's going to change your life the way it changed my life. This is the nutribullet, the world's first nutrition extractor. Not a blender, it's not a juicer. It's completely different from anything else out there. This machine is designed to break down the cell walls of your food, releasing, unleashing the nutrients inside, transforming ordinary fresh foods into superfoods. Now I'm gonna show you the difference between smoothies from a traditional blender and what we can create with mtribullet. Let me show you what I'm talking about. O.K., We're gonna put kale in for chlorophyll and fiber. We're gonna take some pineapple for the vitamin c and a little bit of flavor. We're gonna put in some cucumbers, great for hydration, great for the kidneys, put in some cashews for the creaminess and the protein. And of course we're gonna add some flax seeds in to get the omega-3 fatty acids. And then we're gonna add spring water. Let's get the lid on there. Put on the extractor blades onto our nutribullet. Are you ready? 

[00:03:44]


>> Audience: Ready! 
>> Look, this blender is just mixing stuff around-- it's not breaking anything down. But the nutribullet with its 600 watts of compact power and bullet-exclusive cyclonic action combined with the specially designed extractor blades turning at an amazing 10,000 R.P.M.s PULVERIZING THE CELL Walls, unlocking all that hidden nutrition so your body can actually absorb it and use it. Now, I've got a strainer here, we're gonna pour our blended smoothie through and see what is left over. What's gonna make it through? We've got unbroken flax seeds, lots of fiber... Here, let me show you this. This, ladies and gentlemen, is what we call a smoothie. 
[Audience exclaims] now let's see what happened with the nutribullet. I take off the extractor blades, looks like we've got quite a beverage in here. Let's bring it out and pour it through the strainer. It's completely liquefied. All that nutrition has been turned inside out. Everything's been completely broken down. And when we pour it, we can see just how glowing it is, beautiful. The real test is always the flavor. Let's give it a try. That, ladies and gentlemen, is what I call a nutriblast. We've taken all of those cells, pulverized them, flipped them inside out, got all of that juice, all the nutrients-- the vitamins, the minerals, the enzymes, tssential fatty acids, the protein-- and now we can actually assimilate and utilize those nutrs. We've turned this into a superfood. Listen, juicers makes juice and blenders make smoothies, but the nutribullet makes nutrient-packed nutriblasts. All I'm asking you to do is have one nutriblast a day and that will transform your life. 

[00:06:12]


>> About five years ago the doctor told me after taking my cholesterol numbers that I was gonna have to be on cholesterol medication and most likely for the rest of my life. We tried to address it with diet, we tried to address it with exercise and neither of them seemed to work. There is a history of heart disease in my family. There's a history of high cholesterol in my family, so I felt this was the natural progression of things and it was out of my control, that there was nothing that i could do, until I went onto this nutribullet system, and that's when things really started to change dramatically. When I make my nutriblasts incorporating the nutribullet, it emulsifies fruits and vegetables so well that I feel them go right into my system, I feel those ingredients immediately, and I started to see results actually within three or four days. Six weeks ago when I started this program, I weighed 182 pounds, and after six weeks on the nutribullet program, I believe I weighed in at 160. So this weight loss over six weeks is just a byproduct. The reason that I involved myself in the nutribullet program was for cholesterol purposes, to reduce my cholesterol, to regain control of my life and to get rid of the acid reflux. My sing cholesterol was 263 and now I'm at 208 and within a normal range. And my triglycerides are almost cut in half. Look at my results over six weeks. If I can enjoy these results, I have to think that everybody can. >>N we think of hormone imbalance, we think that's only something that happens to older people... And that's nonsense. This can affect any of us at any age-- in our teens, IN OUR 20s, IN OUR 70s-- And hormone imbalance leads to mood swings, infertility, acne, fatigue, low sex drive, and those things can affect any of us. The emphasis here is on hormones. And both men and women are affected by this. We're not built the same, so the approach has to be a little bit different, so what we've done here is we've created a nutriblast for tuys and a nutriblast for the gals. 

[00:08:16]


>> Great. >> Wonderful. 
>> There are so many amazing hormone-building foods. Foods like beets, grapes, blueberries, pumpkin seeds, broccoli to support the prostate, olive oil, which helps keep good hormones from becoming bad hormones. We need good hormones to keep us young. We've got to put in spring water. Let's put on the extractor blades. We're set. Over here we have a female nutriblast, and this contains some key different ingredients. We've put in arugula, sometimes called rocket, we've added rasprries for their volatile oils, which help to support female reproductive health, we've added avocado and goji berries, one of the best antioxidants on the planet. Are we ready to blast off? 
>> Audience: We're ready. 
>> Look at the power! Look at the bullet-exclusive cyclonic action. The nutribullet is pulverizing these ingredients. All right... Let's see what we got. 
>> Woman: Mmm, love the colors. 
>> Remove the extractor blades. Here it is, coming down the counter. For the ladies, let's give that a try. >> Yeah. 
>> If you have a nutriblast every day, you're gonna look better, you're gonna feel better, you canlive longer and you willlove longer. 
>> My hot flashes started when I was 35 years old, and through the years they have just progressively gotten worse, where there's times in the middle of the night you just feel like you're being microwaved. But after doing some nutriblasts for the first week, I slept better, I felt more rested, I didn't have a hot flash. I am thrilled to death by the change in my health and how I feel. It's the combination of the fruits, the vegetables and all the vitamins that are all being emulsified together... It works. 

[00:10:39]


>> The anti-depressants, the sleeping pills and the blood pressure medication did help in the beginning. But as in long-term, it wasn't helping. Well, within a week of drinking nutriblast I saw incredible changes. Right now I'm sleeping a solid eight hours, I am no longer taking my sleeping pills, and nutribullet has everything to do with that. 
>> I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. It's extremely painful. You're in pain a lot of the time. When I started using the nutribullet, I was pleasantly surprised because the first night that I actually used the nutribullet, I actually slept really well. That was exciting. That was phenomenal. It's almost unbelievable, quite frankly, that just by using the nutribullet and just properly nourishing your body that I got immediate results and a result that I was looking for. If I had to pick one kitchen appliance that I absolutely had to have, it would be the nutribullet. It is the only appliance out there that can give me exactly what my body needs in order to feel good, um, have the health and proper nutrition that is so important in order for us to be able to just live life. 
[Emotionally] if the people were here that made the nutribullet, what I would say to them is thank you for giving me my life back, thank you for allowing me to enjoy my family more... Thanks for taking away the pain. Where have you been all my life? [Laughs] 
>> we all know how important the immune system is. It is the key. Your immune system determines what belongs and what doesn't. When it finds something bad, it releases white blood cells, and white blood cells detoxify our body. They also help us fight illness, pain, even disease. Our ability to create and release white blood cells is affected by a lot of things. It's affected by a lack of sleep, stress, it's especially affected by a lack of nutrition. If we can increase our absorption from our food and nourish our immune system directly, then our bodies can handle practically anything. The nutribullet is designed to help us do just that. 

[00:12:56]


>> For the past two years, I haven't been very healthy. Unfortunately I was diagnosed with cancer. So, for the past two years, I haven't been very healthy and I've been feeling overall pretty crummy. Lost every ounce of my hair-- I lost every hair on my head and then I just covered my head up with wigs, but, you know, at the end of the day when you're taking your wig off and you have to see the result of the chemotherapy, it's really hard, you know, on your psyche. I was amazed at how quickly I saw results from the nutribullet. I was so excited, because to feel it after the second nutriblast was a miracle to me. I was so excited. One of the best things about the nutribullet is that it's not a blender. It's something that pulverizes everything that you put in it and you're extracting the nutrients out of these whole foods, so you're getting the maximum benefit by everything that you're putting in there. And probably about three weeks into the program, my hair just went through this growth spurt, and people were asking me, you know, what happened, because I didn't have a whole lot of hair before I started. I was just telling somebody, I started this year off fighting for my life... I'm ending the year feeling better than I've felt in years. Totally given me hope, you know, and I didn't have that and I just feel wonderful... 
[Emotionally] and I am so grateful for everything you've done-- thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart. You guys are awesome and I hope that this can help other people. 
>> One of the greatest keys to bolstering your immune system is hidden inside the foods that we buy every day. What we have to do is unlock those valuable nutrients so that we can actually absorb them. This can help change your life. In fact, it could actually help save your life. 
>> Announcer: Over the last 30 years, we have become the most overfed yet undernourished nation on the planet, leading to a modern-day epidemic of obesity, high blood pressure, stress, depression and more. We're not getting healthier, we're getting sicker, and it comes down to one simple need: Nutrient absorption. We need to increase the nutritional power of the foods we eat every day to dramatically change the way we look and feel... And the great news is now we can! From the makers of the original magic bullet, introducing the nutribullet, the superfood nutrition extractor. With the nutribullet, you can turn ordinary food into superfood that now absorbs easily into your body's system so you can live a longer, healthier, more active life. All this food is loaded with essential nutrition, and the only way to get all of it is to break down, pulverize and open up the food's hidden nutrition on a cellular level. This process is called nutrition extraction. 

[00:15:40]


Look: Even expensive blenders just mix things around, they don't break things down, and with juicing, most of the valuable nutrition and fiber is just thrown away. But the nutribullet is different-- watch. Start with some spinach for fiber, banana for potassium, add some berries for essential antioxidants, then almonds and flax seeds for omega-3 oils, add a little water, and watch how the power of the nutribullet completely breaks everything down, extracting all the essential nutrition. Look, even the almonds and flax seeds have been broken down to fit through this strainer, unlike traditional blenders that leave everything behind. The secret of the nutribullet is its powerful 600-watt motor, combined with bullet-exclusive cyclonic action that forces everything through the turbo extractor blades turning at an incredible 10,000 r.P.M. To break down and pulverize the stems, seeds, and skins, where most of the essential nutrition lies, taking ordinary fresh foods and turning them into superfoods to give you the strength, energy and vitality for a full active life, whatever your age. Juicers make juice, blenders make smoothies, but the nutribullet makes supercharged, superfood nutriblasts, and by drinking just one nutriblast a day, you can supercharge your body, lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and superboost your energy levels to feel better than you have in years, without taking prescription pills, without any side effects. Just one a day can change your life. We've all bought expensive blenders and juicers and we all know the problem: They're just too much trouble to put together, and clean them once and you'll never want to clean them again, but the nutribullet takes seconds to use and seconds to clean. 
Watch: Just load your ingredients into the cup, twist on the extractor blade, pop it onto the power base, and watch how the nutribullet blasts ordinary foods into superfoods in an instant, then just separate, throw in the dishwasher or give it a quick rinse and you're ready to go again in seconds. How easy is that? And with nearly twice the power of these other machines, the nutribullet is less than half the size. There's no other machine like it. The nutribullet comes with a supersized 24-ounce pitcher, with the same size and capacity of this full-size blender, to make supercharged nutriblasts the whole family can share to kick-start their day. It also comes with two single-serve 18-ounce mugs, so everyone gets to enjoy their own personal favorite nutriblasts. Just twist on the customized handled lip ring and your nutriblast is ready to go when you are.

[??????...] 
>> inflammation in our joints and in our bodies has become a huge problem. Anyone who suffers from arthritis or joint pain knows exactly what I'm talking about. I bet most of you believe that once that pain starts, it just gets worse and worse, right? 
>> Audience: Right. 
>> Wrong. There are foods that contain hidden nutrients that can give your body the tools it needs to help fight the effects of arthritis and joint pain. This nutriblast contains the vitamin c brothers-- lemon and lime-- the anti-inflammatory enzyme bromelain, found in grapefruit and pineapple, apples with their malic acid, which cuts right into arthritis, the anti-inflammatory omega-3 inside the flax seeds, and my personal favorite, turmeric. Turmeric is probably the most powerful anti-inflammatory food you can find in your local grocery store. You ready to try this? 
>> Woman: Yes. 
>> You just make and you drink. So easy. So let's give it a try. 
>> Woman: O.K. 
>> Wow, that's powerful. I don't know if you guys know this, but both my parents are medical doctors. My mom told me that health is our greatest asset. 
>> Woman: Absolutely. 
>> So, let's toast to the best health ever-- cheers. 
>> Bravo. >> Cheers. 
>> I've had migraines most of my life where, um, there's times where just keeping my eyes open is, is very painful. Um, basically, being put in a dark room, laying in a bed with your eyes closed would be the only relief I would get from a migraine. Once a week I would suffer from a migraine. Since incorporating the nutriblast I haven't had one headache, not one migraine. The nutribullet is different because it extracts all the nutrients from the fruits and vegetables and nuts, and I think everybody should do it because you just feel great. I've never felt this good in my life, never. Never. 

[00:23:10]


>> Ladies and gentlemen, we all know that what we eat is important, but how we eat it may even be more important. If you're eating healthy, good-for-you salads, you might only be absorbing a fraction of the available nutrition. By making the amazing nutrition contained at the cellular level of these foods available to you, you'll absorb them, and then you'll feel a huge difference in how you look and you'll feel a huge difference in your day-to-day energy. You can take everyday, ordinary foods and turn them into superfoods in literally seconds with the nutribullet. All I'm asking you to do is have just one nutriblast a day and I promise you it can change your life. Thanks so much for being here. Have the best day ever. Cheers! All right!

=======================================================

>> Our thought prayers are with the town and obviously with the family. Stay tuned with the continuous coverage. Greta is next. 
>> This is it a fox news alert. New information about the absolute unthinkable. Murder of 27 people. 20 of them mere children so small they did not come up to our waist. The indescribable horror began hoursgo when unsuspected parents dropped their kindergarten age and fourth age off to school. Parents couldn't have anticipate what was about to happen. A killer walks in the sandy hook elementary school and starts shooting. We are learning new information tonight and we'll have it throughout the hour. We'll start with rick who is with the latest. Who is the killer. 
>> We know his name adam lanza and lived in newtown, connecticut with his mother nancy who was shot dead in her bed in her home that shared with the shooter. He took her car and at least three weapons and maybe more. Glock and hour and m-4 assault rifle ask went to the school where his mother worked as a substitute teacher and got through security and went to two room one area of the school and beg to shoot children and adultings. He shot 20 kids. 18 died at the scene and two in the hospital died. He shot six adults including the principal and took his own life has police got to the school. 
>> Is there any report on what high was saying or anything peculliar about him. 
>> A six year old boy said the shooter came in and shot the teacher and the boy ran out and that shooter didn't say a sandwich word. We heard from the shooter's brother that he was learning disabled and may have been autistic. 

[00:02:16]


>> And the mother was supposed to teach today? 
>> We don't know that either. We know that the young man woke up this morning at home and shot his mother in the home and tock her car and guns and school where she worked and began the rampage. Nthis is unthinkable. The idea of walking in the class rom and just shooting children . 
>> Little kids. Five or six year old kids defenseless and innocent and it makes no sense at all. 
>> And a principal and other adults. 
>> Apparently there were morning announcements going on when the shootings began and they heard screams over the pa system in order to hearing the gun fire ringing through the hallways and they were fired in an area where the morning announcements were being mad. Children, 20 of them murder where they should be safe. Ray, your thoughts tonight. 
>> You are talkug to me, and i don't know, 12 or 13 hours after this I am so numb and i am crying and emotional for most of the day. And speaking with work associates that worked with me at the school and family and friends that have been calling and at this point, I am numb. 
>> Ray, you never saw the shooter before or hear anything about him in the community? 
>> No, no. Absolutely not. I leftlet school and we generally worked to nine or 9:30 and then leave. The students come to class and that's when we turn them over to the regular teacher and five minutes maybe, that when we left this occurred . It is so unthinkable ray that this could happen. I can't imagine what your is going through tonight. Where do you begin to put the school back together and heal these families? 

[00:04:39]


>> You know, you tell me, please. It is so unbelievable. We are all looking at each other. I just came from thil at -- vigil at the church and there were hundreds and hundreds of people there. And they were -- we couldn't believe that why are going to have -- this is the second greatest mass cure in the history of the united states . Ray, thank you. 
>> And tonight members of the grief striken community gathering for a memorial service. Molly is outside of the church where the service was held. Molly, we are at one of the church necessary the community that held a vigil. A number of churches and places around town allowed pime to gather and refleck on what happened. This community just coming to grips with the grief. I poke with the mon singor and he spept the day with partners that lost their children. He said they are holding up as well as can be expected and sharing the joyful memories that they had with their which were and in the time of advent and people going to church and preparing for so much joy and birth of christ and celebrating christmas, how did people cope with the fact that it is it christmas time. He said there are 20 brighter stars in hen than the light necessary newtown. This community lost 20 children gone and people just beginning to cope and coming together. I respondent timen main street. It is it a pop and mom shop. And a woman who cuts children's hair in town and she was waiting to see how many of the kids she knows were among the injured or dead. We also spent time in the community in the neighborhood where the shooter's mother lived nancy lanza home where she was murdered and shot before her son adam took her family car ask headed for the school. And beautiful big homes and adorable neighborhood filled with christmas lights and it looked like any other joy-filled neighborhood at this time in the holidays, but instead marked off with yellow crime tape and we could barely see where the home was and to where the swat teems and authorities that had been there earliering and spent their time earlier in the day. We were there at three o'clock in the afternoon wn wat teem members and investigator it is 

[00:07:36]


- investigators started to clear out and earlier in the day they finally found out where to go to begin to look for clues and why adam lanza would have participating in this. And how it could have occurred and they were looking for clues and possible danger. And they still have pime they are keeping eyes on those things and devastated neighbors and confused neighbors in the community and state your namely not used to something like this occurring in a neighborhood like newtown. This is it a place where people move iperally for the adorable throw back community and for that essence of what everyone wants their children to experience. Small-town feeling and where hundreds and hundreds of people will show up at a community church to grieve and work and join together to repair . Gret a. >> Molly,nk you. Stretching all the way from connecticut to new jersey. The killer's brother was taken in for question or volunteered. And he was volunteered to talk to police and that is where they are standing by live. 
>> What can you tell me about the brother and the questioning? 
>> We are standing in front of his home. 24 year old ryan lanza, brother of the alleged shooter and I can tell you less than an hour ago, police rolled up their tape that was block the entrance of the building. We hear from a reliable federal source that when police were surrounding the area earlier this afternoon. Ryan and his girl friend showed up and that's when they realized everything that was going on. And he was hand cuffed and taken away and we are hear aring from the fbi that hoe and his father were released and they were cooperative throughout all of this. And we are hearing from residents here that are rattled by all of this. They say the bomb squad was running through the hallways today. And a day care in the area was on lock down and parents were getting e-mails saying don't worry about your kids that is it whats going o. Greta, they are happy that things are calming down and thankful that their kids are all right. 

[00:10:02]


>> You know anything about the relationship between the ther and the shooter or the brother and the shooter or everything the father and mother who was shot today? 
>> We have heard a lot of reports and nothing that we confirmed. We have calls in to the families, but you can imagine they are saying they need time and not taking our calls at the, but it appears that some of the relationships have been spotty and the father, and mother are divorced. The father peter lanza since remarried and lives in connecticut and he and the son ryan are on the way to connecticut. Although ryan is not a suspect, are telling usy are going through his computer and records just to see if that can give them clues about anything and maybe a motive. 
>> Thank you . Police familiar us it will take dicelet gruesome crume - crime scene. Children slaughtered inside of the elementary school. We spoke with paul vance. 
>> Thank you very having us. 
>> Lieutenant, we have seen so many going back to columbine and you never think it is going to happen in your own community. 
>> It is it horrific and tragic and the parents sent these children to be educate never expected to never see them again it is it a heartbreaking trag tee. 
>> And you think that right now. You haven't identified all of the bodies for the families have you? 
>> We have a process where we have to positively identify everyone and we want to do that as expeditiously as possible working on thisthat right now it is important for the families and why understand that. 

[00:12:04]


>> Imagine you haven't got official world and your child is not home and so you know that your child was one of the victims. Imagine that pain? 
>> It is it unbelievable. It is something that no one want to bear and it was heartbreaking to have to hear the partners told that their children were not coming home. It was heart breaking for the law enforcement officers to go in and rescue as many people and atfers and encountered what they discovered in the last two classrooms. 
>> Wasletuation where he kill would an entire class in >> it was not like that and it isine difficult to talk about. Suffice to say there were deceased in two classrooms and hallway and a horrific scene. Was he to law enforcement? 
>> We are looking at that. We have a state police command situation and brought in major crime detectives and newtown police detectives working with us and we'll answer that question and we'll do an extensive background and answer the question about the history and historical evens that this young man may have been involved n. And we'll leave no stone unturned. 
>> Did the school know him or mother complain or worried about him? 
>> There was nothing that showed that something like this could occur . Our investigators will look at all of that and certainly look at the administration of the school and friends and family and relatives. And this isendless and we'll do everything we have to answer the questions. 
>> I don't understand and clear it up for me a I read or heard that the mother was found dead at her home and also a teacher. Was she not teaching or call in sick. Why was she not at sick? 

[00:14:06]


>> We haven't identified officially anyone yet. I can tell you, we have a secondary scene with a deceased feplail who we tentatively identified . Those are questions we have and will have to answer. Ncan you tell me whether there was a substitute teacher in the class rom. 
>> I don't know. I am sorry I don't know. 
>> Medical examiners in with the ch and adultings. 
>> Medical examiners are there with the teem in place. And they are going to work throughout the night and do whatever they need to do to identify the children for the families. 
>> Every time I recover the story, law enforcement and ther all partner they go into these scenes and it is just unthinkable and unpeekable. They all have kids the age o these children much. 
>> It is it a very scene for th. The law enforcement officers who interested the building we have provided them with counseling and we did the same for the family that brought in clergy . It is it hard for law enforce ms personnel and certainly nothing like what the partners are going through. 
>> No parent wants to send his child to school with a prison and lots of metal detectors, but I am curious, was the security not that I am condemning if it hasn't. You it goes both ways. 
>> Suffice to say the school was very secure. And why will certainly determine exactly how the shooter was able to gain access . 
>> Secure in a sense if i tried to get in somebody would stop me and somebody will let me in. >>Hat's correct. You couldn't have gotten in. 
>> Good luck and if is tough on you and especially the families of the dead. Thank you, sir . Our live courage continues in a minute. We will have more on the long investigation atoday and on the record much more alive from newtown, stay with us. I just knew we had to get in there and it is it going to be okay and you are going to be all right I pull would a book shelf and we were barricaded and did you tell them to be quiet. Ndid you worry about that. 

[00:16:39]


>> I told them to be absolutely quiet. Because I was so afraid he would come in and hear us and start shooting the dor. We have to be absolutely quiet. And we have. There are bad goys out there now. And we need to wait for the good guys. I just wanted us to be okay. And I am so saddened thrathere are pime in the situation that are not okay.

[00:20:58]


>> we are back live in newtown, connecticut. The pretty new england town now the scene of one of the deadliest school shootings in history. Adam lanza is the killer, first reports identified his brother ryan lanza as the killer. How did that happen. Clar moses joins us. How did it happen that there was confusion and you spoke to frens of ryan, have you not? 
>> I did speak to friends of ryan. There was a lot of confusion and the internet start tod publish ryan pictures and they called him the killer. At that very moment I talked to some of his friends by text and phone and they told me, i poke to three of his friends and they had spoken to him briefly on book book chat or by phone and he was in fact at work and not the killer . It was physically impossible for him to be in newtown while he was at work and talking on the phone to his friends. 
>> But you know. 
>> Yes? 
>> Do you know if his friends, did any of ryan's friend ever met adam? 
>> Not the ones that I spoke to. They knew he had a brother and that is about the extent of their knowledge. They had brief conversations with him today as you can imagine it was a crazy day for him so they just had a few minutes and they knew he had a brother but none of them seemed to know adam. 
>> Did they know anything about adam, did ryan ever peek about adam or describe unusual or not unusual or a relationship with him or anything? 
>> There is very little knowledge about that. One of his friends did tell me in fact, he had a brother and that he might have been a little challenged, and developmentally challenged but that is all of the information. Other information is very sparse. His friends didn't seem to know his family or at least they didn't mention that today. You don't have any more information. 

[00:23:24]


>> I am sorry one more time greta? Nbeyond mentally challenged you don't know anything more about adam? Nnot about adam, not about adam. We heard earlier today that adam could have had ryan's identification on him. Ryan told one of his friends that the confusion arose that way and it was probably adam rather than himself. But other than that there was little information about adam here in hoboken. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Coming up. It took only minutes for the killer to gun down 20 children and 6 adults.

[00:27:51]


>> Unthinkable tragedy unfolded. Breaking news to tell you right now. There are reports of a school shoot nothing newtown, connecticut. This is it in the sandy hook elementary school. 
>> State police responded to the report of the a shooting in sandy hook elementary school. Which we now understand is kindergarten through fourth grade. 
>> This is reported. Ape dispatcher said that one teacher has been transported to a nearby hospital in danbury with a gunshot wound. 
>> Ahead of him it is difficult to see the wat them that was responding. Those vehicles raced from newtown from all over the state of connecticut. 
>> We heard numerous reports that one gunman maybe two. And two reports said that one gunman may be dead . It is a fast-move fluid situation in the school . 
>> I think it is it important on a day like todayo view this as I know the president, as a father does and I the father and others who partners certain lie do, which -- other parents certainly do. Feeling enormous sympathy for the families that are affected. And do everything we can. >>S are telling fox nuse that 26 people are dead at this time and eight adults including the shooter and 18 children . 
>> Is a gun shot and so they are trying to figure out what happened . We tell them what happened in the deat as and it makes it much worse. 
>> The shooter may a young man 20 years old and he may live in new jersey and there may have been a separate situation there, a crime scene where they kicked down the door of that person's home. We are trying to confirm that. We don't know the identity of the gunman . 

[00:30:07]


>> There were fatailities at the scene and both student and staff. There is no information relative to that and released at that time and we make a complete and proper notification. 
>> It is sheer terror and a sense of immediate urgency and you know to get to your child and to be there to protect them. 
>> The president will make remarks about the shooting today. We'll take a listen. 
>> This afternoon, I spoke with governor maloy and fbi director mueller. I offered our condolences on behalf of the nation and made it clear he will have every single resource he needs to investigate the heinous crime and care for the victims and counsel their families. 
>> There were fatalities. 18 children pronounced dead at the school. Two transported to area helps and pronounced dead at area hospitals and six adults pronounced dead at the scene of the school. 
>> This happened over six hours ago there is it a lot of evidence being processed and the crime scene is active and other scenes are now being investigated including apparently the home of the shooter's mother in newtown where an adult body was found and other residence in new jersey. There are conflicting reports of the status of the shooter's father and conflicting reportos the shooter himself. 
>> The majority that died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5-10 years old . They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays and graduations and weddings, kids of their own . Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill the dreams. So our hearts are broken today, for the partners and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults that were lost. 

[00:32:41]


>> The sheer terror and young children and partners and teachers all witnessing the tragedy and violence. Nit doesn't seem real. It doesn't seem possible. 
>> It is no words. It is it sheer terror and a sense of immediate urgeency. And you know to get to your child and to be there to protect them. Ni have an emergency phone call that there was a shooting and they say where and the schools are on lock down and immediately after that I got a test from ap that there was a shooting in the school sandy hook. And so I left and went to the school. There were hiserical moms they knew and I said what is going on. She said the principal is dead and the children came out with blood. 
>> We are coping and trying to find out what is going on. It is it nerve racking. We have more cars pulling in. And how many injured. 
>> She was in a small reading group, and they started to hearing I guess bangs. And her teacher which I am so grateful for. It was a small group. They rushed the kids into the bathroom and they locked the door and they just told the children it was hammering and tried to keep them calm. And the next thing I know, because it is hard to get the complete story, the next thing I know is that the police came and they were knocking on the door to be let out. When they were she saw glass and blood and one child covered in blood but i understand that child is safe . 

[00:34:43]


>> She was talking about how the while she was walking down the hallway, the police told them to close their eyes. Obviously it was a sensitive scene and she said she heard gun shots and actually what she told me was in the beginning, the intercom came on and she heard a scream on the intercom and it went immediately off. I am not sure at the specifics of the lock down. 
>> Nothing makes sense like this. No it doesn't. Our hearts are with everybody. Every parent and mother and father and grand father and mother and sister and brother for all of the children. 
>> She seemed to be doing okay. But a couple of friends we haven't gotten in touch with. We hope that everything is okay with them. Ncoming up more live coverage from newtown, connecticut and why the plice are in the school. Detective mark fur man is here, next. ?????? ??????

>> Tonight the investigation in the connecticut mass shooting is only beginning. The homicide detective mark furman joins us. 
>> Good evening. 
>> Mark, you and I go back a long time talking about all of these cases. This one tonight, right now as we talk. The medical examiner inside of that classroom, and bodies still in the classroom and trying to determine ideptity. I can only imagine how difficult it is for the police and medical examiner and families and everything. This has to be done, doesn't it? 
>> It does have to be done, greta and unfortunately, I can imagine what it looks like and you try to put that out of your mind. The medical examiner and forensic personnel have to blue pript the room where each and every person is. All evidence has to be photographed before it is disturbed and you have to number and the positions of each body. Each body has to be processed and examined by the coroner and forensically and documented and evidence collected and then, and only then can you remove each body one at a time. 

[00:41:20]


>> You know, I think of the families tonight. They haven't got know official word their child is dead or a loved one or wife or mother. But if you are sitting at home and you are expecting your child to be home or expected your wife or mother or father to be home and that person hasn't shown up. You obviously know that you are -- your family member was a victim and a lot of people are thinking why in the world going on. We know who the shooter is. He shot himself in the head and there is it a risk of a co-defendant or someone who helped him and you will have to put a case together; is that why they do this? 
>> You have to document it, because it is what you need to do to really create a history of the instent. For legal purposes and certainly there could be civil actions if there is not criminal. You have to remember that this suspect was described as someone who might have mental problems and incapacity as far as his mental state he could have been formulated by someone else and guided and provided with information and a conspiracy, you know. It is really what I am talking about and somebody could have put him up and gave him information and completed the conspiracy. And then you would need to prosecute that individual. So it needs to be done because this early in the investigation, you county don't know -- what you have except for the victims. 
>> We are getting a little bit of an idea who he was. And the new york times and reporting about how socially acward he high school. And few freppeds and he didn't center a book book -- face book page we are getting a glimpse of him tonight . But the detectives. They have to dig deeper, are they not? 

[00:43:27]


>> They are going to dig deeper for weeks and maybe longer than that. They will do an autopsy on his mind and his life as well as his body. They are going to figure out who he was talking to and what high was saying and talk to friends and family and anybody on the computer and web sites and anything he put out or wrote. Anything that he threatened. They are going to find out just exactly how many flags there were and that is really only way to go back wards and try to prevent an incident is to control the individual with the idea and motivation to do as heinous as this. Ndo you ever get used to the investigation . 20 children. They are like five or 10 years old. It seems like the worst of the worst. And as a detective, do you ever, can you do this? And how do you go through thyself things? 
>> Well, you know, there is no way that anybody can prepare themselves for a child's homicide. Just in the singular sense. This, the amount of recommend're victims and their age is beyond overwhelming. And I am sure that you know, detectives and forensic personnel. They have to detach themselves for that period of time to do their job. This is it a horrific scene and a horrific crime that no one will get over and no one seeing the scene will be quite the same. 
>> Mark, thank you for joining us tonight. 
>> Straight ahead, you will hear the chilling radio calls as police learned about the mass shooting, that's next. >>. >> gonna this. The red cross was down here all the time.

=======================================================

- Ha. Ha,meaning, "the breath of life." Waiis the water. The irefers to the supreme creator. Ha-wai-i:Hawai'i. 
- Hawai'i is love. 
- Hawai'i--it's a place that wreated in such perfection. 
- Hawai'i is the most beautiful place in the world. 
[upbeat music] 
[people singing in Hawai'ian] ?????? ?????? male announcer: Major funding for over hawai'i is made possible by alaska airlines. Alaska airlines offers nonstop service to four hawai'ian islands from most major west coast cities. More information at alaskaair.Com. Alaska airlines: North of expected. And by the alaska airlines visa signature card. The alaska airlines visa signature card offers alaska airlines mileage plan miles on purchases, which can be used to travel to more than 700 destinations worldwide, including hawai'i. Information at myalaskavisa.Com. female announcer: Additional support from four seasons maui at wailea, a resort offering restaurant options including ferraro's, spago, and duo, spa retreats, kids' programs, and access to three ocean-side golf courses. Information at fourseasons.Com/maui. 
male announcer: AND BY Blue hawaiian helicopters, celebrating a quarter-century of service to hawai'i. 
- Hawai'i is the most isolated land mass in the world, 2,000 miles away from north and south america. Kaua'i is the oldest island at 6 million years old, roughly. And then as you come down the chain, you have--o'ahu's 2 to 3 million years old, and maui's 1 to 2 million years old. And then we're the youngest-- the big island, or hawai'i island. We're just 800,000 years old. So this island's still erupting, amazingly enough. The process continues here. We're in the middle of the pacific plate, and the plate is surfing over what we call a hot spot, about two to three inches per year. So as the plate moves northwest, the hotspot stays where it is, and the islands emerge. The core of the earth is molten rock. Around the core is a mantle, and the mantle has cracks and the cracks in the mantle create a heat plume, which creawhat we call a magma chamber. Then you have the crust, where the plume comes through, to create what we call the hot spot theory. It's a theory, but it's what we believe and what creates this molten liquid rock. 

[00:03:40]


[haunting flute music] ?????? ?????? kilauea, culturally, is a significant place for hawai'ians, and for other folks, as a place that's revered, where pelehonuamea lives-- or pele-- the goddess of volcanoes. So to soolks, she lives here at the summit of the volcano, and to some other folks, she lives up here in the crater of halemaumau. Pele could be wherever it's erupting. So it could be out on the east rift zone when it's going to the ocean. It could be up on mauna loa if it's erupting up there, or it could be right here. And to other folks, they say everything here is pele: The rocks, the trees, and the birds. We're looking at a hawai'ian nose flute called ohe hano ihu. Oheis "bamboo." Hanois "to blow with intent," and ihuis "with your nose." And so you guys have all heard the term aloha, and hawai'ians greet each other with aloha, and alobeing your face or body, and habeing your breath of life. And for hawai'ians, it was revered that your direct connection to your spirit or your soul is through your breath of life. ?????? ?????? 
- everything here was from the world's largest, gentlest, hottest volcanoes relentlessly pushing up material and oozing and building one layer after another until an island forms, and then the clouds and the rains changes it. 

[00:06:01]


- There's this wind that blows. There's a cloud that brings fresh water. That is life. 
- You had this ku and hina, which are our deities. You know, you have this hardness, and then you have this enlightness, like the rains. And that's pretty much what's carved our valleys. The hard lava came down the flows. It hardened the ground. Then the rains came and started to gouge its way from the ocean to the mountains, and that's how you got your gulches and your streams. 
- Hawai'i is the most beautiful place on earth. We have everything here. It's a place that was created in such perfection. One of the stories that we believe is the creation story of papa and wakea. So papa is the earth mother, and wakea is our sky father. And the two mate. And in this mating is how the islands are formed. 

[00:08:33]


- Looking out over what mother nature made really puts in perspective who you are and that you're a small puzzle piece in the whole scheme of things. 
- The hawai'ian island chain one of the most isolated island chains in the world. In order to get here, many of these species had to travel a long way, and those that remain are some of the strong that have survived throughout. The variety of marine life that we have here in hawai'i is so special. And in fact, about 25% of the species here in hawai'i alone are endemic, meaning they're found nowhere else on the planet. ?????? ??????

- what you see is it. All this beauty is here because the people who have come here over time-- the ha,the breath of life. 
- Everything you walk on in hawai'i is made by a volcano. All of the land, all of the valle all of the lush valleys that are so steep no one could ever walk there-- was first built by a volcano, layer upon layer. And then later, rains and clouds carved into those valleys. 
- Today it is called haleakala, "house of the sun." In days gone by, my kupuna,my elders, have used the name, ah'haleakala, "the path to the sun, the path to the light." 
[chanting in Hawai'ian] ?????? ?????? 
- 93% of this volcano is underwater. Only 7% is above water. That makes us the third largest volcano on the planet.

- if I could travel with an o'ahu bird, I could see cinder desert change into cloud forest, change into rain forest, and then, finally, back to the ocean. 
- You continue up the makahiku falls and continue your journey through the gulch, you'll find several more pools until you get to the last waterfall in the pipiwai stream, which is waimoku, which is our 400-foot waterfall. Hana, and the whole coastline, was a special place because it was well-visited by many people of folklore, so a lot of your ali'i, your royalties, came here as retreats. 
- This side of maui is a very, very unique part of hawai'i. There's a very ingrained culture and a very ancient one. The hana highways-- it's the whole east side of the island. This road started as an ancient walking trail. The road itself, though, is unique in that it cuts around the mountain. It goes around haleakala, and they didn't cut through anything. They had to go around. So we're on the side of cliffs. We're going over rivers, going way up in the mountains. It's a very unique road. Most people think that hana is a destination, is a place to go to. But really, the journey is getting here. So stop along the way. Look at all the places. Enjoy what's around you. That's whas gonna make the visit to the east side, to hana, unique. 

[00:15:48]


[people singing in Hawai'ian] ?????? ?????? 
- the cool thing about maui alone-- there are so many different types of beaches, different types of sand, different types of rock and substrate: Gravel, you know, rubble, lava tubes, just amazing geographical formations that, honestly, you can't find them anywhere else in the world. 

[00:17:53]


- Every day, there's this oscillation between the clouds coming in and going out, and that's one of the gifts to the islands. The mountains are so steep, it creates that weather pattern that gives us fresh water. It's not just the volcanoes creating the islands. They're shaped and changed by our weather systems and even living things. 
- People moved around in polynesia because they ran out of water, and without water, you starve. So in hawai'ian, if you are waiwai, you are very rich. You have so much water. And water is a blessing. Rain is a blessing. 

[00:20:01]


- Each island is unique, and it affords species of plants, birds, and insects the ability to evolve according to what's in their environment. And time has allowed these bio-forms to change and be unique to only here. 
- The valleys that we see that are are lush and green are formed through erosion-- through wind, sun, rain, and through weathering. 
- You can lon the memoirs of all the explorers that have come through THESE AREAS--1800s AND BEYOND-- That people were sustaining theirselves here. It was, you know, like, even captain cook-- he was amazed at how there was thousands of people just in the middle of nowhere alive and well and healthy and happy. 
- If you were a bird using the trade winds to soar, reaching down to the ocean, they would have that deep understanding about how everything fits, how everything is connected. And once you went beyond the muliwai, where the freshwater meets the ocean, you would travel out to the reef, and you would see from the air just how beautiful that reef is, and you would begin to understand that that's a place that's worthy of our respect and our protection. 

[00:22:19]


- [on radio] VALLEY CLEARANCE. Good morning. Blue 1-8 at the hat. We got bravo for one flight a-a. 
- To fly a powered hang glider-- it's just like a motorcycle in the sky. You feel the temperatures, the different wind speeds. It really feels like it's your own wings. Hawai'i is the most beautiful place to fly over: The scenery, the lush green, waves crashing in, the turquoise water close to the white sand beaches. What a place to fly over. 
- Aloha, and welcome to a public television celebration of hawai'i's magnificent physical beauty and its rich, beautiful culture. I'm sabrina register along with steven gomes. And stay tuned, because in just a few moments, we'll be visiting lana'i and moloka'i. 
- And mahalo to all of you who are joining us on public television. I'm from kaua'i, the garden island, which we'll see in part three of over hawai'i. But first, we have to present you, sabrina, with a lei, a lei of aloha, because it's-- means that you are so special. 
- Mahalo. 
- You're welcome. 
- Smells wonderful. Between the lei and over hawai'i, I almost feel like I'm there. 
- This is the plumeria lei, and it has a nice fragrance to it. And as sabrina says, she's right. We'll see lana'i and moloka'i next, and we'll see their beautiful islands and what they represent. Part three, we'll see o'ahu and kaua'i in over hawai'i as it reveals so many places that even locals like me, a kama'aina,have never seen. This is a special tour of hawai'i. 
- And where else but public television are there so many places and ways to satisfy the explorer in all of us? And of course, it's all possible thanks to your financial support. We'd love to hear from you right now, and we can thank you with something truly wonderful.

Well, we just saw the big island and maui, and, steven, they really are very different islands, are they not? 

[00:26:38]


- The big island is so huge that if you-- you could take the entire state of hawai'i-- kaua'i, o'ahu, lana'i, all the islands-- and put it on the big island and have a lot of extra space. And then on maui, you have a dormant volcano, haleakela, which you can go up and see early in the morning, which you did, an incredible, beautiful area. 
- Not to be missed. 
- No, and then on the maui coast, you have the hana highway that takes you all the way to hana. Now, it's not about getting to hana; it's about driving along the highway, getting into the waterfalls, the different beaches-- the red beach, the black sand beach. It's an incredible journey on hana on maui. It's a beautiful place. 
- And some people might say, "wow, that trip takes a while. I only have a week in maui." But you say it's really worth it. It's about the journey, about experiencing the different things along the way. 
- Get up early in the morning. Go do it. You will always remember it in your entire life. Going to hana is an event. 
- And haleakela, going either at sunrise, which is what I had the opportunity to do, was fortunate enough, and--or sunset. 
- Yeah, and you will have chicken skin. Your goose bumps will bubble up, because the sunrise is beautiful. The sunset is breathtaking on haleakela. 
- And we talked about the big island, so diverse. You've got the area around hilo as well as the sunny side, kona, so much to see on the big island. 
- And you have to see a volcano as it erupts. Many local people in hawai'i have not had that opportunity. You see mother nature flourishing. It is spectacular. 
- Well, let's take a moment now to find out again about the fabulous mahalo gifts, or thank-you gifts, that we have in store. 
- Mahalo gifts is appropriate. I can go with that. 
- Mahalo gifts is very appropriate. This station is waiting to hear from you, and it is a great time to call.

[00:29:19]


- You know, thinking about the cd and the mahalo gifts, the music of hawai'i, it really does convey the feel of the islands, does it not? 
- You know, the cd has music by the brothers cazimero, these hidden valleys, about the island of kaua'i and the na pali coast. You have hapa singing he'eia about surfing as you fly over waikiki and honolulu. Iou hakane pryor, who sings about hana, the island of maui. So then, of course, keola beamer with slack key as you see the different valleys and the different islands all together. It is a special music that really fits into this-- the over hawai'ivideo. It's really awesome. You know, hawai'ian music sings about everything-- about love, about what we refer to as the 'aina, which is the land. It sings about surfing. It sings about going out on large--long trips along the ocean. It sings about everything-- the skies, even it sings about flying to the mainland, flying back. It's amazing what we cover in hawai'ian music.

- [singing in Hawai'ian] ?????? ?????? 
- [singing in Hawai'ian] ?????? ?????? 
- you know, so many people have had the opportunity to go to hawai'i-- lucky them. But for people who are from hawai'i or spend a lot of time there, why is it such a spiritual and sacred place? 
- Well, you have a beautiful area in the middle of the pacific ocean on islands, and people in hawai'i really take care of the 'aina and have respect for where they live because only limited amount of resources. So they make the most of what they have. And that's also part of the aloha spirit, because the people also need to get along with each other, and they feel the aloha of eacother with each other's cultures, each other's races. And that's why it's so special in the middle of the pacific-- you know, the middle pacific ocean like that. It's a special place, these hawai'ian islands. 

[00:31:44]


- Well, it's time to return to over hawai'i. And, steven, where are we headed next? 
- We're gonna head over to the island of moloka'i, the friendly island, one of the most hawai'ian islands of all the islands. And then we're heading over to lana'i, called the pineapple island, also a very pristine island, a very nice relaxing island to look at and to visit. 
- Two very different islands, so we'll get to see what is unique and special about both of them. 
- Right next to each other. 
- Okay, great. Well, let's go back to over hawai'i, and thanks to all of you who have already called or logged on to our website. You are doing something wonderful for your public television station and for your entire community, so mahalo. 
- So the shape of our volcanoes is different than what you'd find in the cascades or in alaska. So here in hawai'i, we're a shield volcano. If you were to look at it from above, it looks like a shield. So a lot of people come and they say, "where's the volcano?" They don't realize they're standing on it, because we're so gently sloping. 
- They come and look-- "where's the volcano?" You land on it at the airport. So even when you're snorkeling down in the ocean, you're still just hovering above volcanoes. 
- The people who come here and the people who live here get connected with the land and the water. That's just the love for the place. And I think that's what keeps hawai'i the way it is. That's why we stay the way we are, because once you reach here, no matter where you're from, you're gonna end up just loving the land. 

[00:33:49]


- The interconnectedness of the reef and the open ocean-- everything plays a part and has its own role within these ecosystems, and you have everything from an herbivorous or plant-eating fish that grazes algae on the reef to scavengers and all the way up to these larger predators. All of them have very specific roles that they play, and it all ties in to achieving a good, healthy balance. 
- The islands look different and unique because of the fact of their age. So age determines how much soil you have and how big your trees can get. But then, also, we know that, you know, humans and urbanization affecting and changing the landscape. So when we have different plants that didn't come here on their own, through what we call THE THREE "W"s-- Through the wind, the water, and the wings of birds-- then we get other trees in there that can grow really fast, really quickly, like pine trees, and exotic tropical fruit like mango trees. It's all part of the evolution of a planet. 
- Moloka'i. Even like, moloka'i nui a hina-- but it's like the island name. Hina was the mother, was wakea's mate. Hina, she gave birth to moloka'i. 
- If you look at a fish, the fish has a dorsal spine. Those little spines are these island tops. And yet underneath is one big fish. It's all connected. 

[00:36:19]


- There's rare palms to hawai'i. Hawai'i has very few native palms. There's one called loulu palm, or pritchardia. And so this palm-- for other land masses, you know, there's lots of palm species, but for us, we only have this, like, one tree. 
- In hawai'ian culture, they believe that in the ocean, there is mana,which is power, spiritual power. It's a recognition that these very powerful forces that surround us contain a certain godlike quality, a spirit, that helps to shape who we are. It helps to guide us in our daily lives. We do feel that the ocean has that spiritual mana as part of that driving force. 

[00:38:20]


- Every island is so unique in-- of course in physical characteristics and in the characteristics of their communities. And moloka'i is so majestic. 
- This volcano has been above water about 1.2 million years. The farther you go north in the chain, the older the volcanoes get, until they recede below the ocean and totally erode. And they keep going, journeying underwater in a mountain chain that goes all the way to kamchatka, siberia. 
- I would say hawai'i is the most beautiful place in the world, you know? And you can see god lives here, you know, and god's creation lives here. And that's what I see, you know. And I just love this place. an vocalizing]

- the state of hawai'i land area represents 2/10 of 1% of the united states of america, and yet we are responsible for more than 70% of all lost endangered species of plants, insects, and birds. So to this end, to be here, demands the protection, the preservation, of natural and cultural resources. 
- We've just seen a bit of moloka'i. It's the island in hawai'i that is still very close to tradition. No traffic, no stoplights, no buildings taller than a coconut tree. Aloha, everyone. I'm steven gomes here with sabrina register, and we're so glad you are exploring hawai'i with us in a way that very few people get to do. 
- Okay, so we are off now to o'ahu and kaua'i in just a few minutes. I know you're gonna want to stay where you are and see--see these beautiful islands. And, of course, kaua'i, to you, is themost beautiful. It's your home, yes? 
- Nani kaua'i, beautiful kaua'i, and it's special because it is the oldest of all the islands. You have hanalei on the eastern side. You have poipu on the southern side. You have koke'e in the middle of the island. It is a special place, a place that everyone needs to visit. A good friend of mine said, "you go to kaua'i, you'll fall in love again." 

[00:44:36]

So give us a call right now at the numbers below, and give us your kokua, your--your--your hard work that you tell us about how much you appreciate what you do and what we do here at public tv. 
- And right now, I want to chat a little bitsteven, about lana'i and moloka'i. Moloka'i, the friendly isle, and I would imagine there's-- there's a very good reason why it's nicknamed that. 

[00:46:43]


- You head over to that island, and you can chitchat and talk story with people on the island at any time. They are so welcome to having you on moloka'i. And you will get to maybe-- when you talk story with people, they're--they'll maybe invite you to a luau, and their luaus are unique because they take stuff right from the ocean, fresh out of the sea, and an opportunity to meet the ohana, get to know the family. Maybe they'll put you to work, wash the dishes, clean the yard, who knows? But that's what moloka'i is about. It is a friendly, wonderful place to go. 
- Lana'i, if you really want to get away from it all, would you suggest going there? 
- Oh, pristine-- it's an opportunity to, like you said, get away, to relax. You know, you're working hard. You've been busy. Go to lana'i. Walk on a beach where no one is around for miles and miles. It will relax you. It will get you centered. Lana'i is the place to go. 
- And lana'i--the beaches, and then you have the lodge, so very--two different, you know, feels all within one--one island. Thank you, steven. Well, we are headed to o'ahu and kaua'i in just a bit, but first, it's time for you to head to that phone or this secure website and make your contribution to this public television station.

[00:49:39]


- Steven, o'ahu is, of course, the populous isld. People know waikiki beach, north shore. 
- Honolulu, yep, north shore, yep. 
- But it's also a place of great historical interest, a lot of places on o'ahu that you say you can't miss. 
- Yeah, when you're on o'ahu, it's important that you visit the area in downtown honolulu, 'iolani palace, the only royal palace in the united states. And it has a lot of history and culture on the island. Of course, go to the north shore, see the huge waves. And then, of course, you got to head over to the polynesian cultural center where you not only learn about hawaiians but about the different peoples within the south pacific. It's an important place to go. 
- And kaua'i, called the garden isle. 
- The garden island because of how beautiful it is. You have an area known as koke'e where you go up to the-- they call it the grand canyon of the pacific. You go over to hanalei, which has beautiful beaches, green, lush interiors. You get to see the taro patches. It is a place where you got to take a lot of pictures. 
- Is that place by the na pali coast? 
- That's correct, and you go to a beach called ke'e beach at the end of the road. You can hang out over there, good snorkeling, nice place to get away. And a friend of mine, kamuela ka'ahanui, he tells me, "when you go to kaua'i, you'll fall in love again." It is one of the more romantic islands that you can enjoy. 
- Fantastic. Well, this station is depending on you to do your part tay. Here's just a quick reminder of the beautiful mahalo gifts we have for you when you make that call.

[00:52:08]


- Well, as if we haven't seen enough stunning scenery already, where are we headed next? 
- Well, we're headed west in the hawai'ian island chain. We're going to o'ahu, the third largest island, and then kaua'i, the oldest island. I know by the time we speak again, if you haven't been to hawai'i, you're going to think about going, and I hope you do. And if you haven't gone yet, plan a trip. It's worth it. 
- And if you've been before, plan that next trip. 
- Yeah. 
- Mahalo for your support. There is so much more quality programming coming your way this year, and it's all thanks to you. 
- Hawai'i is an ongoing experiment in not just our biology and geology here, but also how we get along together as people. We have visitors from all over the world that can teach us things, but I think most importantly, the islands can teach the rest of the world some things, because our planet is really an island itself. We have limited resources. We have to get along. There's a mix of cultures, and there's a mix of histories to learn from. 
- Most visitors, when they come to hawai'i, they feel a need for a pilgrimage to pearl harbor. And so they go to the arizona, and they learn how the war started, and they can look at pearl harbor and imagine the carnage that happened. It's very traumatic, and so it's really important for them afterwards to visit the missouri, because it gives closure. They can see this is where the war ended, and they can understand that the world was once again safe. So we get a different reaction from the different people that come. So the veterans, frequently, will walk the decks, and you can see them kind of get lost in the past. Sometimes, they'll-- if they're with their family, they like to share some of their memories, and it's very touching. 

[00:54:22]


- I was at port here when I was 18 years old, and coming back here after 65 years, I can't believe it. Seeing this ship after so many years-- just like a blessing to me that I was able to come back and walk again on my old ship. 
- Because of our latitude/longitude, we have the ability to offer visitors a really great array of things to see and do and get a better understanding of islands, wherever they are on this planet. 
[men singi in Hawai'ian] ?????? ?????? 
- it's a whole nother world, as ariel says in the little mermaid. It's a whole nother world under the ocean, a world within a world, and if you get the chance to go underwater, you know, with a scuba tank and just sit there and look, you see all these different levels of this new world. And the reef system's obviously a huge part of the ocean. It acts as a filter, and it also is food for the fish, protection for us as well. Where we have the outer reefs, it stops the large winter swells from coming in and pounding the shores. It kind of gives us that buffer and a protection zone. 

[00:56:48]


- The only landscape that is not created by volcanoes is created first by coral. But then there are creatures that feed on the corals. If you ever snorkel, you get to watch parrot fish. You'll see them eat coral, and, well, they expel that which they cannot use, like all living things. And that washes ashore and creates beautiful white sand beaches. 
- On an island, obviously, you can only go so far and you hit the ocean. So you have to make of what is here. You have to make the most of what you have. 

[00:59:04]


- We say in hawai'i, where you are born, that's your one hanau. That's the sand of your birth. So it--it's-- you're not just connected to the place by its name, but you're connected to the place by its landscape, by its natural resources: The mountains behind me, the sand in front of us over here. That's the thing you long to see every day, and when you're separated from it, you have this disconnect, and it starts to affect you. That feeling of connection, I think, is what makes it different for us over here-- connect to the land. 
- We have a saying too, yeah: Malama 'aina. It's to love and care for the land, and the land will take care of you. In the ancient time, there were systems, like the mountain. You had the wao akua, the highest peaks of our mountains in the heavens, the clouds, the misty rains, the birds, the wildlife. Those were a place of kapu, where you would not go there unless you were asked to go. So it's very spiritual, and the spiritual comes from within. The spiritual essence is to-- enhance you to self-discipline yourself, to make things right. Make things pono is what the natives would say, to make everything complete, yeah? 

[01:01:42]


- So the oldest islands are the northwestern hawai'islands. Kaua'i is the oldest island at 6 million years old, roughly. And through evolution, you know, plants and animals have come here and evolved to live in this unique ecosystem. 
- One of the things I love about this place is just the diversity, not only of the biology and the history of it ologically, but also, it really reminds me, every time someone sees it for the first time, what a unique place it is, and what a cool planet we live on. This is a valley. First it was built by an eruption, a sees of eruptions, not just one, layer after layer after layer. And then it begins a point in life where it erodes. You can see new swaths of color come in. There'll be a landslide. So we're seeing a painting that keeps getting re-touched up over time. And it's a long-term art project. It's not one event. 

[01:04:09]


- The lava flows easiest path. It flows like liquid, down the easiest path. When it rains, it follows the lava down the same easy path, and it's carved out this very hard rock over many years and formed waterfalls. 
- As you look down and you see all the different-- the wet side of the island and the waterfalls, the dry side of the island, the cliffs, the way the waves wash upon the sand on the beaches. Look at all of that. As the islands grow and sink, we physically, emotionally, spiritually change to interact with our land. That's what this place is. It is a portion of our understanding. 
- ?????? We love these islands and all that they share ?????? ?????? warmth, love, happiness, and time to care ?????? ?????? untold tales of times long past ?????? ?????? of kings and queens, of this and that ?????? ?????? trust in us, and you'll know no cares ?????? ?????? throw back your arms and take to the air ?????? 

[01:06:17]


- the amount of mass these volcanoes put on the earth's plate creates what we call a hawai'ian ridge. So it actually creates a deeper trench on the plate. So that's why we say we're some of the tallest volcanoes in the world from the seafloor to the summit. 
- ?????? These hidden valleys have a story to tell us ?????? ?????? of secret wishes, magic people, and kingdoms ?????? ?????? gaze into the sea to know what life brings you ?????? ?????? power, majesty, and strength can you see through ?????? ?????? the barrier of years and the passing of ages ?????? ??? when all the meaning of what was is now ?????? ?????? ours to give and ours to show ?????? ?????? share from the heart for the body and soul ?????? ?????? trust in us, and you'll know no cares ?????? ?????? throw back your arms and take to the air ?????? 
- ?????? fly until you know no boundaries ?????? ?????? laugh a melody of joy and illusion ?????? ?????? grab a sunbeam shining into the canyon ?????? ?????? coloring the mountains over and over ?????? 
both: ?????? IF YOU EVER, If you ever ?????? ?????? ever want to believe in ?????? ?????? the mysteries of glory that we speak of to you ?????? ?????? look into the mirror of this life as we know it ?????? ?????? come, my friends ?????? ?????? we'll take the best, and we'll share it ?????? ?????? trust in us, and you'll know no cares ?????? ?????? throw back your arms and take to the air ?????? ?????? oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh ?????? ?????? oh, oh ?????? ?????? oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh ?????? ?????? we love these islands and all that they share ?????? ?????? warmth, love, happiness, and time to care ?????? 

[01:08:26]


- kaua'i is beautiful and full of greenery, and the communities are smaller. Everybody knows everybody. You know, you can't land on the island without everybody knowing somebody is here. 
- ?????? Of secret wishes, magic people, and kingdoms ?????? ?????? gaze into the sea to know what life brings you ?????? ?????? power, majesty, and strength can you see through ?????? ?????? the barrier of years and the passing of ages ?????? ?????? when all the meaning of what was is now ?????? ?????? ours to give and ours to show ?????? ?????? share from the heart for the body and soul ?????? ?????? trust in us, and you'll know no cares ?????? ?????? throw back your arms and take to the air ?????? 
- ?????? fly until you know no boundaries ?????? ?????? laugh a melody of joy and illusion ?????? ?????? grab a sunbeam shining into the canyon ?????? ?????? coloring the mountains over and over ?????? 
both: ?????? IF YOU EVER, If you ever ?????? ?????? ever want to believe in ?????? ?????? the mysteries of glory that we speak of to you ?????? ?????? look into the mirror of this life as we know it ?????? ?????? come, my friends ?????? ?????? we'll take the best, and we'll share it ?????? ?????? trust in us, and you'll know no cares ?????? 
- everything comes from the ocean at some point, you know, even as it comes back down in the form of rain and feeds the island. It's kind of a never-ending cycle. The water evaporates, goes up into the clouds, comes back down over the mountains, and then feeds all the way through again. The water is definitely a huge resource to us. It's something we have to protect. 

[01:10:55]


[woman singing in Hawai'ian] ?????? ?????? 
- I don't know another place in the united states where there's such a wonderful mix of histond culture and people that get along. When you hear people talk about the aloha spirit, it comes when you stop to listen. And if you take the time to do that, then you'll understand. 
- The thing that makes hawai'i unique and especially lovely is our people and our history and our connection to that. All of those very special places that people visit here are-- we call it one hanau, our birthplace, the land of our home, the birthplace of our kupuna and our ancestors. And so I think it's important, wh people come to hawai'i, to at least try and attempt to see this place through those eyes. 
[woman singing in Hawai'ian] ?????? ?????? 
- while popular visitor destinations like waikiki beach and lahaina make an appearance in this spectacular production, so much of over hawai'i was shot by helicopter, giving us those rare views that show the remarkable diversity of hawai'i. Aloha again. I'm sabrina register, here with steven gomes. And I love hawai'i. I have had the great opportunity to go a few times, and I have to tell you, this dvd, over hawai'i, just makes me want to go back and go someplace new, like moloka'i, where I've never been before. 

[01:13:03]


- Well, I'm from kaua'i, hawai'i, and this program has taken me to places I've never seen before. Yes, true that most of, you know, visitors go to o'ahu or maui, but you go to the island, and you get to see its own history. You get to see the island on the inside of the island. That's why this dvd is so wonderful. 
- Well, yojust mentioned, you're from kaua'i, so what's something, when people go to hawai'i-- or kaua'i, I should say-- they go to poipu beach, but what, perhaps, do they overlook when going to kaua'i? 
- You should go to koloa town and learn a little bit about the history of the sugar plantations. It is a really cool place to hang out and just walk around koloa town. It's really cool. 
- Fantastic.

- people, when they go to visit hawai'i, or of course, when they live on hawai'i, you hear "aloha" all the time, "hello," "good-bye." But talk about the aloha spirit. What does "aloha" mean to you? 
- You know, it's a situation WHERE, BACK IN THE '70s, We had this saying, "the more you give, the more you have." It's about--it's about ohana, your family. It's about taking care of each other. It's about feeling the spirit in the aina, and it's just a wonderful spirit that envelops all of us. We have so many different races in hawai'i sharing each other's culture, and that's what it means to be in the aloha spirit, everyone getting together and enjoying each other's company. That's part of the aloha spirit. 

[01:19:59]

=======================================================

>> Annououncer: The following is a paid advertisement for t the swivel sweeper max, brought to you by ontel products. 10 years ago, the first generation of swivel sweeper took the world by storm. 
>> It works and it's lightweight-- that's the best part about it. 
>> I'm looking for things to clean with it, 'cause I'm going, "oh, surely it can't do that," and then wow, it can! 
>> Announcer: Five years later, with millions sold, we introduced the swivel swper g2 and got rave reviews. 
>> Swivel sweeper g2! 
[Cheering] 
>> well, my husband'll be happy 'cause he won't have to cart that vacuum cleaner up and down the stairs for me anymore. 
>> Woman: I have to tell you, I love it. I didn't think it could become better, but it is. 
>> Announcer: Now, the brand-new swivel sweeper max is trailblazing a new frontier in cleaning. You asked for a sturdier pole and more power, and we gave it to you. The new max is a whopping 33% more powerful, and in the next 30 minutes, you're going to discover game-changing technology that will change everything you know about sweeping. 
>> I didn't move anything, I just kind of went. 
>> I really like the idea that I can turn it this easily. 
>> Man: Very easy to use. Even a five-year-old can use it. 
>> That was really easy. 
>> Pick the dirt out, set it back down, it's ready to go again. 
>> It would go under my bed easily. >> Love it. 
>> Get it and you'll be a believer. 
>> Announcer: Stay tuned and find out what makes the new swivel sweeper max a game-changer and the best cordless sweeper the world has ever seen. Now, here's your host, mindy McCortney. 
>> You know, every once in a while a product comes along that changes everything, that breaks all the rules-- and some of the records, too. With over 15 million already sold, the swivel sweeper has taken the world by storm. Well, get ready, because today we're about to unveil the next generation of the swivel sweeper and here to tell you all about it is my good friend anthony sullivan. 
>> Hey, mindy, how are you? It's great to be here. You know, the fact that I'm standing here almost 10 years since the launch of the swivel sweeper is testament to what a great product it is. This is the new swivel sweeper max, and I have some game-changing technology to unveil today that will change the way you sweep and the way you vacuum. But before I do, I want to show YOU THE A-B-Cs OF THE SWIVEL Sweeper and why you'll love it when you get it home. Firstly, it's completely cordless, mindy. It swivels 360 degrees to the left and 360 degrees to the right. Now walk with me. >> O.K. 

[00:02:26]


>> The thing we hear the most about the swivel sweeper is that it's lightweight and it's easy to use. And it works. Now, it uses sliders instead of wheels on the bottom, which means it will effortlessly transition from carpet to wood without changing any setting. And it won't scratch your floors. Now, if you want to go sideways, this is the only sweeper in the world that has quad-brush technology. What does that mean? It has brushes on all four sides-- that means you're gonna pick up more in less time, which means you spend less time cleaning, and I think that's a good thing. It picks up practically anything and everything in any direction. And at less than two pounds, it really is lightweight. 
Watch this: It's the only sweeper that really picks up in reverse. Straight from carpet onto this white tile, swiveling, picking up-- you can see everything is picked up in just one step. 
>> And sully, show them how it works in the corners. 
>> The corners, watch this: It's actually specially designed with edge-cleaning brushes. These little edge-cleaning brushes will get right in there and they'll pick up those coffee beans. They're gone. Look at the way it gets into corners. And then, when it's full-- we'll walk over here-- all you gotta do is click the touchless dirt tray and all the mess goes into the trash can. At less than two pounds, you will love the swivel sweeper max. 
>> It's lightweight, it's portable, it picks up everything, gets in the corners, and you never have to touch the dirt. Why wouldn't you want one? 
>> I like the power of it. And I would actually be done cleaning my floors in one-quarter of the time that it would be if I did it with a vacuum cleaner. 
>> Easy, it's fast, it's powerful, it's a very handy tool to have around the house for all ages. 
>> I have arthritis, so this is nice. 
>> Where do I get one? [Laughs] 
>> o.K., Sully, you said "game-changing technology," but what's all this behind you? 
>> Mindy, I told you the swivel sweeper max is a game-changer, and let me explain why. All these sweepers and all these vacuums here all use rotary bristles. The problem with rotary bristles is they all get munged up, bunged up, backed up and tangled up with hair and rope and twine. And that means they basically slow down and they're hard to clean with. 

[00:04:31]


>> I know. Every time I sweep up after brushing my hair, you have to use the scissors, pull it out, and you never get it... 
>> Mindy, let me show you something. Remember where you werwhen you saw this. I'm gonna switch the swivel sweeper max on. I've set up the ultimate challenge for any sweeper or any vacuum cleaner. Piles of blonde hair. The swivel sweeper max picks it up, but you could see the problem right there. The swivel sweeper max is completely tangled up, just like any other vacuum cleaner or any other sweeper. 
But watch this: I'm gonna take it to the max right now. Each bristle bar on the swivel sweeper max is spring-loaded. We call it r.C.R. Technology-- removable, cleanable and reusable. It's gonna look like new and it's gonna work like new. 
>> That's brilliant. Why didn't I think of that? 
>> Don't worry, mindy, we did. 
>> It saves me time. I just pop out the bristles, a couple sweeps with my hand, the hair is gone. 
>> Woman: If anything gets stuck in the bristles, they're detachable. You can't remove the other ones. 
>> You can just pull it right out, clean out the hair... 
[Pats hands] and you're done. 
>> O.K., So what's up, sully? 
>> Mindy, I wanna show you how the swivel sweeper max is superior at picking up messes like this. >> O.K. 
>> You've got your sweeper, I've got the swivel sweeper max, they're both brand-new, we've got hair on the floor-- I actually have a little bit more. So, go ahead and switch yours on. >> All right. 
>> What I want you to do is pick it up and then try and untangle it if it gets tangled up. You ready? >> Uh-huh. 
>> One, two, three. Let's go for it. O.K., You can see-- now both sweepers pick up the hair, but as we turn it over you can see they're both tangled. 
>> Right. >> I'm gonna untangle mine, mindy, and you can go ahead and start untangling yours. The swivel sweeper max has removable, cleanable bristles. You can see all the hair has come right off, and while mindy's picking hers out, I've actually untangled mine, put it back, and I'm ready to go-- you need some help over there? >> I need some scissors. 
>> You need some scissors? 
>> You knew I would. 
>> There's a pair of scissors, knock yourself out. That's the difference right there. The swivel sweeper max gets the job done quicker and easier. 
>> I love the swivel sweeper. And I have three girls, all with long hair. Sucks it right up. The brush pops right out, and it's just-- it's easier than cleaning a hairbrush. And you're ready to go. I love it. 

[00:06:40]


>> The best thing I like about it, it's very light, easy to use, it has the sliders, picks up all kinds of things on any surface. 
>> Especially, I mean, the cat itself just kicks the litter out all the time. It gets, like, the little pieces, the bigger pieces. Definitely makes the job a lot easier, a lot faster. 
>> It's got a long-life battery. I've never run out. Just grab it and go wherever you want. 
>> Man: Look how easy that is. Excellent. It's just really easy. 
>> Woman: Surprisingly powerful. I would say it's as powerful as a vacuum. Swivel sweeper max is effortless, enjoyable cleaning. 
>> Announcer: Tired of lugging around heavy vacuums? Tired of all the sweeper and vacuum brushes that get tangled with hair, making them grind to a stop? It's time to take your cleaning experience to the max with the new swivel sweeper max! Now with 33% more power to pick up the tough stuff, a stronger, sturdier pole for greater control, and the swivel sweeper max is the only sweeper with r.C.R. Technology-- removable, cleanable, reusable bristles. Easily strip off hair, twine, and floss that bog other vacuums and sweepers down, and keep your swivel sweeper max looking and running like new! It's the easiest to use, more powerful, most lightweight cordless sweeper. The swivel sweeper max picks up practically anything and everything, from spills in the kitchen to messes on the stairs, from crumbs on the carpet to hair in the bathroom. It's the one cordless sweeper that does it all. Unlike other floor cleaners that use wheels and are limited to a back-and-forth motion, the new swivel sweeper max uses sliders that let it swivel in any direction and pick up in places where other products can't. Thmax slides and glides on any surface without changing any settings, and picks up on all four sides using its patented quad-brush technology that swivels and pivots, picking up wherever it goes, in any direction. When it's ready to empty, the touchless dirt tray empties with a click-- it's that simple. Then just set it down and you're ready to go. Unlike a vacuum cleaner, there's no bags or cords. The swivel sweeper max is completely cordless, and one charge will give you up to 45 minutes of continuous cleaning. It even has a magnetic storage latch so you can tuck it away into tight spaces. With its low profile design, the swivel sweeper max gets under all your furniture and up against baseboards. It even has corner brushes that seek out stray crumbs with laser-like precision and gobble them up. The brushes spin at 4,000 rpm, creating a powerful vacuum action, so it even pks up the tiniest dust and dirt particles. And remember, at less than two pounds, it's so lightweight that even a child can use it-- and they will. Swivel sweeper max picks up all kinds of things that your vacuum can't, including hair. That's right, you'll get the swivel sweeper max with r.C.R. Bristle technology. Other vacuums and sweepers get munged up and bunged up with hair, string and other debris, making them grind to a stop. Not anymore. The new swivel sweeper max has removable, cleanable, reusable bristles that can easily be removed for cleaning. We vac'd this max up with enough hair to put the brakes on a thousand-dollar vacuum cleaner. 

[00:09:40]


Watch: Just click and clean. The bristles look and work like new. No other sweeper in the world has r.C.R. Bristle technology. And with 33% more power and a stronger, sturdier pole, it's tough enough to pick up practically anything.

>> You've seen the swivel sweeper max pick up all kinds of messes in the studio, but now let me show you why millions of people love using it at home. Follow me into this four-bedroom family home. The room where you'll use your swivel sweeper max the most is the kitchen. Why? Because it's where all the action is. Just say someone drops some frozen peas and carrots all over the floor, normally you'll be down on your hands and knees with a dustpan and brush. Not anymore. Let the swivel sweeper max do the work so you don't have to. It glides effortlessly over the kitchen floor using sliders and picks up in any direction. If you spill some coffee beans, you'll pick 'em up before you smell the coffee. Quad-brush technology picks up in any direction, and what i love-- without any adjustment, go straight onto this little rug here and pick up the pasta. Forwards, backwards, side to side. It's the portable powerhouse that fits in the palm of your hand. Then when you're done, just shut it down, grab a trash can, one click of the touchless dirt tray, and you're done. 

[00:12:03]


>> You can transition from a carpet to a tile floor to a wood floor, back to carpet, and you're done in no time. 
>> Yeah, with no changing settings or changing, like, pads or anything, it was just one-two, right onto the next surface, cleaned it up with no problem. 
>> One of the reasons I love the swivel sweeper is because it makes picking up messes easy. If you wanted to clean underneath this dining room table and these chairs, you'd have to move them. This is heavy. It's heavy work. Why'd you have to move them? 'Cause a vacuum cleaner wo get up underneath there. But the swivel sweeper will. Look at the way it maneuvers around this forest of table legs and chair legs. Even in this hard-to-reach area right here-- I don't know if you can see this, but look at the way this swivel sweeper gets underneath here. It's the only sweeper of its kind that swivels 360 degrees and picks up, not on one side, but on all four sides. So forwards, backwards, side to side. Underneath the dining room table, why move it when you can pick up all the messes with the swivel sweeper max? 
>> The fact that this thing can go in-between the chairs in the dining room or in-between the couch and the coffee table or under whatever makes it so much easier. 
>> I have oversized furniture, so this is gonna be fantastic. I don't need a gorilla to move everything now, so I love it. 
>> One of the reasons you'll love the swivel sweeper max when you get it home is because it's lightweight. It's easy to get up and down stairs. It actually weighs less than two pounds. Let's say you're spring cleaning and you want to get some dust bunnies out from under the bed. You break out your giant vacuum cleaner. Firstly, you gotta get the cord and you gotta plug it in. Now I don't know why, but the plug is always in the most inconvenient place. All right, we got it plugged in. Then you gotta switch it on-- where's the button? You switch it on right here. It makes more noise than a jet engine. Then you want to get under the bed, and it doesn't even fit. And it weighs almost 50 pounds. Or you could upgrade to the swivel sweeper max. At the touch of a button you've got the power and the ease and the low profile design to get underneath the bed, get the dust bunnies. It's cordless, it weighs less than two pounds, it gets the job done in seconds. So the choice is yours. You could use the 50-pound vacuum cleaner that doesn't even fit or the swivel sweeper max. 

[00:14:25]


>> Very easy, very light. I like the idea of no cord. Makes thconsiderably easier. >>Re's no cord. I don't have to worry about unplugging it and having to start all over again. Those are great advantages. 
>> The bathroom is where the swivel sweeper max comes into a league all by itself. It's lighter than a vacuum and it's quicker than a broom, and it's the only sweeper with r.C.R. Technology and spring-loaded bristles. What does that mean for you? Well, I've got two things here that are the mortal enemy of any sweeper and any vacuum, and that's long hair and dental floss. Long hair, short hair, blonde hair or dark hair, your hair or my hair, white dental floss or blue dental floss, it all gets picked up by the swivel sweeper max. Now all I'm gonna do is switch it off and use the magnetic storage latch. Most of this hair hasn't even made it into the touchless dirt tray, but the swivel sweeper max is the only sweeper with the spring-loaded bristles and the r.C.R. Technology-- removable, cleanable and reusable. Now just imagine what this would do to your vacuum cleaner. It won't stop the swivel sweeper max. Say good-bye to tangled bristles. 
>> You don't have to go hunt down some kind of tool to clean it out. I think it was a very smart, innovated new feature. 
>> Being able to pick up the hair with the swivel sweeper max and clean the brush easily... It makes me wanna throw the vacuum cleaner away. 
>> Woman: Well, you can clean those brushes so easily and then pop 'em right back into place. It's just like changing the toilet paper, and, well, everybody knows how to do that. 
>> This is so much easier than a vacuum. The sweeper just does it all. 
>> The sweeper being cordless is a lot easier. Go where you wanna go, you're free. 
>> Woman: The thing so nice about this, it doesn't have any wheels, it slides everywhere. 
>> Man: With this, I can get in and around because it swivels around all the legs, goes side to side, front to back. 
>> And it transitions excellent from the travertine to the area rugs to the carpeting. 
>> The thing that I like the most about it is the power that it has to pull up the dirt off the floor. You can feel that you have the strength to do what you need to do. 
>> Around the toilet area, picking up all that little lint and loose hair. 

[00:16:26]


>> I haven't seen anything where #!The bristles just pop out so easily. 
>> The pop-out bles are just so smart. I love how it's so easy to clean, pop back in, and just get going again. Swept up and done.

>> Mindy, there's a very good reason why you're holding a gallon of milk. I've been tellg you all day how light the swivel sweeper max is-- now I'm gonna show you. I've set up this scale. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna lift this side up and I'd like you to hook that milk on the end of the scale. Make sure you don't spill any.

[00:21:02]


>> O.K., Sully, what's up with the maze? 
>> Mindy, I've set up a little chalnge because I want you to see the difference between cleaning with a vacuum cleaner and cleaning with the swivel sweeper max. Now I've already gone ahead and plugged that in for you, why don't you switch it on and just try cleaning this little course here. 
>> All right. 
>> What's the first thing you notice with that vacuum cleaner, mindy? 
>> Well, it's a bit heavy. And I think it's designed to go around corners, right? But it's not going around that corner. 
>> Right, let me show you why people love cleaning with the swivel sweeper max. The thing that we hear the most is that it's easy to use and it's lightweight. >> Right.

And my favorite part about it is when it's time to empty it, all I'm gonna do is switch it off. There are no bags, there are no canisters, there are no dusty filters. 
Watch this: All you gotta do, one click, the touchless dirt tray empties, and you're done. 
>> So you never have to touch the dirt, it's portable, it's lightweight, this is gonna become your go-to sweeper, promise. If you have stairs, you have to watch this because it's so hard to lug a heavy vacuum up the stairs.>> Mindy, if you only use the swivel sweeper max for steps and stairs, it is worth its weight in gold. 
Watch this: It's lightweight, so rather than drag out that big, heavy, clunky, dusty old vacuum cleaner, grab your swivel sweeper. It's cordless, it goes from one step to another step with very little effort. It's so lightweight. It gets into the corners. It swivels, it picks up all the dirt whether you have carpet or wooden stairs, it makes no difference. It just makes the job of cleaning your steps and stairs easy. And then when it's time to empty it, you don't have to unplug anything. All you gotta do is switch it off, carry it down to the kitchen or outside, one click of the touchless dirt tray and everything falls straight into the trash. 

[00:23:18]


>> Look at that. Hey, sully, you missed a spot. 
>> I missed a spot. That's the best part about it. With the swivel sweeper max, if you miss a spot, all you gotta do is run over it one more time, turn it off, empty it, and it's done.

>> And with the ongoing support of these institutions and foundations. And friends of the newshour. And... 
>> This program was made possible by the corporation for public broadcasting. And by contributions to your pbs station from viewers like you. Thank you. 
>> Woodruff: A gunman at a school, mass casualties, and emergency crews-- the scene was eerily familiar and, once again, horrifying. This time, tragedy struck at a grade school in a small connecticut town. 20 of the 27 dead are children. We begin our coverage with president obama's emotional address to the nation this afternoon. 
>> We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. And each time I learn the news, I react not as a president but as anybody else would, as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there's not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today. For the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children. And for the family its of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well. For as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early and there are no words that will ease their pain. As a country we havbeen through this too many times. Whether it's a elementary school in newtown or a shoppmall in oregon, or a temp el in wisconsin, or a movie these never aurora or a street corner in chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. This evening michelle and i will do what I know every parent in america will do which is have our children a little tighter, and we'll tell them that we love them. And we'll remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in connecticut without can to the do that tonight. And they need all of us right now. In the hard days to come that community needs us to be at our best as americans, and I will do everything in my power as president to help. Because while nothing can fill the space of a lost child loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need, to remind them that we are there for them, that we are praying for them, that the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories but also in ours. May god bless the memory of the victims. And in the word its of scripture, heal the broken hearted, and bind up their wounds. 

[00:06:26]


>> Woodruff: Ray srez reports on how the day unfolded. 
>> Suarez: The 9-1-1 call from the school came shortly after 9:30 this morning, and law enforcement officers, including local and state police, as well as agts from the fbi and the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms, were quickly on the scene. At an afternoon news conference, connecticut state police lieutenant paul vance detailed how officials proceeded once they arrived. 
>> On and off duty police officers responded to the school, with newtown police immediately upon arrival entered the school and began a complete active shooter search of the building. That included checking every door, every crack, every crevice, every portion of that school. 
>> Suarez: Vance also confirmed that there were multiple people dead inside the school, including the suspected gunman. 
>> There were several fatalities at the scene, both students and staff. There is no information relative to that being released at this time until we've made complete and proper notification. The shooter is deceased inside the building. There is a great deal of work that is undertaken immediately upon locating the shooter. 
>> Suarez: A law enforcement officer told the associated press the alleged gunman was a 20-year-old, adam lanza, whose mother was a teacher at the school. She is reportedly one of the victims of the rampage. There were also reports the gunman died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds, and that his older brother is being questioned by authorities. The school, sandy hook elementary, is home to children from kindergarten through fourth grade. The violent episode shook students and their families in the smalnewtown community, 65 miles northeast of new york city. 

[00:08:31]


>> We were running really quick, so then we got to the firehouse and we sat in our classes, and i am really happy we are out alive. 
>> It doesn't even seem real, it just does not seem like it's even possible. You read it in the paper or see it in the news, and you're like, "oh, my god, that poor family." And then, you have something happen so close to home, it's like... I think I'm still in shock, to be honest with you. 
>> Suarez: And connecticut governor dannel malloy addressed the shooting late this afternoon. 
>> You can never be prepared for this kind of incident. What has happened, what has transpired at that school building will leave a mark on this community and every family impacted. 
>> Suarez: Today's occurrence in connecticut is the latest mass shooting this year. Most notably, in july, a gunman opened fire at a midnight screening of the latest batman movie, killing 12 and wounding 58. Today's school attack ranks as the second deadliest crime of its kind in american history, only behind the virginia tech shootings, with 32 dead, in 2007. 
>> The associated press sid the gunman's brother is cooperating and not believed to have any questions. Ap also said three guns were found, pooh pistols including a glock and .223 rifle in the back of a car. For more to a reporter who has been at the school and on the scene today. Craig lemoult is with wshu public radio in fairfield, connecticut. I spoke with him a short time ago from newtown. Craig lemoult, thank you for joining us. I understand you went to the sandy hook elementary school today after the shooting. Tell us about it. 
>> Yeah, I did go this morning. Where I got was actually to, there is a fire station just around the corner from the sandy hook elementary school that they were using as a staging area for parents to come. I got there as a lot of parents were arriving and trying to get to where their kids are. And there was, I wouldn't call it a panic but there was a lot of concerned parents. And I saw a lot of relieved faces as they got there and saw their kids were safe. 

[00:10:45]


>> Warner: Did you get an opportunity to talk to any of the parents or any of the children? 
>> I did, yes. I spoke to a couple kids and to their parents. The children told me that they were in class doing just ode things, just like they ordinarily would. And they started hearing some banging. And the teachers told them that it was a lockdown. I was actually, I got to say, surprised that kids knew what a lockdown was, that is a sad statement. They practiced this before. And they all raced into a coatroom before they were ultimately evacuated from the building. I spoke to other people who witnessed children being carried out of the building. And the parents that I spoke to basically were just remarkably relieved and terribly surprised that something like this could happen in what really is a very quiet town. 
>> Warner: I know that right now even as we speak everything, a lot of new information keeps coming inment but what you can tell us about the suspected shoot ever who has been identified in some report of this 20-year-old lanza. 
>> We have confirmed that the shooter was the son of one of the teachers. There are names going around that are being reported. The officials have not identified the shooter or any of the victims yet. Officially. So I am not at liberty to say. But what the name of the shooter was but we have confirmed that it was the son of the one of the teachers. Also officials, state police are confirming that there was another-- there was another fatality, another homicide in sandy hook today. And they do believe, of course, that that is related. 
>> Warner: And then what can you tell us about newtown, one of the fathers said he couldn't believe something like this would happen in a small town like newtown. 
>> Yeah. It's a small, close knit community. And in a really quiet part of the state. You know. It's a suburb but it's almost really more rural. And you know, I talked to a police official here who was asked when last murder in this part of town was, in newtown or sandy hook. And he couldn't remember. He couldn't remember the last time. He said it had to have been more than ten years since there had been a murder in this town. 

[00:13:05]


>> Warner: Craig lemoult, thank you very much, from the npr affiliate in fairfield, connecticut, thank you. 
>> Woodruff: Now, we turn to just some of the many questions being asked about safety, security, and helping children cope in the wake of the tragedy. Stephen brock is a professor of school psychology at california state university in sacramento. He's a member of an emergency assistance team for the national association of school psychologists. Dewey cornell is director of the youth violence project at the university of virginia. He is a forensic clinical psychologist. We hope to be joined by mo canady is the executive director of the national association of school resource officials, which works on school based policing and security. For now I want to welcome both stephen brock and dewey cornell. I will start with you stephen brock. You've dealt with this sort of thing before. What was your reaction when you heard this today? 
>> Well, as a school psychologist, as a father, as a person who is no stranger to this kind of loss t was quite simply devastating. Just a very sad day. 
>> Warner: And dewey cornell. 
>> Terrible tragedy and very frustrating that we weren't able to prevent this. 
>> Let me stay with you, dewey cornell, you have as he said worked with this sort of thing. People look at this and think how could it happen. What do you say when your friends, your colleagues, people who know the work you do, how do you answer that question? 
>> Well, the first thing i try to point out is that calling this a school shooting is a bit of a misnomer. It is a mass shotting that happened to occur in a school. Schools are very safe places. We know objectively that students are safer in school than almost anyplace else. But what's really critical is to understand the relationship between the shooter and the victims. We look for ways to prevent these types of shooting through two key factors. Mental health issues that maybe present in the shooter. Again in this case it's too early to say and also some kind of interpersonal conflict that was overwhelming to the individual. We really can prevent school shoots and other types of mass casualty shootings. But we've got to think about earlier prevention. Prevention has to start long before there's a gunman in the parking lot. Prevention has to start with mental health services and resources in the community to resolve problems and difficulties that people have long before they escalate into a serious violent situation. 

[00:15:41]


>> And stephen brock we know that in many instances that prevention is taking place. But it's not happening often enough because so often these shootings occur and it is typically a young man in HIS LATE TEENS OR EARLY 20s, A troubled young person. Why aren't-- why isn't, why aren't communities reaching these people and what more needs to be done? 
>> Well, again, I would go back to what dr. Cornell just mentioned. These events are, in fact, objectively very rare in occurrence. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. I think we're doing a lot. We could do more. One of these events is clearly one too many. But again I would like to go back to what dr. Cornell just mentioned. These events are extraordinarily rare. And objectively schools are very safe places. 
>> Reporter: And they normally are. And with that, on that note, let me bring in mo canady with the national association of school resource officials. You are joining us now. Tell us what, how safe are public elementary schools in this country? So many parents have to be asking that question tonight. 
>> Well, in general I think they're very safe and the comments that you've already heart regarding, you know, the nature of these type incidents that they don't occur very often. Of course when they do, they're very high impact. I think that across the country school officials overall do a very good job of working hard to maintain safe school environments. It doesn't mean it's perfect and it certainly doesn't mean that anyone is going to be 100% safe. However, you know, as today's tragedy shows us, it can happen anywhere. 
>> Well, staying with you, mo canady, we know that today we were hearing that the school had a buzz-in system. That there was somebody there checking people who came in. Still this young man was still able to get in there, reportedly the son of one of the teachers. What is it that schools could be doing, should be doing to prevent something else like this as rare as it is. 

[00:17:54]


>> Well, and certainly there's no way to say that they were not doing the right thing today. It sounds like they probably were. Just from what I can tell. But you know, the buzz-in entry system certainly are effective especially in elementary schools. But they're only as effective as the person that is manning that system. But the other issue, of course, is the perimetre security of the building. It's one of the painstaking things that has to take place but someone or some people need to be responsible to make sure that all of those perimetre doors are always secure during the day. And that's really difficult especially with children having the propensity to open those doors. Sometimes for people they don't even know. 
>> Well, is there typically a different security system at an elementary school. This was a kindergarten through fourth grade school than there would be say at a high school? 
>> You know, I don't know that there is anything that I would really say is typical from what I have seen. But at the same time you do see a lot of the buzz or camera type entry systems at elementary schools. One of the things that we're beginning to see at more schools from k through 12 are visitor management entry type systems. In other words, where the person coming in has to check in with the front desk, has to present an i.D. And has to be cleared to go into the building. Of course the gman who enters, that is a whole different set of circumstances. 
>> And dewey cornell coming back to you in your comment a minute ago about the need to identify troubled individuals earlier on, you know, again, we've had this. We've seen it happen. The aurora colorado shooting, columbine years before that, what happened recently in washington state. It happened every part of the country. What more do people tonight as they go home and have dinner with their families and as they talk to their children, what me do we need to be doing? 

[00:19:56]


>> Well, we can't turn our schools into fortresses. We can't turn movie theatres into fortresses or shopping malls into the fortresses. We've got to think about prevention as something that's done far earlier. When there are conflicts, when there are troubled individuals, when there are people who are extremely angry and up set and frustrated, as a society we've got to be more willing to reach out to those individuals, to-- we need to have mental health services available for those individuals who need it. We need counselling and mediation services available and domestic situations where there's intense conflict that hasn't resolve but we've got to start before it escalates into a violent situation. And if we can provide these services more generally, we'll have a healthier society an we'll have fewer of those cases that rise to this extreme unusual level. 
>> And in those situations, people say well I knew someone who was trwubled but I didn't know if that was the point to intervene or not. Is there one message for everyone or is it-- individual by nature. 
>> We don't want to wait-- there's no magic signal that says oh, this person is going to be violent. We're not trying to intervene because we have some prediction of violence. We're trying to intervene because a person is troubled. Because they're in a conflictive situation or they're experiencing mental health symptoms. There is a great reluctance for people to recognize that someone is having serious emotional difficulties. And it's all right for them to seek treatment. We need threat assessment teams that could help identify troubled individuals in troubled situations and facilitate referrals for services. 
>> Stephen brock, finally let me come back to you on this question of again, tonight, as families around the country are thinking about what happened. What should parents and grandparents be saying to their children, their grandchildren. Should they wait for the children to bring it up. How should families be dealing with this. 
>> That's a really good question. I think it's important that parents be open and available to talk to their children. Yet at the same time not force a conversation. I like to say let children's questions be your guide. Let your children know you are able, you're available and willing and able to talk about it. But not push them. And not especially don't give them unnecessary details about the event. One thing I think I might tend to be more assertive about putting forward, and that is a thing you have heard from all three of us so far, is that objectively schools are safe places. And I know that might sound like a contradiction today because this is a very sad day. And the tragedy is horrible. But school its are safe places. And parents need to be reassuring their children that the schools that we send our children to on a day-to-day basis are very, very safe places. 

[00:22:56]


>> Warner: . 
>> Woodruff: Well, that's an important message to take away on this terrible day. We thank you all, stephen brock, mo canady, dewey cornell, thank you. 
>> Warner: Still to come on the newshour: A temporary path for young immigrants; shields and brooks; and egypt's coming vote on a new constitution. But first, the other news of the day. Here's hari sreenivasan. 
>> Sreenivasan: The u.S. Will send patriot missiles, along with 400 troops, to turkey to protect ainst possible syrian missile attacks. The troops and missiles will be a part of a larger nato force that includes german and dutch oops as well. Defense secretary leon panetta announced the new moves at an air force base in turkey. 
>> We are deploying two patriot batteries here to turkey along with the troops that are necessary to man those batterees so that we can help turkey have the missile defense it may very well need in dealing with threats that come out of syria 
>> Sreenivasan: A number of syrian shells have landed in turkish territory since the conflict in syria began in march of 2011. The environmental protection agency announced much tighter new rules for soot pollution today. The agency is limiting the amount allowed into the atmosphere from smokestacks, diesel trucks, and other sources of heavy pollution by 20%. The new standard goes into effect in 2014. Residents in coastal california faced another day of flooding after a "king" tide pulled the pacific ocean farther ashore than normal. Residents waded thrgh streets filled with ankle-deep seawater. The tides are the result of an occasional astronomical alignment. Tides are expected to reach 7.3 feet, a level that hasn't been seen since 2008. It was a down day for wall street as investors steered clear of stocks because of uncertainty over the fiscal cliff negotiations between congress and the white house. The dow jones industrial average lost more than 35 points to close at 13,135. The nasdaq fell nearly 21 points to close at 2,971. For the week, both the dow and the nasdaq lost two tenths of a percent. Those are some of the day's major stories. Now, back to margaret. 

[00:25:10]


>> Warner: Next, an update on a new administration policy allowing young immigrants living in the u.S. Illegally to stay here. The "deferred action for childhood arrivals" program began four months ago. Today, the department of homeland security announced that more than 100,000 young people have been granted a temporary reprieve from deportation. 368,000 have applied, less than one-third of the nearly 1.3 million people estimated to be eligible nationwide. We turn again to ray suarez for a look at how the program is working in california, the state that leads the country in applications. 
>> Sorry, I just, like, practiced this speech today. 
>> Suarez: To hear sinyoung park in a class at ucla, you'd assume she, like most of her classmates, is a california kid. And she has been, but only since she was 11, when her parents brought her here fm south korea on a tourist visa. 
>> The thing is I feel like this is where my home is. I remember very little of it, but most of it is just through pictures that I have of my childhood, and like most of my remembered memories are just here. My values and, like, customs are now american. So just, you know, the idea of getting kicked out to korea and never come back to u.S. Is... I just cant even imagine it. 
>> Suarez: Sinyoung is one of an estimated 1.3 million young people here illegally who now qualify for a new federal policy initiative called deferred action. She applied after the president announced the program in the rose garden last summer, citing a failure by congress to pass the so-called "dream act." Spearheaded by the department of homeland security, the operation marks a major change in how the country has handled immigration enforcement in the past, says secretary janet napolitano. 
>> We've identified at least this one category of young people that we really feel are almost in a different situation, 

[00:27:17]


>> Suarez: You could call california america's capital of deferred action. It's estimated that more than a quarter of all the potentially eligible young adults in the country live right here in this one state. Now, when applications didn't come flooding in after august 15, some advocates figured it was because people were waiting for election day, to see whether former governor romney or president obama would be managing the policy going forward. But then election day came and went, and there was no spike in applications. There are many possible reasons for that. For starters, unlike the dream act, the deferred action program does not include a path to legalization, just a two-year pause in the threat of deportation. Applicants need to prove: They were under 31 when the program was announced; were brought te united states before age 16, and have remained for at least five years without leaving; have no criminal record; and have a u.S. High school diploma or its equivalent, or have served in the u.S. Military so, what, a line ran down the block here? 
>> Yes. In fact, it went all the way out there, I would say a mile away. Lots of people, full smiles, entire families. Everyone thought that they would fill out a three-page form, and that they would now be on their way to a new life. 
>> Suarez: Quick like that. 
>> That's right. It wasn't like that. 
>> Suarez: Jorge-mario cabrera is with the coalition for humane immigration rights in los angeles-- "chirla" for short. The group runs daily orientations to explain the process, and has held prepare thousands of applications since deferred action began. But its not nearly as many as they expected to see in the aftermath of president obama's re-election. The cost-- $465 per applicant, plus lawyers fees that can run upwards of $1,000-- is a big deterrent, especially for families with multiple children. And people who've spent years laying low now have to prove they qualify. 
>> It requires that someone knows where they have been the past ten years, 12 years, almost to the point of day by day. Well, it was kind of complicated, a lot of things had to be done. I had to go get my transcripts from school, I had to get background check. 

[00:29:36]


>> Suarez: Fernando fuentes works full-time at a sheet metal plant in compton. He operates this 33-ton turret press that cuts metal for commercial lighting fixtures. The 26-year-old has worked here since high school, long before his new work permit and social security card arrived in the mail last month. He was granted deferred action after his boss agreed to vouch for the fact that he'd been employed there, illegally, for the past five years. Critics like dan stein, head of the pro-immigration enforcement group fair, say that casual attitude toward workplace enforcement is a big problem. 
>> Everyone can understand and sympathize with the equities of a population of people, some of whom were here young, maybe their parents brought them here, but we have to look at the precedent. 
>> Suarez: Stein calls the whole program unconstitutional. 
>> It's a usurpation of the congressional power and the prerogative the constion explicitly gives to congress, that sets the terms and conditions on who can come to this country and who can stay and under what conditions. 
>> Here it is. 
>> Suarez: Fuentes says he knows many americans don't want him to be able to have this card to stay in the country. He works 60 hours a week. He's trained himself to customize cars, trick them out with the latest electronics and fancy upholstery, and now that he can work legally, figures deferred action is good for him and america. 
>> I'm not going to be hiding from anywhere, and I'm going to keep on doing the right thing, 
>> Suarez: Immigration attorney carlos batara has been asked plenty of times to help undocumented young people like fernando apply for deferred action, and he doesn't encourage them. 
>> You're willing to risk and assume that they'll never come back and use the information you've given them against you to bring you into removal proceedings, and if you assume... Or you assume the dream act is going to pass, that's fine. Go to another attorney. I cant do it. I think that almost borders on malpractice. 

[00:31:39]


>> Suarez: So what guarantees do applicants have that their information won't be used against them in the future? 
>> We have provided assurance that information we get will not be turned over, say, to ice. If a person is not eligible, absent some very specific, very serious exceptions. Really the choice is for a young person-- do they... Do they want to go in so that they don't have to worry about being picked up somehow? Or do they want to just continue living the way they live now? 
>> Suarez: The challenge and complexity of confronting the legal and political challenges is on full display as one american family sits down to dinner. The family matriarch first came TO THE U.S. IN THE LATE '70s, Gave birth to a citizen child, then went back home to mexico, where sister and brother sonia and javier were born. As children, they were brought to america to live, where their little brother missael was born, and is a citizen. Like his citizen niece and nephew, sonia's children, whose father, cesar, came illegally, and has been in the legalization process for 15 years. Javier volunteers at deferred action clinics like this one in pomona, california, when he's not in class at the local community college. He applied for deferred action himself just last month and is anxious to get his work permit. 
>> With that work permit, i think definitely the first thing would be being able to get a job and having an incoming coming in, secure income coming in, and being able to pay for my education, go to school at the same time that I'm working. Being able to provide rent money for my mom, which I haven't been able to do because I don't have a job. 
>> Suarez: Javier called his sister the day the president announced the new policy. Sonia, who preferred to give only her first name, has years of college, no criminal record, and has been in the country since 1989, but it turned out she was too old by just ten months. 
>> At first, I was like, it was a frustration, I wish I could have had the opportunities that other dreamers had. I know. But at the same time, I'm glad, because lots of my family members, they qualify for the program, so it's great. My brother's one of them. 

[00:33:58]


>> Suarez: Javier expects to hear back any day now about his application. For him, deferred action is just a stop on the way to a stable future, a way to get legal work, and hope congress gets to work on long-term solution for him and his family. 
>> Warner: What's the connection between the dreamers and john lennon? You can read about the role the former beatle played in paving the way for deferred action and the dream act on our homepage. 
>> Woodruff: And to the analysis of shields and brooks. That's syndicated columnist mark shields and "new york times" columnist david brooks. 
>> So gentlemen, we've all been torn up all day long today with this terrible shooting in connecticut. David, it just is beyond understanding, so how do we make sense of something like this? 
>> Well, the first thing that occurs to me is that you realize the tremendous difference between the process of the grief, the process of the shock, the process of processing all we're feeling today and the policy process. One is just innate outpouring of grief. And then the policy process is about cost benefit analysis, about studies and counter studies. You're trying to figure out what would work. So you feel almost cheap on a day like today. You think down the road we'll talk about what works what doesn't. Already the debates are started. Gun control, all the different policy options on the table. But I am willing to enter into those debates, I guess. But you just want to register the, just the emotion you feel, the scene, the empathy you feel for the parents and so on. 
>> Woodruff: The president certainly did that today, mark. But seems to me we are at, we asked same questions over an over again, every time one of these things -- 
>> you're right, judy. I agree with what david said. The president, his remarks and james brady in the press briefing room, james s brady who was shot and crippled permanently in the assassination attempt when he was press secretary for president ronald reagan in 1981. We have the thoughts and the prayers and the flags at half-mast. But what we don't have and it's the hallmark of I think of a cowhering political and public body, that is we don't have a debate. We don't have a discussion. And the question about, is not whether somebody stands for or against us. Whether we can bring it up. And the reality is that in the united states of america in 2012 it's easier in many states to rent an automobile to buy an automatic weapon than to rent an automobile. It's more demanding. And I just, you know, one of the things about having been in the marine corps is that they teach you how to use guns. They teach you how to use rifles and handguns and automatic weapons. And you come away with just one conclusion. If you reflect on it, and that is they are tools of destruction. They are meant to kill people. That's all, they're not supporting equipment as jim lehrer has remarked. They're not tennis racket, they're not shoulder pads or baseballs. I mean they are tools of destruction meant to do what was done today. And I just think our society has failed to confront, and particularly our political leadership but all of us have failed to confront it. Gee, it's too tough an issue. But the reality is there are too many guns in hands of people who just should not have them. And if we can licence people who clip our toe nails and promote price hikes then we sure as hell ought to be able to licence people who have automatic weapon its. 

[00:37:51]


>> Woodruff: How do you see this? 
>> Well, I guess I don't know anything about this case. We don't know who the shooter is I guess we know now what the weaponry was. But after the aurora case i tried to look into, and made my best decision about what would work. And it's very frustrating because it's very hard to find things that would work. But there are sort of two avenues. There is the mental health avenue which is, and it should be said that in the 98% of people who have mental illnesses are not violent, even people with schizophrenia does not mean they are violent. But there is a small minority who do become violent. And so my belief was that being more aggressive, more assertive in trying to find those people and trying to deny people with those particular shorts of mental health issues access to guns was the way to go. I think would be helpful in the media if we did to the publicize these people especially if they committed suicide. Don't put them on the cover magazines. Don't put their faces on tv. Don't release their names. I somehow thinthat would diminish the perverse heroism of it. As for the gun issue, i think there is a good case to be made for gun control because of the normal amount of killg that goes on with guns. I am a little more skeptical that gun control would reduce these sorts of incidents. Because if you look at where they happen, they happen a lot here, they happen a lot in your, they happen in korea, and norway was the worst. Some of these are very tight gun control regimes. Second the people without do them tend to be disturbed but also meticulous planners. And in a country with 300 million guns I'm skeptical we can keep it out of their hands. So I might be willing to pursue, I think it is a good idea to pursue more gun control. I am skeptical it will prevent these case. 
>> Woodruff: The president said today something should be done, regardless of the politics, in so many words. Do you think that is going to happen? 
>> I don't know. The president has to lead. I mean because it's obvious that with what we have, the national rifle association is essentially has paralyzed the political process in this country. And democrats who have any sort of rural constituencies are terrified to support gun control or even to bring up the subject. And republicans are in lock step, just sort of reflecting on the second amendment. I mean we did ban machine guns in this country. You know, that's been done. And bazookas. We have had success in certain weapons and you know, it requires an enormous national will. But I don't know how else we're going to get that debate going except by the tragedy of -- 

[00:40:28]


>> I would just purely on the political politics of t a few points, first gun ownership is way down. We are at a historic low. Second oddlying and I'm not sure why, I don't have any explanation for this, support for gun control laws has dropped significantly over the last 20 years. I'm not sure why that is. The third point is that these kind of shootings historically have had no effect on public opinion in the gun debate. And I guess pie final point would be I think if we're going to control guns, we really have to do a massive, I think I'm all for getting rid of the assault weapons and machine guns and all that tough but if we want to prevent something like this, we have to really think seriously about drastically reducing the number of guns in our society. And particularly an old patrick moynihan idea, the number of bullet its. It is hard to control 300 million guns. The bullets are a little easier. 
>> Woodruff: That makes it unlikely, isn't it, that something would happen? >>I think we won't know until, you know, until somebody take its that leadership. I meanhere have been, you know, a few lonely voices in congress. And chuck schumer, senator from new york has raised it. But it's going to require obviously a larger coalition than that. 
>> Woodruff: A couple of other things that have happened this week. I want to ask the two of you about. David this really pushed out of the news the story that everybody was talking about last night, that susan rice withdrawing her name to be secretary of state. What finally moved her to take her name out do you think and what does it is a? 
>> Well, I don't really believe it was without white house acknowledgment. If she had a sense the white house was going to fight for her. She would be happy to fight. She had a piece laying out the case for her. I think it is a pretty decent case. I hate it when these things happen when there is no egregious scene committed and there certainly was none in this case. And so I wish frankly she, somebody would have fought a little harder for her. I think-- . 
>> Woodruff: You are saying the white house didn't fight. 
>> Well, the president made a very strong case early on. And then she went to the fill and things deteriorated. And then it sort of has been nothing. And maybe they didn't want to nominate her at all. We don't really even know that. But she certainly was left hanging around for a little while without much support. And they clearly decided this was not the fight they were going to have. 

[00:42:45]


>> Is there a lesson in all this? 
>> Well, don't be the good soldier. She was the good soldier. The secretary of defense and state refused to go on the sunday programs to explain what the policy and what the findings were in benghazi. The secretary of cia did to the go. And so susan rice did. On that fateful sunday after the ambassador's assassination. I think that's probably the first example, first lesson. She was out there by herself. I mean make no mistake about it. The chorus of support was pretty muted. And when the criticism came she-- the president said she was extraordinary and got a big hand at a cabinet meeting but I didn't see anything further organized on her behalf. An there were obviously BEYOND john McCain's own apparent vendetta from the 2008 campaign, there was when you get susan collins and people like that starting to line up against you, I mean it seemed to be a building that was going to be a tough fight. 
>> I would just say she was not her, she became I think for the opponents a symbol of the libya policy which a lot of people didn't like the way the libya thing was handled even before benghazi. And so if should not reflect on her professionalism and competence but she became a symbol. 
>> Woodruff: We'll find out in a few days whether it's john kerry or somebody else. And talk about that later. 
>> Well, just, john kerry is interesting. He and ted kennedy were never close even though both senators were from massachusetts together. But like ted kennedy he has become I think a better public servant and certainly a better senator since he lost the presidency. Kennedy after 1980 became really the dominant figure in the senate. I think john kerry since he lost the presidency and gave up all hopes of the white house has become a far more formidable, influential and important senator. And I think it would be a different kind of secretary of state. 
>> Less than a minute. Job boehner may have gone back to ohio for the weekend. Fiscal cliff, do you know something behind the scenes that's happening that we don't foe about? 

[00:44:55]


>> I know the gestalt which is negative. That maybe we'll have some limited deal but it doesn't look good this week. It has not been a good week. 
>> Remember this, we have not voted on any entitlements in this country since 1983. We have not voted to-- the republicans have not voted to I raise a tax since 1990, no republican in the house or the senate has voted. I mean this is-- we're heading into a major area. So if it's halting, it's slow, if seems not quite open and dynamic, be patient. You know, I think we'll get there. But I do think it's going to be difficult. 
>> Woodruff: We're glad the two of you are part of our gestalt. Mark shields, david brooks. 
>> Thank you 
>> Warner: Finally tonight, to egypt. Egyptians will go to the polls tomorrow to vote on whether to approve a newly drafted constitution. But the path to that vote has deeply polarized the country. It's been nearly two years since exuberant egyptians, backed by their own military, forced out hosni mubarak after three decades in power. But in recent weeks, the streets outside the palace he once occupied have been the site of counter-demonstrations and clashes between egyptians who'd joined forces in early 2011. Seven people died last week, with hundreds more injured, in hand-to-hand fighting between secular and liberal egyptians and members of islamist groups, like the muslim brotherhood. They were fighting over what the new man in the palace-- former muslim brotherhood figure, now president muhammad morsi-- has done to bring about tomorrow's vote on a new constitution, including a late-november decree granting himsenchecked power until the vote. That led many to compare him to his reviled predecessor. 

[00:47:02]


>> ( translated): I WANT TO SAY That we protest against mubarak because he polluted our revolution with blood. Morsi, like mubarak, he did the same thing. 
>> Warner: Morsi said the decree was needed to ensure egyptians could vote on the new charter without interference by mubarak holdovers in the judiciary. 
>> ( translated): THE Revolution has passed but will not stop. However, I must put myself on a clear path that will lead to the achievement of a clear goal. 
>> Warner: That clear goal is a constitution that reapportions powers among the president, parliament and military, and changes the role played by the islamic code of shari'a. Opponents charge it will let the party in power smother the rights of women, minorities, political opponents, and the press. 
>> People understand, without reading the constitutional draft, that this is a power grab. 
>> Warner: Motion picture actor khalid abdalla was a leader of the revolution in early 2011. He is now involved in mosireen, an online video activist group. 
>> The constitutional draft that they are proposing to the country is essentially a sugar- coated poison pill, in which i wish the sugar was real but, ultimately, it's saccharine. We're being told that here is the constitution that is going to ensure your rights. But what it is is a roadmap to ensure muslim brotherhood dictatorship and control of power over egypt for the next 10, 20, 30ears. 
>> Warner: Not so, say morsi's backers, who insist there are plenty of new limits on presidential authority. 
>> These checks and balances are a good way forward. Not the perfect way that our generation or even our creed as revolutionaries wanted, but certainly a step in the right direction, and a big step at that. 
>> Warner: Gehad el haddad is a senior adviser to the muslim brotherhood's political arm, the freedom and justice party. 
>> The president does not have most of the powers he had in the 1971 constitution. The president actually got stripped from about 60% to 70% of his powers. All of the powers that he has are put on the checks and balances from the parliament of both houses. 

[00:49:11]


>> It would be unfair to say that this constitution establishes the possibility of dictatorship or anything approaching the authoritarianism of the mubarak regime. 
>> Warner: Samer shehata is a professor of arab politics at georgetown university. 
>> There were articles in the old constitution which did not limit presidential terms, and so mr. Mubarak was, essentially, president for life-- 29 and a half years. This constitution reduces term lengths from six years to four years, and stipulates that the president can only be re-elected once, two-term limits. 
>> Warner: Opponents also charge the proposed constitution lays a foundation to impose stricter islamic law over a country with many strains of islamic thought, from secular to severely religious, and a 10% minority of coptic christians. Morsi supporters have in fact been chanting "bread, freedom and shari'a" at rallies, and this morsi backer in alexandria seemed to have that expectation. 
>> ( translated): I SUPPORT THE President and I think that opponents fear the growth of the islamic political current. They know thatf the people vote yes, the islamic constitution will rule for a long time, and that will affect the lives of the opponents of the president. 
>> Warner: It's a prospect that deeply alarms many more liberal- minded egyptians. 
>> ( translated): THE Brotherhood are here to occupy the country. We will not let them. We don't need them to teach us what islam is all about. We are much better muslims than they are, and at least we aren't hypocrites. 
>> Warner: Samer shehata says there are reasons for concern, especially in the role it gives clerics at a leading islamic university in determining whether a piece of legislation contracts sharia. 
>> Certainly, it emboldens the idea that islam should play a larger role in politics and also in the social code and law. I think everyone in egypt and anywhere else would say, yes, the shari'a means social justice, it means equality, it means fairness. That's what my grandmother's interpretation of shariah is. Unfortunately, there are some in egypt, islamists of different stripes that have a very different interpretation of the shari'a that have to do with limiting the rights of non- muslims, limiting the rights of women, possibly limiting some kinds of freems of speech and so on. 

[00:51:35]


>> Warner: Even more divisive than the particulars in the constitution has been the way it's been shaped, a process controlled first by the military, and then the muslim brotherhood and new islamist- dominated parliament rammed through, opponents say, without regard for the views of other segments of egyptian society. That divide may be hardest to heal. Secular and liberal forces say though some of them were involved in the constitution- writing process, they had little influence against the islamists. Most ultimately walked out. "That's not dialogue," says khalid abdalla. 
>> If you're going to talk, you don't pull a dagger on me and say, "i'm threatening you." And that's ultimately the way in which the process is being guided by the muslim brotherhood and the muslim brotherhood leadership, and shows the methodology which they're using to force this country to accept something that reorganizes the state in a way that entirely fits their agenda and their agenda alone. 
>> Warner: Gehad el haddad disputes the charge. 
>> I don't think it's a rushed process, because the constitutional assembly took six months in the writing, and they didn't start from scratch, either. They started from well-written drafts of various groups in the society itself. 
>> Warner: El haddad says he understands the opposition's frustration, but it's time to move on. 
>> I think that we really need to be responsible and civilized enough and look at the full half of the cup, knowing well that we have another half to fill up. 
>> Warner: Many apolitical egyptians clearly yearn for their leaders to start filling that half-empty cup. In khan el khalili marketplace, 60-year-old pensioner mohamed taha bemoaned the upheaval that has kept tourists and business away. 
>> ( translated): WE WANT LIFE To go on. It doesn't matter if people say yes to constitution or say no. 
>> Warner: But samer shehata says it may be hard for egypt to move on after the vote. If this referendum is adopted, is approved as expected, where does that leave egyptian society? 

[00:53:38]


>> It produces a very divided, polarized egyptian society, one in which many of those liberal secular voices will feel that the constitution is an illegitimate document, and that certainly is not healthy for democratic consolidation in egypt. 
>> Warner: For an egypt still waiting for the promise of the revolution to be fulfilled in its citizens' daily lives, that would be a bleak prospect indeed. We asked two experts to weigh in on the discontent in egypt. Read their responses on "the rundown." 
>> Woodruff: Again, the major developments of the day: A gunman walked into an elementary school in newtown, connecticut and killed 26 people, including 20 children. The killer then committed suicide. It was the nation's second deadliest school shooting after the virginia tech massacre in 2007. An emotional president obama called for "meaningful action" to prevent such shootings. And our coverage of the tragic shooting continues online. Hari sreenivasan explains.

=======================================================

All of us. 
>> We will be back an hour from now for another edition of 360. Piers morgan tonight starts now. Live live at a community in morning after the worth mass shooting in school history. Sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut and opened fire. He killed 20 children, young children from 5 to 10 years old. The shootings took place in two rooms of one section of the school and he killed at least six adults before killing himself. Police found the body of the suspect's mother in his home earlier in the day. A prayer vigil was held in a church and took place a mile away from the sandy hook elementary. At the white house a vigil was held with people gathering for more gun control. Many say it demands tougher legislation in the white house. Visibly shaken president obama offered these words about the mass killing. 
>> The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers. Men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. 
>> Highly emotional president obama reflecting how most of the nation would have been feeling and tonight police have identified the killer as adam lanza. This is his brother ryan lanza being taken into questioning. Much more on the shooter ahead. I spoke with the former classmate. Susan candiotti has new details from outside the school. A desperate day for the school and the families of the poor children and for america. What do we know about the person who perpetrated the hideous crime? 

[00:02:21]


>> It is so heart breaking. We are learning he is 20-year-old adam lanza. We know according to our sources that for whatever reason when he came to the school this day, he was wearing what is described to me as black battle fatigues and a military vest. He came armed with three weapons. Two of them hand guns. One as a glock and another as a sig sauer and a third poliee found in the vehicle. The two weapons were found on him in the school. The third was found, the bush master which is a semi automatic was found in a car outside the school. What led him to this? We don't know. We do know this. Police have questioned both his brother and his father. His brother was taken into custody for questioning only. He is not being called a suspect. From his apartment in hoboken, new jersey. We understand the father was also questioned by authorities here in the newtown, connecticut area. The father is divorced from nancy lanza. She is the mother of the two who is a school teacher and counted among the dead. Her dd was found in a residence here in the newtown area as well. Believe it or not, piers, the weapons according to authorities were owned by the mother, nancy lanza in this case. Not by the shooter. Still trying to piece together a motive. There signs we are hearing for our sources that the shooter may have suffered from some kind of personality disorder. Did he leave notes behind? Did he tell anyone what he was planning to do? Among the many questions that we all have tonight. 
>> Thank you very much indeed. I want to turn to ashleigh banfield. I was watching when you were speaking to wolf blitzer and you became very emotional. Two o your children went to school in connecticut and you were not sure what was happening with them. They were okay, but this is every parent's nightmare. From what we understand the bodies of still lying there on what the police are calling the crime scene of the school. The parents can't even see them. It's an unimaginable horror. 

[00:04:42]


>> There is no other way to put it. Unimaginable horror and an evil visited upon the community according to the governor of connecticut who spoke here earlier. Another detail for you that i want to share about how some of these parents learned they wouldn't be seeing their children again. I think you already know the detail that many of the children were rushed out of the school. Out of the sandy hook elementary by the police and teachers and raced on foot to a nearby fire station which became the staging area. They were robo calls that went out. Heard the robocalls saying parents of the sandy hook students, come to this fire station to be reunited with your children. Throughout the day there was one area within that fire station where the children were kept and they were shown movies until their parents could come and find them. There was another area where a number of the parents were milling about, waiting for students to be brought into the fire station. You can imagine it was a chaotic scene for sometime. Slowly but surely over the course of the day parents arrive and children were taken away and parents continued to wait and other children didn't arrive and ultimately there was a moment where they had to tell the waiting parents there will be no more reunions tonight. I'm told from someone who was inside that area in a room adjacent that at the moment the parents were told there would be no more children coming there were wails that were released. The person who told me this she said she completely broke down. There was a nurse on hand who volunteered having worked two decades in the business. Her brother telling me that she just wanted to be there and help in any way she could as a grief counsellor and was present at that time as well. A horrifying moment if you can imagine being those parent who is waited and waited and waited only to hear this and ultimately like you said, they know the bodies of their children are still in that school tonight. 

[00:06:47]


>> It's hard to imagine anything worse in the world. Thank you for now. I will be joined by the mayor of danbury right next to newtown. Thank you for joining me. This is almost beyond description, beyond any understanding. How is the community dealing with this or are they? What can you do? 
>> Well, obviously it's been a horrific day in the greater danbury area and particularly the town of newtown. Our heart goes out to the individuals who lost loved ones today and obviously the children and the staff and everybody else. It's been an incredibly difficult day. The first staff have worked hard. She is really doing what needs to be done. The first responders were tremendous and the staff have been heroic in terms of their approach to this. It's an absolute international tragedy and crisis. 
>> I understand that you knew the principal of the school who also was killed. 
>> That's correct. I had the honor of working in the same school system and very close proximity to dawn who passed away today. She was a teacher in the school system and elevated up through the ranks and ended up the principal here in newtown. A committed, hardworking and dedicated educator. Someone who cared deeply about the kids and put kids first in every facet and every way in which she executed her job and somebody who we all admired working with her children as a professional. 
>> Extremely sad day and i appreciate you joining me. I can only wish you the very best. We are trying to rebuild the community. Did you know if there plans for more vigils tomorrow? 

[00:08:51]


>> There are vigils scheduled throughout the weekend. In addition that, connecticut itself is having a simultaneous vigil that they are trying to organize right now where each town and village and city will take a moment out and spend time reflecting and maybe starting once we get through this initial shock and reflecting a little bit about our public policy positions in terms of things like gun control and how we deal with folks who are disabled. Once we understand this horrific tragedy that occurred. That conversation will be started over the next couple of weeks. 
>> Thank you very much indeed for joining me. 
>> Thank you, piers. 
>> We can't imagine what it was like in the school. Sofia was there and just 8 years old. She joins me with her brother, brend a. Thank you both for joining me. If I may start with you, brenda. This is every mother's nightmare. When was the first you heard about this and how did you hear? 
>> I received a call from the school system from the superintendent saying that there was a shooting in newtown, but didn't say it was a school. That the schools were on lockdown. I wasn't too concerned because i didn't know where it happened. I received a text on my phone from a news organization and they said that sandy hook school had a shooting. I got in my car and I went over to the school and there were already state police and the fire and newtown police. 
>> When you got there, obviously scenes of complete chaos, how quickly was it that you realized your daughter was safe? 
>> Okay. When I got there, there was complete chaos, but I did see moms and a neighbor and asked them what happened and they said they didn't know. That there was a shooting and i saw a neighbor like I said and he said they carried out a little bill e girl and she looked like she was dead. Instantly I panicked because of my baby here, but thankfully no sooner he said that I looked towards the kids being brought from the school to the firehouse and I saw her class and I ran up and I said where is sofia and they said she is okay. She's coming. I saw her with her teacher and we all were taken into the firehouse and kept so they could do a roll call and make sure all the students were accounted for. 

[00:11:30]


>> Sofia, it's been a terrifying day for you and your friends. What did you think was happening. Were you aware somebody was firing a gun in the school? Prar are can you hear? 
>> Not really. 
>> She can't really hear. She told me that they heard pops in the hall way. The teacher told me also, courtney martin is my hero, she locked the door immediately and brought all the kids to a corner of the room where they stayed there. They were scared and shaken, but they didn't know what was going on until later when they were brought into the firehouse. Police came and knocked on the door and said it's okay, you can come out. They guided them to the bacm of the school and they walked over to the firehouse. That's where I caught up with sofia. 
>> How is sofia now. It must have been a traumatic experience for all the children who survived this. 
>> I think she is numb right now. She is a pretty bright kid and she has a big support staff at home and we love her very much and she will be fine. We are devastated for the rest of the families. We don't know who was hurt. I do know my close friends's children are okay, but we don't know who the children were. 
>> I don't know if she can hear me or not, but I wondered if she wanted to say anything about what happened to her today. 
>> Do you want to say anything, honey? Are you sure? 
>> She too cold now. 
>> She should probably go home with her mom. It's been a terrifying day for everybody involved. I am so grateful that you were able to see your daughter. Obviously your heart must go out to the poor families who have not been able to see their poor children again. 

[00:13:36]


>> It's a small community and it's a close-knit school and devastating. I will be here for anybody and our prayers go out to all the families. 
>> Thank you very much indeed. 
>> I'm just the luckiest lady right now. 
>> Thank you very much indeed for joining me. I appreciate it. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Very lucky indeed. The gunman is adam lanza and joining me is lanza's former classmate, alex israel. You knew this character. Is this something you could have predicted he would one day flip and do something as monsterous as this? 
>> I don't know if you can ever predict something like that would happen. You never think it's going to happen to your school and where you lived your whole life. I don't know if I could predict it. There was something off about him. I knew him closely when we were very young in elementary school together. He was always a little bit different. He mostly stuck to himself. I don't know if you can say you can predict this. 
>> He was by all accounts a pretty clever young man, almost a genius in math. Me about that side of him. 
>> I was never in any of his classes or anything like that, but yeah, you could definitely tell he was I would say a genius. There was definitely something there that was a little bit above theest of us. 
>> Did he have friends? Was he sociable? 
>> I always saw him alone when he was walking through the school or sitting at the table, sitting on the bus. I'm sure he had a few maybe close friends through school or through his classes. Most of the time I saw him, he was alone. 
>> How would you describe his personality? 
>> He was really quiet. He kept to himself. He was a little fidgety. A little uneasy sometimes if you were to look at him. I think he was just socially not really into going out there and making as many friends as everyone was doing in elementary school and middle school. He preferred to stay to himself. 

[00:15:56]


>> Did you know his family, his mother in particular? 
>> I knew her because we lived in the neighborhood. I knew her through neighborhood events. My mom knew her. She was a very nice woman. I didn't know her personally, but from what I remember, she was a nice woman. 
>> His parents got divorced. Were you aware of that having a big impact on him? 
>> I don't know when they got divorced the. I have known him since about first grade and he has always been the way I described him. Reserved and quiet. So I don't know if the divorce had anything to do with that or when they divorced. That could have caused that or made it worse as he got older and came more reserved. I'm not sure if that affected it. 
>> Where were you when you heard and what was your immediate reaction when you discovered it was this person you knew? 
>> It was devastating. I'm in london now studying here for the semester and coming home on thursday to this. I found out first early this morning I guess probably when it broke at home. It was around 2:00 and the first information of it, it's devastating in a town where you have known up. I felt safe my whole life and i was raised in that elementary school and the school system there and finding out it was someone I knew who had done all of this is just upsetting. You can't imagine that would ever happen. 
>> The community around newtown, how would you describe it? It's a kind of quiet place and this stuff never happens. They don't get many shootings and gun murders. This is an exceptional kind of place in that sense. 
>> No. I mean it's a pretty big town space-wise. We span over a pretty vast array of land, but it's really close-knit in that everyone knows each other and is close with each other and the school systems are close. You grow up with these people and go to school with them. Everyone came together I think through this. They are really supporting each other quite well. That's one good thing to come out of it if anything. 

[00:18:17]


>> When was the last time you spoke to adam lanza? 
>> Probably middle school. I didn't have any connection with him in high school. Middle school probably. The last time I said a word to him. 
>> Your summary is kind of fidgety and slightly a loner and not massively sociable, but not apparently dangerous. 
>> No, I mean I never noticed anything scary or violent or anything like that. I wwuld never have expected that from him, I don't think. Just for someone who sort of went under the radar and kept to themselves, you wouldn't really think of thems doing something crazy like this. 
>> It must have been a heck of a shock to you and I am grateful for you joining us to give us perspective on the character of this person. Thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> The psychology of the shooting, two experts are here to talk about the gunman. 1-800-345-2550 about investing.

[ Male Announcer ] TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE Cold truth AND SAVE $1 VISIT Alka-Seltzer ON FACEBOOK. Let's start with you if I may. I have been involved in many of these kinds of incidents and possibly nothing as appalling as this. There seems to be a pattern with aurora and the shopping mall shooting last week. YOUNG MEN IN THEIR EARLY 20s Suddenly flipping and getting ahold of weapons and causing outrages. What is driving them? What is the possible background to what is going on here? 

[00:23:30]


>> Working on a lot of these cases there a number of different causes that can be divided into two broad categories. One category is people who have that trait of a loss of empathy and inability to connect to other people and a history of cruelty or what people talk about as sociopaths or antisocial personality. At the other end people with brain disorders and serious mental illnesses that are untreated or because of what's happening in their life, exacerbated by stress. It sounds like the little bit that is coming out, we are more in a direction that this is someone with a brain disorder and other parts of the story that it may take years to uncover it. There is nothing sudden about any of these stories. That's the headline for me. It's sudden for us that this happened. As you begin to understand the story, I assure you the warning signs were there. Not that they were ignored, but they were not recognized. 
>> Are people like this as likely to carry out what they end up doing if they didn't have easy access to firearms? 
>> Look, there is no question that firearms play a role. I can tell you from experience if somebody wants to kill a number of people, there other weapons of destruction and ways to make bombs and at least one case I worked on. Firearms are certainly an important part of the picture, but understanding when somebody has a mental illness if it played a and I don't know that it has, but it needs to be carefully considered before allowing that person to have a firearm. 
>> Frank, you specialize in treating post traumatic stress and the effects of violence. A very particular problem here with so many young people at the school who have luckily survived. Having to deal now with the horror of losing possible friends and people that they knew from the school and teachers and the head teacher and so on. Where do you start with trying to counsel young children when this kind of appalling thing happens? 

[00:25:53]


>> I think the first thing is helping the parents. The children look to their parents and for the parents, some of them are stunned. They are grieving. They lost a precious 6-year-old. For the children themselves, sometimes children who go through this and do survive take a while to make sense out of it. They may regress and move backwards a year or two in terms of their normal development. Some of them will figure out years later what actually happened. Some are going to do relatively well. They will be sadder and wiser in a way. The most important thing is what I see happening right now. That community is coming together. People are loving each other. The president has come to remind us that we are a nation who cares and he came as a father. I am a father and a grandfather. I have called my children and i want to know how they are doing with their children. As we come together, we do the best that we can at a sad time like this. 
>> I suppose the big question is why would this shooter do what he did? Go to a classroom and murder so many young children of such a young tender age, possibly the classroom that his mother was already killed at their home. Can you try to piece from your experience the thought process here? Why he would then having killed his mother go to the school and do what he did? 
>> I don't have a crystal ball and I haven't diagnosed or assessed him. People with mental illness are not more violent. That's nt the case. Simply not the data we have. If indeed mental illness is a part of this, there is a particular path that needs to be looked at. Are they depressed and suicidally depressed. His roommate alex israel said he preferred to stay alone. A symptom of asperger's and report that came out which may or may not be true, there is a capacity for empathy and social connection that leaves the person suffering for this condition. They are prone to serious depression and anxiety. If they are suicidally depressed, we don't know enough. What I am trying to do in agreeing to come here is to ask people to don't rush to judgment about who this young man is. If it was mental illness that played a role, it's an opportunity for us to do better. 

[00:28:49]


>> There is a school that you shouldn't give him attention and name him and so on because it brings attention to him. He's dead so he won't be able to bask in the appalling glory of what he did, but secondly these young men. 
>> You are making that assumption. We don't know that. I spend many hours with men like this who killed dozens of people. They don't necessarily want glory. They are seriously ill. Others who do want glory. You are rushing to a particular interpretation of this. It's way too soon to know. 
>> Sorry. 
>> I would like to endorse that also. I know for the whole country, we really want to know why this happened. When you are a parent you can't stop thinking about these questions that you are asking. We have to be very careful in answering them. When you mentioned that we had several similar cases recently, yes, these were similar in that guns were used and they were spree killings and mass killings. I can tell you as a medical doctor and psychiatrist who worked closely on cases, there were different motives and mentalities. There people who don't have a conscious. They torture animals. They have no basis in their mind for empathy or sympathy. They learn how to fake it. One of the columbine killers fit that pattern, but the other was different. He was not a psychopath. In the case of the aurora shooter, the jury is not in yet, but I have a feeling we will find he was on the verge of major mental illness about delusions and hallucinations. One time in my life I was responsible for the federal program of mental health services in america. I have to admit we failed. We failed america in protecting the lives of the seriously mentally ill. Most of what they do is suffer in silence. Their families want to do better by them and as a country we have not stepped up and been sympathetic and caring and appropriate for the seriously mentally ill. 

[00:31:19]


>> An extremely important point. What I was going to say is you both have made extremely valid points. You have three successive appalling mass shootings INVOLVING YOUNG MEN IN THEIR 20s Where the background to all of them was not dissimilar. They seem to be fairly normal kind oflightly off, but nothing with alarm bells. The point of examining their character is that there must be a good likelihood that there others like that out there who may be considering similar atrocities. How do people who know these types of people spot any warning signs? 
>> Piers -- 
>> let me start with the doctor. 
>> I'm sorry. I have three small children. Before this interview they asked me what I was doing and we talked about this for about an hour and a half. My 9-year-old got frightened, he goes to elementary school. I explained to himhat these things are exceedingly rare. Let's not forget, this is exceedingly rare. Just because something happened in the last month doesn't statistically make it a common occurrence. Let's be clear and tell our children that. This is an opportunity to turn tragedy into an opportunity to fix some of the things that are terribly broken in our mental health care system and know how to identify people at risk for violence. It's all at the level of state funding. Sorry about get get into the specifics, but it's mental health care and screening of not only young adults and children who offer a good assessment, we can in fact do a much better job of not only caring for the people and identify those who would never be violent if not for a mental illness. That is one bit of the story. There is another part which is what I think that most people are more familiar with and interested in because of movies. The diabolical sociopath. Both stories are true, but both are actually quite rare. 

[00:33:31]


>> The final word, make it brief if you may. 
>> America has more gun deaths than any other advanced nation in the world. We have laws that say if you are seriously mentally ill, you shouldn't possess a weapon and we don't enforce the laws. We have to get together across this divide and need the nra to step up and say they believe in gun safety and not just in gun ownership. We need politicians on both sides of the aisle to tackle this problem. We will have more dead american children. 
>> Thank you both very much. Still ahead, we will talk to survivors of another shooting, but next the push for more gun control after the tragedy. mike. to? Oh, just diagramming this accident WITH MY State Farm POCKET AGENT APP. You can also get a quote and pay your premium with this thing. I THOUGHT State Farm DIDN'T HAVE ALL THOSE Apps? Where did you hear that? The internet. And you believed it? Yeah. They can't put anything on the internet that isn't true. Where did you hear that? 
[ Both ] THE INTERNET. Oh look. Here comes my date. I met him on the internet. He's a french model. Uh, bonjour. 
[ Male Announcer ] State Farm. More mobile than ever. Get to a better state. @@ 

[00:37:17]


>>> these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods. These children are our children. We are going to have to coming to and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this regardless of the toll picks. 
>> President obama on the shooting. The massacre is raising new questions about the access of guns in america. He is urgently calling for more gun control. A former chief economist on the sentencing commission on more guns, less crime. The president of the campaign to prevent gun violence. The attorney for the michigan and responsible gun owners. Let's start with you. You were pretty outspoken saying this is time to bring in new gun control laws. 
>> Yes. If this doesn't wake us up, i don't know what will. I was heartened that the president said we had to take meaningful action and the only thing he can do is lead a crusade for reasonable gun control legislation in congress. These massacres are taking place more and more often. We saw bay the way today a similar incident in china where a mad man attacked an elementary school in china with a knife with 22 injured children. Not dead. That's the difference. In the uted states we have 9,000 people killed with guns last year in similar countries like germany, 170 and canada 150. There is a reason for that. 
>> What would you like to see in terms of specific gun control? 
>> There a number of pieces of legislation we have been pushing. No reasonable gun owner who is a sportsman can object to bans on assault weapons made only to kill as many human beings as possible like in a mitary situation. No one can object to a ban on the sale of large ammunition clips so you can't reload. No one can objec microstamping of card ridges to trace the murder weapon. No one can object to eliminating the gunshot exception so even if you buy a gun at a gun show, they still have to check your background to make sure they are not selling to someone on a terrorist watch list or mentally unstable person or a felon. Those ares we should do. 

[00:39:48]


>> We had a heated debate on a previous incident. Two things happened in 1996. There was a mass kerr in taz mania in which 35 people were killed. The australians was right wing and friends of george w. Bush and brought in draconian laws after that. He brought in rifles and shotguns. As a result of the next decade, firearm homicide rate fell by 59% and suicide rate fell by 65%. 
>> Not true. 
>> It is true. 
>> No, it's not. If you look overtime -- 
>> it is true. 
>> I'm telling you people can look it up themselves. What you find is for decades the murder rate was falling in australia. It basically stopped falling. If you compare the average o two decades where it's falling to what it was afterwards, it makes it look like the average before is higher than afterwards. If you look on a year by year basis, there wasn't that fall. 
>> Why does adam lanza mother need to have these three weapons? 
>> Can I follow-through on the australiaia thing? 
>> No, why does she need to have these three weapons performed including this semi automatic bush master. Why would a woman teacher at a kindergarten need these women ons in her home? Allowing therefore a clearly deranged son to take them and commit this atrocity? 
>> Whatever that gun looks like, it's a semi automatic rifle. Any hunting rifle is semi automatic. Doesn't mean it functions differently. He fired over 100 rounds in several minutes with this apparently harmless rifle. 
>> Guns make it easy. 
>> You are trying to say it's an average gun. He fired over 100 rounds and killed 20 children. 20 children between 5 and 10. What point do you say we get it? It's time for change? 

[00:41:54]


>> It is time. 
>> Time to do what? 
>> To get rid of the gun laws that cause -- 
>> to get rid of what? 
>> Look at what happened. All the attack this is year occurred where guns are banned. Look at the aurora shooting. 
>> What the hell has that got to do with it? Seriously. What has that got to do with it? 
>> You never let me explain. Can I say something? 
>> Is it a gun-free zone. 
>> Look at the movie theater one. There were seven movie theaters showing the movie within a 20 minute drive of where the killer lived. Only one of those banned guns. He didn't go close toast his home or with the largest screen. He went to the one movie theater that banned guns. If you look at bans generally, you can't point to a place, chicago, d.C. Where we ban guns and murder rates and violent crimes went up. In the uk in jamaica and ireland, island nations that banned guns, you can't find a place where murder rates have gone down. They have gone up usually by large amounts. 
>> You cannot find a place -- 
>> let me bring in. 
>> First of all, basically every statistic that john cited is pure bunk in terms of the fact that the more guns equal -- that's true. They were gun-free zones, but attributing that to the fact that this violence occurred, that's where I have to step in. Listen, my brother was shot in a shooting on top of the empire state building which was chaotic. I know firsthand I talked with the victims from the aurora tragedy. To a person, they all say if there were another person armed, it would have led to more carnage. Excuse me. I let you talk, let me finish. Let me finish. If every one of the cases they say if there were more guns, it would have only led to more chaos. At the empire building shooting in new york. There were highly trained officers in the chaos and eight other people shot and every one was an innocent civilian and every one was shot by a law enforcement officer. 

[00:44:10]


>> We have the attorney for the responsible gun owners. You believe that there should be more guns in schools. Snart? 
>> I believe those of us who are licensed to carry are responsible people and shouldn't be prohibited from carrying in schools or other places. In fact, the michigan legislature passed a bill last night and sent to the government for signature a bill that would allow those of us who are licensed to take more day of training including range time and be able to carry in the places where we couldn't carry before. 
>> Why on earth would you want more guns in schools after what happened today? 
>> Here's why, piers. If we could suddenly make all guns disappear, I would have a different position. I spend a lot of time thinking about this and reading about this. I teach a class called gun control seminar and I get a new group every time and we discuss this in detail. The simple facts are guns exist. THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY 1800s Technology. Semi automobiles were in the LATE 1800s. They are easy to make and last several human lifetimes with minimal maintenance. Since guns exist and we know for a exact that the only way to stop an evil person like the person you were discussing earlier in the show is to shoot them. 
>> This is exactly the argument I have been hearing ever since i joined cnn. I joined on air about a week after gabby giffords the congresswoman was shot in the head. Ever since then, we have the sikh temple and aurora and the shopping mall and so on and so on. The argument I keep hearing if everybody was was armed, it wouldn't happen. It's hog wash, isn't it? If everyone in that movie theater had guns, more people would have been killed in the mayhem that erupted. 
>> The people that stopped the attacks. 

[00:46:14]


>>> Can I just -- 
>> the prove in the pudding. You don't see other shootings at gun shows or -- 
>> they have reasonable laws and they have 100 people a year not 9,000 or 10,000 a year. 
>> Listen -- 
>> it was lower before gun control. 
>> They got the gun zoel. 
>> Almost zero crime. 
>> The gun control doesn't change it. 
>> Scotland in 1996 there was a similar school shooting. Just an awful situation. 16 young children killed exactly as they were today. As a result of this, they brought in a hand gun ban. 162,000 hand guns were handed in. It is time for this. 
>> Listen -- 
>> murder rates went up. 
>> There about 35 murders a year. There 12,000 murders a year from guns in this country. When are you guys going to focus on that and stop telling me the answer is more guns. It is not the answer. 
>> After the ban, it was higher than it was before the ban. 
>> You want more guns and not less? 300 million guns in america is not enough for you? How many more kids have to die before you guys say we want less guns and not more? 
>> He asked me a question. 
>> Let him answer the question. 
>> Imupset that the gun control laws you are pushing have killed people. 
>> That is non--y is sense. Nonsense. Average of 35 killings in britain a gleer a place of banned hand guns. Here no bans and 12,000 people a year die from gun murders. 
>> You have to understand you ban them -- 
>> I have been debating this all week with the shopping mall shooting and months if not two years. Am so frustrated and furious for these kids who are being blown away again with legally acquired weapons. Some boy who has problems takes his mother's three weaponu including this ridiculous assault rifle and goes in the school and kills these kids and you guys still want to tell me the answer is more guns? It is madness! 

[00:48:44]


>> How else can you stop someone from shooting people. What are we most angry about? Every poll shows by massive majorities americans agree with what you said. Yet we have a lobby. The leadership who function as leaders who are enablers of mass murder. Political people and even though polling shows that most nra members would support reasonable gun controls, they come in and lie and say they will take your guns away and stop any legislation to prevent that. 
>> Let's talk about enabling. 
>> Nobody needs one of these in their home. End of story. 
>> I have to say something. 
>> The encouraging thing and what you should take inspiration because we are all frustrated and outraged. This conversation and what these guys are saying does not represent what the american public wants and the conversation that the american public wants to have. We are all in favor of things like criminal background checks. 74% of nra members are and most gun sales do not require a background check. Things that we can do. 
>> It's not as they try to tell me an anti-american thing to say I respect the second amendment and I respect the right second amendment. I don't respect the right for families to load their homes with these so a disturbed kid can take them and something into a school. 
>> The second amendment is nos at polarized as this gentleman is saying. 
>> This will continue next week. Come next week when you have time to think about this you have to change your thinking. The gun lobby has to change its thinking. 
>> Why do all of these -- 
>> we'll leave it there. Coming next, survivors from other mass shootings share their thoughts on today's appalling massacre. 

[00:52:43]


>>> The most disturbing issues from the shooting, police officers escorting schoolchildren from the school. Another picture from the mass shooting in 1999. We have a victim of the shooting, joins me now. And we have another jcc survivor, and a suror of the tragedy in aurora, and the brother of a shooting at the empire state building. This must have brought back awful memories for you today, as it does I would imagine whenever there is a mass shooting in america. What were your feelings? 
>> It's -- it's impossible to put words to what I really feel. It's a mixture of sympathy and disgust. And my heart goes out to those families and there are people who have gone through the same thing and who understand what are you going through, and immediately what I thought was just that I wish that there was something I could do to help them. But, iou know, in reality, it's a helpless situation. 
>> Mindy, you survived what happened to you. When you hear the raging gun debate, which will be particularly vociferous in light of this appalling act today. Do you think that tougher laws should be brought in to try and do something about this? 

[00:54:58]


>> You know, I do. I think josh and I and everyone in our community in this weird family we have, survivors of gun violence, wishes the dayfter what happened to them, nobody else has to go through it. Unfortunately, 13.5 years later, we're sitting here watching these tragedies unfold on a daily basis. 
>> You were 16 at the time of the shooting. Obviously, a lot of kids at the school today will be much younger than that, and they will have either lost friends or people they knew at the school it will be very difficult for them when they have to go back. What advice would you give them? What is the best way to try and deal with this? Best served for their parents. What do you think? 
>> You know, to be honest, it's heartbreaking. Because they are not going to know really what or how to feel until five, ten years from now, when it actually keeps haunting them and nightmares and fears that keep coming up. Josh can speak to that himself, he was six years old at the time, and, you know, now he's in HIS 20s AND IT HAUNTS HIM EVERY Day. I was 16, I knew why I was shot. I knew somebody tried to kill me, and every day, my entire life, I'm almost 30 years old, I'm haunted. There is nothing I can say to them that I am so, so sorry they have to go through this, and i really truly hope something will be done after today, because we cannot stand for this anymore. 
>> Steven barton, you survived the aurora massacre a few months ago, a huge outcry then and people promised to do all sorts of things, politician mouths the usual rhetoric, absolutely nothing happened, and lo and behold, here we are with an even worse tragedy. More dead, and this time, 20 young kids. What are your views about the debate that will now unfold on this? 
>> I mean, I think the president said we need a meaningful action now, and he said that in the past, and so I'll be waiting for that action. It's a shame that 20 children have to be slain for us to even start talking about this. But I really think that the american public is fed up with the lack of conversation on this issue. 

[00:57:11]


>> And there will be more mass shootings in the last five or six years and in the previous four decades in terms of the particularly appalling ones. And yet you keep being told, well, not as bad as it seems. The situation, but it truly is. Since I've been here, I've been utterly horrified, why I get so animated when I debate it on t show. I come from a country where this would be unthinkable. Movie theaters, shopping malls, kindergarten classrooms would be shot down in an indiscriminate way on a bimonthly basis. I don't get why americans aren't far more angry. 
>> It's one thing for a politician to take action, but it's equally important that the american public demands these reforms, these changes, and the polling is clear. Support for common sense gun reform. 82 percent gun owners support universal background checks. It's a failure of the system we haven't arrived at that point yet. 
>> Paula, your brother was killed in the empire state building shooting. You believe in the right to own a handgun and a referendum wasn't needed. 
>> I think today a erendum is needed. As a father, innocent children, I see the heart break, we have to go back to that. We have 20 families, 26 families that are devastated right now, while we're having this debate. That's something we have to focus on. This is about gun control, about mental illness and a combination. Got to be all groups that come together. 
>> It includes violent video games, hollywood movies. 
>> Gun violence culture in america. 
>> It has got to be tackled, and all areas. A proper debate. My argument is, politicians here don't want to have this debate. 

[00:59:14]


>> Well, they have to. They have to. You have to have a congressman like jerry nadler on today, you have to have a republican congressman step up, get together. This has to be taken care of, we can't talk about it anymore, we have to start doing things in america. 
>> Listen, thank you all for joining me. All in your own way have been through horror stories of your own. It is time. President obama talked in a moving and emotional way. It's time for action. Time that america's politicians just did something. Stop worrying about the gun lobby who make millions, billions out of this trade in what often leads to appalling death it is time for some moral conviction and some moral

=======================================================

Occurred here, as you know, there are a number of victims, teachers, support personnel in the building. Children, beautiful, beautiful children who had simply come to school to learn and their day ended a very different way than any of us possibly could have imagined. Quite frankly, as we stand here today, still can't imagine what traps pyred there. . 
>> Evil visited this community today. And it's too early to speak of recovery. But each parent, each sibling each member of the family has to understand that connecticut, we're all in this together. We'll do whatever we can to overcome this event. We will get through it. But this is a terrible time for this community and for these families. Our police personnel and others are doing the utmost to clear this situation as soon as possible and to return these children to their parents or these loved ones to their fellow loved ones as quickly as possible. And we'll wk with all of the residents of this community and connecticut to make sure that we do, in fact, get through this. I was mayor of stanford on 9/11 when our state lost many of its citizens and I lost a number of my fellow citizens and friends. I never thought that in a public career that I would have to face these kinds of circumstances or that they would visit themselves upon this community or the people of connecticut. We'll get through this. And our prayers at this time have to go out to the families. So as I began by thanking those who have expressed their desires to be helpful, the number one way to be helpful is to say a prayer or send a best wish or to be thinking of these individuals who have suffered so mightily today. Thank you. 

[00:03:07]


>> Our hearts are broken. Those -- 
>> hi, I'm al sharpton. This is "politics nation." We're monitoring this live press conference from officials in connecticut. We're going to listen in. Let's go live now to chris jansing in newtown, connecticut. 
>> Hello, reverend al. I can tell you that governor malloy just made brief remarks here at the community gathering spot. He walked by me and seemed to be having difficulty holding back tears. This is a community -- really a nation -- that is trying to make sense of the senseless and the unspeakable violence that happened here in newtown today. 26 people killed inside an elementary school. The mother of the shooter now found at his home here in newtown. And we are just all asking the question why? There is an international gathering, literally scores of satellite trucks here. We know the basic facts of what happened. That the shooter came in early this morning after 9:00 and opened fire. We have heard the terrible stories about the children who were told to close their eyes and hold hands as they left that school building. But we still don't know a motive for this. And that is really the question that everyone is asking. And a little later on, about almost a little less than an hour from now, there are going to be three memorial services at local churche here where the community will have a chance to gather. Many of the parents have spent much of this day together. They were gathered in the local fire house. And that is a place where the governor went and had to deliver to many of them the tragic news that they had not been reunited with their child, that they had not survived this day. And we are told that the school, reverend al, will remain an active crime scene until sunday. 

[00:05:18]


>> So some of the parents did not know what the condition of their child or that their child had been one of the -- that had been fatally killed until the governor informed them a little while ago. 
>> You can just imagine how chaotic this scene was. I mean, you have 600, 700 students inside a school. You have a reverse 9-1-1 call that is going out. You have parents descending on the scene. I can tell you several hours later when I was driving to the school, how backed up the traffic was. It wasn't easy to get to the school. Once you got there, obviously, it was utter and complete chaos. There were so many emergency vehicles there. Just community people coming to the scene as well as parents coming to the scenetrying to make those positive identifications. Getting the children, getting an id, literally, a physical id from the parent, not allowing the child to go until they could confirm that it was with the person they should be with. I can tell you that they were able to confirm several hours ago that every child had been acounted for. Obviously, there's a point at which you want to know what kids might have called in sick that cay. What kids might be somewhere else. It takes several hours in a situation like this. Yes, the parents who had not been reunited with their children were pretty much all gathered together in the fire house and you can just imagine what it was like inside there for those parents who have gotten the worst news you can possibly get. And for the governor who was in there doing his best trying to console them. And, as I said to you, the look on his face as he walked by me just a few minutes ago, said it all. It's expressed the faces of so many people I have seen here in the few hours since I've arrived. It's just a tragedy that is beyond words. 
>> Could you standby for one minute, chris? Joining me now on the phone is rabbi shaul praver. He's been with families at the fire house that chris just referred to that has served as a kind of staging area. Rabbi, what's the scene been like there today? 

[00:07:32]


>> It's a horrible, horrible day in newto. Every parent's worst nightmare came true today. And we're just getting news now of other children that didn't make it. And these are children that are so loved by their parents, so innocent and their death is so senseless. 
>> This is an elementary school. We're talking about children between 5 and 10 years old, rabbi, am I correct? 
>> That's correct. 
>> Wow. This -- and I mean, this is an awesome, awesomely painful day for the parents. And you're trying to comfort them. Do we know any kind of details about the adults? And have we been able to confirm any of the reports about the numbers? We have 20 children, I believe, and six adults? 
>> I don't really have firsthand knowledge about that. All I know is that I received a call from monsignor robert weiss. They called from the office and all the clergy were asked to go to the fire house. So whatever -- I really don't have firsthand information to that question. 
>> In the fire house are parents who basically some of have been there much of the day basically waiting and waiting and finally have gotten the news that their child was one of those that was killed. Can you tell me the scene inside as a faith leader, what you've tried to do to minister these families? 
>> Yes. Some of the parents looked shocked. And you really have to draw them out. They were emotionless. And other parents were the opposite. And they were, you know, wailing. And we were hoping to get some good news from the governor at 3:00. But that didn't come to pass. And so that's when, you know, the wailing really started. And the work for all of the counselors and the clergy, you know, began. And people just didn't know what to -- you know what to do with themselves. It's very -- it's very sad scene. Everybody's crying. Even the people -- the policemen and the rabbi and the pastors, you know, it was really a tough, tough scene. 

[00:10:16]


>> And I understand there's a memorial service tonight? 
>> Yeah, several of the churches are having memorial services this evening. Monsignor bob weiss said we're going to have a community-wide memorial service at the high school, if it's cleared. So that's not a conclusive piece of information. That's just something that we'd like to see happen. 
>> And I emphasize. We're talking about 5 to 10-year-olds. This is incredibly painful. 
>> Well, what happened was that the -- it was mostly the first graders. And their classroom was near the principal's office. And the principal and the school psychologist were, you know, killed execution style. And then they went to the first classroom, which, unfortunately, was the first graders. No these are people we know and love. You know, we've seen them. We've partied with them on holidays and so these parents had the pictures of their kids, you know. This was a bad day. 
>> Rabbi, you said the principal and the school psychologist were killed execution style. And then they proceeded to the next classroom, which were first graders? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> When you say execution style, what do you mean? And how do you know this? 
>> Well, they entered -- they were allowed into the -- now, i don't know this firsthand from seeing it, but from speaking with the people that did see it -- 
>> right. 
>> These were children of a teacher in the school. And so they were recognized, they were known. And so they were allowed in. Well, the one fellow was in. I'm not sure about the other one. There's conflicting information about that. But certainly one of them was allowed in and came into the principal's office and killed the principal and the school psychologist. 

[00:12:29]


>> So, by what you've been told, the one young man killed the principal and the school psychologist in the principal's office execution style first and then proceeded into the classroom where the first graders were? 
>> That's what I was told by first responders, correct. 
>> It's unbelievable. Do we know whether the young man's mother was in the classroom? You say he was one of the teacher's sons? 
>> I'm not sure. I don't think that was in the classroom, but she was killed by her son. 
>> At the school? 
>> At the school. 
>> Rabbi praver, thank you and god bless you for being there and your work and aum you've done today. I'll throw in some prayers with you and the families. Let me go back to chris janson. 
>> I do want to update something because there had been reporting that the shooter was killed at the school. In fact, that was reported for several hours. Officials tell us that is not true. That she was found at his home, which is here in newtown. 26 people were killed at the scene by the shooter. 20 children, ages 5-10 as well as six adults. The only one that has been confirmed by police among the adults is the principal who we are told in just the last year had instituted a new security system at the school. And so we -- you have to understand it. It's the scene in there by everyone who has seen it, described it as just a horror. 
>> So let me -- 
>> they have not positively identified any of the bodies. I just want to make sur that we're clear, that no one has been positively identified. They have said that the principal is among the victims. 
>> But this is very important, chris. You're saying the mother was not at the school. They found her body at her son's home, dead. 
>> That's right. That's right. And, again, that had been misreported. And we were told that it was in her classroom where -- there are two runs. What the police have told us is that the shooting was in one area of the school building and took place in two different rooms. One of them was believed to be the classroom of his mother, but his mother was not there. She was at his home and that's where she was found. That's what nbc news has been able to confirm. 

[00:14:56]


>> Is it believed, then, chris, that his mother he had already killed before he went to the school? 
>> Yes, it does look like that. That is the timeline, reverend. That he was first at home, that his mother was killed. He went to the school and 26 people there were killed before he turned the gun on himself. 
>> Well, chris, thank you for your reporting tonight. 
>> Thank you, reverend. 
>> More on this terrible, unspeakable tragedy in connecticut ahead. 
>> We heard banging and the teacher locked the doors and we all went behind -- we all went over to a corner and the teacher asked us -- all the police officers had machine guns. One of the first grade teachers died.

>>> An unthinkable tragedy. A random, mass shooting that killed 20 kids and six adults at an elementary school. Nobody would imagine a kindergarten classroom could be the scene of such terror, such tragedy. Here's what we know. Nbc news is now identifying the gunman as 20-year-old adam lanza, who lived in newtown, connecticut area. Shots were heard at sandy hook elementary in newtown, connecticut around 9:30 this morning. Lanza was reportedly armed with two handguns, dressed in dark clothing, a mask and a vest. 20 young children and six adults were killed before turning a gun on himself. The investigation is unfolding rapidly at this hour. Joining me now is cl van zandt, a former f.B.I. Profiler and an nbc news analyst. Clint, thanks for being here tonight. 

[00:20:47]


>> Good to be with you, al. 
>> What are officials doing right now to try to advance this investigation? What are they looking for? 
>> Al, as you know, they've got multiple crime scenes. They've got to horrific scene at the school where every law enforcement officer, the first responder goes in, I'm sure the tendency breaks down in tears because that could be their children or grandchildren. You've got that crime scene they have to deal with. And then you've got the separate crime scene of the victim's mother's home where we're told that she was shot in the face and killed. We've got that crime scene. And then you've got any location where the subject may have lived with roommates, his vehicle and law enforcement also has a race going on, al. And that race says make sure there's not any other event. We know, for example, that the connecticut state police bomb squad was going to each location to make sure there hadn't been an explosive device, a bomb, set off. We had to check each of those locations. We have to go through the social media, the e-mails that the shooting suspect had, talk to his family members. Al, we need to make sure there's not someone else involved in this or there's not another shoe set to crop before law enforcement considers this case put together. 
>> Could I ask you to standby, clint, for just a second? We'll come right back to you. Joining me now on the phone is cathy sweeney. Her grandson was at the school today. Ms. Sweeney, how is your grandson doing tonight? 
>> He's doing okay. I don't think it has set in yet. 
>> Can you tell me what he has told you? Where was he and what did he hear or witness? 
>> He was in the computer room and they were told to get under the computers, the p.A. System was on and he said that he heard the gunshots and they were told to get under the computers. And then he said that they were supposed to close their eyes and they made their way up to the fire house that's right across the street. 

[00:23:13]


>> Now, how old is your grandson? 
>> Agt. 
>> Eight years old. They were told over the p.A. System they could hear the gunshots and they were told to close their eyes and led out by teachers, finally to the fire house, to safety. Eight-year-old children, som older, some younger. 
>> Yes. 
>> Did he give you an idea of how many children were in the computer room with him? 
>> No. I haven't been asking him a lot of questions. I figure when he's ready to really talk about it -- 
>> yes. I can imagine that this was an unimaginable day for you and other families waiting to see who and among the children had been armed and who among the children survived. This must be a day that no one could even imagine possible. 
>> Yeah, it was just horrific. And I just found out that a neighbor, who I don't really know, but that lives on the street behind us lost a child. 
>> Oh, my god. The community, I'm sure, still in shock. But, okay, can you share with us who your grandson was seeing was the ones guiding them out of the computer room telling them to close their eyes? Were these teachers? 
>> Yes, it was a teacher. 
>> So we actually had teachers today who had to actually save lives and keep traumatized children going. I mean, the teachers in this school had to really become almost the -- an unbelievable task of trying to save lives while they're concerned about their own safety at the same time. 
>> That's right. That's very right. And I know a teacher, caitlin roy, hid her kids, locked her kids in the bathroom so that they could not be harmed. 
>> So this one teacher, you know, locked her children -- her students, not her own children, her students. 

[00:25:14]


>> Her first grade class. 
>> A first grade class, locked them in the bathroom at the school to protect them so they would not be harmed. 
>> That's true. 
>> Wow. 
>> The young people -- give us a sense of the neighborhood, the community that your grandson and these young stunts live in. 
>> Well, we, in particular, lif in a woodsey area. 
>> Right. But this is not the kind of community -- it's not a high-crime community. It's one of the most unlikeliest kind of communities to face this kind of situation. Not like anything like this is likely. But I'm saying, this is even more stunning in a cmunity reich newtown? 
>> Oh, it's -- sandy hook, in and of itself, is a one-stop light town. Nobody can believe it. My daughter and I don't have any tears left. We're just trying to get ahold of our thoughts. I had to go back and get my car. And still, the police activity and the helicopters, everybody is still there. 
>> Do you or anyone you know or may have spoken with today, are any of you -- are you familiar with the teacher who they says son is the one that was the gunman here? 
>> I'm sorry? 
>> Do you know the teacher? The mother of the gunman that they say is a teacher at the school? Or anyone that said today that knew this lady? 
>> No, I don't know. 
>> Okay. Well, ms. Sweeney, we certainly hope and pray that your grandson and all of the children that survived go through a real period of recovery. This is certainly something that is going to take a long time for recovery and the dealing with how they were traumatized and certainly the pain and loss of those family members are in the prayers of this nation and all of us here. Thank you for coming to the phone and talking with us tonight. 

[00:27:23]


>> Thank you so much. I know we're doing a lot of praying ourselves. 
>> Well, we will certainly be joining you in those prayers. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Let me go back to clint van zandt in washington, former f.B.I. Profiler. Clint what have you heard -- what about that you've already heard as a profiler would give you some areas that you would start pursuing? Is the fact that he apparently or allegedly killed his mother and then went to the school, does that tell us anything? The fact that he was -- we were told dressed in dark clothing with a mask, does that tell us anything? Give us some ideas of what a profiler would start piecing together even as early as this to start looking to bring us to other pieces of evidence that could kind of put together pieces of what was going on in this maniacal mind? 
>> Well, al, in some ways, this is a copy cat crime. If you and I think of this week that took place in a portland, oregon mall, if we think of it as a shooting that took place in aurora, each time, individuals are wearing black, multiple magazines. Thhooter in 2007 carried two handguns. These individuals, number one, in some cases, are dressing like they're some type of a combat character or something. But they're going to combat against totally defenseless people. Al, you know, this takes us back to september, 2004 in russia when, as you remember, terrorists went in and took over a school. 385 children skilled, 785 wounded. But what's important, as you just said, too, that this individual killed his mother at her home and then went to the school and then allegedly killed children that were in the classroom that she taught. Al, this is someone who not only wiped out his mot which is a tremendous taboo for any society. But then he went to the school, I believe, al, he went to the school looking for those children because that's who his mother loved. Those children were part of him. They were part of her. She was part of them. And by -- al, by killing those children, he killed an extension of his mother. And this is as bad, I think, as we've seen in this country. And we've seen some terrible situations. 

[00:30:16]


>> We're told by the rabbi, and, of course, none of this is confirmed, let me be clear, but we're told by the rabbi that he was told that the gunman came in and first killed the principal and the school psychologist execution style. And then proced next door to the first classroom, first grade classroom, and killed the children. We assume having already killed the mother. So there's a direct line here if what we're being told proves to be true from mother to principal to children. This profiler, where would you start putting pieces together to find out what this all means? 
>> Well, number one, you know, you have to begin with the premise that this individual had some significant mental health challenges, issues. Was he being treated? We're told the two hguns were purr kwhased by his mother. Did she actually buy these weapons for him because perhaps at his age, he couldn't buy them? Or were these family guns he couldn't get his hands on. But, al, this goes past any issues about gun control, magazines, weapons. It gos into how do we deal with individuals with mental health issues and how do we teach people conflict resolution skills so that they don't feel that society owes them a living. If life doesn't work out the way they want it to, that I had either strikeout against innocent civilians u like we've seen today, or in this terrible case, his mother and young infants, young children, who couldn't have done anything to this guy what so ever, except perhaps showing him what potential looks like. 
>> Clint van zandt, thank you very much. A former f.B.I. Profiler. 

[00:32:28]


>> I could try to explain it, but I'm sure I would fail. There's no words -- there is no words that I could come up with that would everyone come close describing the sheer terror of hearing that your son is in a place or your child is in a place where there's been violence. You don't know the details of that violence. You don't know the condition of your child. And you can't do anything to immediately help them or protect them. It is a powerless and terrifying experience. 

[00:36:35]


>>> Just by being with everybody else is the only way you can get the strength to carry on. To try to comprehend what's going on. I've taught here over 40 years. I've been blessed to know a lot of children. And it's just -- I know some of them I'm not going to see anymore. 
>> We're back with our breaking news coverage of the tragedy in newtown, connecticut. Joining me now is reverend matthew craigden, senior pastor with the newtown congregational church where they will hold a memorial service in just a few minutes. Reverend, thaurng for joining me. 
>> Of course. 
>> How is the congregation doing right now? 
>> I think our congregation like many people -- or all the people in newtown are feeling just the devastation and shock of these events and are trying to comprehend them and just deal with unimaginable loss and tragedy. 
>> Do you know, personally, any of the parents? Any of those that are involved? And have fell victimized in this amazing day? 
>> Parents who have lost children? 
>> Yes. 
>> Yes. None of the families who, as far as we can ascertain, none of the families that were -- that have lost children are a part of our congregation. We do, of course, have ripple effects of relationships and contacts and relationships with people. Everybody is feeling the effects. I was over there with the clergy for much of the day, my fellow clergy here in newtown of all kinds and all churches and all congregations trying to administer and care for and listen to those who are having to face this and live through this tragedy. In all of the different ways, but especially to those who have lost loved ones. 
>> Reverend matthew, thank you for coming on tonight. 

[00:38:40]


>> Several hundred people came together outside of the white house today for a candle light vigil in honor of the victims in newtown, connecticut and the tragedy there. More on our coverage next.

>>> we're back with our continuing coverage of the horrific tragedy at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. This is the front page on newspapers and web sites across the country today. Children and tears being led to safety. We're still absorbing the shock of what happened to children today. 
>> We heard, like, shots. And everybody went on the ground and ms. Martin just closed the door and we went to the corner. 
>> I was in the gym and I heard a loud -- well, I heard, like, seven loud booms and the gym teachers told us to go in the corner. So we all huddled. And I kept hearing these booming noises. 
>> We heard banging and the teacher locked the doors and we all went behind -- we all went over to a corner and the teacher was supposed to keep us complicated. All of the police officers had machine guns. One of the first grade teachers died. 
>> The older brother of one of child survivors described want his little sister saw inside the school. 
>> The intercom came on and there were screams. The school went on lockdown. And based on what she said, the shooter was in another class and they were all in a closet. They were telling the children to hold hands and close their eyes until they were outside. 

[00:43:35]


>> Every day, teachers educate our children in schools across meshlg. Today, those teachers were saving lives. President obama, a leader known for controlling his emotions, addressed the tragedy late this afternoon from the white house. 
>> We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. And each time I learn the news, I react not as a president, but as anybody else would. As a parntd. And that was especially true today. I know there's not a parent in americaho doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years olds. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today. For the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children and for the families of the adults who were lost, our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors, as well. For as blessed as they are to have their children home tot, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early. And there are no words that will ease their pain. As a country, we have been through this too many times. 

[00:45:40]


>> The president expressing the pain and heart ache of an entire nation. For more on the investigation, i want to bring an nbc justice correspondent pete williams. Pete, good evening. 
>> Al, good evening to you. The bare details are starting to emerge here now. The authorities tell us that the gunman in this school shooting is a 20-year-old who lived in newtown, connecticut. Adam lanza who lived with his mother who was a teacher at the school. And, as best authorities are able to piece together what happened, this is the picture that is emerging. That early this morning he shot his mother at the home where the two of them lived together. Then got in her car with guns that she had legally purchased, that were registered to her, drove in her car to the school, entered thechool at about 9:30. Started shoot first in the principal's area. And then as authorities have said, in two classrooms, including, we believe, one of the classrooms where his mother taught, which was predominantly young people. Kindergarten age. After shooting them, he then turned the gun on himself. Now, there was some confusion earlier today about the identity of the person who had committed this horrible act. Because, apparently, authorities say adam lanza was carrying the id of his brother. So there was initial confusion about who the shooter was. Now we're told it was adam lanza. And his brother td authorities that his brother has a history of mental problems. So authorities are relly satisfied tonight that the young man, adam lanza, was solely responsible for the shooting. He's the one who planned it. He's the one who carried it out. They don't believe that anyone else was involved. They believe that the firearms were legally purchased, but they still have no idea of the simple question that everybody wants to know. Why? Why would he shoot his mother? Why would he then, after doing that, go to the school and continue this horrible act, one of the worst mass shootings in u.S. History. 

[00:47:54]


>> Now, we're told the brother mentioned mental illness? 
>> That's right. Said that his brother had a history of mental conditions. He lives in hoboken, new jersey. We don't know what the nature of that illness is. And, of course, you know, the young man did not purchase the gun his mother did. But even if he had tried to purchase them himself, merely having medical problems wouldn't stop him. You have to be found mentally ineffective by a judge. That's the term of art that's found in the federal statute. But, in any event, it was his mother who purchased the guns. 
>> We do not know if his mother and he lived alone? Was it just the two of them? 
>> We believe they were divorced. That the father was not living there. And I don't know whether anyone was living in the house in addition to adam lanza and his mother. 
>> We were told he was dressed in dark clothing and wearing a mask. Can you confirm that, pete? 
>> I've not heard anything about a mask, but I am told he was dressed all in black, that eegt reelgt. 
>> Nbc, pete williams, thank you for your reporting tonight. 
>> You bet. 
>> More on this terrible tragedy in connecticut ahead. Don't go over 2000... 1200 calories a day. Carbs are bad. Carbs are good. The story keeps changing. So I'm not listening... To anyone but myself. I know better nutrition when I see it: Great grains. Great grains cereal starts whole and stays whole. See the seam? More processed flakes look nothing like natural grains. You can't argue with nutrition you can see. Great grains. Search great grains and see for yourself. For multi grain flakes that are an excellent source of fiber try great grains banana nut crunch and cranberry almond crunch. 

[00:50:54]


>>> More of our breaking news coverage of the school shootings is next. is work. And his new boss told him two things -- cook what you love, and save your money. Joe doesn't know it yet, but he'll work his way up from busser to waiter to chef before opening a restaurant specializing in fish and game from the great northwest. He'll start investing early, he'll find some good people to help guide him, and he'll set money aside from his first day of work to his last, which isn't rocket science. It's just common sense. From td ameritrade. 

[00:53:03]


>>> Welcome back to our continuing coverage. Joining me now is melissa harris and john shane, professor of criminal justice at john jay college. John, let me ask you, you heard pete williams tell us a lot of what has happened. He talked about -- we don't know the motive. What would be the first things we go to now to try and find a motive and walk us through how police would investigate two crime scenes. We have the scene where the mother was found dead and we have the school where the children, the principal and other adults were found. 
>> Right now, they're in the late stages of the investigation. The scene is stabilized. Both scenes are secure. What they're going to try to do now, al, is connect the evidence to see what sorts of physical evidence they can gather to make connections that might yield some light on moet vags. Things reich was there a note left behind? Anything on social media, facebook accounts, things like that. Did he post anything. Did he talk to anybody. Had this been planned for the last couple of months where they said we're just dismiss k it at hand. All along, he's been laying these clues. That's what they're going to look to connect right now. 
>> Melissa, how do you make -- what do you see in this? 
>> I suppose, obviously, as you just heard, we don't know yet what the motivations are. There's going to be a lot of analysis of the motivation. Given this is a situation where the shooter may have had a mental illness, there's going to be a lot of emphasis of this individual case as an individual case. Each of these tragedies are undoubtedly sort of about that specific thing. When you lay them all out together, they are all about one thing. They are about the access to guns. Ultimately, whatever his problems, whatever his motivation, had he not had easy access to handguns and weapons and bull ets, this would have been a different kind of story. 

[00:55:11]


>> Well, we were told earlier one theory was that there may have been some copy cat. We don't know that. But we do know all of these had been dealt with with guns and access to guns. And, in many cases, legally purchase guns. 
>>> I want to end tonight by talking about lloyd morgan, jr. He was just four years old when he was hit by a stray bullet. He was killed in the cross fire of a gunfight. And his parents lost their four-year-old son. I delivered the eulogy at his funeral. Hundre of people were there to mourn. Lloyd's death should have been a wake up call for all of us. I will never fore get trembling as I looked at that little casket. We're going to look at 20 little caskets next week. When will we stop together as a nation and come together across all lines and stop this where we will not have children robbed in their infancy and robbed in the future of this nation. I thought of lloyd times 20 today. I don't know if america can take anymore scenes like this. I hope this wake up call will really lead to our dealing with all of the issues that are connected to this. Thanks for watching. I'm al sharpton. A live edition of "hardball" is up next. ]

=======================================================

>> Woman: The following is a paid presentation n for the nuwave precision induction cooktop, brought to you by the makers of the number-one-selling nuwave oven. 
>> Announcer: When you turn on your cooktop, do you really know what the temperature is? No-- you're just guessing. Are you too busy to watch what you're cooking? Tired of all that burnt food going to waste? Worried about your kids getting burned or a loved one starting a fire in the kitchen? Well, those problems are a thing of the past. Introducing the revolutionary precision induction cooktop from nuwave, the leader in portable induction cooking technology. The nuwave heats up twice as fast, uses up to 70% less energy and is safer than any cooktop. Best of all, the nuwave is the only portable cooktop that gives you precise temperature control with the simple press of a button. Professional chefs create great-tasting meals by maintaining the precise temperature for the perfect amount of time. Well, now you can get professional results too, withhe nuwave precision induction cooktop. 
>> The key to great food is knowing how to control the temperatures of what you're cooking. 
>> Now the p.I.C. Is allowing people at home to cook like you can in a restaurant. 
>> I know that when I turn it on that temperature, it's going to be that temperature. There's no guessing. 
>> Announcer: Not only does the nuwave give you precise temperature control, it heats up twice as fast as an electric cooktop. 
>> I put the water in the pan and turned around and the next thing I knew, it was boiling. 
>> What amazes me about p.I.C. Is how quickly it will heat up. Induction technology is just unbelievable. 
>> Announcer: And because there's no flame to catch fire, no hot coils to burn you, the nuwave precision induction cooktop is the safest cooktop ever invented. Look what happens with this egg: The pan is hot, but the cooktop is not. That's the magic of induction cooking. Make pasta in half the time. Melt butter with no chance of it burning. Melt chocolate to creamy perfection. Make sauces with perfect temperature control. 

[00:02:06]


>> It's small, it's efficient, it's clean and it's safe. 
>> Announcer: And because it's portable, you can take it anywhere, so it's perfect for buffets and outdoor parties. To tell you more, let's join bob warden and jenny repko at the nuwave test kitchen in chicago. 
>> Let me ask you, do you hate boil-overs and the mess they make in the kitchen? Do you hate burnt grilled cheese sandwiches or shriveled-up bacon? 
>> What about over-fried chicken that's all greasy, or dried-out oatmeal, overdone pork chops or charred steak? 
>> Well, what if I was to tell you that instead, you could now have perfect grilled cheese sandwiches, perfectly browned evenly every single time? 
>> All that cheese is melted in there, so delicious. 
>> Perfectly melted. And I could have perfectly grilled steaks set at 350 degrees that give me a perfect medium rare steak or however you like it and it's never going to burn. Perfect pork chops, and not only pork chops... 
>> Right, salmon, grilled vegetables, sausage, perfect every time. 
>> What if I told you, when you fried your chicken, it was going to be fried at the perfect temperature of 375, gently, perfectly, crispy, never soaking up too much oil. 
>> That's hard to do. 
>> In fact, that's the problem with the old stovetops, whether it's gas or electric-- you can turn it up and down, but because you don't have precise control, you're going to get boil-overs. Because you don't have precise control, you're going to burn the cereal on the bottom from time to time. And because you don't have precise temperature control, you can't help but burn a steak or a pork chop on your stove. You see, you're not the bad cook in the kitchen. The stovetop is the bad cook in the kitchen. 
>> That's right, and those days of bad cooking are over, thanks to the fine folks here at nuwave, makers of the number-one-selling countertop oven in the world. 
>> Well, they've done it again. You're looking at the new wave in stovetop cooking. Now, this ingenious invention will make your life a whole lot easier in the kitchen and a whole lot shorter and a lot more fun. We're going to show you how and why every meal-- breakfast, snacks, lunch, dinner, grilled steaks, fondues and buffets-- will be made perfectly every time. Because now, for the first time, you can precisely control the cooking temperature. 

[00:04:18]


>> Announcer: Now you can live well for less with the nuwave precision induction cooktop. It's the most energy-efficient way to cook. The nuwave p.I.C. Uses induction technology. The secret is an internal series of copper coils. These coils generate a magnetic field within your metal pots and pans. The magnetic field causes invisible molecules to begin vibrating rapidly, creating heat, so the cookware itself heats the food. 
>> One of my passions are butter sauces. And one of the challenges of cooking a butter sauce is that if you get it too hot, you know, over 135 degrees, it breaks down. If you get it too cool, it congeals. The beauty of the nuwave p.I.C. Is that I can control the temperature exactly and keep the sauce for an extended period of time. That's such an added bonus for a professional cook and a home cook. 
>> L me show you this unusual pan. Bob, what did we do here? 
>> Well, we actually cut a pan and cut a section out, because in here you can see we have cereal rapidly boiling, right? >> Boiling away. 
>> I can put my hand right there. 
>> It's amazing. Move your hand. I'm going to put an ice cube right there. It's not melting. 
>> Because all of the energy is going into cooking your food. There's nothing wasted anywhere outside of the pan, so this is perfectly cool. So wipe that ice cube off there. 
>> O.K., I've got b cloth right here. Watch this, I'll take this ice cube, wipe it up. I'm using a paper towel on a burner. There's no fire, there's no flame, so it's so safe. 
>> And the minute you put the pan back on it starts boiling right again. >> Wow. 
>> Now, because we're cooking without fire, jenny, I'm going to take a sheet of play money and put it between the p.I.C. And the pan. Instantly it starts boiling again. 
>> Have you ever seen anything like that? Cooking through paper? 
>> So now we're cooking far more efficiently, we're saving 40- to 50% of the energy. >> Right. 
>> Isn't that amazing? 
>> Announcer: Seeing is believing. Look what happened when the nuwave p.I.C. Was put to the test on the streets of san francisco. 
>> All right, this is gonna blow your mind. This is the precision induction cooktop, and it is portable, eco-friendly and it saves you a lot of money, saves you a lot of time. >> Wow. 

[00:06:26]


>> Cooking time is cut in half. You see that the water's boiling now? >> Yeah. 
>> The great thing about induction cooking is it only heats the part of the pot that is magnetic, so everything else stays cool, so watch this. Ah! 
[Group exclaims] okay, everybody, put your hands on it. >> Isn't it hot? 
>> No, it just heats the magnetic part of the pot. This is at 110. You can leave it at 110 and it won't get gloppy, it won't get stale, it won't harden. 
>> And you don't have to be a big chef to cook. Like, I don't have time to cook. This would be great. 
>> Exactly-- this makes you look like an actual good chef. It's temperature-controlled, so I pop my fried chicken right in there and I know exactly what temperature it's at, and you know if you go down one, 10 degrees, boom, drops just like that. Can you do that on a gas range? 
>> Absolutely not. >> No. 
>> Not at all. >> This is temperature-controlled so you don't overcook it, you don't undercook it. 
>> I love the temperature control-- that can cook meat without drying it out. 
>> Man: Mmm! >> That's amazing! 
>> What do you think? 
>> Nice and crispy. 
>> You can fry, you can simmer, you can steam, you can fondue, you can do everything with this-- I love it. 
>> It's amazing-- I've never seen anything like it. 
>> I love that if you take the top... The pot off of the top, it stops and that the handles were cool. That's really amazing. 
>> And you know what the great thing is, you guys? It's portable. You can take this whole thing over to the table, plop it down and it will stay at 110 right in the middle of your guests and you can dip all day. Dip, dip, dip, everybody dip. And the best part about it? You can grill on the table. 
>> Man: Oh... 
>> What do you think about that? 
>> Mmm... 
>> So it's raining outside, it's the middle of winter, you still get grilled food. Will it change the way you cook 
AT HOME? >> Group: Yes. 
>> The p.I.C. Makes everything so simple. >> It looks like you ordered it from a restaurant. 
>> It does look like I ordered it from a restaurant. That's because I'm a good cook now with the p.I.C. [Laughter]

[??????...] 
>> one of my most popular dessert dishes is called the chocolate three ways. It's made with a triple chocolate brownie, done with a chocolate espresso sauce that I do, and also white chocolate gelato with a little bit of rock salt and olive oil, and the p.I.C. Induction burner, I can keep it warm and adjust it in 10-degree increments and spoon the sauce right on-- it's perfect temperature all night long... Opposed to my double boiler that I had before, risking to get water in the chocolate-- would actually make it separate. So I love the p.I.C. When it comes down to keeping things warm, and that chocolate sauce can get out fast and I can move that dish out of the kitchen quick. Now the p.I.C. Is allowing peoplehome to cook like you can in a restaurant. 
>> Well, so far we've been showing you what you can do when you can precisely control low temperatures, like for perfectly melting chocolate or for simmering cereal. 
>> But, everybody loves a great steak and everyone hates it when their steak does not come out just the way they like it. But with the nuwave p.I.C., because it comes with precision temperature control, you won't ever undercook or overcook that steak. 
>> For grilling, use this great cast iron barbecue grill pan that can come with your p.I.C. Now, if you like your steak rare, check this out. It's going to be red and juicy on the inside, but perfectly brown on the outside. If you like it well done, it's not going to be burned on the outside, but it's going to be perfectly well done on the inside. How? Because the p.I.C. Gives you perfect temperature control. Look at this, first I seared it to 575, now I've reduced the p.I.C. To 375 and check out this laser thermometer-- exactly 375 degrees. 

[00:13:50]


>> Check out how 375 degrees gives us those great grill marks without burning or charring. 
>> And you know what I like with my steak? >> I know. 
>> A perfectly baked potato, which I can do right here in my nuwave oven in minutes. 
>> Or if you like my favorite thing, sweet potato fries. Whatever you make in the nuwave, it comes out perfect every time. [Chuckles] 
>> Announcer: According to the u.S. Department of energy, 50 cents of every dollar you spend heating up your gas or electric stove is wasted. But not so with your nuwave p.I.C., Because it uses induction technology. This infrared camera shows how a traditional cooktop heats the area all around the pot. But look how the nuwave p.I.C. Heats up only the pot. This means no more wasted energy. 
>> I love that I'm saving energy, that I'm only heating up the bottom surface of the pot where I need the heat to be, and I really think we're seeing a difference in our electric bills and I love that. 
>> I feel really good when I'm using the p.I.C. 'Cause I'm using less energy to cook whatever it is I'm cooking, and I feel like in my little way I'm doing something for the planet. 
>> One of the best things about the nuwave precision induction cooktop is it's portable. I can take it anywhere, I don't have to leave it in the kitchen. So I'll take it into my dining room and I'll set up my own egg station, so when I have visitors-- especially my family-- I can cook my own omelets, they can cook their own omelets, they can cook their eggs, they can cook pancakes and it's just this simple because I've got precise temperature control. And look how beautifully non-stick this is. All I have to do to make the omelet is tip it, the omelet runs back. I tip it again, it runs back. I'm going to be able to fill this up. So everybody can have whatever filling they like. I always like to have some mushrooms, some cheese, some peppers... >> And you know I like the healthy spinach, bob. 
>> Ohh... >> I just ruined his omelet. >> [Laughs] well, with the perfect green fry pan, we just simply fold that over, it's going to continue to cook while it's in the pan. I fold that out and look at 
this: My pan is clean, I'm ready to cook another omelet again. 

[00:15:53]


>> The heating is consistent, so I can set up a buffet with four or five of these and have different temperatures that are going to maintain. I think one of the biggest complaints is that sometimes the last people that go through the buffet, they get the cold food, and with the p.I.C., the food stays warm through the entire event and the guests really appreciate that, as does the host and hostess. 
>> My husband loves the nuwave p.I.C. Because he can grill indoors instead of having to go outside. He can actually join us as a family and we can all be together and cook. 
>> Announcer: Introducing the revolutionary precision induction cooktop from nuwave, the leader in portable induction cooking technology. The nuwave heats up twice as fast, uses up to 70% less energy and is safer than any cooktop. Best of all, the nuwave is the only portable cooktop that gives you precise temperature control with the simple press of a button. 
>> I love the temperature control. >> As you press the buttons, you can see exactly what the temperature is-- you can watch the water boil change. 
>> Mm-hmm. >> That's incredible. 
>> Anything you boil water for... [Snaps fingers] it's that quick. 
>> Announcer: Make pasta in half the time. Melt butter with no chance of it burning. Melt chocolate to creamy perfection. Make sauces with perfect temperature control. Gas and electric stoves have hot coils and open flames which can burn you. The nuwave p.I.C. Transfers heat only to your cookware, so it's 100% safe. Look what happens with this 
egg: The pan is hot, but the cooktop is not. That's the magic of induction cooking. 
>> Group: Wow! 
>> Woman: It's not even hot. 
>> Will it change the way you 
COOK AT HOME? >> Group: Yes. 
>> Announcer: Why crowd your kitchen with expensive, bulky appliances? The nuwave precision induction cooktop is a complete kitchen all in one. It's your portable indoor grill, temperature-controlled deep fryer, festive fondue maker, timed rice cooker, healthy vegetable steamer, programmable slow cooker. 
>> If I had this, I would fry all day, every day. [Laughter] 
>> so I can steam my vegetables on top, I've got my couscous, my rice, my pasta underneath, everything is done, you come home from a hard day at work, 10 minutes, you got food for the whole family.

[??????...] 
>> Announcer: The nuwave precision induction cooktop is the most convenient and efficient way to cook. You get the convenience of traditional stovetop settings plus the flexibility to control the temperature in 10-degree increments. Sear a steak to perfection or melt chocolate or butter without a double boiler. You can do it all with the nuwave p.I.C. The smart sensors inside ensure you'll create delicious meals every time by maintaining the constant correct temperature. It's like having a professional chef cooking for you. 
The result: No more mistakes, no more burning. 
>> It takes the human error out of cooking. There's no more guesswork in what temperature you're cooking at. It's very easy to just set e temperature at the touch of your fingertips. You can go up 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees. In a matter of seconds, you're at that temperature. It's going to be perfect every time. 
>> Now we'd like to talk about the perfect temperature to fry chicken. Now, up to now we've been talking about what you can do when you have precise temperature control on low temperat, like with chocolate, right? Look at that, jenny. That's been in there for hours, it's still not sticking, it's still the perfect, perfect creamy texture. 
>> Did you taste it? 
>> I know, it's almost unbelievable, isn't it? 
>> Delicious. Oh, and then we went to high-temperature searing. So with the push of a button, we got this to 575 degrees, seared the steaks, then we brought it down to 350 and we have beautiful grilled sausages, pork chops, salmon, even those grilled vegetables-- they were good too. 
>> Well, frying temperature is 375 degrees, especially when you're using vegetable oil. We want to hold that perfect temperature, so lookit here. We have a probe in here, we set this to 375 degrees. It says 375 degrees. Our chicken is frying gently, it's not going to burn. 
>> Here on my burn it's a typical electric coil under here... 
>> I can see jenny's been cooking over here. 
>> This is what happens. It's not safe. And not only is it not safe, I have no idea what the temperature is-- I'm just guessing. 

[00:22:35]


>> When you get that really good fried chicken at one of those fast food chicken places, it's because they have a very expensive deep fryer, they've set it at 375 degrees, they can use that oil all day long without it burning. Well, now you have that precise control at home with the precision induction cooker. Let me give you an example. In the test kitchen, we cooked over 200 pieces of chicken, and this is what the oil looked like. >> It looks like it just came out of bottle. 
>> And this is breaded chicken, right? Here we cooked just 20 pieces of chicken on a gas stove, same results would have been on an electric stove-- you'd guess. You set it someplace between medium and medium-high, you don't know. The minute it smokes, it's gone, it's ruined. That's typically what happens. You have to throw the oil away. 
>> Yeah. Well, that gets expensive. 
>> Announcer: Third-party analysis shows the advantage of nuwave's precise temperature control versus conventional stove tops. Oil cooked with an electric stove contained 45% more saturated fat. Oil cooked with a gas stove contained 10 times more transfatty acids. Oil cooked with an electric stove contained over 90% more cholesterol than oil cooked with the precision induction cooktop. Now some of your favorite foods can be healthier with the nuwave precision induction cooktop. 
>> When you're cooking with frying foods, you're, um, you're trying to keep that temperature high so the grease doesn't get in the food, where you're not ending up with greasy chicken or greasy fish. And with the precision induction cooktop, I was able to master frying that chicken perfectly. 
>> Announcer: The nuwave p.I.C. Has been tested and recommended by the cooking club of america and is the safest cooktop ever invented. Did you know that every 85 seconds, a fire strikes a home in america? And most often, that fire starts in the kitchen. 
>> My very, very first fire was a 16-year-old kid who was cooking french fries on the stove and he forgot about them and he burned his parents' entire house down. 
>> Announcer: Well, that will never happen with the nuwave p.I.C. There is no open flame, no red-hot electric coil to catch fire and as soon as a pot is removed from the nuwave, the conduction of heat stops. 

[00:24:38]


>> The safety features of the p.I.C. Impressed me so much that I'm going to send one to my mother. She's getting a bit elderly and forgetful and I'm always a bit worried that she might start a fire and the p.I.C.'S going to eliminate that problem. It's a great thing for the elderly to have and it's going to be a nice present. 
>> During our show, we've showed you what a difference the nuwave precision induction cooktop can make in your cooking. Whether you're cooking breakfast or snacks. 
>> Lunch, dinner, hors d'oeuvres. 
>> Whether you're grilling or griddling, when you have precise temperature control, it can make all the difference. 
>> Whether you're searing at high temperatures... 
>> Or whether you're having precise temperature control at only 110 or 20 degrees for perfect chocolate, you have got it. In 10 degrees intervals you can go from 120 to 130 to 140, all the way up to 575 degrees, which you can never get with your stovetop-- you're always just guessing. So to sum it up, what do you get with the nuwave precision cooktop? You get, first of all, speed-- it heats up really fast. 
>> And safety. There's no red-hot coil or open flame. 
>> And you get precise temperature control that you can never get with your old electric burner or gas stove. 
AND YOU SAVE... >> Both: Money. 
>> So, here's how you can get your nuwave precision induction cooktop right now.

>>> Quizas alguien que pudo haber estado ausente durante el dia, todo es parte del proceso por el que pasamos vrt y estamos en el proceso de identificacion que fue mas dificil, va a tomar algun tiempo, y posiblemente no estara disponible sino hasta ma??ana. Hemos confiscado las armas. 

[00:02:31]


(Pregunta fuera del microfono). 
>>> Nos comunicamos con todos los padres, han sido informados y por eso nos tomo tiempo llegar hasta aqui. Buena pregunta, realmente esto es algo que los socorristas hacen, ofrecemos consejeria, porque no es algo que veamos todos los dias, es una de las cosas que hicimos, y el coronel dejo en claro que esta gente va a recibir consejeria y asesoria segun sea necesario.

>>> Esto es lo peor que experimentamos en esta localidad, estamos preocupados por las victimas, nuestros oficiales son profesionales, y vamos a lidiar con esto. 
>>> Puede describir la escena? 
>>> El hospital local tiene sus equipos de consejeros para crisis, ellos van a estar disponibles, ellos estan a disposicion de ser necesario. Y van a estar ahi todo el fin de semana. 

[00:04:45]


>>> Puede describirnos la situacion? 
>>> Ciertamente los padres se han reunido en la estacion de bomberos adyacente y asegurarles que hicimos todo, es un proceso dificil de identificar el estatus de toda una escuela elemental. Tenemos que tener esto en claro. Es un proceso de sanacion, tenemos que pensar en las familias. 
>>> Que nos puede decir respecto a los maestros? 
>>> La investigacion esta en marcha. Todavia hay padres alli. No puedo darles un numero. 
>>> Cuanto tiempo les tomo darse cuenta de la magnitud? 
>>> Minutos que llegaron al sitio se dieron cuenta de esta terrible escena que teniamos ante nosotros. 
(Comentario fuera de microfono). 
>>> No tengo un cronograma, las autoridades respondieron cuando se dieron cuenta de lo que habia pasado, pidieron todos los refuerzos necesarios. 
>>> Gracias. 
>>> Vamos a regresar poco antes de las 6 volveremos para darle otro parte, y luego uno mas ma??ana, algunos estan cansados y quieren descansar, y vamos a ver si podemos darle un cronograma de los proximos partes. 
>>> Bueno, se trata de la cuarta conferencia de prensa, es una lluvia de informacion, los detalles se van confior mando conforme pasen los minutos. Y aqui pendientes de todo lo que vaya surgiendo con respecto a la investigacion. 

[00:07:02]


>>> Fue uno de los tiroteos con mayor victimas fatales, y tenemos cobertura, y comenzamos con blanca cosa. 
>>> Ella esta a poca distancia donde ocurrio esta tragedia, un dia terrible no solo para los padres sino para toda la poblacion, adelante. 
>>> Buenas tardes, me encuentro detras del colegio, donde termino la conferencia de prensa, y fue la tercera en lo que va de esta tarde, la cuarta sera alrededor de las 6 de la tarde. Y es lamentable lo que paso, hay una profunda conmocion aqui, y es una ciudad bastante apacible, que esta enfrentando esta tragedia, lo que conocemos hasta el momento y lo que se informo y que en este momento se encuentran pasando ds mio, informaron que basicamente cuando ellos se les reporto que ocurria esto llegaron hasta la zona donde me encuentro, oficialmente se trata de 27 personas que han perecido, y de ellos 20 son ni??os, 18 perecieron aqui en este lugar de los hechos, y dos de los ni??os lo hicieron cuando llegaron al hospital, las autoridades han enfatizado y dicho claramente que antes de dar mayor informacion quieren que sean los propios padres, porque hablamos de criaturas de 5 a 10 a??os. Y reiteran que tienen que comunicarle los nombre hablar con los padres, y despues darnos a conocer los nombres de las criaturas, hay una profunda conmocion, se llamo a todo el pueblo, alrededor de 30 mil habitantes, ya tenemos que alrededor de las 7 de la noche se han empezado a reunir una serie de residentes para expresar su pesar por lo que esta ocurriendo. Y esta es una reunion que ocurrira alrededor de las 7. Y estan aqui sicologos que ayudan a los padres y que en el transcurso de esta noche se le va a comunicar los nombres, con respecto a la poblacion hispana, hemos conversado con una periodista que cubre esta zona, y nos dijo que ella habia logrado visitar por su trabajo que le llamo la atencion el hecho que cuando visito y paso un dia aqui la forma, la distribucion del colegio, y los pasadizos son bastante estrechos, y no le sorprendio la cantidad de personas que perecieron, nos trasmitia como esta la oficina de la directora, esta rodeada de vidrios para manejar mejor el funcionamiento del colegio, y que por eso se haya producio la cantidad de muertes, extraoficialmente se habla de alrededor de 100 disparos. De las dos armas que dicen que se encontraban por parte del acusado, del principal sospechoso hubo mas de 100 disparos, es un hecho conmovedor. 

[00:11:41]


>>> Y decias que enfatizaron que antes de dar mayor informacion tenian que notificar, muchos padres no saben si sus hijos estan muertos o no. Es correcto? 
>>> No te equivocas, desafortunadamente no te equivocas, han reunido a los padres de familias, y en una zona donde la prensa no tiene acceso, para poder asesorarlos, estan conversando, y despues de estas conversaciones paulatinamente les van a ir dando oficialmente a ellos los datos y los nombres, hablamos de ni??os cuyas edades oscilan de 5 a 10 a??os. 
>>> Espantoso. No nos podemos imaginar como se sienten ellos de saber o no si son sus hijos. 
>>> Y nosotros como padres entendemos, porque es lo que nadie se espera. Una pesadilla. 
>>> Gracias, regresamos contigo en cualquier momento. 
>>> Todo empezo en una apacible ma??ana donde fue interrumpida abruptamente. Y esta con nosotros la aterradora agenda, y hay muchas preguntas, mucha incertidumbre. 
>>> Y hablamos que natalia llamo al colegio de sus hijos para saber el proceso, y nos pasa el peor pensamiento, uno entrega a un colegio pensando que estan bien, pero esto le puede pasar a cualquiera. Lo que mas queria en ese momento era ir a buscar a mi hijo y abrazarlo. Y definitivamente es una tarea dificil la que tenemos en este momento de reportar una noticia como esta, porque son criaturas inocentes, era una agenda en el que el pistolero tenia el plan de acabar con la vida de su progenitora, y arraso con la vida de 20 peque??os. Y todavia no tienen una cronologia de los hechos. Y reconstruimos la historia. Veamos. 

[00:14:47]


>>> A las 9:40 reporta la policia que un pistolera esta en la oficina. La llamada indica que varios estan atrapados con un adulto armado, y con una persona con heridas multiples. A las 10 grupos de estudiantes son desalojados y reubicados en una estacion de bomberos. 
>>> Algunos tenian miedo, todo el mundo lloraba dice esta ni??a. 
>>> A las 10:45 la policia rodea el edificio. A las 11 indican que pueden ser 30 las victimas fatales. 
>>> A eso de las 1 confirman que el atacante esta muerto dentro del edificio, no se sabe si se suicido o fue neutralizado, los residentes siguen consternados. 
>>> Paso todos los dias por ahi, precisamente al lado esta los bomberos, y una patrulla , me sorprende lo que esta pasando hoy, es un pueblo tranquilo como repito, y uno no cree que algo asi pueda pasar. 
>>> El pistolero fue identificado como adan lanza, y se dan detalles escalofriantes, se cree que lanza viajo hasta la escuela en newtown con la macabra mision de asesinar a su madre. Hasta el momento se confirmo la muerte de 27 personas, la noticia sigue en desarrollo, y a cada minuto surge nueva informacion, se indico que la no novia del pistolero esta desaparecida. 

[00:17:06]


>>> Originalmente se habia identificado como ryan, que es el hermano, se habia reportado fallecido originalmente, pero confirmaron que era adan, y comenzo a reaccionar ante esta tragedia diciendo en su pagina de facebook que no era la persona, y una cierta confusion, hasta que confirmaron que se trataba de adan lanza, hay una gran confusion, se estan movilizando los diferentes medios a diferentes puntos. 
>>> La informacion tambien va cambiando. 
>>> Aunque se reporta que un hermano esta muerto la policia de nueva jersey no confirmo esta version. 
>>> Y otros medios de comunicacion habian notificado que antes que llegara a este centro supuestamente habia asesinado a su mama, entonces, habia encaminado hacia el colegio, son informacion que van saliendo minuto a minuto. De acuerdo a las conferencia de prensa. 
>>> Confirmaron que la madre estaba en una aula. 
>>> Ya que trabajaba como maestra. 
>>> Gracias, natalia. 
>>> Y una de las victimas del joven fue su propio padre. Vamos con alex en nuestra afiliada de nueva jersey que fue asesinado su padre. Adelante. 

[00:19:17]


>>> Buenas tardes. Estoy en una ciudad cerca a manhattan, a una hora de donde ocurrio este crimen, aparentemente el hermano del pistolero vivia en este lugar, no se saben los detalles, el lugar esta acordonado, es un lugar residencial, exclusivo en este sector de nueva jersey, en este edificio es donde aparentemente vivia su hermano ryan. La policia acordono el lugar, hasta el momento no dijo los resultados de este operativo que se lleva en esta zona. Esto es todo por mi parte. 
>>> Gracias. Y hacemos una corta pausa y regresamos con mas en esta cobertura especial en el que toda la nacion esta de luto. Ya volvemos a "primer impacto." ??? ??? ??? ??? 

[00:23:50]


>>> y continuamos aqui con esta trasmision en vivo y de costa a costa para comenzar de esta masacre en newtown, y hace algunos minutos visiblemente consternado se vio el presidente obama y con lagrimas en los ojos hablo de las victimas de esta masacre. Vamos con lourdes y esta cobertura. Vamos contigo, lourdes. Buenas tardes. 
>>> Buenas tardes. Y gracias barbara. Y una vez nuestro corazones estan rotos, como has dicho visiblemente emocionado, el presidente obama dijo hoy y 
quiero citarlo: La mayoria de los que murieron eran peque??os ni??os bellos, tenian sus vidas enteras, sus cumplea??os, graduaciones, dijo que la nacion atraveso muchas de estas tragedias, y aludio que habia que hacer algo por evitar estas tragedias y se refiere al control de armas, y dijo y lo quiero citar, que van a tener que hacer algo significativo para prevenir mas tragedias como esta poniendo a un lado la politica. Respalda el renovar una prohibicion para el acceso a armas automaticas. Esto es dificil en el congreso, la casa blanca dijo que esto tendra que esperar por el momento. Y el presidente obama que tambien hablo con el gobernador y esta al tanto de la investigacion tambien ordeno que las banderas a todo lo largo del pais esten a media asta para reflejar el luto de esta nacion. Dijo que tendran a media asta las banderas en todas las embajadas, instalaciones militares, buques de guerra, y quiere demostrar que este pais hoy esta llorando. 

[00:26:26]


>>> Se puede decir que hablo como padre. No como presidente de esta nacion. 
>>> Correcto. Y dijo que esta noche el como otros padres alrededor de la nacion apretaran mas fuertes a sus hijos y les diran cuanto los quieren. El presidente visiblemente emocionado, el tambien envia a sus hijas todos los das al colegio. 
>>> Y se espera que el presidente visite el lugar de la masacre? Se sabe algo? 
>>> Se especula y espera, y sabemos que los presidentes han acudido a los lugares de esta tragedia, el presidente lo hizo en el pasado, el presidente bush fue a virginia tech, donde tuvo la masacre de 30 estudiantes, y fue para consolar y a la gente en la universidad, y espero que vaya a esta comunidad a hacer lo mismo en los dias proximos. 
>>> Gracias lourdes. 
>>> Bueno, y es que no es la primera vez que una fatal balacera viste de luto sus aulas. Vamos con norma y un recuento de los horrendos crimenes que empa??an la historia de esta nacie. 
>>> Estados unidos vivio una oscura tradicion, muchas motivadas por el rencor de los agresores. Lo que es lamentable. Aqui un recuento de las peores matanzas. 
>>> La secundaria fue escenario de uno de los momentos mas tragicos. El 20 de abril de 1999 dos jovenes asesinaron a balazos a 13 personas. Ambos habian recibidos constantemente palizas y burlas y decidieron tarlos, y perdieron tambien la vida much inocentes. Planearon sigilosamente este ataque durante un a??o. El 2 de abril del 2006 un hombre armado dejo salir a los estudiantes varones y tomo como rehenes a las ni??as, y ejecuto a 5 de ellas antes de suicidarse. Se cree que el motivo fue una venganza por algo que habia pasado hace 20 a??os. La masacre de virginia murieron 33 personas. El pistolero envio un manifiesto expresando su odio hacia la sociedad en general. Este mismo a??o el 2 de abril un coreano mato a 7 personas en una universidad de california. El atacante asesino a sus victimas tras alinearlas contra un muro. 

[00:30:01]


>>> Dramaticas imagenes en las memorias de todos. Son algunos de una larga lista tiroteos. El tema de posesion de armas vuelve y una vez en un pais abatido por crimenes. 
>>> Esta matanza abre nuevamente el debate. 
>>> Vamos a la pausa y regresamos con mas a "primer impacto." ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? 

[00:33:18]


>>> de regreso con "primer impacto." Son imagenes en vivo con un grupo que se congreso en frente de la casa blanca en protesta sobre el tiroteo ocurrido en connecticut, y desato esta controversia, la casa blanca se pronuncio al respecto, y dijo que mantiene su compromiso para renovar las restricciones del control de armas de asalto. Continuamos en cobertura continua, y se une nuestro colega felix que unio hace algunas horas con jorge ramos con esta trasmisin ininterrumpida. Y como decias durante la trasmision, habia otras matanzas pero no de esta magnitud. 
>>> Sabiamos que son situaciones que se presentan con cierta periodicidad, pero nunca algo con ni??os de esta edad, las veo a ustedes y sabemos lo que significa esto, a esa hora es la hora de recoger a los ni??os, y habiamos tenido la sensacion que no estabamos seguros en un teatro, y ahora no estamos tranquilos ni a la escuela, y como lo mencionan bien, abrre la doble discusion, primero hablamos del tema, los! Hechos, en medio de td la informacion, y segundo el debate sobre el porte de armas, la enmienda existe, cambiar una enmienda constitucional es un tramite dificil. Y cuando el presidente habla de esto es que algo tiene que cambiar. No puede ser que un rifle de asalto como el r 15 lo pueda comprar cualquiera. El debate sera dificil pero marca un punto de quiebre. 

[00:35:59]


>>> Lo que mas impresiono fue el numero de victimas, no se sabia mucha informacion, subio de 10 a 20. Y esperamos datos consolidados de lo que paso. Durante la tarde nos escucharon modificar datos permanentes, pero lo cierto es que comenzo como un tiroteo, pero algo que a lo que nos acostumbrado, pero no teniamos la dimension de lo que paso, cuando se conocen las caracteristicas, un joven de 20 a??os que mata a su padre, despues va y mata al rector del colegio, entraa al salon donde eta su madre, mata a su madre y empieza a disparar a los menores. Y tristemente nos acostumbramos que en los 20 a??os se presentaron 23 masacres, tenemos mas masacres que a??os, pero ninguna de las caracteristicas de la que vimos hoy, y un reflejo es la imagen del presidente, yo no recuerdo, con el presidente obama y esta imageno recuerdo una imagen, me cuesta trabajo. 
>>> Como padre mas que como presidente. 
>>> Y manejaba las dos cosas, estaba la conmocion de saber que tiene hijas y les puede pasar algo parecido, como a cualquiera de nosotros, y lo otro, la necesidad de un cambio, por eso hay que hacer un cambio significativo, que es un cambio significativo? Es lo que estara en discusion, y como deciamos no es facil, la asociacion del rifle tiene un gran poder, que se va a lograr? No se. 

[00:38:19]


>>> Siempre se abre la controversia pero no vemos resultados. 
>>> Repetimos esto cada vez que hay masacre. Y mencionamos que cuando sucede esto dicen no es el momento de hablar de esto, es momento de las victimas, de lo que paso, no, este es el momento. 
>>> Estoy de acuerdo, y hay que plantear el tema, hay puntos de vista encontrados, hay que escuchar a la contraparte, hay personas que defienden la tenencia, pero son las caracteristicas, si no se va a cambiar la enmienda por lo menos hay que dar un paso adelante. 
>>> Ojala comencemos veamos un cambio, y nosotros haremos con contacto, sabemos que es una epoca del a??o emotiva, sin embargo el luto y dolor invade nuestras vidas tras esta tragica balacera. 
>>> En este momento en las casas de esas 20 familias estaban pensando en los regalos para sus hijos, que iba a llevarle santa. El tema que les estaba rondando. Y cuando comencemos a conocer a las victimas, un tiempo dificil. Cuando veamos los rostros de los ni??os tambien. 
>>> Y vamos con blanca rosa que esta en la escuela primaria donde fue perpetrada esta masacre. Adelante. 
>>> Efectivamente como estuvimos reportando, estamos esperando que se produzca la cuarta conferencia de prensa, un poco para recapitular lo que sabemos, y en este momento se encuentran dos estudiantes compa??eros de clase del principal sospechoso de haber cometido esta masacre, ellos vivian en nueva jersey, y lo conocian desde hace mucho a??os, y los policias los estan interrogando. Al preguntarle si exis existaalgun vinculo con este dijeron que no, pero estan interrogandoles para dar mas luz en medio de esta gran tragedia. Y otra cosa que surgio es que este colegio contaba con un nuevo sistema de camara que estaba en pleno funcionamiento, estas camaras van a ser definitivamente un arma importante en las investigaciones, y que habian sido instaladas en el local de este colegio. Y que estaban en pleno funcionamiento. Cuando se trata de una inveacion tan grande como esta, estos elementos de ayuda para la policia son impr imprecindibles. Y las autoridades dijeron que la prensa no tendra acceso directo a los familiares, ya estan en un lugar bastante lejano, donde estamos nosotros que es en las afueras del colegio, se encuentran siendo asistidos por un grupo de sicologos que estan conversando, no solo por lo que ocurrio, y anticipan que van a tener que trasmitir los nombres de las criaturas que han fallecido, que han enlutado a todo el pais, y nos podemos dar cuenta por la cobertura que hay aca. Todos los medios se encuentran aqui transmitiendo en vivo al igual que nosotros. Y en los proximos minutos se dara lo que se espera la ultima conferencia de prensa en la que anticipamos que la policia nos va a decir si empezaron el proceso bastante doloroso de comunicarle a los familiares los nombres de las personas que han perecido. Y han hecho mucho enfasis en decir que solamente despues de darle a los familiares los nombres recien nos los daran a conocer a nosotros, una medida con la que estamos completamente de acuerdo. Regreso con ustedes. 

[00:43:59]


>>> Una noticia que nos llego sumamente lamentables, es que una victima es la nieta de jorge marquez, una ni??a boricua declarada muerta aqui, entemente esta ni??a que se llama ana grace marquez esta entre las victimas, y los familiares estarian en camino a connecticut, es una victima, la nieta de la hermana del alcalde de un pueblo en puerto rico. Empezamos a conocer mas detalles, es una lluvia de informacion, pero se van confirmando a medida que pasa el tiempo, y se confirma una de las victimas, es latina, es de puerto rico, es ana grace marquez, conociendo los detalles tan lamentables, en este caso... 
>>> Nuestro mas sentido pesame, blanca rosa continua con nosotros? 
>>> Si. Como el nombre de esta criatura que ustedes dieron, tambien vamos a escuchar otras declaraciones, una madre argentina que hizo declaracion al periodico el clarin, su criatura tenia 7 a??os, era una historia feliz, ella habia logrado sobrevivir esta tragedia, y contaba la version de una criatura que tuvo la suerte de salvar. Es un hecho afortunado, pero hay otras 27 familias que no pueden contar lo mismo.

See if they air that. That is it for "the five." Thank you for 
>> yes, andy, that was our actual in bus entertainer. 
>> I feel like you were trying to tell me that. 
>> I was. 
>> Six years going strong. Joe still has the professional seem lessness in all the other shows. 

[00:02:00]


>> We are so good. We are like a well-oiled machine and a harlem globe trotter. 
>> It would be one thing if we taped in advance, but we are live so you have to roll with it. 
>> These mistakes happen. Exactly. 
>> It is live television. That's the price you pay from the spontaneity of live television. 
>> It is live television that makes it what it is. All right. Go away captain collar. Let's welcome our first guest, she is so hot her oven mitts wear oven mitts. She co anchors on fox newschannel and she can waive. Well he is so sharp that switch blades carry him. I would like to welcome a first time guest. He is patrick mill sap, rm -- former chief of staff of newt gingrich's campaign. And he is considered a fruit basket. My repulsive sidekick, bill schulz. And if comedic genius was a dresser he would fall apart when you bang him. Sherrod small. 
>> Thank you, gregory. 
>> Thank you. 
>> I have so much to say, but I am so an dree -- aping gree. 
>> And good to see you, pinch. 
>> Today the -- lincoln leads les miserables. It is poppy-cock with a side order of balderdash. ?????? I dreamed a stream ?????? ?????? in times gone by ?????? ?????? when hope was high ?????? ?????? and life was living ?????? 
>> wow. You guys want to go to something? There you go. 

[00:04:02]


>> The whole point of bringing up the bus tour is to remind people that I will be on a bus tour. It begins in oklahoma city on DECEMBER 15th. And then I hit wichita, falls and wood lands and grapevine and plano, waco, tyler. Go to greg gutfeld.Com and you can find out more about it this week. You have to go, really you do. 
>> Can I ask a question? 
>> Sure. 
>> Is that the actual size of the bus? 
>> I would laugh hysterically if that question hadn't been asked 20 times already. 
>> Really? Oh, then I i am not the only one that sees it is a possibility. 
>> The answer is a resounding yes. 
>> You are terribly right. 
>> Actually the bus is smaller than this. 
>> Should we respect their lack of respect? An army handbook is advising american soldiers not to speak ill of the taliban or speak up for women's rights in afghanistan. The proposed document obtained by the "wall street journal" linked the lack of savy to deadly uhing tays noting that many of the confrontations occurred because of ignorance or lack of empathy for muslim and/or afghan culture rare norms. Cultural norms. It is resulting from the afghan security force member. 
>> Hold your tongue when they treat women worse than chris brown does. And the handbook cautions don't mention homosexuality. Not everyone agrees. Speaking of disapproval, look what happens when andy levy tries to leave his apartment. Jay nice jeans, andy. Sounds weird in his apartment. 

[00:06:04]


>> Sherrod, should our soldiers be more like you and culturally sensitive to the taliban? 
>> Yes, they should be. Mind your business. You are not there to do a one-man job and changing their minds and feelings about things. Do your job and keep your head down. 
>> I don't know, harris. The fact is should we look away at how they treat women? They throw acid in women's faces and they shoot women for adultery. 
>> They are terrible people. 
>> I can't argue with that. I understand that. Originally and all along i thought we were in fact sherrod changing hearts and minds. How do you do that if you can't change who you are? We have seen with long-term conflicts that this kind of bonding and shared cultural experience is important when you are going to be there for a longtime. For civilians who are open to it. 
>> It makes me think I am not interested in winning hearts and minds. Maybe we should high tale it out of there. 
>> No, you can win with hearts and minds. You can play games with the kids. 
>> What movies have you seen? 
>> You don't have to talk about homo sexuality. 
>> Teachers and them basketball and football. I didn't say fried chicken with them. 
>> Patrick, go ahead. 
>> He didn't. 
>> The only concern that this is from is that these afghan troops that were supposed to be helping are shooting our guys. That's what started this. And so number one if this is going to help prevent that, then let the brass do it. Number two, you are right. Who are our friends here? We have friends and allies that are shooting us. We have israel our friend and allies that say they are on our end. It is a bigger issue. 
>> It is like friends how you consider people friends on facebook. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> It is not like friend, friends. 
>> We were stationed there with my dad. And I always thought we take actual lessons learned from conflicts and then apply them. What I understand with this though is that the manual has to be gone over by general allen. We don't know exactly what the end will be. 

[00:08:14]


>> Very good point and way to add information into the story that I wasn't aware of. 
>> Okay, sorry. 
>> I am the host here. I am supposed to look like i am in control. Bill, you served, but it was at appleby's. Do you have any opinion on this what so ever? 
>> Yes, clean up your tables. I am a table busker. The gum and all of that stuff, I am not getting paid enough. We pool our tips. Secondly if you want to win the hearts and mind of the taliban you decapitate them. Reach into the head hole and pull out the mind. You go into the aorta cavity and pull out the heart. Mind, heart, we won. Second of all, the problem with this is they are not just talking about the taliban. They are talking about regular afghanistan, people. What exactly are we fighting for? I have to wonder if the allies were going to germany were they getting pamphlets that said, don't say anything about the jews. 
>> That's exactly right. I think patrick is correct that we have to keep our troops safe. But if you made a parallel comparison like bill did, the assume usion is you would turn a blind eye to anti-semitism or worse, killing jews. The only answer is get the hell out of there or do something. But I don't know what to do. 
>> I go back to the center forearm me lessons learned who wrote this manual out of fort leavenworth. I don't know if you could win a long-term conflict without making friends. Different than those on facebook. 
>> You know what would win over friends? Dropping dvd's of "friends." 
>> Ross and chandler. 
>> They love western culture. No they don't. You know what bothers me the most? Feminists and beta males who spend their time on blogs going after sexist behaviors like fraternities or wall street. Stuff like that. Oh look at these guys. They never say anything about the stuff that is going on over there. They are bad stuff. 

[00:10:23]


>> I like beta males. 
>> You are not a beta male. 
>> No. I don't know what a beta male is. 
>> It is the opposite of alpha male. 
>> And sherrod wants to teachers and our wonderful sport. Look at their sport. It is polo with a goat's head. There is a big divide. 
>> You work with what you have. 
>> They do that once a year though. Jay we have the super bowl -- 
>> we have the super bowl once a year. 
>> I want them to -- you know, you can really bond with people just being normal with them. 
>> These are people wlow you up. 
>> I know you want to move on, but these are soldiers and marines. We want them to be -- we want them to be safe, but we want them to fight our wars and get out. At the point we teachers teach them diplomacy won't they take over? 
>> It is hard to slam dunk a ball when the vertebrae is still attached. 
>> I don't think he said that. 
>> We used to play goat basketball in our family. 
>> We finished this topic. 
>>> From manuals to mangers they are focusing on bullies in assisted of blitzen. A school has can -- canceled its holiday concert and replaced it with an anti-bullying concert. Public schools admit some parents complained about the religious content of the show. But she denies the reason why they are fore going the fa-la-la's for that reason. We just had a little change at that particular school because they had a big initiative on anti-bullying. But some town residents don't see it that way with one writing, everything these days has to be politically correct. What is this world coming to when thirn cannot put on a christmas play? What is the world coming to indeed? The new show's theme will be peace, friendship, kindness, be good to your fellow students and accept differences and be supportive. 

[00:12:25]


>> Boo. 
>> Sometimes I think we are lowering the bar. I want to ask you, harris, the anti-bully seminars are becoming the secular christmas. It is exclusively fun for christians. You can't sayhey are bad, and they affect everybody, examine it is like aular replacement. 
>> One, the bullies win again if you take away christmas. 
>> We did it y'all! 
>> Right? I mean, I like the idea of teaching kindness and peace, but thenhy wouldn't you just put that program on in december? They know they are not right in this case. What they are doing is just killing the program. They are not replacing it. They are killing it. They are running a program later in january during the celebration of martin luther king's birthday. They wanted a reason to kill christmas. This was a little piece that killed me. Individuals who objected to the religiouture of a christmas program should just stay home. Amen. Why not just stay home if you don't want your kid there? Why kill christmas for everybody because that's what you are doing. Otherwise you would simply replace it. 
>> Let's take the first story and compare it with the second story. You have the american government saying you can't talk about homosexuals or women or pedophiles over there. We will respect that. Over here in our country christmas is a bad thing. The fact of the matter is christmas -- the birth of christ is historically accurate and it actually happened. What ever you believe about christ is a different thing. If we are tolerant about people's beliefs it is a historically accurate thing that happened. Why are we so tolerant of those guys, but when it comes to our thing it is like, we can't do it. We are not tolerant. 

[00:14:41]


>> It is not like we are talking about easter, the resurrection. 
>> A bunny? 
>> No, sweetheart. And I just say swee heart because I like you or I would punch you. 
>> If it was anybody else you would punch him in the face. 
>> Are you right, it is the date on the calendar. 
>> It is ch ri st-mas. 
>> Everybody is so afraid of pissing somebody else off they will ruin it for everybody. 
>> I remember having christmas plays and celebrations all through school. Nobody seemed to be angry about it. 
>> And that was the only thing you ever wept to. 
>> I -- ever went to. 
>> I never went to the class. 
>> Some of the biggest bullies are actors and are missing out in the christmas play. Just saying. 
>> How many more need to be hurt before this senseless war on christmas ends? 
>> Seven. 
>> Sherrod, you are being flippant and everybody knows it is 12. 
>> Holidays are -- bill, were you going to answer it? 
>> Well, the mistake they made here by can selling it and then replacing it with something else, if they just canceled it, a couple parents would have been like -- mmm. And then they would say oh thank god we do don't have to go to this thing. My kid is annoying as it is. Put a costumes on them that's even worse. And then the kids who don't have a role and the parents complain about that. No one in my school likes the holiday stuff. The kids didn't like to do it. The parents didn't like to watch it. The teachers didn't want to be there. The anti-bullying thing is worse. Just can sell it and you won't have any problems. 
>> It is an attack on fun, and it is replacing fun with a didactic her nest no fun -- her nest no fun killer. We are all against bullying. When you have a seminar everybody will be listening going, we know it is wrong, we know it is wrong. There is no real story other than be nice to everybody. We get it. Holidays, however, are decisive and hurtful. Not everybody can have the same level of fun. 

[00:16:50]


>> We have to come up with a new holiday that everybody is included in. 
>> What would that be? 
>> Everybody likes pilates? They have a pilates day. 
>> It is hard to do. 
>> We have become a country of idea police. If you are exposed to an idea you don't agree with, you might get something. 
>> Because it is I killer. 
>> We will have nothing in a couple years. 
>> People prefer nothing to something. On that note we will take a break. Coming up, is one group to blame for all of our problems? Sherrod small discusses his new book, the world would be right if there was no more white. 
>> And it is a musical. But first, can google make it harder to find porn? I don't know. All of my sites are bookmarked. 

[00:21:00]


>>> Is chris christie too big for a presidential gig? The new jersey governor was asked if his girth would get in the way on barbara walters' 10 more fascinating people special. 
>> There are people who say you couldn't be president because you are so heavy. What do you say to them? 
>> That's ridiculous. People watched me the last couple weeks during hurricane sunday for 18 days. I don't think that would be a problem. 
>> That was as hard-hitting as his pants aren't fitting. Let's check in with barbara walters' most interesting cat. Terrible and not funny whatsoever. Sherrod, is christie's weight with voters or is this an issue with the mainstream media. 
>> Show respect for barbara walters who knows how to ask a question. She never says, hey, I think you are too fat to run. She says, what do you people to people who say -- 
>> there are people who say 
-- 
>> what would you say to them? 
>> She knows how to ask the question and not p ut it on her. I love it. 
>> This is a woman who has been a talk show host for many years and has an unusual vocal delivery. She is asking a fat guy if he should be president, and she has been a a talk show host or interviewer for 40 years with an unusual vocal delivery. See my point? 
>> No, I don't see it at all. 
>> First of all as a fat guy, I don't think I can -- 
>> are you not. 
>> Don't you do that! Don't you do that! You look great. 
>> I don't think I should -- i don't think I should throw stones. Let's get past the question. Let's get past the question. This is the most ridiculous answer chris christie has ever given in his political career. He is known forgiving straight talk. He is known for just saying it as it is. D he goes, barbara, I don't know. I don't know I'm fat. 

[00:23:14]


>> This is like, you know this is almost like -- gavin has said this, but it is an achievement to get large. 
>> Down where I am from, this is svelt. This is a practical thing. I spent four months on a bus, and once you get secret service you never walk. Whatever his weight is before he starts campaigning, think add 50. 
>> The secret service keep you from walking? 
>> Let me tell you something. They pick you up from the front door, and they take you to events. They pick you up and drop you off at planes. You stop walking. 
>> They don't want you approached. Let me ask you, harris, what do you make of this? Do you think it was offensive for her to bring up his weight? 
>> I think it was irrelevant, although people are talking about it. I would have owned it then. I would have said, you know, you look like you're hungry. Is that a problem? 
>> Bill, here is my problem. We are losing our fat people. There are none in the public eye. 234 the old days there were fat role models or roll role models. Everybody knew fat people. They were everywhere, and they were -- jackie flea glee son -- jackie gleason. 
>> Fatty arbuckle. 
>> He was a terrible role model. 
>> It is called mike and molly. Let's watch a little mike and molly. 
>> You think it was a legitimate question? 
>> I think it is a legitimate -- no, I don't know. I don't know anyone who says he can't be president because he is so big. I never heard that. 
>> People are worried about his health. This is a guy who on the jersey boardwalk last summer before we had the awful storms, last summer was eating ice cream and donuts and got into a fight. Remember that? 
>> I loved that. He followed the guy. 
>> He didn't put his ice cream down while he blessed out this person. 
>> That is a good point. He worked like 20 hours every day during hurricane sandy. And yet he did not lose a pound. This is dedication of a level I have never seen. You have to multi task your eating to such a degree, i don't know who you he does it. I do know he has to have the stickest most crumb-filled keyboard in awful government. 

[00:25:33]


>> And that's sexy. 
>> There is a serious point. He is a leader that people look up to, and health is an issue. He and obama walking down together look like an interracial number 10. Look, nbc's "big loser" poe lit cal edition, huckabee did it. He was a fat governor and started running. 
>> Again, health was the spark there, so I have read. You know with governor huckabee, once he gets his sights on something he will finish it. Maybe govenor chris stey doesn't feel like he needs to do that. But he should have answered the question honestly. You know what, barbara, who ever you are quoting, I am fat. I own that. I love it. Move 
>> you know what I was thinking about? How awesome it is to lie on a bed, and you have this really hot, hot donut, and it is like on a contraption above you and you put in scoops of ice cream and it melts into your mouth. It is ice cream dripping into your mouth and all over your face. 
>> So you have been to the governor's mansion. Greg got the private tour. Now that nondisclosure agreement you signed is out the window. 
>> It is amazing. 
>> Hugh hefner has a swing in his bedroom, but we have the ice cream canopy. 
>> Do you have a comment on the show? E-mail us. It is red eye at fox news.Com. And do you have any videos of your animal doing something, but not falling because that's wrong. Click on submit a individual yoy, and we may use it. Still come, the half time report from andy levy. He is our donut -- hole. 
>> It is sponsored by ice skating, using the ice skate to glide over an ice covered surface. Thanks, ice skate skating. 

[00:31:12]


>>> For that we go to andy levy. I want to congratulate you. 
>> For landing the role as jeremy renner's stunt double. It is a college-age -- college-aged film. 
>> I ruined it. 
>> You kind of did. 
>> Thanks, sleeve less joe. 
>> I have sleeves. 
>> He is working on a car out back. 
>> He didn't know we were dhog show tonight. 
-- We were doing this show tonight jie. Casual greg is different than regular greg. 
>> Okay. 
>> Casual greg can hang out and talk and rap after the show. 
>> Rap? 
>> That's what I call talking about emotional and personal issues. 
>> Really? 
>> That's what I do with kids. 
>> I call my office the tree house. It is in a tree house. 
>> Things I did on the bus. 
>> You were just giving the prosecution so much ammunition. 
>> Let's get to it, shall we? Proposed army handbook would advise soldiers no theo speak ill of the taliban and speak up for women's rights. Sherrod, you said it is telling our troops they are there to do a job, and they should mind their business beyond that. This is applying the thanksgiving dinner rules to afghanistan. 
>> What is the thanksgiving dinner rules? 
>> You don't talk about certain things. 
>> You don't talk about it. It is like being around family. Some things you keep in house. When you have other people around a that ain't family you talk regular talk. 
>> When you have the crazy racist uncle at thanksgiving dinner, ie me, there are certain subjects you don't bring up. 
>> This raises a point. 
>> There is a difference thank gives and the taliban, alcohol. 

[00:33:15]


>> One of the reasons you can't say anything to the taliban is that they are always sober which makes them miserable people. 
>> We need to put cocaine in their water. 
>> They have drugs there though. 
>> They sell opium. 
>> That's what every dealer says. 
>> Until they get caught. And then it is all for personal use. 
>> You said part of the reason we are there is to share our values. And to win hearts and minds. It just doesn't seem to be working. 
>> That's not the point. The point is they don't want it to happen at all. If you block it it doesn't have a chance to happen. We don't know that for certain. It is almost impossible for people to be in each other's company for the amount of years that our troops have been on the ground in that country and not have shared some sort of cultural back and forth. And in a very good, positive way. I am an optimist, but I have a dad who served. I understand that when you have boots on the ground for that long there will be some shared experiences. And with all prayers, I just hope that we can rub off the good stuff on each other. They are human, so they have stuff they can share with us too. Amen, can I get an amen? 
>> The flip side is when you have boots on the ground for so long the people start to recent you. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> There is always a segment of the population that can open that door. If you block it, if you tell our ps that you forbid it, they will follow that command. 
>> You said if this will keep our soldiers safe, then you are for it which I agree with. But is the fact that we need something like this, does that mean it is time to get out? 
>> I think that is the problem. Like I said before we are making our troops into diplomats 
>> bill, you were correct when you said this is not just about the at that . This is about the people who are supposed to be on our side even though it seems like a lot of them robert. 

[00:35:32]


>> As patrick said, boy this is funny. 
>> Patrick, it is like jazz. Sometimes the humor is in what I don't say. 
>> I am laughing on the inside. 
>> That's a sweet, sentimental thought. 
>> That's crap is what it is. Harrison, center forearm me lessons learned, what it does is rapidly collects and analyzes and archives the operational records in order to facilitate initiatives and conduct focus, knowledge and forms the army and enables the operationally based ingnaw gracious and integration throughout the army and in the jim environment. 
>> And all you really need to know -- 
>> why do you hate the military, greg? Why do you hate the military and military programs that are set up to make our army better? Why sir? 
>> Wow. 
>> He is thinking about it. 
>> That's the center that wrote the journal. The only buds man is trying to show us. 
>> You need to drill down, harris. 
>> It is a newschannel. 
>> You realize the host is no longer talking. 
>> I would say that was my secondary purpose. But it was my primary. 
>> Job well done. 
>> They replace the christmas concert with anti-bullying program. Harris, you said the bullies win again if they take away christmas. They are not taking away christmas. They are can selling a concert. 
>> They are saying they are not going have it that way. They didn't replace it. A month later they are going to do thely program. It is not like they physically put something in place. I guess you wouldn't enjoy an anti-bullying program. 
>> To me it is another way they will destroy the arts in schools. More than a christmas play is a play. One of my favorite times in school. Greece, we did greece in the -- grease, we did greece 
-- grease in my class. And I was kinicki. 

[00:37:36]


>> Can you do that? 
>> I need the wig. 
>> I played rizzo and I didn't need the wig of the. 
>> You're welcome. 
>> Patrick, I didn't really understand or agree with your argument, you said somet about because joe success was a historical figure. But that has nothing to do with what christmas celebrates. It is celebrating the birth of the son of god. 
>> But the point is, there is a historically relevant component to that for nonchristians. People who do not claim to be christians or are not christians their eyes will not burn out of their head by watching something that does that. 
>> Jesus in a manger. 
>> But the entire point of christmas is that jesus is the son of god. It is not that he was a man. 
>> The point of christmas, jesus the son of god was born that day. 
>> Right, exactly. The son of god. I'm confused. 
>> You are trying to have a fight about jesus christ. 
>> I am not having a fight about it. I think it is disingeneral wise to pretend that christmas is about the birth of a historical figure. 
>> I am not saying that at all. For the people that are arguing against this and as only your religious thing, i think that is disingeneral wise is they know nobody can look at christmas because of the birth of christ. 
>> It is a religious holiday. 
>> But it is something people can learn from. It is not imposing values on anybody. 
>> I hear what you are trying to say. Andy, this is something you can learn from. Do you catch my meaning? Why don't you come to service with me this year. 
>> It is not too late. 
>> Sherrod, you can't have a pilla tease day. 
>> That was pontious pilot. Chris christie tells barbara walters that he is not too fat. I thought it was fantastic when she said there are people who say. But others say that is a cheesy journalistic practice. 

[00:39:44]


>> It still works. They are still making the big money. 
>> I agree. 
>> Harris, you said if governor huck uh key -- huck uh be wants to get his sights on something he finishes it. Couldn't you say the same thing about governor christie and a bucket of chicken? 
>> I don't know what he likes other than donuts and ice cream. If he decided he want to do something about his weight, he would do it. 
>> You are probably right. 
>> He should have said this. I am fine the way I am. If I get to a point where i can changing it, I change it. He nee to refer to himself as 2phat where the 2 is the number and the phat with a p-h. You get the two chains and the old school people because you have phat with a p-h. 
>> The kids want to call them fatty boom boom. 
>> It was not the fact of his weight, but the answer to the question. I don't know how it got this way. 
>> Is it not possible he wept to bed on a thursday and was in perfect shape and then woke up friday and was huge. 
>> You think it is impossible, but it doesn't make it impossible. I have seen weirder things. 
>> Is that what happened to that shirt you are wear ?G. 
>> Then you turned that mil j fox from 1987? 
>> Yep. 
>> Are we done here? Momentum killer 2012. Coming up, where do kittens come from? Not a story, just something lou dobbs sent me. But first, is facebook making people fatter? It is according to facebook is making people fatter.Com. That's where I get all my news. 

[00:44:35]


>>> Will it be a thorn for fans of porn? Google has modified its filter to make it harder to stumble on to sexy, sexy content accidentally. We have all been there. If you are looking for adult con at the present time you can find it without having to change the default setting. You may just need to be more explicit in your query if your search terms are am ambiguous 
-- am ambiguous? 
>> That's one of my daughters. 
>> Am ambiguous is kinky. Let's discuss in the -- 
>> lightning rooooooouuuuuunnnnndddd. Lightning round. 
[Applause]. 
>> You find porn by accident every day. 
>> I find that -- I find it behind the high school in the woods. 
>> Those were the good old days. 
>> I think that was good. Back then -- it was hard to find porn. It wase he was rewarded if he found it. 
>> You can stumble on to it. 
>> The next thing you know you have boobies on the screen. 
>> Patrick, accidental porn happens, but we make a joke, but isn't it a bigger problem that is available at all times? 
>> Well, yes. This is a great thing -- true story. Not a joke. I have three daughte they wanted for christmas big teddy bears. 
>> Oh my god. 
>> I made the bad mistake of googling big bears. Let me tell you what comes up when you put in big bears. 
>> Did you see a guy named billy who was 47? 
>> That was a union rally. 
>> You dress them like village people and h them do this you have big bears. Nobody needs to see that ever. Thank you, google. 

[00:46:41]


>> I find it quite entertaining. I get fashion tips from there. 
>> I browse through. 
>> Do you ever believe people find porn by accident? 
>> I know children have found it by accident. Absolutely. So in my household where i have a six-year-old as of this week and a three-year-old i put controls on everything. Have I to not let them play with my ipad until I have turned on the you are a port mode. 
>> But they are savy and they can go through it. 
>> And there are things they might put in -- it is amazing. My three-year-old says to me the other day because she is hearing it on the radio now and I have to be conscious from the gingham style video she's sexy and she know itself. Children learn. 
>> And any search terms that are anyway, shape or form related will bring something up that they will never, ever, ever see. 
>> Google popsicle. See what comes up on. 
>> Well now I have to. 
>> You made the statement a few moments ago that all of us have been there. Not everybody at this table has been there. 
>> Bill hasn't been there. His pornonsists of drawings that he does on the cardboard box he sleeps in. 
>> I have gotten rid of the bloggers. Let me tell you the reason god made it. Why he made a laptop and google. 
>> I am watching tv. Gabrielle reece, I wonder -- gabrielle reece, nude, oh yes, 1988. That is why computers exist. This is why I go home every night. I don't have a girlfriend. But have I my google image search and I want to know if there was a topless seen in 1989. 
>> The most important thing is I met gabby reece. She was the olympic volleyball player. 
>> Shoot, I am thinking of somebody else. 

[00:48:42]


>> She did pose nude. She did pose nude. Look it up, oh wait you can't. Go to bing. Bad move on your part, google. 
>>> We have to take a break. Don't leave now. There is more to talk about i think, I hope. 

[00:53:01]


>>> New studies linked facebook to over eating and over spending. It had a higher body mass index and creredit cardebt. It can lead to less self-control in other areas of your life. Pretend it makes sense, everybody. Sherrod, does this make sense, and should mark zuckerberg be arrested? 
>> I always said he should be arrested. 
>> And you are over eating, you are over spending because are you buying food you don't need. 
>> I guess. 
>> Or is this a foolish story. 
>> Patrick, you think this is true? The whole internet in general? You are sitting there, of course you will gain weight. 
>> I think now we know why chris christie is fat. Obama spends too much, and that explains both of those. 
>> Harris? 
>> That's good for me. 
>> Well this truly has become a bad story too. 
>> I don't think I know anybody who trolls facebook. Who does that? 
>> You go on and see what somebody says and get off 
>> you post your behind the scenes with greg gutfeld and theang pictures. 
>> By the way we had slept pictures of the -- excellent pictures of the bus tour on facebook. 
>> I am getting fat just thinking about it. 
>> The disturbing thing in this story is people get this artificial sense of self-esteem by being on facebook. If you are getting self-esteem from facebook, you mayd to talk to somebody. 
>> That's a great idea for teenage girls out there. If they want to get their friend or frenemy they go on facebook page and like, like, like,e. Oh that's great. Another dorito. The next thing you know twenty pounds later and no boyfriend and greasy skin to boot. Think about it. 
>> In another life you were a mean girl. 
>> I definitely was. 

[00:55:03]


>> And in another life I mean three years ago. We have to take a break. He did. He had surgery three years ago. He was a mean girl. Post game wrap up. I hope he reads from a book. 

[00:58:39]


>>> See you back here at 5:00 p.M. Eastern. And then o'reilly at 8:00 p.M. With remi spencer. Who is that? 
>> Back to tv's andy levy for the post game wrap up. 
>> Thanks. 
>> How is that show on the weekend going? 
>> We continue to be number one in our time slot in all of cable. We are happy, fox report weekend 7:00 p.M. Eastern and 4:00 p.M. Pacific, be there. 
>> Outstanding. Patrick, where is camilla? 
>> Go past atlanta and hit florida and back up and find to where and turn right. 
>> It sounds like my life. 
>> Wow. 
>> Is that a person or a town that you just gave directions to? 
>> It is a town with five stoplights. Four stoplights. 
>> Wow, okay, cool. 
>> Sherrod, what is up with you and katie couric and joy behar.

[Whining] no way. I'm through with rides. 
Emily Elizabeth: Come on, clifford. Hey... How about this? "Larry's amazing animals." Well, at least nothing's moving. Come on. Ooh. I can't wait. 
Cleo: Shh. It's starting. Hello there, ladies and gentlemen. My name is larry gablegobble, and I'm proud to present to you the most amazing animals you'll ever see under one roof! 
[Drum roll] and now I present to you a powerhouse pooch... A musclebound mutt... That ripped-up rover... Rodrigo... Chihuahua of steel. 
[All laugh] don't let his size fool you, folks. He may be small, but this pup packs a punch. 

[00:04:10]


[Grunts] 
[gasps] whoa. 
[All groan] are we having fun yet? Ok. I'd like to present our next act featuring another courageous creature. Ladies and gentlemen, let's give it up for dirk, the extreme dachshund. 
All: Aah! 
[All gasp] come on, people. Let's give it up for that daredevil dirk. 
[All groan] and now the grand finale. I'm proud to present to you dorothy, the daring cow, starring in "high wire heifer." You can do this. You've done it before. Keep your head up. Eyes on the sky. Don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. I ask you, is she not udderly cow-rageous? 
[Laughs] this is so lame. 
Cleo: This is so-- amazing! And now, if that isn't daring enough, I proudly introduce the star of our show, shackelford, the high-flying ferret. 
[Funky hip-hop plays] 
Crowd: Whoa! Whoa! 

[00:06:11]


Boy: Look that. Whoa!

Cleo: Hey... Uhh. Let's go back and get their autographs. Or we can get them to sign something for us. Great idea. Ugh. Hey, guys, you gave it a great try. I'm proud of you. Dirk, that ollie was wicked. And, rodrigo, your power lift has a...Potential. Dorothy, your act... Brought down the house. And you, shackelford, the shining star of the show. You were the best. Uh, larry? Back in a while, gang. What do you think p.T. Wants? 
Dorothy: He probably loved the show so much that he wants us to start doing 2 shows a night. 
Dirk: Definitely. 
P.T.: This is not a personal decision, larry. It's a business decision. You know why I'm here, so I'm just gonna cut to the chase. Your show is failing. All I'm asking for is a little more time, p.T. Larry, we've had this conversation a hundred times. If you take back the tent and this bus, where would my animals live? You haven't made a dime in years. 
[Sighs] my carnival is not a charity. The show's gotten better. That's not my point. I know how much you care for them. I know how much your animals need you. I'm all they've got. Larry, I just don't think I can give you any more time. All I need is 3 more weeks. 3 weeks? What can you do in 3 weeks that you haven't done in 3 years? Come here. I'll show you. 
[Sighs] 
Larry: Watch this. Introducing tummy yummies pet talent contest. I'm george wolfsbottom, ceo of the tummy yummies corporation, and this is my daughter madison. Howdy, y'all! We're looking for the most talented pets in the country. Think your animal has the stuff? My talent scouts might, too. You and your pet could win fame, fortune, d a lifetime supply of tummy yummies. So keep an eye out for us-- and we'll keep an eye out for y'all. That's it? That's your plan? Yeah. Pretty good, huh? 

[00:10:33]


[Sighs] larry, how do you even know this contest is for real? Oh, it's been everywhere. Check this out. What's this? It's a magazine ad. The final competition is in 3 weeks. I just know my animals can pull it off. 3 weeks? Ok. 3 weeks. After that, the bus, the tent, everything goes back to me. Understand? Thanks, p.T. You're a real friend. Or a real fool. Ohh. Fame, fortune, lifetime supply of tummy yummies. Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man, have I got news for you. What's that? This, my dear dorothy, is our destiny. Oh...Destiny...Cool. It's a contest that we are going to win. What kind of contest? Oh, a contest for talented, unique, amazing animals. Hey, like, that's us. I'll bet our show can win it. We are amazing, aren't we? Totally. With our current act? No. Reality check, guys. We need to think outside the cage. We need something new. Ha! Something the people have never seen before. Ha! Are you with me? We need something big. Hey! We need something big. I need something-- something big. I need-- 
[sniffs] 
[sniffs] hello there. Aah! Oh, please. Oh, please. Please. I'm just a ferret. There's no good meat on me. I don't want to eat you. No? Then what you want? Just your autograph. My what?

[00:13:01]


Cleo: You must all lead such exciting lives. Well...I don't think that we particularly-- of course we do. Between the shows, the travel, the crowds of adoring fans... Ha ha. Yeah, it's pretty cool. 
All: Wow. How about you guys? You in the biz? Well, I don't like to brag or anything, but it's often been said that I do have... Oh, you know...Talent. Yeah, yeah. I kind of picked up on that vibe. So would y'all be interested in joining our cast? 
All: What? You mean be in your show? That's just the beginning. I'm talking about tv. Have you guys ever heard of tummy yummies? Oh, it's my favorite! 
[Slurp] ha ha! Well, check this out. They're having a talent contest in 3 weeks. The winners getfame, fortune, and a lifetime supply of tummy yummies. Wow. I can go grab larry right now and sign you up. It's no problem. Oh, thank you, but we could never-- just pass up an offer like this. Clifford, t-bone, doggie conference outside now, please. We'll be right back. Guys, I think we should consider this. What? I'd never leave emily elizabeth. Or sheriff lewis. And what about mrs. Diller? You'd really miss her. Gee, I hadn't thought about that. It'sjust...It all seems so exciting. So, uh, is there a problem? Sorry, guys. It sounds like fun. We're sticking around here, but thanks, anyway. 
Dorothy: Ok. Hey, man, wait. Take this little souvenir with you, and in case you change your mind, WE'LL BE WITH P.T.'s CARNIVAL Tomorrow night on the mainland. Thanks. Well, take care, you guys. I'm sure we'll see you again next year. 
Dirk: Ok. 
Dorothy: Ok. Sure thing. 
Rodrigo and Dorothy: Bye-bye. Bye. Ohh... So close, yet so far. 

[00:15:23]


[Yawns] good morning, clifford. How are you, boy? 
[Laughs] ready for breakfast? Woof! I'll be down in a minute, ok, pal? 
[Rings bicycle bell] 
[ring ring] 
[ring ring] there you go, boy. Tummy yummies. I'll be back with more. Would you look at the size of that dog's breakfast? Morning, mom. Morning, dad. 
Mom: Good morning, sweetheart. Morning, clifford. Ruff ruff! 
Dad: Good morning, horace. You know, I just don't know how you do it year after year. Do what? Feed that dog. Look at him. He's got one big appetite. 
Dad: Big? It's huge. How much does he eat a year? Uh...Well... Clifford eats quite a lot. I can't imagine trying to keep up with that appetite. I'll bet he eats more in a week than all the pets on birdwell island eat in a year. 
Dad: Yes, but-- he's like a bottomless pit. Why, he'll eat you out of house and home. 
Mom: Oh, I wouldn't-- feeding him must be a big problem. 
Dad: Problem? Well, it isn't always easy. 
Mom: Well, that's for sure, but we love clifford. He's one of the family. 
Dad, voice over: Clifford packs quite an appetite. 
Horace, voice over: How much does he eat a year? 
Mom, voice over: Clifford eats quite a lot. 
Horace, voice over: Feeding him must be a big problem. How can you afford to feed that dog? He eats so much. Problem? Well, uh, we mortgaged the house. The winners get fame, fortune, and a lifetime supply of tummy yummies. 
[Gasps] that's it! 
[Both growling] 
Cleo: Hey, clifford. How's it-- hey, that ad. Where's that ad for larry's amazing animals? Over there. Why? What do you need that for? I'm a problem. Mr. Bleakman said so. I eat too much, and they can't afford to feed me. 

[00:17:36]


Cleo: What? Maybe you misunderstood him. I'm always misunderstanding things. You don't say. No, t-bone. I heard him loud and clear. I'm gonna join larry's show and win that tummy yummies contest. And leave emily elizabeth? Not forever, just long enough to win a lifetime supply of food. Clifford, are you sure? I mean, maybe if you waited... I can't wait, t-bone. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm leaving. Good-bye, you guys. Bye, big guy. Bye. Hey, boy. You get a good night's sleep, ok? Woof. I love you, cljfford.

[Rings bicycle bell] any luck? Nope. Did you go by the lighthouse? Check. The park? Double-check. I talked to mrs. Diller and sheriff lewis. They said cleo and t-bone are missing, too. Weird. It'slike they're not even on the island anymore. 
[Gasps] I think you're right. Look. Where do you think he went? I don't know, but I do know he's with cleo and t-bone. I don't get it. Why would they leave? I wish I knew. 
[Panting] 
[both panting] can we rest for a minute? I'm thirsty. I'm sorry, guys. It's just that if we don't catch up to the carnival tonight, we'll never find them. Ahh. 
[Yawns] you know, a catnap wouldn't hurt. Can dogs take catnaps? We can't rest here. I gotta stay out of sight. Hey, why don't we stop over there where that carnival is shutting down? Carnival? Carnival? Over there. See? Whoo-hoo! Uh--uh, guys? What about me? Whoa-ho-ho! Wait! I found it first! This thing won't shut. Ok, gang. Plan number "b." We gotta pack all over again. Aah! Holy cow! You guys are back! Amigos! We never thoug we'd find you guys. So, bitten by the showbiz bug after all, huh? Uh-huh. Yes! I knew it. No one in their right mind can resist the glow of the spotlight. [Gasps] you--you-- uh-oh. What is it? You've got tags. Larry would never take you if you already have a family. We're all strays. He only takes in strays. What? These old things? Ha ha ha! They're from, like, 5 owners ago. We've had these for years. Well, I just got mine-- zip it. Oh! These old things? We just keep them to fool the dog catcher. 

[00:26:53]


[Laughs] oh, yeah. Yeah. Smart. Ok, now. Don't move. I'll go get larry. 
Rodrigo: Ok. Fantastico. Fantastico. Fantastico. Finally, a girlfriend! I'm so excited! Oh--oh--oh--we'll make friendship bracelets and trade lip gloss-- 
[gasps] and bake snickerdoodles. Cool. Ok. Ok, shack. Show me what's so important. [Gasps] ha ha! I don't believe it! He's huge! We can sure use a big red dog in our show, eh, shack? Hmm. Need a home, guys? Well, hey, um... Welcome to the family. Whoa--ho. And, shackelford, good job, pal. You always come through for us. 
Larry: And that lovable little mutt went on to fame and fortune 
as the star of his own movie: Benji. The first of 4 feature films as well as subsequent tv movies and even his own television series. 
[Yawns] I'm such a softie for that story. 
[Honk] no one knew his craft like benji. He's the reason I'm in the business. 
[Sighs] 
[sighs] isn't showbiz great? Huh? Oh, yeah. Really...Great. 
T-bone: The best. It's a good thing we're having such a good time, and we're not... Homesick or anything. Yeah, right. Right. ??????

Shackelford: Oh, no! Aah! Let's go! 
All: Aah! Woof woof! Whoa! Oh! Aah! Whoo! Whoo--ow! Cool, dude. Why, ladies and gentlemen, it's big red to the rescue. 
[All cheering] hmph! Beginner's luck. Yay! Cool, man! That was, like, way rad, big red. That's our clifford. The greatest. Oh, you're my hero, clifford. Thank you. Ah, thanks. I was just helping, that's all. 
[Door opens] hey, well done, clifford, my man. That was one lucky break. We were all a tail wag away from disaster. Good stuff, good stuff. But let's not let that happen again, right, team? We can't depend on an accident to save the show. So, dorothy, dorothy, dorothy... You know you my girl, right? And I know that soon you are going to really master this act that we've been over 100 times. You just need to practice and not look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Right, shackelford. And you, dirk. Every heard of too much of a good thing? Well, now you have. Gotta ease up on the throttle. Does that thing have a downshift? Whoa. But, bro, I got a need for speed. You need not end up in the audience every show. What about me, shackelford? How did I do? Ha ha! You, my little amigo, need to focus on keeping those weights up, up, up, instead of down, down, down. You almost flattened me like a tortilla. Perdon. Uh, shackelford? Did we do ok? Ok? Yes, you did ok. We all did ok, but "ok" is not enough. "Ok" does not dazzle, "ok" does not delight, and "ok" does not-- I repeat-- does not win contests! We need to be-- fantastic! That was truly amazing. That was our best show ever. Big red, you stole the show. If you guys keep up what you did out there tonight, we'll be sure to make it into that contest. And thanks to big red, I bet we can win it. Ha ha! Thanks, pal. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have big red. Do we get the tummy yummies soon? 

[00:34:57]


[Sighs] hello? I'm calling to report 3 lost dogs. The first one is extremely friendly, red, and he's as big as a house. No, I am not crazy! Don't worry, we'll find him. I know we will. Thanks, mr. B. Oh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Help! Whoo! Hi, dorothy.

Oh, I'm just-- I'm j-- can I tell you a secret? Sure. I have this little problem with heights. Really? You do? Well, I know it's hard to believe. I mean, I make it look so easy out there, but it is not. I mean, I get scared when I'm up there, and then I mess up, and now I'm all worried that I'm gonna ruin our chances to win the big contest and everyone will be so disappointed, and I just feel awful. Well, back home, whenever emily eliz-- who? Uh, whenever a friend of mine felt bad, I'd gi her a ride. A ride always helped make her feel better. All right. Really? Well, can I try?

[00:39:39]


[Whistles] hey, guys! Come here! Dorothy, shackelford, come over and have a look. Ahem. Ruff! Ta-da! 
[Gasps] isn't it great? 
[Dogs barking happily] pretty good, don't you think? 
[Dogs yip happily] thanks to all of you, this show has become better than I ever imagined. Who would've thought we'd come this far, this fast, huh? I guess you knew, though, huh? That big dog makes a big difference. Hmm. 
[Grunts] mr. Gablebottom? That's gablegobble. Gable like clark, gobble like turkey. Congratulations. I'm a representative of mr. George c. Wolfsbottom, c.E.O. Of the tummy yummies corporation. You've been chosen to compete in our national animal talent contest. 
[Gasps] [gasps] w-w-where? When is it? Tomorrow night. Shangri-large. This is it, you guys! This is the big-- this is the big break we've been waiting for. We're gonna make it! I've gotta call p.T. Woo-hoo! Where's shackelford? He's gotta hear this. Hey, shackelford! Hey, you missed the big news. Always with the "big." A guy from tummy yummies told larry we get to perform in the contest tomorrow night. Fame, fortune, and tummy yummies, here we come. Oh, yay, yay, yay. What's the matter? Aren't you happy? Happy? Oh, I'm happy for you. After all, isn't this what it's all about? You? You and your tummy yummies? Yeah, that's exactly what I've been hoping for. You know, I wonder what's bigger, you or your stomach? What do you mean? You heard me loud and clear. Tummy yummies! Tummy yummies! Now do I get my tummy yummies? Where are my tummy yummies? Am I there yet? I need my tummy yummies. Sound familiar? Well, i--i'm sorry. I--i-- no, no, no, no, pal. I'm the one who's sorry. I should have never asked you to join up with us, anyway. We were all better off without you. 

[00:41:59]


[Gasps] hmph! Hmph! 
Cleo: Clifford! Clifford! Clifford! There you are! Where were you? You missed a great rehearsal. Yeah. Check out our new trick. Ta-da! Mm-hmm. Ok, spit it out. I'm going home. We're all going after we win the contest tomorrow, right? No. I'm going home now. What?! Clifford, what about the contest and the lifetime supply of tummy yummies? And helping emily elizabeth? I miss emily elizabeth, and I'm going home. But larry and the animals need you. Shackelford said they were better off without me. But that's not true. You're the best thing that's ever happened to them. Oh, it doesn't matter anymore. Are you guys coming with me? Of course. Yeah, we're a team, right? Yeah, we gotta... Stick together. Birdwell island, here we come! 
Cleo: Good-bye, fame. Good-bye, glamour. 
T-Bone: Good-bye, amazing animals. 
[Yawns] blech! 
Larry: Big red! [Whistles] 
[whistles] big red! Poufy! Little guy! Yoo-hoo! Where are you? Hey, guys, I can't find big red, puffy, or little guy. I think they left us. They didn't even bother to say, "later, dude." Why would they do that? Hmm. Good question. Any idea why they'd leave, shackelford? What's it matter, anyway? Huh? Just goes to show you who your friends are. Like I always say, you've to go with what you got. I never heard you say that. We were fine before clifford. Yeah, but fine doesn't win contests. Bad news, guys. It looks like they're gone. I hope they're all right, wherever they are. Look, gang, I know everyone's upset. This isn't the way we would've wanted it, but the show must go on. We're going to shangri-large, and we'll find them after the show. Emily elizabeth, here I come. It's gonna be great to be back home, isn't it, t? Yeah. It's too bad we're not going back with the tummy yummies, though. Well, at least we're going back to where we're appreciated. Right, cleo? Right. I thought they were pretty nice to us. And that larry sure was a great guy. He took good care of everyone. Yeah, he sure did. Too bad. Now they'll never win the contest. 

[00:45:21]


[Swallows] no clifford, no cleo? No way. Sure, they will. Are you kidding? They'll never win without you. They don't stand a chance. Hey, gang. Take a look at that. Shangri-large! Whoo-hoo! We made it! Tummy yummies, here we come! Nothing can stop us now! Uh...Uh-oh. Oh, no. Please, no. No, no, no. Not again. Don't do this to me-- not today. Oh, please, please, please, baby. Sit tight while I check it out. I'm sure it's nothing. That sounded bogus. It's just the thingamajigger. You see? It's-- 
[coughs] not so bad. [Coughs] great, just great. What are we gonna do now? Well, at least things couldn't get any worse. Hmm. Don't worry, guys. Aah! Hey, don't worry! Here I come. We're moving! Yeah, backwards! Aah! What the--[gasps] yahoo! Big red to the rescue! 
[Excited animal noises] cool! Hey, guys. Welcome back. Hi, dorothy. Hey, girlfriend. Thank you for coming back, clifford. It really means a lot to us. And even to shackelford. 

[00:47:31]


[Whimpers] 
[scoffs] I'm not so sure, dorothy. Listen, I know that he was pretty harsh to you yesterday. I think he's just feeling...Replacedyou. Replaced? How? All I wanted to do was help. I know. I know, clifford. It's not your fault. He's just not the most secure ferret in the world. But he means well. Whatever, dorothy. 
Clifford: Woof woof! Wow! Did you see that? 
Dirk: Rock on, dude! 
Announcer: And now, ladies and gentlemen, before we present the final act, I'd like to introduce the man who made this incredible show possible. Daddy! Madison. What is it, honey? Have you made up your mind? No. They're all lame. And now, without further ado, mr. George c. Wolfsbottom. Aw. I'll be right back, sweetie. Remember, you promised. 
[Clifford barks] 
[gasps] now we're talkin'! Woo-ee! That's a whole lot of red. And now, for our final act of the evening, a traveling animal show that has toured all over the country. Let's give it up for larry's amazing animals. Aah! Whoa! 

[00:49:50]


[Crowd applauds] 
[crowd applauds] 
Cleo: Ta-da! Asp] 
[crowd applauds] 
Announcer: That-- that dog is incredible. He's humongous! I've never seen anything like him. Clifford! 
[Telephone rings] hello? Oops. [Rings] uh, hello? Yes, I know. I saw it, too! My little puff-ball on tv. And the winner of the tummy yummies talent contest is... 

[00:52:00]


[Air seeps from balloon] 
[gulps] larry's amazing animals! Yes! We did it! We did it! You did it! You guys! You guys are the best! Good boy. I could never have done it without you! Can I get an autograph!? 
[Overlapping shouts] one over here! One over here, please! 
Larry: Well, here you go. Hey! Hello! Who do I make this out to? Thank you. No, thank you. Thank you, gablegobble. For what? For signing the contract. What's going on? What is this? That, partner, is our deal. But you didn't give me a chance to-- gablegobble, listen to me. You just won the contest. I didn't even read it first. Shouldn't I know what's in it before I sign it? Don't you want fame? Well, yes. Fortune? Of course. And a lifetime supply of tummy yummies? Yes! Then a deal's a deal. Mano a mano. You and your animals will be living it up in the wolfsbottom royal suite. We'll discuss the details later. In the meantime, enjoy the best the hotel has to offer. Hear that, gang? We did it! We--we hit the big time! Ha ha ha! They like us! They really, really like us! Uh, guys? Guys! Where's big red? Stop! Stop! 
[Gasps] big red. 

[00:54:07]


[Dogs barking] don't worry, guys. This isn't over yet. Contract or no contract, I'm gonna get big red back, no matter what. 
[Madison laughs] daddy, you did it! You did it! He's absolutely huge! He goes with my collection perfectly. Yeah, he's somethin', all right. He's gotta be the biggest dang dog I've ever seen. And he's mine! All mine! I've even got the perfect name. Clancy! 
[Cell phone rings] duty calls, sweetie. Come on, clancy. Come see my collection, boy! Come on! Hmm? 
The world's biggest doll house: Check. 
The world's biggest carousel: Check. 
And now the world's biggest dog: Check. Isn't it great? You're gonna love it here. Everything's just your size. Ok, clancy. Let's play pony ride. Ya-hoo! Go, clancy! Go! Ha ha ha! Ahem. You guys relax. I'm calling wolfsbottom. We'll get big red back, before you know it. ?????? Wow! Party time ?????? ?????? party up a good time ?????? ?????? party time ?????? ?????? ow! Like hollywood time ?????? ooh! Check it out! A water bed! Woo-hoo! Sure beats a lumpy seat in the back of the bus, huh, gang? Ooh, finally, the sweet smell of success. 

[00:56:29]


[Sniffs] mmm. Or is it snacks? Whoa! Snacks galore! And it's all free! Who wants popcorn? Hmm. Hey, dorothy. Look, girl. Non-dairy creamer. No, thanks, I'm not hungry. Rodrigo, mi hermano, guava cactus, baby! Your favorite! No, gracias. What is wrong with you guys? You should be happy. I don't know, shackelford. It just doesn't seem right without clifford. Again with clifford? Clifford's the best! He believed in us! Yeah. He should be here with us, man. He made me feel so...Dainty. All he cared about was the food. He was only in it for the eats. Once he won it, he was out of here. He didn't care about us. He was in it for himself. Everything that dog did was just for himself. He did it for emily el-- huh? Uh-oh. Who is emily [imitates muffled speech]? Emily elizabeth! She's his owner back on birdwell island. 
[Gasps] but you said you didn't have families. You said these tags were fake and you only use 'em to fool the dogcatcher. Why would you make that up? Because you said larry wouldn't take us in if we had owners. Clifford really needed to win that dog food to help emily elizabeth and the howards. We had no other choice! Aw, man. So all big red wanted was to help out his family. I messed up, guys. I guess it's not your fault. You just didn't know. But now I do. Let's go. Where? To see a man about a dog. You dog-napped big red, and I want him back! Well, that's too bad, because clancy just loves his new life of luxury. He's a wolfsbottom now. 

[00:59:03]


[Hangs up] hey, buddy. What's the matter? 
[Gasps] you-- you have owners? We have a dog to fetch. 
[Telephone rings] 
Girl: Hello? Are you, by chance, the owner of a very large, very red dog? Morning. Howdy. Who are you here to see, sir? I'm larry gablegobble, and I'm here to see mr. Wolfsbottom. What about? Uh--ha ha ha!

- [giggling] 
[big bird and snuffy laughing] 
- so the guy says, snuffy--the guy says-- 
- what, what? 
- I thought it was in the winnebago. 
- Ha ha ha! 
- Oh, look, snuffy, look. 
- What, what? 
- Hi. - Oh, hi. Welcome to sesame street. Ha ha ha! 
- Yeah. Well--oh! 
- Whoa! - Wow! What do you think that is? 
- Gee. I don't know, bird. 
- I do! It's "the sesame street letter of the day show"! 
- [Applause] 
- wow! 
- With your hosts big bird and snuffy! 
- Wow. Hey. That's us, snuff! 
- We've got our own game show, bird. 
- Yay! But what do we do? 
- As hosts of "the letter of the day show," you'll introduce the letter of the day... Meet the special "letter of the day show" guests... And sing a song about the letter of the day! 
- Wow! That sounds like an awful lot, bird. Do you think we can really do all that? 
- Aw, sure. Why, we could do anything if we stick together, old pal. 
- You're right, old friend. 
- Are you ready to start? 
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes! 
- I'm ready. 
- What's the letter of the day then? 
- We're about to find out. Today's letter is behind this curtain! 
- Ohh. 
- Well, how do we open it? 
- Just grab that rope. 
- Ok. Got it. 
- And pull, but first... Drumroll, please! 
[Drumroll] 
- oh, bird! I'm so excited! 
- Me, too. I can't wait to see what letter it is. 

[00:04:22]


[Crash] uh-oh. Did you just hear a crash? 
- Uh, it sounded like something fell, bird. 
- Quick! Pull the rope! 
[Audience groans] 
- where's the, uh, letter of the day? 
- Look! 
- Oh, no! What happened? 
- Looks like the letter of the day fell over, and it broke! 
- Ohh, no. Now we can't have our "letter of the day show." 
- Nonsense! The show must go on! 
- But the letter broke. 
- Well, as my granny bird always said, ift's broke, fix it. 
- Smart granny bird. They're gonna fix the letter of the day! 
[Cheering and applause] 
- uh-oh. 
- Or maybe not! 
- What's the matter, bird? 
- Well, we don't know what the letter was before it broke, snuffy. 
- That's right. How do we put it back together if we don't know what letter it was in the first place? 
- Sounds impossible! 
- But we've got to try. There must be a way to figure out what this letter was. Let's think, snuffy. Think. 
[Knock] 
- better think fast! It's time to meet the "letter of the day show" guests! 
- Guests? Guests! That's it! 
- What's it, bird? 
- The "letter of the day show" guests must have something to do with the letter of the day. 
- That makes sense. 
- So if the guests will be like clues, they'll help us figure out what this letter was. 
- Bird, I think you've just had a brainstorm! 
- Yes! It is a good idea! So bring on the special guests. 
- Your first special guest of the day is a box! 
- [Cheering and applause] 
- thank you, thank you. Ha ha! 

[00:06:26]


- A box. That's our first clue, snuffy. So why is a box on "the letter of the day show"? 
- Maybe there's something inside the box, bird. 
- Good idea. Let's look. 
- Hmm. Nope, nope. Nothing inside. What do we do now? 
- Try thinking outside the box. 
- Ooh! 
- Ha ha ha! 
- Ok. Let's see. Bbb, bbb, box stars with the letter "b". 
- I'll bet the letter "b" is the letter of the day, bird. 
- So let's put it back together! 
- They figured it out! 
[Cheering and applause] 
- uh-oh. 
- Oh, no, they didn't! 
- What's the matter, bird? 
- Ohh. Look at the pieces of the broken letter snuffy. 
- It's 2 straight lines, bird. 
- Yeah. That means that the letter of the day has 2 straight lines, right? 
- Right. 
- And let's think what the letter "b" has. 
- Hmm. The letter "b" has 1 straight line and 2 curvy lines for the bumps. 
- But there are no curvy pieces here. 
- So that means that the letter "b" can't be the letter of the day. Oh, dear. What do we do now? 
- Well, we need another clue, so send in the next guest. 
- The next "letter of the day guest" is wax! 
- Thank you, thank you. 
- Wax. Why wax? - Ooh. 
- Sorry. Can't hear you. I've got wax in my ears. 
[Laughter] 
- wax. Www, www. Wax stars with "w". 
- Yeah, and the letter "w" is all straight lines. 
- They figured it out! 
[Cheering and applause] 
- uh-oh. - Ooh! No. No, they--no, they didn't. 

[00:08:27]


- What's the matter now, bird? 
- Well, snuffy, look. There are only 1, 2 straight lines here. 
- Oh, dear, and the letter "w" has 1, 2, 3, 4 straight lines. Ohhhhh. 
- Yeah. So "w" is not the letter of the day either. 
- Gosh! This is hard, bird! 
- Well, maybe the next guest will help. 
- The next guest is tyrannosaurus rex! 
- [Cheering and applause] aww. 
- Rawwr! 
- Leela?! - Leela?! Why are you dressed in a tyrannosaurus rex costume? 
- It's the only way I could get on the show. Plus I really like dressing like a dinosaur. 
- Not just any dinosaur, a tyrannosaurus rex! 
- Yeah. - Heh heh heh. 
- Yeah, but, snuffy, it's too hard. We're never gonna figure this out. 
- Bird, you said it yourself. If we stick together, we can do this. 
- But, snuffy, the clues don't make any sense. They all start with different letters--box, wax, tyrannosaurus rex. 
- Wait a minute, bird. Say those words again. 
- Why? Box, wax, tyrannosaurus rex. 
- Yeah. Do you notice that they all kind of sound the same at the end? Box, wax, rex. 
- Yeah. Hey. Snuffy, I think you just had a brainstorm! 
- I did? - Yes! Now we know these words don't start with the same letter, but maybe they end with the same letter. 
- Are you saying that these words may end with the letter of the day? 
- Yes. Leela, quick. What is the last letter in tyrannosaurus rex? 

[00:10:31]


- Ooh. The letter "x". 
- How about box and wax? 
- "X" and "x". 
- I think we may be on to something here. 
- Me, too, snuff, but we have to be sure. Leela, will you help us check? Absolutely! 
- See? We need to see if these two straight lines can make the letter "x". 
- Ooh. They can. Watch this. We just need to cross them in...The...Middle like that. 
- Oh, wow! 
- The letter "x"! 
- It's the letter of the day. 
- They did it! They figured it out! 
- Yay! - Yay! Oh, yay! 
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Guys, you're gonna knock it over. 
- Oh. Hey. You know what? - Hmm? 
- We could always fix it again. 
- Ha ha ha! 
- Hey. Fix. Fix has that same sound at the end. 
- Mm-hmm. That is because fix also ends in the letter "x," and that is not all. 
- There's more? - There's fox. 
- Hello! 
- My good buddy tex. 
- Yee-ha! 
- And tex's pet ox. 
- Moooo! 
- Yeah. His name is max! 
- Wow! So many words end in that "x". 
- What a wonderful letter. 
- That's why it's me to sing "the letter of the day song." 
- Oh, boy. Care to join us, leela? 
- I'd love to. 
- ?????? How do you make a letter "x" ? ?????? ?????? now that's an easy riddle ?????? 
- ?????? take 2 straight lines ?????? ?????? and cross them exactly in the middle ?????? 
- ?????? sometimes it's hard to find an "x" ?????? ?????? they're not just anywhere ?????? 
- ?????? but check the end of all these words ?????? 
- ?????? and you'll find "x" is there ?????? 
- ?????? oh, oh ?????? ?????? ox and fox and fix and six ?????? ?????? are words that end in "x" ?????? 

[00:12:36]


- ?????? and box and wax and ?????? 
- ?????? tex and max ?????? 
- ?????? tyrannosaurus rex, yes ?????? 
- ?????? and also lox and paradox ?????? 
- ?????? so listen closely, friend ?????? 
- ?????? and when you're spelling all these words ?????? 
- ?????? PUT Xs AT HE END ?????? 
- ?????? Hooray for "x," hooray for "x" ?????? 
- ?????? the very last letter in multiplex ?????? 
- ?????? say, can you hear us shout hooray ?????? ?????? for the "sesame street" letter of the day? ?????? ?????? "x" ?????? 
- [cheering and applause] ooh! 
- Well, we did it, bird, the best "letter of the day show" ever! 
- We can do anything if we stick together, old pal. 
- You are right, old friend. 
- Oh, snuff. Heh heh heh. 
- Ha ha ha! 
- Hi. I'm maya. 
- Ooh. And elmo's elmo. 
- And we're here to tell you all about the word brainstorm. Now the word brainstorm means a sudden idea about something. 
- Yep! 
- Hey, elmo. What else can we do to explain the word brainstorm? Hmm. - Hmm. Ahh! - Ahh! What? 
- Well, elmo just had a sudden idea. 
- Oh. You mean, you had a... - Mm-hmm. 
- Brainstorm! 
- Yeah! - Well, what is it, elmo? What's your sudden idea? 
- Well, elmo and miss maya can rap, rap about the word brainstorm. 
- Oh, awesome idea. Let's do it. 
- Yeah! 
- ?????? Go tell your aunt susie ?????? ?????? tell your uncle norm ?????? ?????? a sudden idea is called a brainstorm ?????? ?????? bbb, bbb, bbb, bbb, brainstorm ?????? ?????? bbb, bbb, bbb, bbb, brainstorm ?????? ?????? yeah, boy ??????

- Well, we can do a little brainstorm song and dance. 
- Oh. Elmo thinks that idea sounds like fun. Hit it. 
- ?????? When it's cold ?????? ?????? or when it's warm ?????? ?????? a sudden idea is called a brainstorm ?????? 
- hee hee! Great singing, miss maya. 
- You, too, elmo. Thank you, but wow. All these brainstorms are making me tired. 
- Elmo, too. Maybe miss maya and elmo should take a nap to rest our brains.

- ha ha ha! 
- Ha ha! 
- Oh? Hmm. Hmm? Ohh. Eep. 

[00:20:57]


- Hello! Welcome to the flying fairy school puppet theater. It's puppet time, so grab a puppet and make it move. 
- Ok, puppet, let's see your moves. Excuse me, puppet? Aah! Oh, no! 
[Gasp] I can't feel a pulse. Go on, breathe, darn you! Breathe! 
- Blogg, you do know that puppet's not alive, don't you? 
- Not on my watch! [Gasp] it worked. It's a miracle. Hey, what are you doing with those strings? 
- Puppets can't move on their own. You got to pull their strings to make them move, like this. 
- I can do that. 
- Well, actually, I think it's more like this. 
- I don't need help. 
- Well, maybe if you-- - ah-ah-ah! I can do it myself. Ooh, this puppet stuff has too many strings attached. I'll just get him to move another way. 
- How? - I'm gonna turn this puppet into a real boy. 
- Oh, that doesn't sound like a good idea. 
- Sure it is. I'll just use the blue fairy special, and I think it goes like this. Go to a luau, eat some poi, and turn this puppet into a real boy. Come on, real boy who was once a puppet. Let's boogie down. Why can't I boogie down? 
- You're a puppet. 
- Nonsense. Puppets are made of wood. 
[Knocking] aah! I'm a puppet! 
- Oh, dear. Looks like someone tried to turn a puppet into a real boy. 
- Don't worry--i can just turn myself back. 
[Grunting] 
- I'm afraid that's impossible even if you could move your arms. You see, the only way to turn a puppet into a real boy is to go through the pinocchio process. 
- What's the pinocchio process? 
- The pinocchio process is a series of steps that goes like this. Hop with a cricket, do the donkey dance of joy, swim with a whale, and you'll become a real boy. 

[00:23:07]


- Looks like we have to find some animals. 
- Yeah. First up, a cricket. 
- I can do that. No problem. 
[Grunting] 
- um, maybe I'd better poof us there. But where do you find a cricket? 
- Well, a cricket's an insect, and I always see insects out in the grass. 
- Then let's get up and get out of class and look for a cricket in the grass. 
- All ri class, let's find a cricket. They look like this. 
- [Cricket chirping] 
- ah, something moved. 
- Oh, is it a cricket? 
- Hey, can't a ladybug get some privacy? 
- A ladybug. Ha. We better keep looking. 
- Something's crawling between my toes! [Giggles] 
- maybe it's a cricket. 
- Yikes. What kind of bug is that? 
- Time for a termite snack. 
- [Gasp] a termite. They eat wood, you know. 
- Eat wood?! 
- [Munch] this wood tastes like feet. Blergh. 
- Ha! What's that sound? 
- [Gasp] it's a cricket! 
- Go, boy! Time to hop! 
- You want us to help pull your strings? 
- Nah. I can do it myself. 
[Grunting] well, you can help if you want, t I definitely do not need it. 
[Grunting] hop, hop, hop. Hop, hop, hop. My legs. They're back to normal. 
- Yay! 
- Darn you! 
- Uh-oh. Why is the rest of blogg's body still puppet? 
- Because blogg has to go through the next step of the pinocchio process-- the donkey dance of joy. 
- Then let us go find a donkey. 
- We don't need a giraffe or a monkey. What we need is a donkey. 
- Come on, donkey. Let us do the donkey dance of joy. 
- [Donkey brays] 

[00:25:08]


- aah! Donkey tells me he does not want to do the donkey dance of joy! 
- Probably because he's a very angry donkey. Aah! What are we gonna do? 
- Maybe we need something to make that donkey happy. 
- But what makes donkeys happy? 
- I don't know! Let's ask spot. 
- Spot. Oh, spot. 
- [Spot barks] 
- oh, hi, spot. How do you make a donkey happy? 
- Fetch, spot, fetch! 
- [Spot barks] 
- hay. Hay. Hay. ??????Go and tell your whole class ?????? ?????? that it comes from the dry grass ?????? ?????? you find it in a haystack ?????? ?????? some animals have it for a snack ?????? ?????? talking about hay, hay...Hay! ?????? 
- [spot barks] - what did that song have to do with donkeys? 
- Let's twinkle think. 
- ?????? Twinkle think, twinkle think ?????? 
- I know. - Yow! 
- I think the donkey is a punk rocker. 
- I think the answer probably has something to do with hay. 
- [Donkey brays] - oh! Oh! Maybe the donkey likes hay. No, that can't be it. 
- Sure it can, gonnigan. The song said animals have hay for a snack. Maybe the donkey's hungry, hungry for hay. 
- Ok, then, listen to what I say. Give us a big plate of hay. 
- It worked! [All cheering] 
- wingwhack. [All cheering] 
- [donkey brays] 
- and the donkey's happy. 
- And he's doing the donkey dance of joy. 
- I got to dance with him. I don't need help. If you insist. 
[Moaning] - [giggling] 
[grunts, sighs] 
- hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw! 
- Wow! It worked. Blogg's arms and wings are back now! 
- But I still have a puppet head. 
- That's because you haven't done the last step of the pinocchio process. You have to swim with a whale. 

[00:27:13]


- And whales live in the ocean, so, let's get our wheels in motion. Poof on down to the ocean. Well, here we are, and there's the whale! 
- Aah! I didn't expect it to be so huge! 
- Now's your chance, blogg. Swim with a whale. 
- Ok! Here I go! 
[Whimpering] 
- what's wrong? 
- I can't do it. 
- Sure you can. Your arms and legs and wings are all back to normal. 
- But I don't know how you swim. 
- Oh, no. 
- Maybe you can ask for something to get you to swim. 
- Ah! How about rocket fins? 
- Blogg... - Ok. I admit it. I can't do this on my own. I need help. 
- You heard him, gonnigan. 
- Ok. I can help. I think. 
- Let's swim! 
- Ha. And reach and pull and a-kick, kick, kick and a-reach and a-pull and a kick-kick-kick. I'm doing it. I'm swimming with a whale! And I'm back to normal! 
- Yay! 
- Thanks, whale, and thank you all. I couldn't have done it without you. 
- You're welcome. 
- Swimming with whales was really cool, but now let's all go back to school. 
- I know a different way to get them to move. 
- No! 
- ?????? Da-dum-da-da-do, da-dum-da-do ?????? 
- great work, blogg. 
- ?????? Da-dum-da-da-do, da-dum-da-do ?????? 
- [laughs] I love puppets. 
- Me, too. - Ha ha. 
- Super grover 2.0 is on the way, but right now, it's time for "number cook-off" with chef murray and chef ovejita! Chef ovejita? Where are you, chef ovejita? 

[00:29:15]


- Hee hee hee! 
- Chef, ovejita, come out of that bowl. We have to cook. 
- Yoo-hoo-hoo! 
- Chef ovejita. - !Si! 
- What number recipe are we making today? 
- Voy por los ingredientes. 
- Great idea! She's off to get the ingredients. Let's see what she brings. 
- Whee! 
- Oh, look at that. We have 1 egg. 
- Uno. 
- In the bowl. - Mm-hmm. 
- What else you got, ovejita? 
- Oh. Nada mas. 
- That's it? - Si. 
- Very minimalist recipe. 
- Si. - See what we're making. 
- Vamos a ver! 
- What is it? Whoa! 
- Hee hee hee! - Ha ha ha! Hey! It's the number 1! 
- Uno! 
- Hey! Let's see more on the number 1. 1. 1. The number 1! 
- Ahem. 
[Hums] ?????? how many birds can sit on this wire? ?????? ?????? before this song is sung? ?????? ?????? the answer, my friend, is-- ?????? 
- 1. 
- ?????? And now my song is done ?????? 1! 
- What superhero is on the way? 
- Super grover 2.0! 
- Yes! 
- He observes. 
- Oh, look! No! No! Aah! 
- He questions. 
- Hubba-wha? 
- He investigates. 
- Hmm. What does this button do? Aah! 
- Super grover 2.0! He shows up! In the peaceful countryside, one lone horse is taking a ride on the road to trouble. 

[00:31:28]


- Oh. I'm not taking a ride at all. This cart...Won't...Move. Help! Help! 
- Have no fear! I am coming to the rescue! 
- Who said that? 
- Aaaaaah! Unh! 
- Super grover, you showed up. 
- No. He did not. Super grover 2.0 did! Now what seems to be the problem? 
- I am trying to take a ride in this cart,ut... It won't move. 
- Aha! So the question we must ask is what will get this cart to move? 
- Yep. That's the question all right. 
- It is time now to unleash the power of observation, vation, vation, vation! 
- Huh? - I will look closely at the cart. 
- Ah. 
- Hmm. Observing, observing. Aha! 
- Ahwha? 
- These look like stick thingies at the front of this cart. 
- So? - So obviously these stick thingies are some sort of switch to turn the cart on. Switch on. Ohh! Ow! Oof. I think we blew a fuse. 
- You know, I'm thinking maybe something's supposed to be in front of this here cart, and maybe those stick thingies are to pull it with. 
- Pull. Hmm. Something to pull it--no problem. Be right back. Here you are. This little worm is just what you need to move this cart. 
- A worm? 
- Precisely. Now go ahead, wormy. Pull the cart. Come on, come on. Put some muscle into it. That's it. That's it. Use your backbone. Pull the cart. 
- Something tells me that that worm doesn't have enough force to pull this cart. 

[00:33:31]


- THE WORM NEEDS 4s? I know where to get some of those. OK, LITTLE WORMY. HERE ARE YOUR 4s. Now move the cart. Come on. 
- No. No, no. I'm not talking about numbers. Force means the strength that you use to move something. We need something with more force. 
- More force. Ah. That means that it's me to activate the wer of investigation. Be right back. Here we are. 
- A chicken? - Yes. You see, this chicken is bigger than the worm. Ergo, I predict it will have more force. Go ahead. Use the force, chicken. 
- [Clucking] 
- what are you doing? No. Chicken, do not eat the worm. Head for the hills, wormy! 
- I can't believe this. 
- Bawk kaw! 
- There, chicken. Now go, and may the force be with you. Pull. 
- [Clucking] 
- well, the cart is moving a little bit. 
- Yeah, but not very much. 
- Bawk kaw! 
- What happened? 
- Behold. The chicken laid an egg. Now she must go on maternity leave. 
- Oh. I guess we need even more force than a chicken to pull this cart. 
- Worry not. Your problem will be solved anon. The force is strong in this one. 
- A pig? 
- Yes. The pig is bigger than the chicken, so I think the big pig will have more force than this little chicken. 
- [Clucking] 
- [oinking] 
- chicken, pig. Makes good horse sense. 
- You are a wriggly one. There. Now pull, pig, pull. 
- Oink oink! Ooooiiiink! 

[00:35:37]


- Mething tells me this pig is oinked out. 
- Oink. 
- No. We'll never get this cart to move! 
- Yes, we can. We just need something even bigger than a pig like a horse. Hey. You are a horse. 
- Well, true, but I was kind of hoping to ride in the cart. 
- Well, then we just need something else bigger than a pig to pull the cart. 
- Say, you're bigger than a pig. Maybe you could pull the cart. 
- Me? Well, I am a force to be reckoned with, i suppose. Heh heh. All right. I will try to use my own force to pull it. Excuse me, pig. 
- [Oinking] 
- all right, super grover 2.0. Giddyap! 
- [Grunting] 
- it's working. It's working! You do have the force to pull the cart! Yee-hawwww! 
- And so our superhero has learned that it takes a lot of force to pull something big and heavy like a cart. 
- This has been a very moving experience. 
- Giddyap, super grover! 
- ?????? Sit down, stand up ?????? ?????? stand up, sit down ?????? ?????? come and sit right next to me ?????? ?????? would you like a cup of tea? ?????? ?????? you stand, I sit ?????? ??????

[Ruff ruff] do you hear that? Do you know what sound that is?

- Nice work! Let's do some more listening. 
[Rapid thumping] I hear something. What is it? 
- Helicopter! 
- Boo-yah! 
- Rawwr! Chh! 
- Whoa! That's a strange mix of sounds. 
- Rawwr! Chh! 
- I wonder what that sound is. 
- Rawwr! Chh! 
- A tiger with allergies! 
- That was one weird sound, and I loved it! Now let's get ready because elmo is on the way. 
- ?????? The voice ?????? ?????? the voice ?????? 
[rock music playing] 
[cheering and applause] 
- welcome to "the voice," a singing competition like no other because our superstar judges are only using their superstar ears to pick out the next amazing voice. Finally a singing competition that's entirely about your voice--no distractions and no cheap gimmicks. Right, judges? 
- Right! 
- Ohh! Ooh! Ok. Let's get started as our first contestant makes his way to the stage. Let's listen for the voice. 
[Applause] 
[iales] 
[tapping] 
- wow! Listen to that voice. 
- It's an incredible voice. 
- It's an amazing voice. 
- Is that even a voice at all? 
[Tap dancing] 
[cheering and applause] whoa! Yah! 

[00:40:35]


- We found the voice! 
- Ok. I think there's been some confusion. This contestant was not using his voice. He was making sound with another part of his body. 
- You can make sound with other parts of your body? 
- Yes, of course, you can make sound with lots of different parts of your body. Show them how you made sound, contestant number 1. 
- What you're saying is that is not a voice. 
- No. That is not a voice. Contestant number 1 is making tapping sounds with his feet. 
- Oh. 
- Yes, a voice is what I'm using to speak right now. Can everyone hear the difference? 
- Yes. 
- Great. Then everyone spin around, and we'll bring in the next contestant. Whoa! Ohh! Ugh. Ok. Let's listen for the voice. 
[Applause]

[whistling "yankee doodle"]

- Oh, come on. That doesn't sound like a voice at all. What sound is it? 
[Cheering and applause] 
- we found the voice! 
- Ok. It seems like we're not getting something here. Again, that wasn't a voice. 
- You're right. That wasn't a voice. That was the voice. 
- No, no. It wasn't a voice at all. It was whistling. 
- [Whistles] 
- oh. 
- A voice is what you hear when you sing or you speak like I'm doing right now. Hear me raising my voice? 
- Yes. 
- Great. Then turn your chairs around, and we'll bring in the next contestant. Yow! Listen for their voice. 

[00:42:35]


[Applause]

[Pppbbbting] ok? Not a voice! What I'm yelling at you with, that is a voice! Got it? 
- Yes. 
- Good. Then turn around--wait! Don't turn around. Just get out of the chairs, and I'll turn them around for you. If you want something done right on this show, you have to do it yourself! Whoooooa!

>> ?????? Hey, sid, what do you say? What's you want to learn today? 
>> I want to know why things happen and how and I want to know everything now, oh, yeah how does this thing work? Why does that stuff change? How does that do what it just did? Hmm what's up with the sky? You think I could fly? The world is spinning and I want to know why I've got a lot of questions and big ideas I'm sid the science kid ?????? 
[captioning made possible by the jim henson company and friends of nci] oh, hi. I'm sid, and I'm really, really excited because today after school, I'm gonna have a playdate with my friend gabriella! Whoo bam! Ha ha ha! Hey, you'll never guess where the playdate is. It's in the tree house. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A playdate in the tree house. Tree house, tree house, tree house. 

[00:02:18]


>> Come on, sid. Let's get a move on before it starts to rain. 
>> What? Rain? What about my tree house party with gabriella? Oh, it's like the rain knew what my plan was. Why is it always that way? Boy, you make a plan for a party outside, and it rains every time! Well, now i just really, really got to know. Why does the rain always know when I want to go outside and play? [Echoing] play, play, play. 
>> Sid! Breakfast time! 
>> Oh, ok. Yeah, I'm kind of hungry. Oh, boy. Breakfast time! Hey, mom. Hey, dad. Hey, zeke. 
>> Hey, sid. 
>> Hey, mom, are you sure it's gonna rain? I mean, look outside. There are some little sunny parts out there. 
>> Oh, rain would be a good thing, sid. It waters trees and plants and vegetables. We always need some rain. 
>> Yeah, but what about my special tree house playdate with gabriella after school? 
>> Oh, you're worried that your playdate will be rained out. Well, come on over to the computer, and we'll check today's weather report. 
>> Ok. Mom's really good at computer stuff. 
>> All right, sid. Let's look at the pictures here. See? Yesterday was sunny, but can you tell what today's weather will be? 
>> Well, I see the sun and some clouds. Oh, I got it. It's gonna be sunny or cloudy or both. 
>> You know, sid, you would be a really good weatherman. Sometimes they look at the clouds, and then they make predictions about what the weather will be. Predictions are when you guess what you think will happen. 
>> Really? 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Well, if I could talk to a weather guy, I'd ask about the rain. I mean, how come the rain always knows when I have plans to do a special playdate outside, and then it rains on me? 
>> Well, the rain doesn't rain on your playdate on purpose, sid. 

[00:04:20]


>> It doesn't? 
>> No. Rain just rains because that's what rain clouds do. 
>> Hmm. So it's all about rain clouds. Hmm. I better learn more about clouds today, so after breakfast, I'm gonna investigate at school. 
>> Good idea. ?????? I love my mom 
>> uh-huh 
>> my mom is cool 
>> uh-huh 
>> but now it's time for having fun in school yeah ?????? 
>> hi! 
>> ?????? I'm looking for my friends I'm looking for you there's gabriella ?????? 
>> ?????? watch what I can do ?????? uh-huh! Yeah! Here we go! 
>> Wow! ?????? I'm looking for my friends I'm looking for you hey, there's gerald ??????

>> That's you! 
>> ?????? You got me ?????? 
>> yeah! ?????? We're looking for our friends and look who we found weound each other friends! ?????? 
[laughter] 
>> and now it's time for the sid survey. Hello. I'm sid, roving reporter with today's question. What do you think clouds are made of? Maybe you can think about what clouds are made of, too. Let's go get some answers. Ooh, there's may. Hello, may! 

[00:06:36]


>> Hello, sid. 
>> Hey, what do you think clouds are made of? 
>> Well, I flew through clouds when I was on an airplane once, and it was like flying through dandelions when they turn all white and fluffy. Maybe clouds are made up of a whole lot of dandelion fluff. 
>> Hmm. That's interesting. Thanks, may. 
>> You're welcome. 
>> Hey, gabriella. 
>> Hello. 
>> Hi. What do you think clouds are made of? 
>> Oh, uh, I think clouds look like they're made of something really soft like cotton balls. Ooh, it would be fun to sit on a soft cloud made of cotton. 
>> Cotton? 
>> Oh, thanks, gabriella. 
>> Sure. 
>> Sid, sid, sid. 
>> Hi. 
>> Hey. 
>> Hi. 
>> Hey. Ok, maybe clouds are made of cotton candy. That would be so awesome because we could eat the clouds. 
>> Yeah, we could. Boy, I like that idea. Thanks, gerald. 
>> Ok, bye. 
>> Bye. And now the results of my survey. May thinks that clouds could be made of dandelion fluff. Gabriella thinks they could be made of cotton balls. And gerald hopes that they're made of cotton candy. Maybe you've thought about what clouds are made of, too. And there you have it. I am sid, roving reporter and cloud expert. 
>> Everybody, rug time. 
>> That's teacher susie. 
>> Rug time! Rug time! 
>> All right, we're coming! 
>> ?????? It's rug time come on in! Rug time take a seat rug time 
>> we're ready 
>> everybody move your feet rug time >>eacher susie 
>> good times on the way rug time, come on in we've got a lot to learn y ?????? 
>> yee haw! Ha ha! Howdy, partners. This here's my horsie. Come on, giddy up, horsie. 
>> All right, partner, trot on over to your seat and sit a spell. 
>> Okey-dokey, partner. Whoa, horsie. Oh, easy, critter. Whoa! 

[00:08:39]


[Thunder] 
>> ooh! Thunder. I love thunder. That means rain. 
>> Oh. That's what I was afraid of--rain clouds. 
>> You're right, sid. Rain does come from clouds. 
>> Susie, on the playground, we were talking about what clouds are made of. Do you know? 
>> Oh, that's a good question. Have any of you ever flown through a cloud on an airplane before? 
>> I have. It looked like we were flying through dandelion fluff. Wait. If we flew through them, I would have seen the dandelions. Hmm. What are clouds made of? 
>> All right, my scientists. Les figure this out together. 
>> Ok. 
>> Why don't we take a look at some pictures of clouds? 
>> Cool. 
>> All right. Here's a picture of a cloud. Can any of you describe it? 
>> Uh, it's big and white. 
>> Yeah, and puffy. 
>> Yeah, and sometimes you see those clouds on sunny days, so it's probably not a rain cloud. 
>> Right, but it could become a rain cloud. 
>> What? 
>> Really? 
>> It could? 
>> Well, clouds are actually made out of teeny, tiny bits of water. We call it water vapor. And when the bits of water vapor come together, they make a white, puffy cloud. 
>> What? 
>> Clouds are really just a bunch of water? 
>> Right. But let's see what happens when more and more water vapor comes together. Can you guess what happens? The cloud gets heavier and heavier, and when that heavy water falls out of a cloud, what do you think it's called? 
>> Rain! 
>> Very good. And do you know what that rain becomes when it's really cold? 
>> Snow! 
>> Ice! 
>> Right! And we call rain, snow, and ice "precipitation." 
>> Precipitation. 

[00:10:40]


[Thunder] 
>> oh, oh, oh! Let's go to the window. Let's see how the rain clouds are doing. 
>> Oh, cool. The clouds are really dark now. 
>> Mom was right. It's raining. There goes our playdate. 
>> Oh. I really wanted to play in your tree house. 
>> Oh, don't worry. Rain showers come and go. Maybe by this afternoon, it'll be sunny again. 
>> Really? That would be great. 
>> Oh, you know, this rain shower gives me an idea for a rain investigation. Ok, scientists. You know where we're going. 
>> The super fab lab! 
>> That's right. Grab your journals and let's go! 
>> Ok! 
>> Super fab lab! Investigate! Explore! Discover! Ah! 
>> You know the best way to investigate rain? To go and get right into it. 
>> We're going out in the rain? 
>> Yes, we are. 
>> Yeah! 
>> All right. 
>> We're gonna take our umbrellas and all go outside and try collecting some rain in these buckets. 
>> Neato. 
>> We're also going to observe what happens when the rain hits the ground. 
>> Oh, yeah. It makes mud and, um, puddles. 
>> Right, gerald. This investigation will be like a rain puddle scavenger hunt. 
>> Ooh, a rain puddle scavenger hunt? Maybe this rain isn't such a bad thing after all. 
>> Yeah. The rain is great. Wow. There are so many observations to make. Let's grab your buckets, get your umbrellas, and go outside. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Yeah! 
>> Cool. Hey, you're scientists. You can try this, too. 
>> Look in the sky. What color are the clouds? Ooh, dark gray clouds might bring rainy weather, and here comes the rain. Let's make some observations. Where does rain collect on the ground? How does the rain feel on your skin? What happens when it rains on dirt? Right. It makes mud puddles. Go ahead and touch the mud. How does it feel? Is it cold? Is it wet? Do any little creatures like to come out in the rain? Yes! You found a worm. Let's make some more observations. Look at the way rain droplets collect on this tall leaf. Now look how rainwater collects at the bottom of this slide. Let's use our buckets to collect some rain. It's not raining too hard, so it takes a while to collect lots of water. Let's compare how much rainwater everyone collected in their bucket. Hey, there's something else you can do in the rain with your bucket--you can play! Ok, scientists, let's draw some pictures in your journals. Think about the observations you made today. Rain comes from gray clouds, and when rain falls to the ground, it makes puddles and mud. What a fun investigation. Our umbrellas kept the rain off of us, and we're back inside, nice and dry. I can't wait to see the observations you made. Let's start with you, sid. 

[00:14:16]


>> Ok. Well, here is my plastic bucket. While I ran around in the rain, I left it in the sandbox. When I came back, i found a little bit of water in the bottom. Then I found this leaf. It had its own little puddle inside. It was like, um, a little leaf bucket. 
>> Great observation, sid. Rainwater collects in lots of places. Ok, gerald. Can we see your journal? 
>> Oh, yeah. Ok. Well, I drew a picture of the sky, and there were lots of dark, wet, rainy clouds up there. Um, ok, but then I saw one little puffy cloud all by himself. I named him puffy. Ha ha! And it looked like he was floating toward the playground. Hey, you know, if he ever gets here, then I predict it'll stop raining because he's not a dark rain cloud. 
>> Wow, gerald! You made an excellent prediction. You saw a white cloud, and you predicted the rain will stop. 
>> Yeah, and I hope you're right, gerald, because then we'll observe rain and sun today. 
>> Maybe we will. Let's take a peek outside and see. Oh, hey, look, the rain stopped. Now you can play outside with all your new ideas without your umbrellas. 
>> Oh, boy! 
>> Yay! 
>> It's time for... 
>> Good laughternoon! 
>> Hey, sid. 
>> Hey, gabriella. 
>> What goes up when the rain comes down? 
>> Hmm. I don't know. What? 
>> An umbrella. 
>> Ha ha ha! 
>> Knock knock, gerald. 
>> Who's there, may? 
>> Weather. 
>> Weather who? 
>> I don't know whether it's going to be raining or sunny today. 
>> I hope it's gonna be sunny. 
>> Me, too. 
>> Ha ha ha! 

[00:16:17]


>> Hey, sid! 
>> Hey, gerald! 
>> What kind of underwear do rain clouds wear? 
>> I don't know. What kind of underwear do rain clouds wear? 
>> Thunderwear! Ha ha ha! Wait, wait, wait. I have another one 
>> oh. 
>> Ok, what kind of underwear does the rain wear? 
>> I don't know. What kind of underwear does the rain wear? 
>> Rainderwear! 
[Silence] oh, um, now laugh. 
>> Ha ha ha! 
>> Now, that's funny. 
[Recorded laughter] 
>> hello. I'm sid the weatherman with the weather report. Today we've got the craziest weather ever! Let's take a look at our weather map. Ok, first we are gonna have lots of snow. 
>> La la la la! I'm a snowstorm. Brrr. Put on your sweaters and coats. 
>> Then we're gonna have a crazy windstorm! 
>> Shhh! I am the windstorm. Look out! 
>> Yikes! And finally, don't make any special plans for a playdate in the tree house because here comes a huge rainy thunderstorm. 
>> Thunder, thunder, thunder! Rain, rain, rain, rain! Thunder, thunder! 
>> Well, that's today's weather, folks--rain. 
>> That's ok, mr. Weatherman because after the rain comes the sun. ?????? Ta da ?????? I am the sun. I'm shining my sunny rays on you. Shine, shine, shine. 
>> Shine. 
>> Thanks. I feel much better. Well, this is sid with the best weather report ever! 
>> Shine. 
>> Shine. Shine. Shine. 
>> And now, snow, snow, snow, snow, snow. 
>> It's time--shhh! Wind, wind, wind, wind! 
>> For susie. Thunder, thunder, rain! 
>> To sing--shine, shine, shine. 

[00:18:19]


>> Go, susie! 
>> Shine, shine, shine, shine, shine. 
>> Thank you, thank you, thank you. You know, this morning, there were white, puffy clouds in the sky, and then came dark rain clouds, and it makes me wonder--what if there was a cute little puffy cloud and it dreamed of becoming a big rain cloud so it could rain all over the world? 
>> Wow. 3 little clouds were hanging around floating above the land one little cloud was dreaming out loud and this was her plan she said, "i've got big dreams I'm gonna make you proud I'm gonna grow and grow and grow till I'm a big rain cloud oh, yes, I am" so the little white cloud floated over the plain 'cause she read once in the paper that all a cloud needs to make some rain is a whole lot of water vapor and she said, "i got big dreams I'm gonna say it loud I'm gonna grow and grow and grow till I'm a big rain cloud" that little cloud she grew into the biggest cloud in the nation and then her thunder rolled and down it came precipitation water! Well, her raindrops fell and watered the ground they fed all the plants and the flowers and the birds and the bees and the mango trees they all got a lovely shower and she said "i got big dreams and I'm awfully proud I'm putting on a show with a bright rainbow 'cause I'm a big rain cloud ?????? 

[00:20:25]


>> yay! 
>> Hey, I'm a rain cloud raining on plants and flowers. 
>> I'm a rain cloud, raining so all the animals can have a big drink. 
>> Well, thank you, rain clouds. Your rain is such a wonderful thing. Oh, hey, come on. Let's go take a look outside and see if we can predict what the weather will be like for the rest of the day. 
>> Yeah! 
>> Oh. 
>> Oh, I see white, fluffy clouds. 
>> That means no more rain! 
>> I predict that the weather for the rest of the day will be sunny. 
>> Me, too. 
>> Me, three. 
>> Yay! 
>> Ok, rain experts. It's time to go home. 
>> Yeah! 
>> Yay! 
>> Hey, gabriella, that means we can still have our tree house playdate. 
>> Cool. 
>> Oh ho! There's my sid. 
>> It's my grandma! 
>> And there's gabriella. 
>> Hi! 
>> Hello! Here we go, kids. ?????? Da da da da hmm ?????? 
>> ?????? back seat driving with grandma ?????? 
>> ok, kids. Tell me about your day. 
>> Oh. Well, sid's grandma, we were pretty worried that it was gonna rain on our playdate, but now it's sunny. 
>> Yeah, and we learned that rain is important and we really need it. 
>> Oh, yes, indeedy do. Rain is really important. Oh, I remember when I was a girl, I used to spend time at my aunt joelle's farm. All the people that lived on farms out in the country really depended on the rain because it made the crops grow. Oh, yes, rain is really important. The whole farm couldn't live without it. But they couldn't just turn on the water in the kitchen. They had to collect it from the well or from the rain barrel on their roof. Yeah. A big rain barrel. You could keep lots of water up there, and the water that the rain barrel collected came down to the kitchen through a long pipe, and guess what. We used to drink that water from the rain barrel, and, boy, was it good! Ha ha ha! 

[00:22:50]


>> Wow. 
>> Well, I know rain is really important, but I'm glad it's not raining now because that means we get to have our playdate in my tree house. 
>> I'm so excited. I can't wait to go in your tree house again.

>> Oh, oh, and that one looks like a moose wearing a cowboy hat, eating an ice-cream sundae. 
>> Really?

>> Cock-a-doodle-doo! 
>> Wait a minute. Grandma, you're silly. 
>> I got you. 
>> Ha ha ha! My grandma's funny. What a great day today. I learned a bunch of stuff about clouds. They're not made of cotton or dandelion fluff or cotton candy. Nope. They're made of water. And if there's too much water in themthen they rain on you. Yay, rain! Whoo hoo. So I guess rain is a good thing, but I still wish I had an invention that would let me have any party outside any time i wanted to, even if it did rain. Hmm. Ok, I've got it. Here's my super dooper ooper schmooper big idea. I'm gonna make an invention called the unbelievable umbrella! Whenever it rains, the unbelievable umbrella opens up to any size--so big it can open up over the whole neighborhood. I can have all my friends over for a picnic, and no one will get wet, even if they're outside. And here's the best part. All the rain that lands on my unbelievable umbrella will roll off into big rain barrels, just like the rain barrels grandma told me about, and all the water that's collected in the rain barrels will then pour down a bunch of pipes and fill a whole swimming pool with rain water, and we'll all swim in it. It'll be so cool. A picnic and a swimming pool party while it rains. Awesome. And that's my super dooper ooper schmooper big idea!

[Recorded applause] 
[thunder] ha! Cool. All right, it's raining again! Go, rain, go! Rain makes water for the plants and the animals and everything. Rain is awesome. Hey. You know, the next time it rains, ask a grownup to go out and explore with you outside. That's what I like to do because I am sid the science kid.

=======================================================

Connecticut, where press conference has just begun. The connecticut governor malloy. Listen in. 
>> Children, beautiful, beautiful children. Who had simply come to school to learn. 
>> The day ended a different way than we could have imagined. As we stand here today we can't imagine what transpired there. Evil visited this community today. It's too early to speak of recovery. But each parent, each sibling, each member of the family has to understand that connecticut, we're all in this together. We'll do whatever we can to overcome this event. We will get through it. But this is a terrible time for this community and for these families. Our police personnel and others are doing the utmost to clear this situation as soon as possible. To return these children to their parents. Or these loved ones to their fellow loved ones as quickly as possible. We'll work with all of the residents of this community. And connecticut to make sure that we do, in fact, get through this. I was mayor of stanford on 9/11. When our state lost many of its citizens and I lost a number of my fellow citizens and friends. I never thought that in a public career that I would have to face these kind of circumstances or that they would visit themselves upon this community or the people of connecticut. We'll get through this. And our prayers, at this time have to go out to the families, so as I began by thanking those with expressed their desires to be helpful, number one, way to be helpful is to say a prayer. Or send a best wish, thinking of the individuals who have suffered so mightily today. Thank you. 

[00:03:10]


>> Bret: That is connecticut governor dan malloy with a brief statement there in newtown, connecticut. Obviously, expressing grief there. After this horrific day. I'm bret baier in new york tonight. We begin our coverage from newtown. We begin with senior correspondent rick leventhal who is live tonight near the school. Hello, rick. 
>> Reporter: Bret, we just heard from the governor, for the second time today. Expressing his sorrow and his condolences to the families of all of those victims who suffer today at sandy hook elementary school in hang hang, which is in newtown, connecticut. As we now know a young man identified as adam lanza, 20 years old, went in to that school this morning, opened fire with apparently, with three weapons. Glock handgun, another handgun and semi-automatic weapon and slaughtered 26 people inside that school before killing himself. We have now learned that adam lanza lived with his mother here in connecticut. Woke up this morning, according to the federal source, shot his mother in the face. Then took her car and went to her school and that is where this horrible shooting transpired. He killed 18 kids at the school. Two children were found there and moved to a local hospital where they died. Six other adults before killing himself. We know that when police arrived on scene just after 9:30 this morning, they didn't waste any time. They went inside the school, locating adults and children and moving them out of the school to safety, that is then when they found the victims all located within two rooms of that school. One area o that school. So again, horrific set of circumstances here. We now understand that the father of the shooter is being questioned in new jersey by the f.B.I. There were early reports that he also had been killed. That is not the case. The father of adam lanza is being questioned by federal authorities in new jersey. The shooter's brother ryan lanza also apparently cooperating with authorities being questioned in new jersey. The shooter adam may have been carrying his brother's i.D. Which led to early confusion about who e identity was. The shooter adam lanza, dead at the scene. Slaughtered 26 people inside the elementary school, bret, before killing himself. And now police are going through the grisly task of processing that crime scene. Bret? 

[00:05:32]


>> Bret: Rick, they have been talking about processing the crime scene. You mentioned that and dealing with the families. And the bodies taking them out of there. What about processing that scene and trying to find out what was behind this guy and what was his motive, what happened with the background of this man? From the beginning. 
>> Well, that kind of information, the best information about the mental condition of adam lanza will come from his father and his brother, who are being questioned by the federal authorities at this time. There may be writings or computer postings that they can locate from his mother's home. His mother, as we mentioned, has been killed. But the father and the brother could provide insight, some background to what the shooter's motives may have been. We have heard he was mentally troubled. May have been learning disabled in some way. That also is something that the authorities will try to nail down, as they look for some kind of answer here. But this young man clearly had major issue this morning when he woke up and according to federal authorities killed his mother. Went to her school after she was already dead. Killed every kid in her class. 
>> Bret: Amazing. Rick leventhal live outside the school. Rick, thank you. Flags in washington, d.C., have been lowered to half staff. This is the flag at the capitol building and we'll take a look at the flag at the white house lowered to half staff to remember the victims and the families. Here to give us some perspective on the shootings, rich marionos, the assistant director and special agent in charge of the bureau of atcohol, tobacco and firearms and explosives. He is the lead investigator for control bum line shootings in 19 -- columbine shootings from 1999 and joins us in washington. Rich, thank you for being here. This is a horrific investigation. First, it's tough to even deal with to start the investigation for experts who have been talking about this all day. They said it's tough to even do it. Once you get in to it, what are they doing from the beginning to begin their looking in to this guy and starting the evidentiary gathering? 

[00:07:49]


>> Guest: I never thought once again in my entire career I'd go through another incident similar to columbine. The entire bureau and the law enforcement members are just saddened and send our sympathies out to the families. We as an agency with atf and the partners are so commit to make sure that we come up with a motive and come up with every answer to try to ascertain how this event happened. What they will be going the next 24 hours which is extremely important is to identify the victims with the medical examiner. They will also be conducting many tests, forensic tests on the weapons, the ballistics evidence, checking the different locations where the offender, or any other offenders may be in association with this guy. Occupied or anyplace they may secreted any additional evidence. They are going to try toto look I'm sure from the lessons learned from the various investigations we have taken part in. To do a full data mine in social media, to find postings to lead to motive, phone record, credit card purchases to do a complete dig-in data mine to establish how such a senseless tragedy could happen again in united states. 
>> Bret: Quickly, has anything changed with school security? This was an elementary school. But has anything changed around the country with school security since columbine? 
>> I think the school security in the united states has gotten much, much better. I think we have done a tremendous job in law enforcement, and throughout this country to work on plans for active shooters. As you could see the tremendous job that the law enforcement community did by getting in their quickly and swiftly and securing the safety. The other members of the school and the other children. School safety we do a better job. Many school systems we utilize electronic identification. Signage sheets. One access to get in. One entry to get in one exit to get out. We have come a long way since columbine. To get to your point, we still need to improve. Partf improving is for all of us in the law enforcement community to take the lessons learned from all the shootings, from virginia tech, columbine or this and pull resources together to come up with solutions based work to provide school system and work in concert with them to make the schools that much safer. We are also a democracy. Country that is based upon freedom. We don't want to lock down our schools in some form that gives away that freedom. 

[00:10:28]


>> Bret: Rich, assistant director and special agent in charge of atf. Rich, thank you so much be. Back with you a little later. Still ahead, white house reaction to today's events. An emotional reaction at that. We will continue our coverage of the deadly school shooting in connecticut. Keep it here. 
>> Our hearts are broken today. For the parents and grand parents, sisters and brothers of these little children. And the families of the adults that were lost. 

[00:14:11]


>> Bret: Welcome back to "special report" on a night of almost unimaginable sorrow for parents and others in newtown, connecticut, 65 miles from us here in new york. Police say a gunman dressed in black body armor came in to the sandy hook elementary school this morning and started opening fire. When it was over, 27 were dead at the school. Six adults, and 20 children. Along with the gunmen. Police say one other doesn't was killed elsewhere. Believed to be the shooter's mother. An emotional president obama spoke this afternoon about the shootings. Chief white house correspondent ed henry has thatart of the story. 
>> The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of five and ten years old. 
>> President obama struggling to keep his composure, the grief of an entire nation visible in the tears he tried and failed to suppress. 
>> They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings. 
>> Earlier the president spoke to connecticut governor dan malloy, as well as f.B.I. Director robert mueller who is coordinating the investigation with state authorities. 
>> I offer governor malloy by condolences, on behalf of the nation. And made it clear he will have every single resource that he needs to investigate this heinous crime,are for the victims, counsel their families. We have had too many tragedies in the past few years. 
>> Partisan bickering seem unimportant. Deliberations of the looming fiscal cliff uninterrupted. 
>> At pl 10:30 this morning in the oval office the president was notified by the homeland security advisor john brennan of the shooting in newtown, connecticut. At a school. The president, receiving regular updates as more information becomes available. 
>> The president has received many of those emergency updates over the last four years. From a congresswoman shot at a super market in tucson, arizona. She survived but six others did not. 

[00:16:17]


>> Our hearts are broken by the sudden passing. Our hearts are broken. 
>> To an aurora colorado movie theater this past summer. 12 dead. 
>> When you have an opportunity to visit with families who have lost their loved ones as I described to them, I come to them not so much as president, as I do as a father. And as a husband. 
>> Late they're same month the president faced criticism from liberals for speech to the national urban league. 
>> When I said in the wake of tucson was we were going to stay on this persistently. 
>> The where he talked about violence but carefully danced around the issue of gun control and offer nod specific plans for follow-through. 
>> We identify gun ownership that pass on from generation to generation that hunting and shooting are part of cherished national heritage but I also believe that a lot of gun OWNERS WOULD AGREE AK-47s Belong in the hands of seasonals not in the hands of criminals. 
>> Today, dramatic chief. Specific promise of action in the second term. 
>> These neighborhoods are our neighborhoods. The children are our children. 
>> We have to come together to take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this regardless of politics. 
>> For now, the president ordered flags be flown at half staff, military posts public buildings and grown and including the white house. Where there is a grieving staff and first family. 
>> This evening, michelle and I will do what I know every parent in america will do, which is hug our children tighter. And we'll tell them that we love them. 
>> Captain mark kelly, husband of former congresswoman gabrielle giffords said today that she sends her prayers from tucson, and he added a meaningful discussion of the nation's gun laws can no longer wait. Bret? 
>> Bret: Ed henry live on the north lawn. Thank you. This was one of the worst school shootings in american history. We will have the latest on historic and tragic shootings in connecticut. When we come back. 

[00:18:27]


>> The children obviously were very shaken. They were crying in the closet, in the closet of the art room. Eventually, they were leaving and when they were leaving the police made them hold hands, the police told them to close their eyes. ???????????? 'bout ] stop! Stop! Stop! Come back here!

[00:22:06]


>>> Moments ago, eric holder spoke out about the shootings. 
>> As a nation, we have to ask ourselves hard questions. We gather too often to talk about these kind of instances. We need to discuss, who we are as a nation. Talk about the freedoms that we have, the rights that we have how they might be usedn a responsible way. 
>> Bret: There will be a lot of people analyzing what he said there. Mass shootings like this have become all too common and like this one, like others, it's sure to spark new arguments on both sides of the gun control issue. Tonight, chief intelligence correspondent catherine herridge looks at the history and particularly gruesome year. 
>> You can never be prepared for this type of incident. What has happened and transpired will leave a mark on this community and every family impacted. 
>> Whether it's the searing images from newtown, connecticut, the panic at a mall in portland, oregon, on tuesday, when two holiday shoppers were killed by a single shooter or mass murder as sikh temple in wisconsin in august, they can't begin to explain the loss. 
>> The statistic provide cold comfort for what happened today. If you look at an event like today you think we have got a problem. We have to do something. Whatever you do, you need to make sure that it's something that, you know, is going to be effective. 
>> While the worst school shooting in history remains virginia feck in 2007 where 32 were gunned down bay student the recent crime dated from the justice department that runs through 2008 shows that multiple victim homicides in this country are rare. With less than 1% of the crimes involving five or more victims. 
>> Gun homicide by individuals in the late teens and early 20s LIKE THE VIRGINIA TECH Gunman and friday's aed shoot rer down. According to federal data, gun homicides by persons between 18 and 24 peaked at 8600 in 1993 and dropped to half that by 2008. 

[00:24:14]


>> Law enforcement has been making herculean efforts to prevent the tragedy we saw unfold today. Efforts at law enforcement disposal range from gun buy-back program, background checks and tart geted evident to interdict flow of illegal guns. 
>> While schools and communities far from newtown, connecticut posted metorials to honor the children and families that will never see another birthday, the law enforcement says the impact is amplified in age of instant communication. 
>> It'not that common but when it happens it's widely publicized. Schools take additional precautions at this point in time to protect their teachers as well as the students. And doing drills periodically during the school year. 
>> April of this year, seven major shootings in the u.S. Alone, all involved a single shooter with multiple deaths. What is not clear tonight is whether this represents any kind of up-tick in the national statistics long-term, bret? 
>> Bret: Thank you. 
>> You're welcome. 
>> Bret: Go back out to newtown, connecticut. Correspondent molly line is outside the home of a person believed to be the shooter's mother who was killed before the school massacre. Hello, molly. 
>> Reporter: This is where adam lanza believed to have woken up this morning and shot his mother before taking her car and heading to the school. Doing something so far from what this community what been preparing for. We're in a neighborhood filled with christmas lights. Now this community instead of preparing for all of that joy will be facing deep sadness. A steady stream of police vehicles driving in the usual peaceful new england town served as a constant reminder of the tragedy that transpired here. Anna was working in her cafe when news of the shooting broke. The place filled with mothers getting morning coffee. 
>> We started to freak out not knowing if it's the high school, people were crying not knowing. A couple minutes later they found out it was sandy hook elementary school and I had a customer with two young children. I think one kindergarten age and she was totally scared. I read it on her face. 

[00:26:23]


>> Residents were shocked, most not wanting to talk. The emotion of the day evident on their faces. The small central village area filled with stores that cater to kids and the sign in the window, of a fun cut hair salon and consignment shop says it all. Inside, the owner was trying to come to grips with the loss of so many children. 
>> I know the whole town, practically. I'm just worried and I'm sad. It put myself in their position. It's terrible. It's a shocking thing, because you see this on tv and some place else. You don't think of it, as being here. 
>> Grass the sadness they will face in coming days. More than two dozen people will be laid to rest, 20 of them children. 
>> Bret: We don't still have the names of the victims, right? Have they been all notified? 
>> Authorities are holding those names very close to the vest right now, understandably. They want to give the parents of the children and also of the other people that were killed first knowledge of this. And time to prepare. Bret? 
>> Bret: Of course, of course. Bill hemmer -- thank you, molly line, outside the home of the mother believed to be killed there. Bill hemmer is live outside sandy hook elementary school, the site of today's shooting. When we come back, our continuing coverage here on fox news channel. Keep it here. 
>> My son was at the gym when it happened so I think he heard the gunshots. So it's -- they were both, i think it will be one of those things where you try to understand what happened. When we tell them ultimately what happened in details, i think it will make it much worse. ???????????? ???????????? Everything. Share "Not even close." Share "You owe me..." Share "Just right."

[00:31:46]


>>> Children, beautiful, beautiful children, who had simply come to schoo learn. And their day ended a very different way than any of us could possibly have imagined. Quite frankly, as we stand here today, still can't imagine what transpired there. Evil visited this community today. 
>> Bret: That was connecticut governor dan malloy. As we have been telling you throughout the afternoon, heavily armed man opened fire inside a school. Elementary school in connecticut today. The results were almost impossible to comprehend. 20 children killed. Age 5 to 10. Six adults. The shooter also died. He apparently killed at least one other adult believed to be his mother at location. Bill hemmer is live outside sandy hook elementary school in newtown and joins us live this evening. Bill, we are just getting word of some news about the guns the shooter used. 
>> Yes, bret. Fox news can confirm that the three guns tied to the grisly murder scene were owned by the shooter's mother nancy lanza who also has a relationship as a teacher with this school. What we are starting to piece together here is the timeline, that began at daybreak earlier today. When this young man got out of bed. Took one of those gun, shot his mother in the face. Took her car, and drove to the school here, a small elementary school in the picturesque part of connecticut and taking the lives of 20 children ages 5 and 6. All in kindergarten, six other adults inside. That building as well. I tell you, bret, after being here for a couple of hours, what is striking this is small town america. Beautiful wooded area of rolling hills. This time of year you think of christmastime a few weeks from now and if the snow starts to fall around here it's a picturesque community. One can only imagine how beautiful it is. But that beauty has been absolutely shattered by the description of the grisly scene inside of this school building. Earlier today, some of the police described it as not a simplistic scene. Imagination starts to run you start to think about these children inside these two different rooms. In one section of the school. The bodies have not been removed. They are still inside that building because police say we need to answer every question. That will take some time. Certainly to try and sort this out, as we work through this, in the coming hours and the coming days. So many wonderful why would this happen? And why -- so many wondering why would this happen and why the children? Certainly, they did not deserve this. 

[00:34:30]


>> Bret: About those weapon, we're confirming that all three weapons were registered, legally purchased and registered to the gunman's mother. According to law enforcement officials. We're also being told there was 223 bushmaster rifle and two handguns recovered at the school. The authorities not saying how many shots were fired. But as you mention, that scene gruesome for all the authorities who have to go in there. For that community to deal with, that you are there on the ground. The nation is reacting but there on the ground, what is it like? 
>> This town stoplight. Sandy hook. You can walk through it in a minute's time. It's that small. You can imagine how neighbor knows neighbor and family knows family and how it would rip apart any community much less the town of sandy hook here in southwestern connecticut. The police by the hour have been giving us updates but I'll be frank, there are very few facts coming out about the story. That tells me they are peeling back the layers and trying to piece it together. You can imagine the confusion that resulted starting at 9:30 this morning, trying to find his gunman, locate the relationship, who is he relationship to, mother and his father and relationship with his brother. All of this stuff is starting to evolve throughout the night. We expect a briefing sometime soon. When we do, maybe, slowly, bret, we can piece it together. More at 7:00 on the "fox report" live from here. 
>> Bret: We'll see you 20 minutes. Thank you, buddy. Return now to washington. More with rich marianos who was the lead investigator in columbine in 198 # 9. You heard -- 1999. You heard about the guns that were registered to the mother and that is serious fire power for shooter to have used. What about this, in this investigation. We hear about the lone wolf shooters and the authorities worried about them. Today's tragedy really is a worse case scenario where it seems like they are digging for derogatory information about the guy. It's early but we are not hearing anything about this guy or any history of yet. 

[00:37:00]


>> Well, because law enforcement wants to conduct a professionable investigation. They don't want to release evidence or anything to create prejudice among the community, jury if a criminal will be charged. And wants to keep a little bit of respect for the family members without turning this in to a circus. 
>> Bret: Yeah. 
>> Guest: We have done a good job with that in terms of limiting the information, making this what it's about. It's about the tragedy that happened in a community. Put a full court press together with law enforcement components and trying to be respectful that we don't jeopardize any part of an investigation. Or a potential prosecution. Or create debate among both sides. Just using this issue. 
>> Bret: I fully understand that, rich. I guess my point is how can the authorities stop someone who perhaps has no indication of trouble in the past? That is the real challenge. 
>> The challenge for law enforcement, not just here but everywhere. We need more community approach. We need everyone working together on this issue to identify people that, identify where the criminals are purchasing fire arms. To identify where violent crimes are taking place and the guns are used. To identify criminals that are putting the guns in the hands of criminals. You know it's about crimes gun and crime problem, violent crime problem. In order to solve this we all need to work together. All federal agencies, local police, community group, gun dealers, the media. The only way we'll sol tv is a combined effort and make the country what we love and respect. 
>> Bret: Sure. These were legally purchased and registered guns of the mother. 
>> I'm not going to comment about the evidence right now because it's too early to tell. We don't have witnesses to put the gun in the offender's hand at this time. For to us qualify or make a statement of who purchased them would be unfair to community and unfair to the public and the poor family dealing with the tragedy. I can guarantee you, though, atf is putting a full court press guard identifying if the guns were purchased illegally and put hands of violent criminal we'll put a stop to it and put person behind bars with all the evidents we have. 

[00:39:17]


>> Bret: Rich, I appreciate you sticking around. 
>> Thank you very much, bret. Thank you for your compassion and your time on this issue. 
>> Bret: We can't make sense of this. But we can discuss it. The fox all-stars are next. Connecticut school shooting and the analysis. When we come back. ???????????? ????????????

[ Male Announcer ] BECAUSE ENBREL????, ETANERCEPT, Suppresses your immune system, it may lower your ability to fight infections. Serious, sometimes fatal, events including infections, tuberculosis, lymphoma, other cancers, and nervous system and blood disorders have occurred. Before starting enbrel, your doctor should test you for tuberculosis and discuss whether you've been to a region where certain fungal infections are common. Don't start enbrel if you have an infection like the flu. Tell your doctor if you're prone to infections, have cuts or sores, have had hepatitis b, have been treated for heart failure, or if, while on enbrel, you experience persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, or paleness. If you've had enough, ask your dermatologist about enbrel. 
>>> The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful kids between the ages of five and ten years old. 
>> They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthday, gradua weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today. For the parents, and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults who were lost.

>> Bret: An emotional president obama, reacting to the school shooting in newtown connecticut. For analysis go to washington, d.C. And panel. Fred barnes of "weekly standard." Kirsten powers for daily beast. Syndicated columnist charles krauthammer. Charles, words today? 
>> The first thing to say in looking at this or analyzing this requires a huge amount of humility. The true fact is we do not know and often even after these events are analyzeed and thought through, we really don't know. This is the problem of evil. And it's been struggled with forever. What we know about the current shooting is that people are divided in three camps. Three elements. Psychology of the shooter, you have the weapon, and you've got the cultural environment. People will choose whichever cause they want to blame. They will say it's guns that were available. Laws ought to be tightened, although the brady campaign says connecticut has the four strictest laws in the country. Then you have the environment. People on the right, tend to say that our cu decenttizing young -- de-sensitizing people in movies and video games to kill in way older generation find disturbing. I tend to gravitate toward the psychology of the killer. When you think about the details of the crime, he began by shooting his mother in the face. Taking her weapon and then destroying everything precious to her. Her colleagues and her children. Then killing himself. That I think is where I would start. Although I think all the issues have to be discussed. 
>> Bret: Kirsten? 
>> Yes, I think all the issues have to be discussed but the psychology part has to be paired with the semi-automatic weapon in order for something like this to happen. As the president said today we need to have some meaningful action, to deal with this issue. This is something now that is starting to almost become epidemic in our country. It's not -- in my entire childhood I don't -- you know, if it happened, this was such a rarity. It's now almost commonplace. This shootings. This is particularly terrible because it involved all the young children. 5-year-old. The innocent of the innocent you can think of. But I think we have to look at the factors, mental health factors. Are we looking for signs, are we offering mental health treatment to people? But also looking at the gun laws, do we have the right gun laws? All the differents a spents of it -- aspects of it and try to seriously address the issue and not just throw up our hand and say well, there is nothing we can do about it. These things just happen. These things just shouldn't happen. 

[00:46:40]


>> Bret: Fred, attorney general holder earlier talked about freedoms and age losing what happened today -- analyzing what happened today in contrast or context of our freedoms. 
>> Well, one of the freedoms we have had in this country ratified by the supreme court the right to bear arms. Individuals can do it an they do. But there are other countries where arms are plentiful, countrys like israel and switzerland we don't have the same homicide rate we have in the united states. We don't have the mass killings over and over again. My are action was oh, not again. That was a lot of people's reaction. The problem is the united states is one that charles mentioned; the psychology of the people who do the killings, virginia tech, columbine, theater in aurora, colorado and all the killings. We have to find ways to keep guns out of the hands of these people. It's hard to do. Look, the guns belong to this killer's mother. She had them at the home. The son not old enough to own a firearm got them and took them and used them. I don't know how you could really stop that. Even in a state, as charles said, with pretty strict gun control laws. The problem is we do have -- compared to other countries with a lot of gun, a culture of violence in this country that allows, that allows a lot of violent acts to happen. They we curbed well here and people do get guns. Look, we are not going to been ban guns in this country. We can curb the number of them but these were legally owned guns and were used by presumably, a psychotic person. Hard to stop that. 
>> Bret: Charles, if you a parent tonight put on the psychiatrist hat and your child, what do you say to them? 

[00:48:46]


>> I mean wefully a culture you can't escape from the events. Which citizen tragic. So everybody is exposed. All you can do is provide them safety and love. No explanations that's not what you do. Show them you will protect them, because youe them. They do not have to fear. That is all you can say. 
>> Bret: Panel, as always, tough day, but thank you next up, reaction from all over the country to today's events. ???????????? ???????????? 

[00:52:39]


>> Bret: Now reaction from around the country. Chief washington correspondent james rose season live tonight in d.C. Hello, james. 
>> Bret, good evening. There were some folks that i spoke with this afternoon who hadn't heard about the massacre, some overseas tourist, people stepping out of museums but most had heard. Li you and me they were changed forever. 
>> Maybe 45 or -- 
>> for millions of americans the gruesome news came in bits and pieces. 
>> First, they learned there had been a school shooting, then a fatal one, then a tragedy of unfathomable proportions. 
>> Why are people doing things likebe this? I don't understand what makes people evil that would just want to go and kill innocent people. 
>> It's just the worst, most devastating stuff. Really sad to realize our society has come to this place. 
>> I'm sorry. It's crazy. I can't believe people are doing that. 
>> It is very upsetting, children, who haven't lived, haven't experienceed anything. And taken so early. It is very shocking. 
>> What was supposed to be a season of joy darkened, as manuals of children hearded out of sandy hook elementary school, the lucky kids who made it out alive and still may face years of trauma from the event cut to the core of parents everywhere. 
>> I cried and I cried and my daughter called me who has a child in kinder garden, first grade and in second grade and she couldn't stop crying. So it's a tragedy. As I said to her, you can't understand things like that. 
>> It's devastating. It really shook me. Because I have, you know, son here in elementary school, and I can't imagine what the parents go through, the parents getting the cools. It's so unfortunate. It's tragic. It really hate that it even happened. It's just so sad. 
>> From columbine through virginia tech and the movie theater in aurora up through this week's mall shooting outside of portland, oregon, americans have become -- 
[ inaudible ] idea of mass shooting but not to the horror, cruelty and enduring emotional impact of them. 

[00:54:41]


>> The community, create a community that is strong and a community that does sort of have those unsaid barriers. We don't accept that here. We are together. We're cohesive. 
>> We have a societal breakdown. I'm a teacher, so I see it at an operational level. There are people who take easy access to things to fill a fantasy or go nut their blaze of glory or whatever prompts them. 
>> I am glad that our doors are locked at all times. You can't get in them. That was my first reaction. Then walking up to school today, I thought to myself, you know, I feel for the parents. It couldn't even imagine what they are going through. 
>> My mother regina rosennen of staten island, new york, wrote hug your children for me when you get home. This has plunged the whole country in to terrible sadness. Bret? 
>> Bret: Thank you. Some final thoughts on a tragic day. no human.

Perhaps you can begin the sense of flood of sorrow and fear and ager and confusion that gripped this community of newtown today and really all over america. It is a day no one there, none of them, will ever forget. Newtown will now live in our collective consciousness, along with names like columbine and aurora, colorado and virginia tech. And again today, the nation recoils together, rallies together, grieves together, prays together in recognition of the value of human life.

Deal, what's next? 
>>> Why are these ukrainian lawmakers throwing punches. Glad we're not there. 
>> Not there yet. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 14th. "Starting point" begins now. Good morning, everybody. Our starting point, a developing story about syria's ongoing civil war and a new role for the united states. Leon panetta signed an order to send two patriot missile batteries to turkey along with 400 u.S. Troops to help the country defend against any u.S. Action by syria. The move was expected as the rebellion destabilizes or begins to destabize the assad regime. Nick paton walsh h the latest for us. Nick, good morning. 
>> Reporter: Good morning. 400 u.S. Troops expected to be on the ground, but this contribution of three total member nations, germany expected to begin ratifying its deployment of two patriot batteries, the netherlands as well. Let me give you the back story. The past two months we have seen exchanges, syrian army accused of firing into turkey. Turkey returning fire. That sense of host tillity and volatility on the border leading them to ask nato for help and patriots coming here at this point. Expected to be used mostly in the event of missiles being fired and have the ability to take down aircraft as well. We heard from u.S. Secretary of defense leon panetta, that the u.S. Does have a plan in the event that they see the assad regime use or prepare to use chemical weapons. Not clear if patriots will be involved in that. But right now, in the very volatile part of the world, we have u.S. Troops potentially on the ground. 
>> Nick paton walsh, thank you for the update. 

[00:02:02]


>>> Frank discussions, open lines of communicaion, but no deal. 18 days until the fiscal cliff. President obama and john boehner met just under an hour. After cooinated press releases, both sides assured the american people that communication lines remain open. Dana bash is live in washington, d.C. This morning. 50 minutes and sort of a very milquetoasty kind of statement at the end of it, sounds not good. 
>> No, not good, considering where we are in tcalendar. I'm told by sources in both parties, a meeting that did not produce any new ideas, more of touching base meeting, the president wanted to talk to the speaker before he went home to ohio, which he still planned to do this weekend, the sources say that the basic problem still is, soledad, after all of the weeks, is democrats still believe republicans have the problem. They need to deal with the debt crisis by raising more revenue, meaning raising more taxes and republicans still think democrats are the problem. They are not offering enough in spending cuts. The issue is, reality, democrats, the president has the most leverage. Has had the most leverage, republicans know that. Everybody see where is this will probably go. Republicans ve to give some on the rate increases for the most wealthy. And the question, when is it most politically advantageous for both sides to agree to that. 
>> Let me ask a question. You have had a chance to talk to two former majority leaders from opposite sides of the aisle what are they saying about where we are and the fact that there will be a deal somewhere soon? 
>> Trent lott and tom daschle, republican and democratic leader, opposite sides of the table four years, working together on tough issues and they pointed out it is certainly possible, of course it is possible. They have to have the political will in to the political leaders and they pointed out that timing on a deal is really key. Take a listen. 

[00:04:11]


>> Very true. 
>>> The speaker is going to have to make a decision on that, and the president is going to have to make a decision on what he will do in return on spending, and they need to do it on concert. You have to have the winds and the brass come together. 
>> Maybe hold hands and jump off the cliff together? 
>> It would be more fun on the way down. At least have you company. 
>> Whether or not that is all going to happen before the ends of the year, really still is an open question. But, soledad, outside a meeting of republicans yesterday, and all of them said that the speaker told them, don't make christmas plans. 
>> Yeah, not a shock either. And I think jumping off a cliff, whether you have hands to hold or no hands to hold is all bad, all the way down. Dana bash this morning, appreciate it. 
>>> Diplomatic shocker to update you on after the republican firestorm on the attk in benghazi, susan rice has taken herself out of the running, won't try to succeed secretary of state hillary clinton for that role. President obama talked about ambassador rice's decision last night. 
>> I hadn't made a decision about who would be my next secretary of state. No doubt, susan is qualified. Other people are qualified as well. Her interest is in serving me, but more importantly, in serving the country. Could not be prouder of her. She is one of the top members of my national security team. 
>> She'll meet with the president today, our foreign affairs reporter, elise labott in washington, d.C. Break this down what's happening behind the scenes. She said in her resignation note that she's decided to do this for the good of the american people, so there is not this contentious, partisan debate. What's really happening here? 
>> Well, I've talked to some of our aides. She was ready for a fight. She doesn't give up on a fight. Tweeted this morning with an op-ed in "the washington post," but over the last couple of days and weeks, her aides and she started to do the math. Wasn't just about benghazi anymore, morphed into something else, on other issues back when she was in the clinton administration, increasingly politicized and wasn't going to stop. So she made the tough decision and also I think, soledad, her aides felt that this detracted from some of the more successful work that she did as u.S. Ambassador to the united nations. If you remember, she was instrumental in passing the toughest sanctions ever on iran. Pushed for military action in libya and other things. Take a listen to what she told nbc news about why she withdraw her name. 

[00:07:08]


>> I didn't want to see a confirmation process that was very prolonged, very politicized, very distracting and very disruptive. Because there are so many things we need to get done as a country. 
>> And, soledad, she has a lot of work to do at the u.N. Right now, the u.S. Is trying to get a resolution imposing sanctions on north korea the syria crisis, and right now, the short list for secretary clinton's replacement, down to one man, senator john kerry, who is seen as someone who has a locality of world stature, a lot of relationships with world leaders and certainly as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee has a lot of foreign policy chops and most attractive to the administration, soledad, he's he's I will confirmable. 
>> Elise labott, thank you. That's a very short list. One name on it. 
>> Short list of one. 
>>> Live pictures of a pro president mohamed morsi rally in cairo. Members of the opposition say the constitution is too islamist and infringes on minority rights. Protesting outside the presidential palace right now. 
>>> New this morning, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake off the coast of baja. So far, no tsunami warnings. 
>>> Clackamas town center will reopen to shoppers in six hours. That's the mall where a gunman killed two people on tuesday and critically wounded a third before killing himself. A candle-light vigil will be held outside the mall. 
>>> A funeral for fallen dallas cowboys player jerry brown. Brown was killed in a suspected drunk driving accident on saturday. His teammate and friend josh brent was behind the wheel. You are looking at new dashcam video of the wreck released by police along with 911 calls they received in moments after the accident. 

[00:09:10]


>> Is anybody injured? 
>> I don't know. I just drove past it. Looks like it just happened. A car upside down. 
>> Josh brent is free on half a million dollars bail. He's arged with intoxication manslaughter. 
>>> So today is the deadline for states to declare whether they will set up their own health insurance exchanges. 22 states will not do it. In those cases, the affordable care act dictates the federal government comes in and will do it for them. The exchanges will offer consumers an internet based marketplace for purchasing private health insurance plans. So it hasn't come to this in washington, d.C., Yet. This brawl broke out on the floor of ukraine's parliament. Lots of pushing, shoving, collar grabbing, and the scuffle apparently started after members of ukraine's opposition party accused two of their own members of planning to defect to the ruling party. I guess the good news, it's not partisanship, it's fighting within the party. You know, looking for a silver lining. 
>> They are talking. Not just saying we had frank discussions. 
>> Those are more than frank discussions right there. 
>> Can you imagine if we had video fiscal cliff come to this and people going at each other. No women at this shot. I looked very closely. What does that say? 
>> Sorry berman. 
>>> Ahead on "starting point" this morning, "black in america" will reair on saturday. And an espn host is questioning the blackness of a star football player robert griffin iii, rg3 on air, what was said and the fallout from that, straight ahead. Plus, business news. One more way the fiscal cliff could cost you. What happ]ns to your paycheck immediately if there is no deal in washington? That's next. Bring it down, please? Better. That's what happens to background noise, when you're making a call on this. This microphone here, picks up the sounds around you and helps turn them down. So when the world gets noisy Calls sound better. ...so as you can see, GEICO's customer satisfaction is at 97 Mmmm tasty. And cut! Very good.

Though all energy development comes with some risk, we're committed to safely and responsibly producing natural gas. It's not a dream. America's natural gas... Putting us in control of our energy future, now. 
>>> Welcome back to "starting point." I'm christine romans, minding your business. The s & p 500 snapped a six-day winning streak, despite modelly upbeat economic data. Call it the payroll tax cliff. Of all the tax issues being negotiated in washington, there is one that many middle class families would certainly feel immediately. The payroll tax holiday that comes directly from your paycheck. Payroll taxes fund social security. Workers have been getting a break. Paying a rate of 4.2%. In 2013, the rate is said to go back up to 6.2%, of everything you make. Take a look at this someone making $50,000 a year will see $19 less in their take home pay per week, starting at the beginning of the year. The payroll tax cut, a piece of the whole tax mess, tax puzzle, could have a direct affect on your paycheck. I'll tell up the stock market up 13% this year. Until now, everybody says they'll get it sorted out. I'm starting to get e-mails from strategies who are starting to get nervous again. 

[00:15:00]


>> The stock market, going up based on that this is all bluster, but now you think it will start going down? 
>> I don't know. Greg valier, does a note to clients, the financial markets think this will get solved, but the word and mood in washington is it won't. 
>> Let's bring in a former democratic governor of tennessee. A member of the campaign to fix the debt. He joins us this morning. Nice to have you with us, sir. Great to see you again. A documentary a couple years ago. 
>> I remember. 
>> Nice to have you with us today. I want to talk -- christine, stick around. I want to talk about finance 101. The deficit is the gap between the spending and revenue that the government has every single year. The cbo is reporting that the deficit in 2012 is$1.1 trillion which sounds terrible, but it's also gone down over the years, if you look at 2009, 1.4 trillion, 2010, it dropped, 2011 it dropped and 2012 it dropped. Why are you focused on fixing the debt at a time when we veal have a low borrowing rate? Why focus on fixing the debt instead of the deficit? 
>> The two of them are really the same thing. You have to fix the deficit in order to get to a more sensible place with the debt. The difference now, we have these high levels of deficit in the past. And they can't -- the war -- the depression was over. The separation we're in now, with the deficit being driven by an unwillingness no tax and to cut entitlements, no end in site. Something that, you know, threatens to undermine the financial stability of the country. A silly place for to us be. It's crazy. 
>> Three pillars of fix the debt. Walk us through. 
>> I think we were talking about first of all doing something -- doing something real about it. Making sure that at least 4 trillion in reduction over the course of the next ten years and doing it in a smart way, not walking off the cliff, and causing us really to quite likely move back into recession. Plan it out over a period of time like intelligent adults ought to do. It has to be fair, there has to be entitlement reforms and revenue increases. We need to stop this political wrangling that just looks so silly out here in the country. This is a self-inflected wound. The fiscal cliff we're looking at. We need to get beyond that and get to the real problem, showing the world we know how to run the government of the united states. 

[00:17:56]


>> Paul krugman in "the new york times" has an interesting op-ed and starts off by saying we are not having a debt crisis and says this is really a political crisis. Let me read a bit of it. Americans may nod their heads when you attack big government in the abstract, but they strongly support social security, medicare and even medicaid. And he's talking about his framing of the gop. Part of the problem, americans have a sense against big government, but when it comes to big government, people don't want to cut those things of what they think are part of what americans deserve to have. 
>> I put the blame on that squarely on the political leadership in washington. I think the country is hungry and would response to someone how you fix the whole problem. These are the pieces that you need to put together to get us out of this mess. Instead, focused on aspects of the thing, and about whether marginal tax rates should go up or not, and what ought to be done about entitlements in the short term. People respond and will respond in this country, always have responded to someone who honestly tells them what the situation is and has a real proposal, not political in nature. Shared sacrifice that solves the problem. We ought to try that. 
>>> Dave wels of "the wall street journal" writes about the risk of cutting the deficit, too much too soon. If you just focused on jobs and could really solve the problem, bring your deficit to zero. If you had a robust job market. Bring unemployment down low enough in the budget geeks their vana critically adjusted deficit should be close to zero when the economy fires on all cylinders. He is like don't worry about debt, don't worry about the deficit, worry about jobs. 
>> I didn't read that piece, but I don't think anyone believes you can simply grow your way out of this. Would you have to have growth rates in the economy that are beyond anything we've experienced over a sustained period of time for long period of time to grow our way out of it. That's an easy way out. This requires taking some hard actions, and I think everyone also agrees we shouldn't go off the cliff. We are in the throes of a very sort of fragile recovery right now. Let's do the stuff it takes, space it in over time like a well-run organization would do and give the world some confidence. I would make the point if we really solved this problem, it would be a stimulus package to the economy greater than anything we tried to do before. 2 trillion sitting in corporate america sitting on the sidelines. A lot of jobs, a lot of investment. If we can present them and the rest of the world with a stable situation and an understandable situation where there is not big things in the road down the road, you will start to see money come in, and a huge stimulus to the economy. 

[00:20:54]


>> Former governor, fill bresenen, thank you. 
>> Thanks, enjoyed. 
>>> Still ahead, we'll talk about blackness. Comments from an espn host talking about washington redskins quarterback rg3. It's -- it's so crazy that i can't even summarize it in a line. But it -- it is a very interesting, and we'll talk about it on the other side of the short break. WE'RE BACK IN JUST A MOMENT. Subaru owners look in the mirror, they see more than themselves.

>>> Welcome back, everybody. Our team this morning. Bastian junger, author of a new e-book, called "a world made of blood." We'll talk about that later. Will cane, cnn contributor, columnist for theblaze.Com. And we have a former adviser to president clinton and a writer. 
>> How are you? 
>> I'm struggling this morning. 
>> It's friday. 
>> I'll try to fake it. Did you watch the espn host, rob parker. 
>> He made you watch it. Because we'll be talking about it. 
>> He's now really dealing with this controversial issue about race. Talking about the washington redskins quarterback, robert griffin iii, and earlier in the week, rg3 told a recorder he wants to be defined by his work ethic and character and less about race and that prompted parker to wonder what kind of brother rg3 really is. Let's play a chunk of that. 
>> My question, which is just a straight, honest question. Is he a brother? Or is he a call ball brother? 
>> What does that mean? 
>> He's not real. He's black, but he's not really down with the cause. We all know his wife beyonce, and he's a republican. No information at all. I'm trying to dig deeper into why he has an issue. 

[00:25:47]


>> Let me say this. I'm uncomfortable with where we just went. 
>> I love -- I love stephen a. Smith. I'm uncomfortable where you just went. Our documentary, "black in america," what it was all about. Rg3 doesn't fit into parker's sense of what real blackness is. 
>> Like a stereotype. People advocating against stereotypes, stereotyping themselves their own people. 
>> It's so -- it's so offensive on so many levels. You lined up three white guys to talk about this thing, this term cornball brother, and I tooked an informal poll, and all my black friends. Have you ever heard the term, the answer is unanimously by the way no. It turned robert griffin iii, any sense of individuality, and he wants to be defined by who i am, which is a fricking quarterback. 
>> He feels like he's dodging the question. Are you -- what is the role of race in being this great quarterback? Right? And for people of color, it's often a challenge. He wants to say I don't want to be defined by being the black quarterback, but at the same time I want to represent all of the black people who look at me as a great quarterback. Mr. Parker took some great exception to that, which is sort of a pr effort and -- 
>> he is trying to take something away from rg3. That is the tone of the conversation. 
>> Is he black? He has the corn rows. That column there. But he has a white fiancee. But he might be with the gop. 
>> Might be republican. 
>> Stephen smith, never thought in my whole life he would be uncomfortable. Who is black in america, my documentary, will reair saturday at 8:00 p.M. And parker, maybe I'll send him a copy of it.

[ Thunder crashes ] it doesn't. Stop pretending. Only flood insurance covers floods. ?????? ?????? visit floodsmart.Gov/pretend to learn your risk. 
>>> Welcome back, everybody. You're watching "starting point." Let's begin with john berman with a look at today's top stories. 
>>> Dancing in the streets of pyongyang, toasting the country's first successful satellite launch into space, even though the u.S. Government indicates that the north koreans might not have control of the satellite. The north korean government looking at the launch. As leaders call for punishment, insisting that the north koreans have moved one step closer to being able to launch nuclear weapons across the pacific. 
>>> Authorities in birmingham, taking another look at security procedures after a man shot and killed himself inside the federal courthouse. The u.S. Marshals said the man worked in the building and slipped the gun in as he used as employee entrance. No one in the courthouse wasser threatened. 
>>> An aspiring actor and comic killed after fulg into the roof of the intercontinental hotel in chicago. Nicholas wieme was taking pictures on the onion rooftop zone when he fell and became wedged in the chimney. It took hours for firefighters to get to him. Pronounced dead 45 minutes after they freed him. 

[00:32:05]


>>> Surveillance video captured a confrontation between a few young men who police say we arguing over a basketball game. One of the men, as he was leaving, turned and fired a handgun into the train. You see it right there. Wounding two people. Philadelphia police right now say they are searching for assailants. 
>>> The university of iowa, the first public university in the country to ask about their gender identity and sexual orientation on applications. Students aren't asked specifically if they are gay, only if they identify with the lesbian, gay, transgender community. This is an optional question that will help the university meet student needs and track retention rates in population. Soledad. 
>> Hmm. Not sure how I feel about that. I guess in some ways good to be able to provide opportunities, if you have a whatever percentage of gay students, people who are identifying however that question is phrased. But on the other hand, it seems weird to me. Crickets. Okay. 
>> I would say the university of iowa is the first public institution to do this, and I'm not sure I would have worded the question exactly the way they worded it. But I think it's a kood idea to know what -- 
>> how would you word the question? 
>> Are you gay or lesbian? They seemed to have made it more complicated than it needs to be. 
>> Why not just ask the question you want the answer to, rather than asking around the question. Ultimately and you don't have to answer. You could just ignore the question. 
>> It could be held against you. 
>> You don't have to answer, and also they say it's their business because it helps them serve different populations, the same way you ask optionally about race. 
>> You don't say do you identify with white people? 
>> That's why I say it's a silly way to ask the question. 
>> You start off very quietly, people, but I appreciate the conversation. Zero dark thirty, hotly anticipated thriller over the hunt of osama bin laden. Major buzz and controversy. Graphic depiions of brutal interrogations, and a young operative, purportedly modeled on a real cia operative. We have lauren ashburn, daily beast contributor and editor in chief of the daily download.Com to talk about that. It's just a movie. Why are people going completely nuts about this? 

[00:34:33]


>> It's just a movie. The woman in the center of it, the cia operative, was trashed on the front page of "the washington posaid as being abrasive, a passed over for promotion. 
>> It's a dock you drama it's a movie. 
>> This real person is not able to defend herself. 
>> But there is a big question whether or not the cia actually gave them all of this information, all of this access. The white house gave her access. We don't know who she is. 
>> She knows who she is. 
>> First of she could have her friends leak stuff back this is how the press works. She could have her friends leak stuff back. It would be fine, work it out. 
>> Torture, a half an hour of torture scenes in here. 
>> And I'm sure that's because they want to tell the story in the most accurate historical context, right? 
>> I don't know if it's accurate or historical, it's a docudrama. 
>> It's fun to watch you fight. But seriously, is there a requirement -- you've done movies obviously. Is there a requirement that a movie about war has to be accurate. There have been a ton of movies around a real topic. A real experience that have been, you know, taken poetic license on certain things. 
>> I have never made a fictional movie. But in a fictional movie you can do whatever you want as long as you don't call it a documentary. That said, I think the torture issue goes to the broader issue of why we're in afghanistan, in a sense. I've had this argument with people. And very happy with bin laden was killed. And the point I make, no way we could have killed bin laden without being in afghanistan, and you won't fly s.E.A.L. Team 6 from virginia a kill him. You don't get the intel and forward operating bases. We had to be in afghanistan to do that. The moral question for america, that was a correct decision to be at war in order to kill that person? The finer point, can you torture in order to kill someone you need to get? I don't know what the answer is. 

[00:36:57]


>> The filmmaker and cathlin big low are presenting this as a journalistic enterprise. They are not calling it a docudrama. They got an unusual degree of access to cia, white house, which wanted to spin this to a positive movie of obama. 
>> The positive piece in the center, the woman getting the credit for getting bin laden killed. 
>> Why is there a woman at the center of this movie? 
>> Is it more interesting? 
>> Wasn't there a woman at the center of the story? Based on a real character, right? 
>> Part of a team. And I think she's a heroine, and that's why I come back to the notion she is being trashed and she should be getting a medal. 
>> I haven't seen "zero dark thirty." Can you separate torture from bin laden? How does the movie treat that connection? 
>> Based on critic who's have seen it, they are saying there is a clear implication we would have not gotten bin laden if -- 
>> torture seems to have worked, softened up the character, the person who eventually gave information. 
>> Investigators are not convinced we would have gotten bin laden. 
>> You can't say a movie like argo, which goes often declassified information, does not at some point take license and create drama in certain scenes that did not happen. I don't believe that. Mississippi burning created entire characters around a real event. 
>> I thing about it the woman who gets highlighted at the center, people at the agency who had something to do with it are now starting this whole trash talk, she's this, she's that. 
>> You can say it's just a movie, but movies like this, it looks like a big box office movie shape perception for a lot of people who don't follow stories that closely. 
>> That's their fault. Go read a newspaper. Don't rely on movies as your source of news. 

[00:39:00]


>> Don't you think organizations like the cia have decided it's in their best interests to put storylines out there like this. 
>> I don't have to guess at this. A whole bunch of e-mail traffic that shows cia operatives saying we need to pick a winner. This will be big, we need to cooperate. 
>> If you were in the white house, wouldn't you do this? Cooperate and say here is the real side of the story? 
>> The problem, what are the messages? What message is it trying to send? The message torture works? Everybody could see, if you torture somebody they will -- 
>> where does it leave you? Where does it leave you if we are a country that tortures people. >>Do what sebastian does, write nonfiction, the message is only truth. When you venture into fiction and open to criticism. What are you trying to tell us? 
>> He says he wants it to be judged as a movie, it's not a documentary. It's a movie, not a documentary. 
>>> We have to take a short break. Still ahead, we'll talk about ambassador susan rice, taken herself out of the running for secretary of state. Does that mean that senator john kerry is a shoo-in?

>>> so this morning, we have been reporting that susan rice has withdrawn her name for consideration as secretary of state. Repeated republican attacks on her character are shameful. The confirmation process would have been too disruptive. Listen. 
>> I withdrew my name, I think it's the right thing for the country. And I think it's the right thing for the president. And putting those things together, that makes it the right thing for me and my family. 
>> Will cane, do you think she was pushed to this by republicans, or more at work here? 
>> I think there is more at work here. But certainly repcan opposition in the wake of her -- not testimony, but going out in front of an american audience on sunday shows played a role. 
>> About benghazi. 
>> About benghazi. Susan rice didn't have a strong well of democratic support behind her anyway. She had been ruled to not be the most diplomatic person in what would be the leading diplomatic post of the united states. 
>> She had one very important supporter for that post, the president of the united states. 
>> Is this the president showing weakness? As some people suggested? The president put into a corner by republicans who started immediately saying they wouldn't support her as secretary of state. 
>> The president is trying to pick the fights he can win. You have to look at what can happen with the fiscal cliff debate. The president has to choose where does he have to go on the mat? The fiscal cliff, issue of taxes. Or two fights, one on susan rice? 

[00:45:48]


>> I think what would happen, the president decided she w probably not the best person t be secretary of state for the country, and for our diplomatic initiatives. She served extremely well at the u.N. And she is a terrific diplomat. But there -- john kerry should be secretaf state. Perfect for it, and coming after hillary clinton, you need someone with a big international gravitas. And john kerry will be great. He's in. 
>> Also, a lot of people haven't heard about her until now. John kerry, everyone knows rice, like for a lot of americans, who is that? And the president was in a position of pushing someone relatively unknown until the controversy. 
>> We have to take a short break. We'll talk about tv. One of my favorite subjects. Changed a lot in the last decade. One of the most popular critics say we can thank the sopranos for that.

>>> Welcome back to "starting point." Former president george h.W. Bush is expected to be home sometime before christmas. He's been in a houston hospital for three weeks recovering from a stubborn bout of bronchitis, 88 years old the oldest living former president. 
>>> Thursday night football, the stumbling bumbling philadelphia eagles, they fumbled the ball four times, they threw an interception but this was the worst. They blocked their own punt. You don't do that in football, that helped them to a 34-13 loss at home. They don't teach you how to do that. 
>>> If you noticed a change in your tv viewing habits over the years there are what feels like dozens of award winning shows on right now, "madmen" "breaking bed," "downtown abbi" and it all started with "the sopranos." The book is called "the revolution was televised." Nice to have you with us. 
>> Thank you for having me. 
>> What changed tv drama do you think? 
>> Well, what happened was in THE MIDDLE TO LATE '90s, SO MANY More channels were producing so much programming the audience fractured. One of the time the goal was we'll get it as big as possible and dumb it down, now the audience is smaller so instead of trying to aim for wide net let's go deep and get something that makes people passionate what they do. Hbo was willing to give creators to write it. 
>> David chaseidn't set out to write a drama, but wanted to make the stakes high enough that viewers would care. The writing has improved so much. When you look at some of the shows we just named there have been business changes, viewers started really to expect some high quality writing in dramas. 

[00:52:46]


>> Basically the tv dramas on cable in particular over the last 15 years replaced the kinds of movies that adults used to expect to see. Now the movies are blockbusters and low budget art films and not a whole lot in between. Now if you want serious drama about adults and adult issues and what's going on in america you look to hbo and fx and amc and showtime. 
>> Why is that? I worked at a broadcast station for a long time. I used to wonder why can't we get some of these shows? 
>> They've tried and there's a few broadcast shows in my book, I write about "lost" and the problem is with broadcast the threshold is higher. Fox did a show a couple years ago called lone star which was basically their attempt to do an amc style show, canceled after two episodes because not enough people watched. 
>> People embrace an anti-hero in cable than on network, people like the flawed, terribly damaged person manufacturing drugs and stuff like that, you could see networks executives being oh my god, we could never possibly have this show on our air. 
>> Archie bunker was an anti-hero. It happened. 
>> He did an episode when he runs in the ku klux klan, those are the racist. Archie is just ugly and says offensive things. 
>> I still miss the sopranos. Was it the greatest television series either? 
>> Either "the sopranos" or "the wire." 
>> Was the ending the best ending on television ever? 
>> It is certainly the ending we've talked about the most of any television show ever and I'm still getting arguments about it to this day. 
>> Simon, he talks about how i real writer wants to do something, envision a story that has a beginning, a middle and an end and seems like a different format than year ago when the goal was to be on tv for as long you can, your show has as many seasons as possible. Versus we have an arc and when that story is told we're done. 

[00:54:53]


>> One of the things that happened a lot during this period, have producers go to the network heads and say I want to end this show, I've told the story, the producers of "battlestar gallatica" and it's no longer let's drag this out. It's her the story, tell it in the best way possible in the minimum amount of time and let's go before people get sick of us. 
>> Changing viewing habits, because I watch "homeland" "breaking bad," but something else changed, I watch them all on demand or I stream them. I rarely watch them when they air. Now, it occurs to me that a lot of these are funded by channels by packages where you pay for 100 cable channels and I don't watch 99 of them. We move to ala carte do these series continue? 
>> That's what I don't know. If people start cord cutting, the networks have made things so easy to watch, if people say i don't need my cable, I just want internet the money may not be there for the shows. Netflix is starting to produce their own shows, one called "house of cards" with kevin spacey that's their attempt to be the next hbo. 
>> I shot something for that. I'm so excited, in march it comes out. 
>> Yes. 
>> The book is called "the revolution was televised." Alan sepinwall nice to have you with us. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>>> Still ahead the story of some basketball players who lost their high school basketball game by 105 points. It was 107-2.

>>> America inching closer to the fiscal cliff, 18 days we go over, that means triggering massive tax hikes and spending cuts all at the same time. The house of representatives set to go home for the holidays today and yesterday the president and speaker boehner metaphor 50 minutes and then released a statement that didn't say a whole heck of a lot but both called the discussion frank and said the lines of communication remain open. Our senior congression correspondent dana bash is here. Forget the christmas plans you're probably notng to be enjoying christmas this year? 

[01:02:27]


>> Nobody thinks they're going home for christmas, if they do maybe for a day and come back to washington. I've been talking to sources in both parties this morning about that meeting yesterday with the president, and the speaker, which did not go very long, 50 minutes and did not go all that well. What we need are new proposals and coming together and I'm told by both parties they really restated their positions. What seems to be going on is frankly I think both sides are trying to run out the clock. The republicans they know the democrats have leverage and the speaker is just waiting potentially to the last minute so he can say I did my best, we have to raise more revenue and on the flipside, the democrats the president knows he has leverage and he's running out the clock. It's win/win for him. If at the end of the day the republicans cave on tax rates, great. If not,nd god forbid we go over the cliff he knows all the polling shows republicans will take the blame. 
>> We move away toward polling and a big fix for the benefit of the american people as a whole. I know you've had a chance to talk to two former senate majority leaders each on the other side of the aisle. 
>> Senates lott and daschle, they worked on many issues together and they still think that it is possible to get a deal, it just has to do with the timing. Listen to what they said. 
>> I still am convinced and hopeful at least that they're going to come to an agreement. There is an argument that you don't want to make it too early because that gives people that may not be too happy with it more time to undermine it so the tempo and the timing is important. 
>> I've heard people say in the last couple of days, republicans and democrats said the time has come for us to put our country ahead of our party, and that's really what it's going to take, putting the country ahead of the party. 
>> Exactly what you were just saying, soledad, the key difference between now and then, about a decade ago, is both parties, members of congress of both parties are very concerned not just about general voters but about getting primary from within their own party and that is why it is so much more difficult to get a deal. 

[01:04:46]


>> Dana bash thank you very much. 
>>> Lots of people have been giving the president some advice, dan glickman was a former congressman, served as secretary of agriculture under bill clinton. He writes this in "the hufgston post." "I have a humble suggestion for the president to give this debate a noble and unifying congress. The president should schedule an address so he can articulate to congress and the american people who what he with do better than most, are we still a nation sacrificing a little for the greater good?" Why do you think a presentation before a joint session of congress versus the two of them sitting in a room and continuing to try to hash out a deal is a better way to go? 
>> Soledad the issues are very big here. They have to do with the future of the country, jobs, economic security and these issues are being debated like is another political campaign, a question of power, who is going to win and who is going to lose and i don't think e american people really understand what's going on there, other than washington seems to be at it's games again it played before the election. Only the president has the bully pulpit. While I generally agree with the concepts he's put forward, substantively I think he's the only person who can talk to the american people, paint a picture and create a narrative why we're going through all this, totally absent f this discussion. Most americans think it's a tribal battle in washington not affecting their lives in any way. 
>> Painting a picture and what you wrote the specifics are less important than the big picture rationale and one of the big points of contention is lack of specifics. What are we actually thinking about cutting, exactly what will the tax rate be, things like that, I think people would argue that specifics, lack of spervegs has been a big problem in this debate. 
>> That's a question of leadership and both the president and the congress have to come up with those specifics. I'm reminded of the kennedy address, john kennedy, ask what you can do for your country. Somebody has to ask the american people, the wealthy and others as well, the whole society whether they're willing to sacrifice for the good of the country to maintain america's strength in its economy around the world. Nobody's done that yet, and we've seen proposals like the simpson-bowles proposal or domenici-rlin. I think somebody has to ask the american people, here are the facts, here is what happens if we don't do anything, that's not good for america and republicans and democrats and has to bring the american people into the debate. So far this has been an inside washington debate. 

[01:07:38]


>> Hi, congressman, it's richard socarides. I think if we all think about the speech that bill clinton gave at the democratic convention, if barack obama could go before congress and give that kind of a speech now i think it would really help him and the democrats win the day in these negotiations and I think that's the kind of thing you were suggesting, right? 
>> It is but I think he has to be careful not to give a partisan speech. This is a bigger speech than this. This has to do with the future of the republic. After all if we can't even add or subtract tower deficit into some reasonable way so the american people have some predictability and fiscal sanity nothing is going to work. He's the only one who can articulate this to the american people but it has to be done in a way that's not engaged in political gamesmanship. 
>> I'm not a cynic. Sometimes I am but today not particularly. I don't see how a speech somehow brings the american people who feel disconnected with a fiscal cliff discussion. What could I do? You do a very moving, say an amazing speech, moving, I laugh, I cry, I move, to do what? 
>> These conditions are not a mystery. These are the same lines from the same people we've been hearing for 14 months. I'm not quite sure how speaking to them in front of a different group of people makes any difference. 
>> I'd love to throw to dan, I'm not sure of the president's desire to do what you describe. Which is to mix up the fiscal cliff and our long-term debt situation. I've seen no desire coming fm the white house to deal with both issues at the same time. 
>> First of all I recognize it's maybe rather late to do a speech today. The president just can't do a speech without getting the speaker's permission to do that kind of thing but if you look at the issue bigger than just what the tax rates are going to be or what the entitlement cuts are going to be, this has to do with the fiscal stability and strength of america, to be the leader in the world. These are fundamental issues, somebody has to articulate the significance what have we're talking about to the american people so they understand it, and it has to be done in a nonpolitical, nonpartisan way. 

[01:09:49]


>> Dan glickman joining us, former democratic congressman and former agriculture secretary under president clinton, nice to have you with us sir.

This brings u.S. Troops into the volume tire area.

>>> Look at this picture of a high school basketball scoreboard, yes, 107-2, that is not a mistake. There are some calls for the winning coach, the winning coach to be fired for allowing such a crushing loss. We'll hear from the losing team's coach and their players, that's coming up next. 

[01:16:14]


>>> Welcome back, everybody. So we want to start this morning showing you a scoreboard. You're not misreading the score of the basketball game, 107-2, the final score of a girl's high school basketball game, the bloomington south lady panthers won, they defeated the arlington high school golden knights, the knights are made up of a number of young women who never played on a varsity team. The sign was really an indication of bad sportsmanship. Team members join us along with their coach. Nice to have you guys with us. We appreciate it. I'm going to start with you, coach, if I can. Tell me how everybody is feeling after what not only was it a devastating loss, everybody was talking about it, it made headlines all over the place. How are you guys feeling about that? 
>> Well, we were, we weren't shocked the next morning but then again we were in shock. It's a humbling experience and at the end of the day we're blessed because we have one another and we just go back to the grind on the basketball court the next morning, so it was shocking news but we got over it and we just are back on the ground on the basketball court. 
>> Briolette you're a freshman at arlington. Have you played basketball before? What went wrong that the score was so lopsided? 
>> Yes, I've played basketball before and I think what went wrong was that we just, it was a struggle because not everybody on the team has played before and this was a varsity game, and it was more competitive because they've played longer than most of us and they just work, they work very hard and we just haven't played before and it was probably really hard for all of us as a team. 
>> Coach, let me ask you a question some of the fallout people were saying there should have been a mercy rule meaning they should have figured out how to after a certain number of points were scored played the game differently, maybe the opposing team stop shooting on you, maybe stop the game, whatever. Sort of various versions of what should have happened. Letting the game go on so long that was really bad sportsmanship. Do you see it that way from the opposing team? 

[01:18:31]


>> No, I don't see it that way. I was asked about the mercy rule and I do not believe in the mercy rule. I just believe in character and this is the game of basketball, and I believe that all rules and regulations should stay the sabut I believe that this is a time for the opposing team or ourselves, whichever way the game is going if it's a lopsided score that the team works on something they've never worked on before and therefore that will milk time off the clock eventually and you won't have to go through the nurturing phase as I have been with my girls but nonetheless it's been a blessing. 
>> So I have a question. Who scored the two points that you got? 
>> Right here, free-throws. 
>> That's your hero. 
>> And you built from there. 
>> That was it. You guys have lost 23 games. You've really had a tough time and the school was taken over because of some academic issues so there's a level, everybody has to have a c grade point average on the team or they're not allowed to play. It's been a challenge for you. Mike epps the actor came in, gave a talk to the team and said listen there's a lot of growth that can be had basically in losing, when you lose, you can come back from that in a big way. What's the strategy coach now and how are you bringing your girls along, your young ladies along for the next games? 
>> Well, ever since the game had ended and all this has come about, our minds have not changed. They are the same as if this was the first game of the season, just staying humble, working hard, continuous effort every single day and keeping a smile on our face and basically still getting after it in the classroom first and we just haven't changed who we are and how we do things, and I just tell my girls every single day, it's about getting better, growing relationships and building our character at the end of the day, so we haven't changed anything. 

[01:20:46]


>> I think that's true. I completely support that, and yes, in the classroom first and foremost, and then on the basketball court after that. Coach ebony jackson joining us, briella thompson and her teammates joining us from the arlington high school golden knights women's basketball team. They have a great school, I had a chance to tour it, a great restart and focusing on academics.

>>> Good morning, I'm clps cls watching your money. U.S. Stock futures are up slightly but worries about the fiscal cliff persist. The s&p 500 snapped a "360" day winning streak despite modest economic data. The s&p is still up almost 13% this year. Starting to be some worries going over the fiscal cliff we'll see a return of some of the gains. 
>>> Ben bernanke says the fed stimulus will continue until the jobless rate falls to 6.5%, a full percentage point from where we are right now. To get there in one year one economist told cnn money we need to create 270,000 jobs a month. To get there in two years we need 200,000 jobs per month. The growth right now about 150,000 a month so growth at that rate is unlikely. It could mean at this rate it could take until 2018 to reach 6.5% unemployment. If hiring stays like it right now the job won't turn into a pre-recession 5% until 2025. 
>> Bernanke is saying they'll keep the rate at that level until then. 
>> They'll keep interest rates low and keep stimulating until we get back to 6.5%, so that means the fed will keep propping things up as long as they can. 
>>> Still ahead on "starting point" reminding people of the trayvon martin case, the 17-year-old shot to death in florida, a man said that apparently the music in the car, the boys were riding, was too loud and there's a chance the fact that the shooter could use the controversial stand your ground law as his defense.

It doesn't sound like he'll be going after people smoking pot.

>>> We turn to a story we've been following now for several weeks and it is a tough, tough story, the man who killed 17-year-old jordan davis in a florida parking lot is scheduled to appear in court on monday. He is 45 years old, his name is michael dunn and he is charged with first-degree murder and three counts of attempted murder for firing into a car where davis and three of his friends were sitting. Dunn says he felt threatened by the teenagers, after he asked them to turn down their music, so it was basically over loud music and that he shot them in self-defense, and there is some word his first attorney said that they might focus on florida's controversial stand your ground law in his defense. Now since then he has switched attorneys. Joining to us talk about this is lucia McBeth and ron davis, jordan davis' parents and their attorney as well john phillips. It has been a horrific three weeks for you. I cannot imagine how awful it has been, if you can, ms. McBETH, TELL ME HOW YOU FOUND Out that jordan had been killed. What happened? 
>> A phone call from his father, my husband and I were in chicago for thanksgiving and I happened to come up to the bedroom and i saw ron's name pop up, and i knew the moment I saw his name, that late at night, I knew it had to do with jordan. 

[01:34:27]


>> Did you know it had to be bad? 
>> I knew in my spirit it was not good. I knew that it could not be good that late at night for him to be calling. 
>> When did you, mr. Davis, learn the details of what had happened in the parking lot? Because the shooting was horrific, but the details around the shooting awful as well. 
>> Yes. Its first call I got was from the best friend of my son, and he had phoned his mother while in the car and his mother called me and I rushed to the hospital to see about my son and when i found out that he had been shot and killed and the way that we been shot and killed, I got home and told my wife what happened, and it was the most excruciating thing. I mean, it just tears at your gut and tears at your heart all at the same time and you're unsteady and then to make that call to her, and just to, just to try to soften the blow, you know, just a little bit for her, because that's our only child, the only child we were going to have together and he was a special child. He was just great, a great, great child, and we'll never recover from it, and this gentleman has just torn the fabric of our family apart. 
>> Before we talk about your son, let's talk a little bit about the case. Mr. Dunn says, he had a concealed weapons permit. He took, we know, the gun out of the glove compartment, fired eight shots into the car and his attorney, first attorney, he's now swapped attorneys said they might focus on the stand your ground law and mr. Phillips you can jump in if you feel like this is a question that needs to go to you. Here is what the first attorney has said about what happened that night. Let's play that. 
>> Kill that mother [ bleep ], you dead [ bleep ], and he sees that much of a shotgun coming up over the rim of the suv, which is up higher than his jetta and all he sees are heavily tinted front windows that are up, and the back windows that are down and the car has at least four black men in it, and he doesn't know how old anybody is, he doesn't know anything, but he knows a shotgun when he sees one. 

[01:36:52]


>> So that's her explanation of what happened. Is this case about race? Is this case about loud music? What is this case really about, do you think? 
>> It's about loud music and it's also about anger, about having a concealed weapon in your car, knowing you have it and feel bold enough to use it because you're being shielded in the state of florida, they tell you if you have a concealed weapon these are some of the things you can do if you feel you're threatened in any way, then you are allowed to use your weapon, so he was angry, and he heard loud music, of course you got 17-year-olds, they don't do what you say if you're in a public place. You're not their parent and he decided that, well, you know what? If you don't turn the music down I'm going to take my weapon out and shoot at the car at least eight times at the car in a gas station. 
>> The stand your ground law says you're justified to use deadly force if you reasonably believe that such force is necessary to prevent eminent death or great bodily harm to yourself. You were going to say? 
>> If it is about race for mr. Dunn he's the only one that knows that. We're not going to use that, because that doesn't justify anything that has happened for jordan, it doesn't justify anything that has happened for trayvon martin, it doesn't justify anything that happens for anyone else that falls victim under this law. It just doesn't. So he's the only one who understands and knows where he was and what was in his heart at that time, and he has to deal with that. 
>> Did you worry about jordan whenhe trayvon martin case happened? I've had so many parents say to me -- 
>> absolutely. 
>> Oh my god that could have been my kid. 
>> Absolutely, you think about that all the time. As we've said before when your children grow up and go on, you have to give them a freedom, chance and opportunity to be who they are and they make friend and do things, there's always the undercurrent, always a little bit of that fear that you're concerned because you can't be there with them, you can't hold their hand anymore. You've trained them and you've done everything that you can do but they do have to go out in the world. You do your best that you can to protect them. 

[01:39:05]


>> Soledad I'd like to really say that I just want the community and the world, america to know that when you allow people under this shield stand your ground you're putting in jeopardy your kids that have nothing to do with the two people that are facing each other. You have people, the kids are playing hop scotch, kids are jumping rope, riding bikes, your nephew, your niece and two people decide to draw down on each other, they're going to hit anything that's in the way, so america has to know that it's not just the two people involved, it's the people that have nothing to do with the 10-year-old kid, the 10-year-old girl, somebody's niece, somebody's daughter, that happened to be playing near the two people that decided to draw on each other. 
>> It's unclear if he's going to in fact use the stand your ground law. The second attorney that has come in has not indicated that either way but whatwould you like to see for him? 
>> That's the problem with the stand your ground law, based upon a reasonable person's standard and the only witness to the reasonable person whether that person was being reasonable was now killed in every one of these cases and that's a major problem. 
>> What would you like to see happen? Mr. Dunn goes to court on monday, arraignment. 
>> We have actually already begun to fight against the stand your ground laws. We've started www.Walkwithjordan.Com and on that site, you can go and sign the federal petition to go to washington, we're going to washington to make amends to the federal stand your ground laws. We have to do it federally because that mandates all the stes to take a look at this, not just the state of florida. So we've already begun that walk, www.Walkwithjordan.Com. We only need 25,000 signatures, by the end of this month, for washington to take a look at it. 
>> Thank you for talking with us this morning. I know this is a terrible, horrific thing to have to discuss and something I'm sure as a parent you can't even imagine.

>>> Welcome back, everybody. Sebastian junger is better known for being out in the field, facing danger, writing about it. He's a best selling book like "the perfect storm" "war" and his latest work of fiction is an eBOOK CALLED "THE WORLD MADE OF Blood" and tells the story of a young american journalist trying to survive his latest assignment which is a war-torn country in africa. Talk to me a little bit about why you decided to write this STORY AND PUT IT OUT AS AN eBOOK And also some of the really what's behind some of the other projects you're really passionate about, helping journalists like the guys you talk about in the story. 

[01:45:25]


>> I've always been a journalist, covered a lot of civil wars as a journalist and after sierra leone was my first civil war in africa, it was incredibly terrifying. I was at a situation at a checkpoint we were stopped by rebel forces, stepped out of the jungle and stopped us at gunpoint and for about 15 minutes it seemed like they were going to kill everybody. I spent 15 minutes trying to get myself ready for that. It didn't happen obviously. I wrote my story and several years later I kept think being that really traumatic episode and thought I want to write a piece of fiction that goes to what happened with me and keeps going, and how would I react, how would people react and so that was why I came to write fiction. It's not something most journalists do but it was an interesting experience. It's a short story and I put it line because I wrote this in '04 but now that's how you reach people is online, it's on byliner and we're getting an incredible response. People are really reading it. Itoes to the dangers of the job. People in the last year more journalists have been killed this past year than several previous years combined. It's incredibly dangerous now. 
>> Especially for the freelancers. We all get in, if you work for cnn we go through this training if you're going to be in a war zone. If you're a freelancer you show up with a backpack and have to navigate and learn as you go, terribly dangerous. 
>> The first war I was in, in bosnia and '93, went there with a backpack, sleeping bag and notebooks. That's how I broke in. I didn't have an assignment. In the arab spring it's wide open for that opportunity for young people and that's why the mortality rates sore high. I started an organization called reports instructed in saving colleagues. 
>> Risc. 
>> To provide free combat medical training to freelance war reporters. I had a good friend hetherrington, but he just bled out. Had I been there I would have watched him die, couldn't help him. I started aa training program, three session ace year to train freelance war reporters how to save lives.

>> It's amazing how many things do you in terms of nonprofits and things after stories that have touched you. This is not the first thing you've done "the perfect storm" you were moved to making a difference in addition to being the reporter around it. Is that a way to get your head around all of the things you see and deal with? 
>> Journalists have to stay out of the story and if it's a painful story there's a moral anguish there. Non-profits are one way to deal with the anguish. 
>> Thanks for talking about it with us. THE eBOOK IS CALLED "A WORLD Made of blood." Sebastian, thanks. We have to take a short break.

>> Gentlemen, the deployment order is out and I've instructed the sergeant major to lock down the base. In less than 48 hours, we will be inside one of the most dangerous combat zones in the world. 

[01:52:18]


>> The film elores issues of loyalty versus duty and is resonating is veterans. Aidan quinn nice to have you here. 
>> Nice to be here. 
>> Allegiance is a military film but it isn't just for people interested in the military. 
>> I just loved the script, the characters. The gentleman, the young man that wrote it and directed it did a phenomenal job and talking to him, he convinced me that he was going to do a good job and indeed he did. 
>> He's a veteran and he surrounded himself the entire movie, people funding it and helping out on it were all veterans. What kind of expertise do you think they brought to make it better and more realistic? 
>> You see a tremendous amount of expertise in all the characters, whether it's, you know, they do great work, they WERE TRAINED BY NAVY S.E.A.L.s And people that were in the military, we had military always there, so they just made sure they kept it real. 
>> Is it a true story? 
>> I think it's based on some of the things that happened to the director. I don't know how much of it is actually true, but it's based on a lot of things that happened to mike connors, the director. 
>> It's the story of allegiance, when a fellow soldier has to go awol because he's trying to see his son who is dying and of course he's a part-time soldier who now suddenly has become a full time soldier in another country. I want to show a little clip of that. 
>> Do you honestly think I want to let you walk out of here without even a slap on the wrist? Hell no! But these are the decisions i have to make for the good of the unit. For the good of the men. That's all, lieutenant. 
>> Do you think we're seeing more movies out of hollywood on the military? 
>> I don't think so. I think hollywood is very afraid of any military films because they're tough for the audience because we have conflicted feelings about our involvement in iraq and afghanistan. I think the great thing that has changed is we have 100%, almost seems like 100% approval of our veterans, and support for our veterans. I know that is a huge improvement. 

[01:54:39]


>> Right, so where there is conflict it's not over the individuals. 
>> Right. 
>> Most people look at them as heroes regardless of how they feel about the spending or the war itself. 
>> Exactly. 
>> This film is being released first on video on demand. 
>> Um-hum. 
>> Then will go into movie theaters which seems to me to be a complete flip of how it used to work. 
>> Right. It's exactly the opposite of how it used to work but now how it's done on good low budget films. The idea is to get word of mouth, get it talked about on the internet and then you release it so you're actually getting free, if you will, publicity by getting people talking about it on the internet, and it's quite successful.

O o 
>> first from fox at 3:00, a horrific murder inside an elementary school. Fox news has confirmed up to 27 people are dead including what we hear now an updated number for the children, 20 children. That would make this the most deadly school shooting in united states history second only to the massacre at virginia tech in newtown, connecticut, 50 miles southwest of connecticut state capital, and 60 miles from our studio in new york city. Cops identified the shooter as 24-year-old man, ryan lanza. Police say at 9:30 they received an emergency call from the school right after the school, or around the town the school usually looks the doors. The killer, dressed in mock military gear, armed with two guns as he opened fire inside the school. His victims? Teacrs and children. 
>> We spotted the troopers and the newtown police entered the school and me began a complete active shooter seven including checking every door and every crack and every portion of the school. Our objective was to evacuate as quickly as possible. 
>> Officials have not confirmed the number of dead saying that they are in the process of notifying families. The officials said the shooter died inside the school. It is unclear if he took his own life or if police killed him. There are reports that the man's mother was found dead and investigators are questioning a second person. This is a developing story. Jonathan hunt is live in newtown, connecticut the scene. >>Jonathan: HARD TO IMAGINE And hard to put in words the terror inflicted upon sandy hook where we are, part of the greater newtown area. Or upon the children of sandy hook elementary. It is perhaps described best by one of the children themselves who was led away from the school early today. Listen. 

[00:02:25]


>> We were just in the middle of gym and we heard gunshots. The power went out. The gym teachers directed us to stay against the wall and everyone started panicking. Then the police came in. They asked if he was in here. We had to climb into the closets and we heard a lot more gunshots and the ambulance came. 
>> The one thing about the children is that some of them don't understand exactly what happened here but parents obviously understood it all too well. You can only imagine t terror that they experienced as they heard about the shootings and started running toward the school. Here is one of the parents. 
>> Mayhem in the room with all the kids and the teachers trying to find your kid, identify them, trying to find out the situation. 
>> There are no words. Terror and a sense of immediate urgency to get to your child and to be there to protect them. 
>> As hard as the teachers tried to protect the children, in sandy hook elementary school today, the awful news is that 20 children were among the total of 26 dead. We do not have final figures. All of this obviously is very fluid. It could change. 
>> We ask for your patience as we work to confirm every detail we have so far. The wires, jonathan, show that ryan lanza's father was killed in his home in new jersey. In addition to the news from the top of the hour, his per, we know, the per of the shooter was found dead in connecticut. We are putting together a little bit of what happened perhaps early this morning but the timeline as we know we are still discovering. What else do we know of the shooter? >>Jonathan: WE ARE TOLD HE WAS 24. Ryan lanza was his name. There was some initial confusion with the shooter being identified as a 20-year-old. We do know according to officials that ryan lanza has a 20-year-old brother. That may have been where some of the confusion came from. Also, interesting to note as we note that, there were reports that police were questioning a second person in detection with the shootings that they allegedly found in the woods behind the school. All of this, obviously, in its early stages. Police are confirming just now the shooter died inside the school. They have also confirmed that both the mother and father of ryan lanza have been found dead in their homes. The father in new jersey, the mother here in newtown, connecticut. She worked at the school but police obviously are still working through at the who of leads. 

[00:05:55]


>> The shooter is deceased inside the building. There is a great deal of work that will be undertaken immediately upon locating the shooter. There is a great deal of search warrant activity and law enforcement activity, instate and out of state to cover all the bases relative to that individual. The scene is secure. >>Jonathan: THE SCENE IS Secure. The school obviously is a major crime scene right now. Unimaginable to think of the scene inside sandy hook elementary. 
>> Part of the screen the viewers can see what is continuing to be a live shot. We see a lot of responders and police cars on the scene. Tell us where you are standing in relation to the school. Also, talk to us about what you have seen from the responders that has stayed on that scene for the last several hours. >>Jonathan: WE ARE AT A MEDIA Staging area the police have essentially set up. The school is a little bit behind me across the fields. It is on complete lockdown. Every street in this very small town of sandy hook is shut off by the cops for obvious reasons. The people of the town as we will hear later, they are not really wanting to talk to the media. Very, very understandable. Everyone here is in a complete state of shock. We did hear some reports that some of the firefighters -- there is a firehouse close to the school -- some of the firefighters walked out in tears and if it is reducing grown men to tears you can only imagine what the small children went through. Many were led out through the school in the immediate aftermath of the shotting by their teachers and by police. They were told to cover their eyes. One can only assume they were told to do that because they were walking around bodies of kids who used to be their classmates. 

[00:08:10]


>> Back to jonathan when we get more news. We are awaiting a news conference from the governor of connecticut and a statement from president obama in seven minutes. Now a woman and her eight-year-old daughter, a student, both join us on the phone. Brenda, as a mother, can you tell us about what you have learned. >>Caller: Well, when I first came home I assumed it was only the principal that was killed. Then I found out that 26 people. I talked to some friends and there are children that are unaccounted for and they will not tell the parents where they are. That is all we know since I left the school. 
>> So there is a lot of confusion. That has been our experience with the story. Your daughter is on the line, what grade are you in? >>Caller: Third grade. 
>> What happened at school? >>Caller: We were about to have social studies and math we and heard big bgs, like got shots and miss martin went to lock the door and she told us to go in the corner and miss martin called 9-1-1 and they came. 
>> The his came? >>Caller: Yes. 
>> That is it right new. Can you tell me about how you felt when that was happening? >>Caller: I felt scared. And everyone was shaking. 
>> I am sure. It sounds like your teacher did a good job, though. Miss martin is her name? >>Caller: Yes. 

[00:10:10]


>> How did you get out of the school? >>Caller: The cops knocked on the door and he told us to come out and we ran out. 
>> You were pretty happy to see your mom? >>Caller: Yes. 
>> Tell us how you first learned about the shooting and how were you able to reunite with your daughter. >>Caller: I got an emergency phone call there was a shooting and the school was on lock down and then I got a text from ap that there was a shooting at a school in sandy hook and i thought, that that is our school. I went to school and there were hysterical moms and she said what is going on, and she said the principal was dead and the children came out with blood. I was numb. It was the worst moment of my life and I saw her come from the school, from the firehouse, with her class, come from next to the score and I broke into tears, the happiest moment of my life. 
>> What relief. We can only ma'am how that felt. We are so happy you were able to see your daughter at that moment. Can you tell me, when you are in school, we have heard from people in the town that sometimes you practice emergency drills. Have you practiced emergency drills like the one you did today? >>Caller: Not really. Going out and waiting until the people call us. 
>> Did you see anything when you walked out the school? >>Caller: No. 
>> What is next, mom in how do you talk to your daughter about this? What are they telling you, the school officials, about what is next for parents? >>Guest: OBVIOUSLY EVERYTHING Is cnceled for today. We are just, I want to know how personal friends are and make sure the kids are safe, my friends' children I want to make sure they are safe. We are just dailying with it. 

[00:12:38]


>> Can you tell me one last thing, how did itl when you saw your mom at the fire house? >>Caller: I was really happy. 
>> I bet. We are happy. That is an emotion you both shared. Thank you, both, friend da and sophia. We are so glad your daughter is safe. 
>> Thank you to both of you. Remember, she is just eight, one of the children inside the school, nearly 700 students in the school, kindergarten through 4th, YOU THINK ELEMENTARY School is old are kids but at this school it only goes up to the 4th grade. We will wait for the president. He will make a statement and we will wait to hear from him. Speaker boehner says he is lowering the flags over capitol hill over this incident. But, first we return to the scene, our reporter isin'ing us. >>Reporter: THE LATEST Information we have been hearing is that the gunman who killed at least 27 persons, 18 of them elementary schoolchildren, meaning somewhere between ten and under, he was from newtown, connecticut, a small suburban community, quiet suburban community, with no crime. He, sources are saying, he went to emergency and kill a relative there. Then he came here this morning newtown and walked into the sandy hook school where his mother teaches, shot and killed her mother and shot and killed most of the children in the classroom, the 18 children were in the classroom. The police have recovered two handguns and possibly a .223 high caliber rifle he may have used. He was wearing, dressed in black with body armor, and carrying the two pistols. After he shot his mother and killed the children in that elementary school classroom, he walked down the hallway and at that point, this is a one-level school building, the principal came out of the principal's office with two teachers and at that point the alleged gunman shot and killed the principal. A total of 27 persons killed, 18 of them children, and nine adul and we hear that some children may also be in serious condition and may have also died so the numbers may go up to 30 but that is not officially confirmed. That is the situation like in newtown, connecticut. 

[00:15:41]


>> He was standing down the street from the scene and we are skipping over a few states here as we continue to watch the story. The crime. The murders happened in newtown, connecticut, but the shooter may have lived in new jersey, where his father was found killed. His mother also fund killed in new stun connecticut. We are just now putting together the story as it comes to our newsroom. Right now, 20 children have died. That is the latest. That number has changed the last several hours. We will continue to keep you updated. The president is set to make remarks about the shooting today. 
>> I have spoken with the governor this afternoon and fbi director mueller. I offered the governor my condolences on behalf of the nation and made it clear he will have every single resource that he needs to investigate this heinous crime, care for the victims, counsel their families. We have endured too many of the tragedies in the past few years. Each time I learn the news i react not as a president but as anyone else would, as a parent. That was especially true today. I know there is not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of five and ten. They had their entire likes 
ahead of them: Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were teachers men and women who developed their lives to help our children fulfill their dreams. Our hearts are broken today for the parents and grandparents and sisters and brothers of the little children and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors, as well, for as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight they know that their children innocence has been torn away from them too early and there are in words that will ease their pain. As a country we have been through this too many times. Whether it is elementary school in newtown or a movie theater in aurora or a street corner in chicago, the mains are our neighborhoods and the children are our children. We are going to have to come folk and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this regardless of the politics. This evening, michelle and i will do what every parent will do, hug our children tighter and we will temperature them we love them and remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in connecticut who cannot do that tonight. They need all of us, right now, in days to come, the community needs us to be at our best as americans, and I will do everything in my power as president to help because while nothing can fill the space of a lost child or loved one all of us can extend a hand to those in need to remind them that we are there for them, that we are praying for them, that the love they felt forthose they lost endures not just in their memories but also in ours. May god bless the memory of the victims and in the words of scripture "heal the broken hearted and bind up their wound wounds." 

[00:20:17]


>> An emotional president obama making a statement about the school shooting that transpired this morning on a quiet winter morning, friday inwe are morni right before the holidays in connecticut. The president reflecting how so many of us feel. Our hearts are breaking with our fellow americans in connecticut. We will look at a couple of things happening around the country will we are all taking this in. What you are seeing is the flag at half staff at the white house. The president has ordered that to happen as a way to honor the victims in connecticut. It will be flown at half staff and the white house says upon all public buildings and grounds, all military posts and naval stations so if you see this, this is what this is for. We will move to the capitol, speaker boehner early today also saying that the flag will fly at half staff again to honor the victims. Ed henry at the white house with us from the briefing room, standing by. You have seen the reaction from the president and jake carney. Very report everyone in this room is trying to take a breath. I have never seen the president in four years getting that emotional and wiping away tears in front of us, and he stopped himself several times in the remarks saying obviously that he is reacting not just as a president but as a parent as many of us obviously are all around the country and the world. It is also important to note that the business of government does go forward. He made very clear he spoke to the governor in connecticut and he spoke to the f.B.I. Director, robert mueller, and pledged every resource of the ral government will be there for the folks in conneicut, state and local law enforcement, to tell with this tragedy and he obviously got into the emotional toll of this tragedy that goes far beyond what any dollar or any resource from the government can deal with but it is also worth noting and I want to make sure I quote hip, he said that at some point we will "come together to take meaningful action regardless of politics." Interesting because early today as you noted jake carney was careful to say it is too soon-to-be talking about whether there will be gun control legislation in the days and months ahead to deal with tragedies like this, prevent future tragedies like this. Again, the president didn't use the words gun control but he said meaningful action regardless of politics in the days ahead. He has faced some criticism after what he noted have been a series of tragedies during the first term of his administration. He mentioned the movie theater in aurora, colorado, the temple in wisconsin, tucson, arizona, as well, with congresswoman gabrielle giffords shot and others lost their libs. She thankfully survived. You could tell the emotional trillion on this president from all the tragedies but this in particular with all the children. 

[00:23:13]


>> Well put. Thank you so much. Back to the white house as we get more news. A few different points of what the president had to say, and i note that the president gave us more information than we previously had. The president noted that as a victim, it included children 5 to 10 years old. If you are just gypping, we have been reporting over the last several hours we have heard of the shooting taking place in a few different locations including the principal's office, the elementary classroom, and the first gradefrom a parent. The president narrowed that down, 5 to 10 years old. The question is, what happened inside the school? We don't know. We do know that this is the murder of some of our most innocent. That is the big headline of the day as we continue to look through the other details. Now is child psychologist and associate professor and a former nypd investigator. Doctor, first the murderer. Dead. That enrages us. There is anger and sadness. What do you do with the remain motions? >>Guest: WE HAVE HEARD A LOT Of people talking about are we becoming sensitized to mass shootings? We hear about it. We are upset for a day or two but this takes it to another level. Our most innocent people. Our youngest. Our most vulnerable members of society. We see they are not safe. They have been sluttered -- slaughtered. Will wake us up to the issues of society whether it is medical laws, legal haws, gun laws. I think it is much too early to go into those right now. Right now we have to focus on what is happening with the parents, with the children, in that school and that country, what is happening with us here in the united states. This is a global issue. We have to allow people to talk about their grief and rage. 

[00:25:30]


>> One question that comes up, why does this happen, and what kind of person does this? >>Guest: IT IS A SICK AND Deranged individual. Something was going on in his mind that not only took the likes of those innocent people, the schoolteachers as well as his own parents in two separate states. What we know now there are two separate crime scenes, one in new jersey why his father appears to be killed by him. As well as a crime scene, two crime scenes in connecticut, one at the school and one in his mother's home. So law enforcement has a very big task, putting together the different crime scenes and tie the case together to understand why it happened, were there warning signs, and what do we do moving forward. To jeff's point, I would say it is time for us to go him and hug our children and to be with our children and try and counsel them in what happened in someone else's school bus they will hear about it. 
>> I am glad you brought that up. We will take a quick break but so many parents and families are going to see this, it is unavoidable, so we will learn to talk to our kids about it. Do you want to take a break? We will take a quick break. 

[00:30:49]


>> We expect to hear from the governor of cut -- connecticut where the school shooting took place this da right before holiday break in the middle of hanukah right before christmas. We expect to hear from governor malloy in a few minutes and hope to hear more of the details. Officials have been keeping the details under wraps. They are talking to the families of those affected. Welcome back to continuing coverage of the worst school shootings in our history. 26 people plus the shooter are dead. 20 of them, the victims, are children. At sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut; where this happened. Teachers and school officials helped the young students escape. The firehouse was down the block and they told them to close their eyes as they left the school building. Moments ago the president offered his thoughts from the white house. 
>> The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of five and ten. They had their entire lives 
ahead of them: Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. 
>> The murder of the children and the death of their dreams. 
>> Some of the kids are being led out of the school and the girl in the center of the screen is crying beyond consolable getting led out of school. The hospital in neighboring danbury connecticut is treating three patient. The school and the facility was on lockdown. We spoke with the mayor of danbury who said the communities had actions plans in place. 

[00:32:53]


>> Whether it was a school shooter or mass casualty we drill and we practice and the kids practice. That ishy we need these things so we are ready. 
>> We spoke with an 8-year-old would came out of school 10 minutes ago and said she remembers fire drills and we know a drill is one thing but a mass shooting is another. Little can prepare you for this. The parents have been stunned saying they have known newtown, connecticut, as one of the safest places in the country. Rick? 
Rick: We are surrounded by dozens of members of the media. The governor is very close and is expected to approach the podium. I want to update our viewers on information from a reliable federal law enforcement source who says the shooter in this case may not be ryan lanza but his brother. Ryan lanza is in custody in new jersey and that adam, 20, is, in fact, the shooter and used an assault rifle and a glock handgun and may have killed his father in new jersey and then gone do his mother's home here near sandy hook in newtown, connecticut, killed his mother and went to her kindergarten and slaughtered every child in the classroom. The death toll is 26 including 20 children and five adults. The shooter is confirmed dead and is, in fact, adam lanza and his brother, ryan, may be in custody. I am told the two weapons were registered to his mother. We are expecting an update from the governor. We were told earlier that his primary concern is the family members of the victims and the governor's press person is approaching as our the state police. 
>> Thank you. We will go there like to the lot of the scene are parents and an official and we don't know the woman on left. Maybe we can bring that picture back, someone who is reacting to the situation looking beyond consolable and we can only imagine as we learn 20 children dead, several adults, and we are still waiting on consolation on what happened inside the school. Rick brought us news that perhaps the name that we have for the individual of the shooter is wrong and we will work on confirming that. Rick is always reliable and this has been chaos. This only the initial reports pointed to two shooters. We also heard that local officials were looking for another car that had fled the scene. We had live shots of investigators going into the woods behind the schools. There were many questions on whether the investigation was over, was the scene done, or was there something going on. Obviously there is much more to the investigation. The body of the shooter is inside the bill and we will work on confirming the identity. One of the thing we are also watching is the fact that whoever the shooter is, the brother, try as we may, ryan or adam -- here is the governor. 

[00:36:16]


>> Tragedy played itself out in this community. The lt. Governor and I have been spoken to in an attempt to be prepared for something like this playing itself out. We can never be prepared if this kind of incident. What has happened, what has transpired at the school building will leave a mark on this community and every family impacted. I and only that all of our fellow citizens in the united states and around the world who have offered their assistance, remember all of the victims in their prayers. To all of you of the media, we will do our best to keep you as informed as we can. After I'm done speaking a representative of the state police will speak to you and give you some additional information. Early today a number of our citizens, beautiful children, had their live taken away from them, as well as adults whose responsibility it was to educate and supervise those children. The perpetrator of the crime is dead as is an individual who the perpetrator lived with. With that I will turn it over to paul who will answer or will give you additional information. Later in the day, perhaps, we will speak again. On behalf of the people of the state of connecticut we extend our condolences to the parents of these children as well as the adults. I thank the president who has been on the phone with us today for his statement released to you a little while ago and the statement made to me earlier today as the hours raced by. I should also say there are a number of public officials including the first select woman who has been on-site throughout the day. We have state representative and state senator and other select people who are here. We have the superintendent of schools would has done wonderful work in helping us get the information necessary to begin the process that will be ongoing for a number of hours. I thank in advance the senators for also joining us. I will absent and mr. Vance will come forward and speak with you. Thank you very much. 

[00:39:40]


>> Good evening. I would like to restate some information we made available earlier and we will take some questions but this is an active ongoing investigation with a great deal of work to go and a lot of things we cannot confirm or discuss as of yet. Shortly after 9:30 this morning, the police department received a call for help at the sandy hook elementary cool in newtown. Upon realizing the intensity and difficulty of the situation we called for surrounding police departments and state police to respond. Upon arrival, officers at the school immediately entered the school as we knew it was potential active shooter situation. The focus was to search for students, faculty and staff and remove them to a safe area outside of the school. They did search every nook and cranny every room, and every portion of that school and accomplished that task. They took the rescue to a saming area to reunite them with family members. As has been reported there were fatalities. There were 18 children pronounced dead at the school and two transported to area hospitals and pronounced dead at area hospitals and there were six adults pronounced dead at the scene at the school. As the governor reported, the shooter is deceased and deceased in the school. There is a great deal of work going on relative to that. That is the reason we have not identified him. That means search warrants and examinations of residence, employment, and other ancillary things. The scene has been secured. Newtown police officers, state police major crime units for western district and central district have responded and are working with several agencies to process this scene. It is not a simplistic scene. We need to establish identity. We need to docuuent the entire scene. We need to answer every single question surrounding exactly how and why this incident occurred. As the governor said we will be here through the night, certainly through the weekend and we are not putting a time stamp on completion. We will work with the medical examiner and establish positive identification l is a great deal of work that needs to be done. We will take very brief questions. This is an active ongoing situation. 

[00:42:19]


>> We are told there are two other crime scenes? 
>> There is a secondary crime scene in newtown, that is correct. There is an adult deceased at that location. I cannot discuss anymore information on that. There is assistance being lended to us by new jersey. I don't have the details. 
(Inaudible). 
>> I can state the information we have right now the shootings took place in one section of the school in two rooms. That as much as we will go in as far as location. Our personnel are documenting the entire scene. We will have everything mapped out in a final report with final information presenting the answers. Right now I don't have anymore details. Right now there is one shooter but we are still looking at every answer later fact and circumstance related to the deceased shooter at the scene. 
>> Did the shooter take his life? 
>> To be determined. Why have the answer, the next step is the medical examiner's office who will assist us in answering the many and cause of death. 
>> How many injured? 
>> That is it, 26 deceased. 
>> No injuries? 
>> One person injureed. 
>> Were the children in one classroom? 
>> In one section. One area. I don't know specifically how many rooms are involved. I was told there were two but one section of the building. Everyone was in that same section of the building. The section of the building exactly is to be determined. 
>> Did you say how the shooter died? 

[00:44:21]


>> That is to be determined when the examinations are complete. 26 including the shooter? 20 children, six adults and the shooter. 27 total. 
(Inaudible). 
>> And that is the school and a secondary crime scene a deceased adult. 
(Inaudible). 
>> To be determined. Our investigators are look at that. We have not made any positive identification. There is preliminary identification but we have a great deal of work. That is something we have to do is establish positive identification on all the deceased, a time was the shooter's mother injured? 
>> That, I don't know. It was 20 children, six adults, and the the shear, and a secondary scene with an adult victim at that scene. The next update will enabout quarter to 5:00. That will be an update. 

[00:46:21]


>> One thing I would like to say, we have been meeting with all of the family members. It is a very, very difficult scene for the family members, and all the responding first responders. It is a tragic state. We have been asked by the family members to ask the members of the press to request their privacy and to, plaza, leave them alone. They are going through a tremendous amount of growth. I am sure you can appreciate that. Have been asked to ask you that personally. Back in 60 minutes to ask additional questions. 
>> That is lieutenant paul advance, the first time he has answered questions about what happened early this morning at sandy hook lty school. We have new now a like shot of what we believe to be the home of the shooter. Rick brought us the news of the identity of the shooter maybe being adam lanza or ryan lanza. We are trying to work through that. A lot of conflicting reports which son of the family it might be. The father was found dead in new jersey, the mother found dead in newtown, connecticut. There is still question on the identity of shooter. Rick? 
Rick: The police are reluctant to get in to too many details of the shooting, they are working to identify the victims in the school and are not ready to identify the shooter. I got that information from a reliable law enforcement source. We heard this family was involved and the shotter had a brother and now we told the shooter's brother could be in custody and the shooter obviously killed himself during the news conference we heard. We are now confirming the numbers which are staggering and horrific:20 children killed. 18 dead inside the school and two transported dying in the hospital. Six adults including the shooter dead in the school. And confirmed a second crime scene here in newtown, the home belonging to the mother of the shooter. The mother believed to be dead inside the home. We are told the kindergarten class that was assaulted was the choose of the mother. She was a kindergarten teacher so a horrific set of circumstances. Police have a long road ahead of them, processing that christmas scene and putting this together. 

[00:48:54]


>> One thing we heard from lieutenant paul vance, he was asked when the police went to the school was it like, did the police engage with the shooter and we learned according to lt. Colonel, police did not shoot the shooter. The shooter is dead. So we can never, although we will wait if confirmation, he took his own life. We have state representative john fry of connecticut. Representative, you have two nieces and a revenue in the school -- a nephew. Are they okay? >>Guest: THANKFULLY. My niece, the twins, are in 4th, SO THEY WILL BE TEN IN February. AND MY NEPHEW IS IN 1st. 
>> Did they see anything? >>Guest: THEY DID NOT. My nieces were in the library and the librarian and teach are put them in a closet. My nephew was in a classroom close to the classroom where most of the victims but no one saw anything. Leaving they school they saw broken glass and the police and swat teams but they also heard noise but they didn't see anything. 
>> Some of the kin described noise as "pots banging around" or hammers. One 8-year-old said she thought it was hammers and that is what the teacher told them. Do you have any indication that either your nieces or your nephew knew the children hurt together. >>Guest: FIRST, MY Understanding is there was an altercation in the school office and someone in the office had the foresite to put the audio switch that signals to the school there was something going on so like everyone else in the school my nieces and nephews heard a commotion for a brief moment. No indication yet but last night I was at the sandy hook holiday concert where the 4th graders participate and I cannot go pack and think of the people in the audience and the younger kids running up-and-down the aisles and they have all been...Things are different today for the people in the auditorium. 

[00:51:29]


>> Thank you for sharing that with you. 

[00:54:51]


>> Continuing coverage over a massacre at an elementary school in connecticut. The gunman's mother worked at the school and presumed dead. His father is dead. We obviously know the suspect is dead with his body still inside the school. This is a live shot of hoboken, new jersey, where we believe the shooter lived and where the father's body is, we believe. The shooter took the lives of 20 children and many adults. President obama ordering ins to fly at half staff. In the meantime sources telling the associated press the suspected shooter's girlfriend and another friend are missing and that his brother is being held as a possible second shooter. Molly has more. 
>> I am at a secondary scene the authorities have talked about, in the community where the home of the shooter's mother is, nancy, who has been confirmed dead. There is one body in the home. Authorities continue to have this neighborhood blocked down and you can see the yellow tape here. Before we came here we got out in the sandy hook community, the people that surround that school, the businesses, and as you can imagine they are just going to come to grips with the pain they will feel in the coming days particularly with the numbers confirmed that 20 children are dead. We had a chance to speak with a number of the business owners, a cafe owner who saw everyone in the cafe, many mothers in the morng running for the school, and we had a chance to speak with a woman who cuts hair in the community. She talked about her fears of who the 20 children will be as everyone waits to find out their identities and the identities of the other adults killed. 5 to 10 years old is what we know of the victims. Who and why this happened are questions we don't have antis for. We do expect a news conference from lieutenant paul vance in an hour. That is it for "studio b" today and harris is here later for the fox report at 7:00 p.M. Eastern and continuing coverage here on fox news.! next? He's going to apply testosterone to his underarm.

=======================================================

Announcer: Explore new worlds and new ideas through programs like this, made available for everyone through contributions to your pbs station from viewers like you. Thank you. Inside you already is all the freedom that you'll ever need, power to make things happen, and the flow that you're looking for in your life. All you need is a system for understanding what you already have and how to use it. I'm a teacher of that system, called t'ai chi. 
Narrator: Gain the physical, mental and spiritual balance that is the basis of this ancient wisdom practice. Join david-dorian ross, t'ai chi teacher and eight-time national champion, as he introduces you to basic t'ai chi moves, 
when t'ai chi: Health and happinessairs next. Hello, welcome. Welcome. It's so nice to have you here. You know, some folks who are here today have done a lot of t'ai chi, and some folks have no experience at all, just like the people who are watching in the television viewing audience. Some of you have had some t'ai chi experience and some not at all. So, you're all welcome. And I want to say that I'm really honored to be here on public television. You know, people have been asking me for years, isn't t'ai chi very difficult? Isn't t'ai chi something you have to study for years before you can show it off in public? But I tell people, if you can wave your hands, you can do t'ai chi, right? Let's prove it. Let's take your left hand and just wave. Just "wave, hey, hello, how are you?" So, let me tell you right off the top that what I'm doing while I'm instructing you is mirroring you. If I say right, you go right. If I say left, you go left. It doesn't matter what I'm doing. Across, and up, and right to left. Now, let's get the other hand involved, and the right hand scoops under and across, left to right, and down, and scoop. Let's get both hands going, across, and circle. Oh, that's awesome. Look at that. Beautiful. One more time, across, let's come back to the middle, and float down. That's wonderful, wonderful. What you have just done is a movement from t'ai chi called waving hands like clouds. I'm so excited to share with you in this program something that I've done for the last 35 years of my life, all right. It's called t'ai chi, and t'ai chi is something for everyone. You don't need to be a certain age. You don't need to be a certain fitness level. You don't need to be a certain religion or philosophy, because it's a practice that combines everything that everyone needs, right, physical exercise, philosophy, guidelines for life, ancient wisdom, but it's also practical. The principles of t'ai chi, you know, informed by the movements that I was just doing, can transform your life, transform your health, transform everything that happens to you. To kind of get us started, I thought I would tell you a little bit about where t'ai chi comes from, what's the origin of t'ai chi. And to do this, we have to cast our minds back almost 2,000 years to a time in ancient china when there was a terrible flood. The waters of the yellow river overflowed their banks, wiping out whole villages and sending people into the countryside. And after the floodwaters receded, plague arose, such a terrible plague that the emperor himself decided to take his personal physician and send him out into the countryside to find out what made people so sick. The physician came back, and he told the emperor, "i've discovered an amazing thing." He said, "i've discovered that people are like water. When they're moving, when they're flowing, it's healthy. But when they stop moving and become stagnant, pestilence arises." And the emperor's physician, a man named hua tuo, said, well, I discovered something else, the people areetting sick, but none of the animals are getting sick. The animals are still healthy. And you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go back out into the countryside and teach people how to move like the animals. And that way, they'll never get stagnant, they'll never get sick. This is one of the oldest forms of t'ai chi-related practice called the frolic of the five animals, all right, and the five animals are the animals that he found in the forest. There's the tiger. Do this with me. So, yes, the tiger with his claws up and the big tiger's mouth there, the tiger that pounces. There's the deer, got to stick the deer's horns out there, who twists and turns and gallops forward. Yes, there's the bear, the bear who kind of lumbers along, he's very loose in the shoulders and he's kind of, you know, waddles back and forth, there's the bear. All right, the monkey, the monkey, who's very quick, right, grabs little things, and he's always on the lookout for something that he might steal, right, is the monkey. And finally, the bird, the crane with his big wings, rising up in the air and floating on the wind, yes. See, these movements that you're doing right now, this is the origin of what we turn into t'ai chi. Hua tuo made an amazing discovery, but the consequences of his discovery went far beyond health and fitness, and it became not just about medical practice or, you know, something that will make you feel better, but something that would actually be an approach for your entire life, having an abundance of good health, having a sense of clarity of mind and creativity, of great relationships, you know. If you've ever felt like you'd like to have it all, let me suggest to you that what you are really looking for is something very simple. Balance. Think about this. When your life is in balance, everything works. And when your life is out of balance, everything begins to break down. Balance is the combination of three basic experiences, three dynamic experiences that we call freedom, flow and power. And I can assure you that the best thing about t'ai chi, the best thing about this concept of balance is that you already have all three of them, inside you already is all the freedom that you'll ever need, the power to make things happen, and the flow that you're looking for in your life. All you need is a system for understanding what you already have and how to use it. I'm a teacher of that system called t'ai chi. So in our time together, I'm going to teach you how to find your balance, how to stay in balance as much as possible, and how to regain your balance just in case you happen to lose it. You don't need a special room or a special piece of machinery or magic shoes or a potion or something like that. You already have everything that you need to do t'ai chi. So let's kind of do a little t'ai chi exercise while we're doing this, all right. I want to have you all scoot forward in your chairs for just a moment. This is sort of the first lesson of t'ai chi. If you're at home watching, move forward on your chair so that you can tuck the tailbone under a little bit, right, and float the head up. In the ancient writings about t'ai chi, we talk about posture, using the word pearl. They say the spine is suspended from above, like a string of pearls, so here's your head, floating up like the top pearl, and here's the rest of your spine floating down. Tailbone tucks under, the head floats up, and in the middle the spine stretches out, becoming longer and straighter and more comfortable. You know, a question that people ask me all the time: How does t'ai chi give you all these great benefits? So I want to answer this from the chinese perspective, by talking about a word we call chi, the life force, the spirit breath. And when you're in good posture, when you're moving through space in a certain way, your chi, your life energy, moves in a balanced and harmonious fashion. That's one of the sources of the benefits that you get out of t'ai chi. Another way of looking at this might be from the western perspective, and saying, you know, that as much as we might want to stay in balance and be in balance, the fact is that most of us develop great imbalances in life, and here's why. We have a habit of always moving away from what hurts, right, and moving towards what's more comfortabl we move away from the weaker sides of ourselves and towards the sides that are stronger. So we wind up with these weird postures and odd sort of angles of our body. This is what we technically call a compensation pattern. I'm compensating for what hurts or what's weak, right. But here's the thing. Compensation patterns, by definition, lead to advanced wear and tear. They actually age you faster. So, t'ai chi corrects those imbalances, bring you back out of those compensation patterns, and literally turns back the aging clock. So, from a western perspective, this is another source of the benefits of t'ai chi. So, let's review really quickly what leads to balance, these three experiences-- freedom, flow and power. And throughout the show today, I'm going to continue to talk about them and reframe our conversation and our experience together. Let's start with the first one, the idea of freedom. And just to kind of give you a sense of what that means, when my mother was 70, for her 70th birthday, she decided to go skydiving. 

[00:10:19]


[Audience chuckles] yeah, that's the reaction I had. When I tell people about my mother, I get a lot of interesting reactions. I get people who say, you know, oh, I would never go sky-- jump out of a plane, are you kidding, I could never do that, you know, or I shouldn't do that. You know, this is what we, you hear that, shouldn't, can't, won't, mustn't, have to, always, never? It's what we call the language of constraint. It's a narrowing down, a limitation of our lives. It's what I call "i can't." That's the opposite of freedom. Freedom is "i can." "I can't" is out of balance. "I can" is moving towards balance, where everything is possible. The traditional way of talking about t'ai chi is I say I am playing t'ai chi. So, that's what we're going to do today, right, we're going to play, you're going to play with us at home. And in fact, I think we should just get into some motion here, to feel what it feels like to be playing t'ai chi. Let the hands be relaxed by your sides, as you are scooting forward on your chair and getting the tailbone tucked under, getting the head to float up here. And then let the hands float up in front, nice and easy. Oh, yes, and then float down again. Imagine--i'm going to give you a little thought exercise here. Imagine that you're sitting in a hot tub... And the hands are floating on the surface of the water, so the water flows in, the hands begin to float, and they float a little higher and a little higher, and when the water reaches about chest high, it shuts off and then you settle down into your chair and you say, aahh. That was good. See, that is the way t'ai chi is supposed to feel, like you're not even moving, like something is moving or flowing you, all right, just flowing and floating. Together, the hands by your sides and float up, and down. Ah, you can say aahh if you want to, yeah, and float back up again. And now I want you to round your arms out like you're hugging a big tree and open side to side. Now we're going to round out our arms like we're holding a ball, a big beach ball against our chest, with the right hand on top. The other right hand. There we go. And open side to side, and now left hand on top. So we have open and right hand on top, a kind of a closing or a gathering, and an open and come back to hugging the tree. And now we have a floating down, aahh. And a floating up, so we have up, down, open, close, hug the tree, open, back to hugging the tree, and down. Doesn't that feel nice, right? Well, so this is what most people relate to t'ai chi as, these movements that kind of, what, flow, which is the second principle, second element of balance, of harmony, is a sense of flow. Today what I want to do is share with you four simple t'ai chi flows, or t'ai chi movements. Okay, so I'm going to break down these movements for you, and I want you to follow along with us at home. And in fact, I want you to do it in your chair. There's a lot of students that I work with all the time who are not ready to stand up and do the footwork, which we're going to add a little bit later in the program, but they start out in the chair, or maybe they even continue in the chair, so you can continue in the chair yourself. So, just be in your chair. Scoot forward. Let's go back to standing on the edge of the chair with your head top floating up, right. And as we do these movements, I'm also going to give you some basic rules, some guidelines to follow as you're, you know, doing the movements together. And here's rule number 1, flow rule number 1: Smile, slow down and breathe. Aahh. Right, smile, slow down and breathe. Very nice. Okay, hands relaxed by your sides. The first movement is called opening the door, right... The commencement of the movements, the hands float up in front of the body, not too high, just about chest high, then elbows heavy, everything floats down. Just like we did before, this is the first movement, opening the door. Let's float back up again. So, that's simple enough, so I think I'm just going to tack on the next movement, which is actually the last movement of the whole sequence. Circle your arms around, crossing the wrists at the bottom, and float up, now pause, and just aahh, let it go, float down. Perfect. That's actually the last movement of the whole sequence, which we call closing the door, right. So we're halfway done already. We've got the opening and we've got the closing. Let's try it one more time. So, smile, relax, breathe, opening the door, the hands float up. And float down. Good. Let them float back up again, and round them out like you're hugging a big tree. Open side to side, and we're going to put the right hand on top of the big round ball. The next movement, movement number 2, actually, is called grasping the bird's tail, grasp the bird's tail, and it actually has four small pieces. Piece number one is called ward off, like keep away. We're going to open towards the left, open towards the left, and the right hand is going to press down towards your hip. So this is my keep-away arm, this is my keep-away, my ward-off arm here. Right? That's piece number one. Now part number two is called roll back, and what I want you to do is to let the right hand drift forward until the two hands are sort of facing each other palm over palm, right, almost like I'm going to make a little t'ai chi sandwich. Pull both hands down. Turn the waist and toss the hands towards me. Beautiful. That's the second piece, roll back. Now the right arm is the long arm here, and what I want you to do is to bend the elbow, folding it in, and bringing the hands palm to palm. This is the start of piece number three, which is called press. So I'm going back over here to my left side, pressing my hands foard. Beautiful. Let the hands slide apart, draw them in, down, and push forward. This is piece number four, which we call push. And that whole combination is called grasping the bird's tail. That was very nice. That was terrific. That was terrific. We're halfway done. Let's pick up the other half, all right, so let's go back to hands by your sides. You're doing well in your chair. Scoot forward a little bit. You can relax anytime, by the way. I'm telling you to scoot forward, but if you feel like you want to sit back and relax, go for it. Sit up nice and tall, the head floats up. Now I've given you flow rule number one, which is smile, slow down and breathe. Here's rule number 2. We call it conserve the curve, and it has to do with what you're already doing with your spine. There's this natural curve in your spine here that's supposed to be there, but in t'ai chi we kind of minimize it a little bit, right, like the string of pearls. Your head floats up. Your tailbone drops down. And in the middle the curve is conserved, right? That's flow rule number two. Hands by your sides. Let the hands float up in front, opening the door, and float down, aahh. Very nice. Hands float back up again, rounding out to hug the big tree, open, now we get the right hand on top, and we're going to open towards the left. Ward off. Very nice. Let's let the right hand float forward, and pull both hands down, toss them towards the television. The long arm now folds in, placing palm against palm. I'm looking to the left again as I press. Slide the hands apart, draw them in, and then forward to push. Beautiful, very nice. Now stay with me, because what we're g to do is open and then left hand on top. We're going to do the same move, grasping the bird's tail, to the right side. We're going to open to the right. Remember, left hand pushes down by the hip here. Float the left hand forward, palms facing each other, palm over palm. Pull down and toss them towards the television. A long arm, which is now the left arm, folds in, palm against palm. Press forward towards the right side, beautiful, slide the hands apart, withdraw, and push. Nice. Come back to the center and scoop the hands down, crossing at the wrists. They float and pause, and aahh. Floating down, closing the door. That was nice. That was beautiful. That was beautiful. This is what we call t'ai chi forms, t'ai chi flows. We practice the forms to practice mastering the sense of flow, the element of flow, which is a part of balance and harmony. But we say that what's important about flow, what's important about t'ai chi forms is that it doesn't stop giving you benefits when you walk out of the classroom. I believe that you can keep the benefits going in the rest of your life. T'ai chi really has significant benefits to every part of your life. The mayo clinic, for example, has found that people who practice t'ai chi do things like reduce their anxiety and depression, they improve their balance and stability and muscle strength. It improves the quality of your sleep, lowers your blood pressure, improves your cardiovascular fitness. It can relieve chronic pain. Anybody with chronic pain? T'ai chi can relieve that. It increases your energy, your endurance and agility, your overall feelings of well being. T'ai chi reduces falls in older adults, well, in everybody, really. I tell you, dr. Vijay vad, who is a renowned sports medicine specialist at the hospital for special surgery in new york city, said that preliminary evidence shows that doing t'ai chi once a week can increase balance and reduce the risk of falls and hip fractures among seniors by up to half. This bears repeating. The greatest beauty of t'ai chi is that all the things you need for that kind of balance, freedom, flow, po is already in you. You already have everything you need. There's so much I want to share with you, right, in this exploration of t'ai chi in the rest of this program. The next thing that we're going to talk about is how to actually get in touch, a real physical sensation of that energy we've been talking about in an exercise I call touching the chi, touching the chi. So we're going to come back and do that in just a minute.

Lyn: Hello, I'm lyn may. Thank you for joining us for t'ai chi, health and happiness with david-dorian ross. David-dorian is here in the studio with me, and right now we're going to take a short break to talk with him about t'ai chi, balance, and about this pbs station. Before we do that, please take a look at this. 
Announcer: Contribute $65 to support this pbs station, and we'll say thanks with the companion dvd to the program you're watching, which includes 40 minutes of additional information and exercises. When you call with a $100 contribution, we'll send you the companion dvd and david-dorian's new home practice dvd, 9 flows. Progress from what you've learned today with more t'ai chi moves. For your generous contribution of $175, you'll receive the companion dvd, the 9 flowsdvd, plus the unique t'ai chi beginner's kit. Open the box to find a specially designed t'ai chi exercise ball, a dvd with a program to guide your use of the ball, and a second program with even more t'ai chi exercises. There's also a collection of essays to deepen your understanding of the philosophy of t'ai chi. Call or make a contribution online, and thanks. 
Lyn: This is an absolutely wonderful program. We are so fortunate to have it as part of the pbs schedule. Tell me why you chose pbs. 
David-Dorian: Well, pbs is a place where people come for continuous learning, you know, where people who are sort of lifelong explorers of the journey of life come to find out new information and new ideas and new ways of being in the world. So, for me, it was just a natural to want my first special to be on pbs. 
Lyn: I know you also watch pbs. 
David-Dorian: Oh, my gosh. I've watched pbs since I can remember watching television. I've grown up with pbs, and to this day i love watching, you know, masterpiece theatre, masterpiece mystery!, one of my favorites-- 
Lyn: Oh, we share that. We were talking about that a little bit earlier, said, oh, we love masterpiece mystery!-- 

[00:23:50]


David-Dorian: Yes. 
Lyn: There's a lot to talk about, david-dorian, but one of the important things you've done for our viewers is put together a fine collection of thank-you gifts. Tell them about it. 
David-Dorian: Well, of course, the first gift is the companion dvd to this program that we're watching, because you'll want to watch it over and over again and get some of the details and, you know, remind yourself of the things that I've been saying. Plus there's some tremendous bonus material. We had a chance to talk with the fabulous studio audience and take the experience that we had in the broadcast show and just, you know, kind of get deeper and additional explanations of what we're doing. There's a fabulous q&a session, and then this wonderful exercise on learning about cooperation, a game I call t'ai chi for two. And then we have my newest home practice program, the 9 beginner flows, which is like, you know, having a t'ai chi teacher in your living room. So, you'll be able to take all the movements you learned in this program, plus new movements that you can add to your repertoire and have an ongoing practice that just builds and builds. And if viewers can make a generous contribution of $175, you'll receive a dvd of the program you're watching, plus the home practice dvd, plus this wonderful kit I want to explain. It comes with a dvd with not one, but two programs on it. One is another repertoire of movements, so you'll have now three different routines of t'ai chi flows. Plus this t'ai chi ball that I developed, because a lot of my students come to me and say, you know, I'm feeling the workout in my legs and my thighs, but what about my upper body, what about my arms and shoulders? So the weighted t'ai chi ball will answer that question. And so one of the programs teaches you how to use the ball, and then you can use it for all of the t'ai chi routines that you've learned. And it comes with a booklet, a collection of short essays that I've written on the experience of t'ai chi called exercising the soul. Now if you have all these materials, it's more than I'm in your living room, it's like I'm living with you, and you can do t'ai chi 24/7, any time you want. 
Announcer: We appreciate a contribution of any amount. If it's right for you, it's right for us. Just give us a call right now, and thanks. 

[00:25:59]


Lyn: David-dorian, what's the impact on a viewer's life when they get this kit? 
David-Dorian: My goodness. I wanted to create a series of tools that would actually make a difference in people's lives. People are looking for something more than an idea. They want something tangible. To find, you know, what we're talking about in this program is, is balance, you know, the missing ingredient. We all know that we're out of balance in some way or another, so how do we get back? And the tools in this kit really make that possible. We talk about on the physical level that the movements of the routines of t'ai chi will balance out the body but also balance out the energy that flows through you, that, you know, gives you life and gives you power, the chi, the spirit breath. The inclusion of the t'ai chi ball will make your musculature, the outside of you, also in balance so that the bottom half doesn't get more worked out than the upper half, you know, but that this will make it all complete. The fact that we have two dvd programs, you know, that you can study over and over again to expand your repertoire of movements. And what that does is it makes you experience more of yourself, if you will. It really gets you back in touch with your body and with the energy that's flowing through it. And then, my booklet, exercising the soul, a series of essays that really kind of tell you about my philosophy about t'ai chi and lead you through the mental aspect and the emotional aspect of t'ai chi and the embrace of balance and harmony, and how to understand when you are, what it feels like to be out of balance and then how to drag yourself or step towards balance once again. It really does bring you back to a point where you can have new possibilities, a new sense of, that there's something more, there's something that I've always been reaching for and never knew how to get it until now, until t'ai chi comes into your life. 
Lyn: David-dorian, I have tried t'ai chi at a couple of different points in my life. Had you been my teacher, I'd have stuck with it. Tell me about your first experience with your first teacher. 

[00:28:10]


David-Dorian: Oh, my goodness. Well, my first experience actually was a lot like many of my students. I did it entirely by accident. I was not even looking for t'ai chi. I was looking to learn how to meditate, but I was so terrible at meditation that I thought I would try this, because it's moving meditation. So I signed up for this class and I showed up, and I knew nothing about exercise. I knew nothing about chinese culture or martial arts or any of that. So I was completely out of my element, and I started trying to do the moves, but almost immediately, like within three minutes, I was, you know, it was like being struck by lightning. 
Lyn: You had an epiphany. 
David-Dorian: I had, but a physical epiphany. I could feel my body just heating up and, and coursing with energy. And at that moment, I had what I can only describe as a memory of the future, where I knew that I would do t'ai chi for the rest of my life and that I would be a famous teacher someday. 
Lyn: That is amazing. It was like falling in love. 
David-Dorian: I fell in love right at that moment. And the rest, as they say, is history. It changed everything about me. It changed what I was taking in school. It changed where I was living, how I ate, how I dressed, the kinds of activity that I did. It really was a transformative experience. 
Lyn: What an inspiring story. Ah, don't we all wish that we could have those kinds of moments in our life? Pbs offers them, as you may have learned by now, and nothing, nowhere is it better than in a program like this. So, this is your opportunity to have your own transformational moment. All you have to do is call the number you see on your screen. Support this pbs station, and we would be so happy to send you, now you know I want everything. I've always wanted everything. I would suggest, if you can do it, that you make your contribution at the $175 level and get everything. GET THE KIT. GET THE BALL. GET OF DAVID-VDs. 
Announcer: Contribute at the $65, $100, or $175 levels and we'll say thanks with materials especially designed to expand your experience of t'ai chi, health and happiness with david-dorian ross. And remember, this public television station appreciates a contribution in any amount. If it's right for you, it's right for us. What's important is that you call or go online right now to make a pledge of support. We appreciate you deeply. 

[00:30:34]


Lyn: David-dorian, this is exciting. Tell me what's coming up next. 
David-Dorian: Oh, we're going to do a hands-on exercise where you're actually going to use your hands to feel the inner energy, to feel what we call touching the chi. Plus we're also going to do an exercise, it may be one of the hardest things for people to learn about t'ai chi, and that's called letting go. But the audience was so fantastic in this exercise, it's really fun to watch. So, that's coming up in our next segment. 
Lyn: That sounds great. 
Announcer: There's still time for you to give us a call or go online. Let us know you've enjoyed t'ai chi, health and happiness. We appreciate your viewership and your support. I promised that the next thing we're going to do is a little exercise on actually getting in touch with that inner energy, which we call the chi. In fact, you can feel the life energy in the palms of your hands very easily, and I'm going to share with you just a very simple exercise called touching the chi. So, this is what I would ask you to do to start with, is if you've got a heavy watch on or a bracelet or something, you might want to take that off for just a second, you know, put it in your pocket. And then take your wrists and sort of cross them over in such a way like the palms are facing the same, facing each other, but just crossing wrists, and make some small circles, nice and slow, circling around about the size of a half dollar, circling around. And after about 30 seconds or so, you might start to have some sensations. And if you do, what we're going to do is we're going to change the position of your hands, and now move your hands to face each other palm to palm, right, middle of the palm facing each other, and continue your circle, circling around, nice and easy, little tiny circles. And pause, and let's try something else. Let's try pulling them slowly apart. Pull your hands slowly apart, and push them back together. I can see some of you already, I can see the looks on your faces, right. I want you to take a look at the palms of your hands. What does that look like? Do you notice anything? 

[00:33:03]


Woman: It's red. 
David-Dorian: It's red, so you see some color, yes? What else? What about feeling, sensation? Tingling. Warmth, yes. By the way, if you don't feel that, you're not dead. It's all right. 
[Laughter] these are classic signs of an increased flow of chi. Now what's happening is that right here in the center of your palm is a giant acupuncture point, called the lao gong point. And as I'm doing this exercise, what I'm doing is I'm focusing, right, I'm thinking about it. So I'm thinking and my mind is going to this point, and as my mind goes to this point, what happens? The chi follows. In fact, this turns out to be one of the most famous t'ai chi sayings in the entire practice. It goes like this, e-tao chi-tao, where the mind goes, the chi follows. And where the chi goes, the blood follows. And where the blood goes, the body follows, right. So as mind is focused on "i can't," that's where my chi is going to go, but when my mind is focused on "i can," that's where my chi is going to go as well, okay. So this also becomes one of the elements of balance, power, chi, life energy. You know, why is power an element of balance? Being powerful is the opposite of being forceful. Right, when you're forcing things, you know, things sort of get stuck, but when you're powerful, things just happen without forcing. In fact, in chinese we have a saying about that, we have a phrase, it's called wu wei, which means effortless effort, which is how power really feels, right, just effortless, how balance really feels. It's just effortless. Now this also brings up one of the other benefits of t'ai chi and the sort of the contrast between t'ai chi practice and some of the more conventional western forms of exercise and health, and that is that in the west we talk a lot about consuming energy, right, I've got to burn some calories. But in the east, in the t'ai chi practice, we talk about conserving energy. I want to keep my chi. Chi is the energy of my life, so I want to keep it as long as possible and live as long as possible and do things with it as long as possible. So this is an interesting contrast between consumption of energy and conservation of energy. I want to finish up the movements that we've been starting, okay, so we're going to add footwork, right, now that we've got the hands all happening really nicely, we're going to add some of the steps to it. Tell you what, let's all stand up. Now you don't have to stand up. I'd like to invite you to join us as we add the footwork, but if you want to just do it, sit in a chair, and anyone here, if you want to do it sitting in your chair, perfectly fine. T'ai chi can be done without the footwork, but let's give it a shot, shall we? All right, now I'm going to turn around so we're all facing the same direction, so you'll be going the same direction as me this time, all right. Start out with the feet together, hands relaxed by your sides. Soften the knees a little bit, and remember, what's our first rule of flow? Smile, slow down and breathe, right? What's the second rule? Conserve the curve, so tuck the tailbone in a little bit. Let the head top float up like the pearl and let the spine fall down underneath it. Beautiful, all right, here we go. From this position, shift the weight over to the right foot and the left foot steps out to the side about shoulder width, and center. Both hands float up in front, opening the door, and then with the elbows heavy, everything floats down and you can soften the knees, but just a little bit, just a little bit of a drop there. Nice. Now, pause and stay right where you are because I want to add flow rule number 3. The third rule here is called knees over toes. So, take a look, right, you're in this position, you're sinking down here. If your knees have fallen out of alignment, bring them back so the knees are right over the toes. This is a basic rule of flow, because when you get out of alignment, you lose your balance. So rule number three, knees over toes. One more time, from the beginning, feet together, hands relaxed by your sides. Left foot steps out to the left and center. Both hands float up, and aahh. Good, knees over toes. From this position, shift the weight over to the right foot and step in, tapping the left foot down on the ground and embracing the moon, right hand on top. Open the left foot to the side and step out into a lunge position, all right. Let the left hand float out, ward off. Beautiful. Now stay right there. Stay in this position. So, you're doing pretty good, I can see, knees over toes, very nice. I want to add t'ai chi flow rule number 4. Flow rule number 4 is called heavy feet. Heavy, yeah, good, heavy feet. So this is what this is like. Anyone have kids, or cats? Ever try to pick up a cat that doesn't want to be picked up and suddenly it weighs like 2,000 pounds, right? That's what this should feel like. That's what this principle is like. So your entire body weight, your entire mental weight, your entire emotional weight, everything goes down into your feet, heavy feet, it makes you feel rooted, anchored into the earth. Right, this is another rule of flow. So here I am, in ward-off position, my feet heavy, my knees over my toes, the right hand floats forward, and floats down. Now turn and toss them to the front of the room. Beautiful. The long arm folds in, palm to palm, and press, shifting forward. Beautiful. Slide the hands apart. Rock back. Here I'm sitting back, even the toe comes up on this one, and then forward again to push. Very nice. Stay with me. Sit back. Turn inward and open, back over here to the left foot. Step in t-step and left hand on top. Step out with the right foot into a lunge and ward off. Beautiful. Left hand floats forward, pull both hands down, and turn and toss them towards the front of the room. The long arm folds in, coming back to facing to the right, press forward. Slide the hands apart. Sit back and withdraw. The toe even comes up. And rock forward and push. Oh, so nice. Stay with me, a big finale. Sit back, turn inward and open, back over here to the right foot, but only step in half a step and cross the wrists. I'm going to turn around here so we're facing each other. Crossing the wrists and then they float down, aahh, right. Left foot returns to the right. And we end with a little bow. And those are four simple moves with four simple rules of flow. Beautiful, very nice. Very nice. Go ahead and have a seat. Have a seat. That was, that was terrific. Fantastic job. So, just like the movements of flow and the rules of flow, there are rules of power, right. There are rules that help the chi to flow. I'm not going to go through all of them in today's program, but I do want to talk about one of them. This is power rule number 3, and it's called letting go. Yeah, letting go is hard, isn't it? Letting go is a challenge for people, and sometimes, you know, we find it to be a challenge because we have confused a couple of ideas in our minds. We think that being powerful means, you know, holding on, I've got it all under control, I've got it all wrapped up, I'm in, I'm powerful. In fact, what t'ai chi teaches us is that wherever there is holding on, wherever there is tension, chi stops flowing, right. So wherever there is physical tension, there is no chi flow. Wherever there is mental tension, there is no chi flow. Wherever there's emotional tension, there's no chi flow. Right, so we have to let go in order to gain power. Now I'm lucky because I have a natural reality check in my life called my four-year-old daughter, who teaches me about this principle all the time. So, you know, a great example, when it's time to go to bed and I say, all right, you know, it's time to go to bed, and she says, why? And I say, because I said so, I'm the dad, right? That's not powerful. That's not powerful. That's me, you know, kind of, you know, being a bully. I'm bigger than she is, right. So, there's a forcing trying to go on, and nobody's happy. Right, we both wind up going to bed being unhappy, unsatisfied. What works out better is when she teaches me about cooperation rather than conflict. And we sit down together and we say, honey, you know it's time to go to bed, and she goes, well, if you just sit with me for a second, you know, I can put my head down, and we cooperate. We make it happen together. And there's no forcing. There's no pushing. There's no yelling. There's just like aahh, and that's being powerful. That's being effortless. Right, that's what power is all about. T'ai chi, for me, is kind of like a guidebook for the journ that we're on, the journey of the mind and the body and the spirit. It's kind of like your spiritual gps, without the annoying voice. So if you let this be your guide, your gps, your compass, it can always lead you toward balance and not towards the opposite, which we call chaos. Earlier in the program, we started touching on the idea of freedom, and I promised you we'd come back to it and talk about it just a little bit more. And for this exercise, I'm going to need a volunteer. Thank you so much. 

[00:43:21]


[Laughter] 
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? Marge: Marge. 
David-Dorian: Marjorie, all right. So, marjorie, just watch one time. I'm going to sort of demonstrate what we're going to do together. Okay, well, I take that back, what you're going to do. All right, so, this is a kicking exercise from the t'ai chi routine. You're going to stand on one foot, open and kick. And slowly fold back in and float down. Got it? 
Marge: Absolutely. 
David-Dorian: Absolutely, all right. 
[Chuckling] 
Marge: You going to catch me when I fall? 
David-Dorian: Maybe. Beautiful, beautiful. That's exactly right, okay. No, stay right there, stay right there. Just give me one hand, just one hand. Okay, do the same thing again. Get settled down. All right, left leg is going to lift up. All right, I got you. Open out to the side and kick. Fold back in and float down. Awesome, yes? 
[Applause] we're not done yet. Now I just want a half a hand. Okay, all right. And same thing, get settled down, the knee comes up. All right, opens out to the side, kicks out, right, and floats back in, and down. Better and better. Give me one finger. I just want one finger, all right, and knee floats up, opens out, kick out to the side, fold back in, and down. Now just in case ybody's asking, do you think I could hold up marjorie's entire body with one finger? No. So I wasn't really doing anything about this. This is about her own mind. Remember I said this before, that, you know, that the opposite of freedom is constraint, is the language of "i can't." And really what was going on in marjorie's mind was, pfft, I can't do that, right, I don't have a blue shirt, right? 

[00:45:25]


[Laughter] I can't do that. But what we did with the exercise here, with going from one hand to half a hand to one finger, is changing "i can't" into what? 
Marge: I can. David-dorian: I can. That's what I want you to stay to yourself, I can. Say it. 
Audience: I can. 
David-Dorian: Awesome. Thank you so much. Beautiful. 
[Applause] so, why is this so important? Why is letting go, why is being, you know, "i can" so important to balance? Because when we limit our thoughts and we think I can't, you know, "i can't" is a limiting belief, when we limit our thoughts, we limit our possibilities. We limit our mind. And our mind, remember, controls the chi. So if we're limiting our mind, we're limiting the flow of life's energy, right, because where the mind goes, the chi follows. And if a mind is always going to "i can't, I can't, I can't," that's where your chi is going, too. So to free your power, you must free your mind. This has been an introduction, just a taste, to what I hope will be a long and happy journey, because you can do t'ai chi for the rest of your life. You can keep on practing what you've learned today, keep on practicing the flows that we've learned today, keep on exploring, keep on, you know, taking t'ai chi from other teachers. One of the things that, you know, I wanted to share with you is that, wherever you are living, there is, you know, likely a teacher nearby, you know, even in the places out in the country or in small towns, I find that there is somebody usually who knows t'ai chi and is willing to share it with you. My own journey, my own, my own experience of t'ai chi has guided my life for the last 35 years. It really has changed so much about me. It's changed my health. When I was a child, i, you know, hated exercise. I was asthmatic. I never participated in sports. And, you know, now I'm 55. I feel betterhan I did when I was 25. I have got clarity of mind, a sense of vision, and this is what I love to do. This is my bliss. This is the first step to having it all. T'ai chi is a very important tool. The first step to happiness, the first step to health, the first step to harmony, right, is to follow these principles we've been talking about. And the first principle of power and freedom and flow is to, what, be in the moment. Be in the moment. So, let's let this be our moment. Right, let this show be your turning point, so to speak, where you find that you really did have everything that you need to have it all. You have freedom in you. You have power in you. You have flow in you. Right? And when you realize that you already have power and freedom and flow, you realize that you have everything that you need to have a life that you've always dreamed of. I want to end with a little quote from lao tzu, the famous chinese philosopher, who said, "be content with what you have, rejoice in the way things are, because when you realize that there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you." Thanks for being here today. Thanks for joining. Thank you. 

[00:48:34]


[Applause] 
David-Dorian: You know, I am very proud to have my first broadcast special on this pbs station and to share some information and some ancient wisdom about the life energy, the chi, that gives you the power that's an element of harmony. Now, chi is everywhere. Chi is in your body. Chi is in the relationships that you have with other people. Chi is in this station, if you will, and this station's chi, its life energy, depends your support. In return, the station's gift to you is programs of the highest quality anywhere on your dial, 24/7. The station brings positive, life-affirming energy, chi, to you, to your children. So, please join me in keeping this station healthy. When this station's healthy, you're happy. So, call the number on your screen, and ank you so much. 
Announcer: For a contribution of $65, our thank-you gift is the companion dvd to the program you're watching, uninterrupted and with 40 additional minutes. You'll deepen your exploration of this ancient wisdom practice with more forms, more explanation about the principles of t'ai chi, and a q&a with david-dorian ross. When you contribute $100, we're happy to send you the companion dvd plus david-dorian's new home practice dvd, 9 flows. Nine additional beginner sequences continue building on the moves you've learned. And for a generous contribution of $175, you'll receive the companion dvd, plus the 9 flows, plus a unique box t'ai chi beginner's kit developed by david-dorian. Inside the kit is a special t'ai chi ball, a collection of essays about t'ai chi, and one dvd with two different programs. One program teaches you how to use your t'ai chi ball, and the second teaches eight essential sequences. With this ultimate t'ai chi set, you'll practice with increased focus and confidence. 

[00:50:39]


Lyn: David-dorian, I loved watching you in this program, your control, your physicality. You're in fabulous shape. But you haven't always been into physical fitness. I was fascinated by that. 
David-Dorian: Oh, my goodness, no. As a child, I had terrible asthma. I was allergic to just about everything that you can imagine. And I really wasn't an exerciser. I wasn't into sports at all. It really wasn't until I was in college and discovered t'ai chi for the first time that I finally was introduced to my own body and my own sense of physicality. And it was t'ai chi that unlocked the door for me. I probably would not be here today if it hadn't been for t'ai chi. 
Lyn: One of the things everyone always wants to know about any exercise program, will I lose weight? 
[Laughter] 
David-Dorian: Well, the short answer is yes, but it may not be for the reason that most people think about. The biggest way that t'ai chi helps you to lose weight is it changes your sense of possibility. Most people are stopped in the losing weight, the whole effort, because they have a thought of "i can't," just that's kind of the overview of where their whole approach to losing weight is. And as we talk about in the program, t'ai chi changes "i can't" into "i can," and by changing that sense of possibility, you really do finally get the results that you were looking for. 
Lyn: Is that partly because everyone can do it at his or her own level, and no matter what age-- 
David-Dorian: It's a beautifully embracing kind of activity that anybody can do, regardless of your age or your current physical condition. It's made for everyone. 
Lyn: What an interesting solution if you've been struggling with weight loss and you have it in your head that you can't shed those extra pounds. So this is yet another reason to consider calling the station right now and making your contribution and receiving these gifts, an unexpected benefit to your health. David-dorian, tell us about this fabulous kit, full of goodies. 
David-Dorian: Oh, my gosh, well, as we've been talking about in the program, t'ai chi covers many different elements, many different facets of life, the physical, the mental, the emotional, the energetic. And so you've got a lot of tools in this kit to get all those different elements, like the t'ai chi ball, which is really about the physical aspect. 

[00:52:52]


Lyn: Now I'm holding the ball, but I don't know what to do with it. I like the weight. 
David-Dorian: You like the weight. Well, what happens is, you use the ball with the movements you've already learned #s FROM THE OTHER PROGRAMS. So, a movement like wave hands like clouds, you transfer the ball from hand to hand and you get the double benefit of the energetic flow plus the physical. 
Lyn: All right, so I have the ball. 
David-Dorian: Just like that. 
Lyn: And what's interesting is that it makes me want to be quiet. Now there's something. [Chuckles] I like it. This alone would make it worth the kit. What's next? What else do you have? 
David-Dorian: What's next is a dvd with two different programs on it. One is a progr that has an additional routine of movements, so you get a chance to circulate that chi energy around the body with more motions, and another program that tells you how to use the weighted t'ai chi ball. And then the most important part, I think, for me is the book that comes with it. This book, called exercising the soul, is a short collection of essays that, about, about t'ai chi and its impact, and infused in there is a bit of my own personal philosophy of what t'ai chi means and how it can benefit your life and how it can transform your life. And you get all of that in this kit, the ball, the two programs on the dvd, and the book. 
Lyn: This station can bring you david-dorian and t'ai chi because viewers who care have stepped forward and made a pledge of support. That action, that individual, personal step is what keeps this station healthy. Now, maybe you've always wanted to try t'ai chi but you just never got around to it. You were too busy or you didn't know where to go. This station, as david-dorian says, is the place in this community for lifelong learners, for explorers who want to keep on discovering new dimensions of life. So, please call the number on your screen now and take your first t'ai chi step to supporting this station. 

[00:54:53]


Lyn: I do love the concept of having it all. Who doesn't? It's just what david-dorian has said and what we all aspire to. So, the way for you to have it all right now is to call this station and make a contribution at the $175 level. Whether your goal is to lose weight or become more fit or just have that experience of getting out of that chair and moving your body, you've seen the effects of that in this program. And of course, david-dorian is a terrific teacher, AND ALL OF THAT COMES TO YOU IN THE DVDs You've seen today, and of course if you get the kit, you get that wonderful red ball that you can use and that'll help just make your body feel even better. So give it some thought and think about what you are prepared to do for yourself and for this public television station. We count on you, and you can count on us. Thank you. 
Announcer: When you contribute at the $65, $100 or $175 levels, we'll say thanks with materials especially designed to expand your experience of t'ai chi, health and happiness with david-dorian ross. The companion dvd, home practice dvd, and the t'ai chi kit all have been designed to help you find balance in your life. This public television station appreciates a contribution in any amount. If it's right for you, it's right for us. What's important is that you call or go online right now to make a pledge of support. We appreciate you deeply. 
Lyn: One of my favorite elements of what you've done and what you've talked about is being in the moment, very hard for most of us to do. 
David-Dorian: Oh, it is so hard, because it's, it's not really part of our culture, which is why t'ai chi is such a magical tool for people, because it teaches us, in every way, how to experience being in the moment, physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually. And, you know, this is an opportunity for people to be in the moment right now in their relationship to the pbs and public television station that they're watching. 

[00:57:06]


Lyn: And alas, I have to be in this moment now and reluctantly bid you adieu and thank you for being with us. Thank you for what you've brought to us and to public television. We really do appreciate it. And we thank you for being with us, too. We hope that you enjoyed this program, and there's one way you can tell us that will reassure us that we're on the right track. You still have a moment to go to the telephone, make that call and support your public television station. Thank you for being with us. 
Announcer: We appreciate a contribution of any amount. If it's right r you, it's right for us. Just give us a call right now, and thanks. 
Announcer: Explore new worlds and new ideas through programs like this, made available for everyone through contributions to your pbs station from viewers like you. Thank you.

=======================================================

Tavis: Good evening. From los angeles, I am tavis smiley. We continue our road to health series. Empowering women of color to the healthcare approach. Dr. Linda bradley is here. And jakob dylan with "the wallflowers" is here. We are glad to have joined us. Coming up right now. 
>> There is a saying that dr. King had thasaid there is always the right time to do the right thing. I just try to live my life every day by doing the right thing. We know that we are only halfway to completely eliminate hunger, and we have a lot of work to do. Walmart committed $2 billion to fighting hunger in the u.S. As we work together, we can stamp hunger out. 
>> The california endowment. Health happens in neighborhoods. Learn more. 
>> And by contributions to your pbs station from viewers like you. Thank you. 
Vis: Dr. Linda bradley is the founder of a program aimed at women of color called celebrate sisterhood. I read a piece that you wrote: 10 ways to put your doctor at of business and I was fascinated by what I saw and I thought to ask you. Whether or not doctors really want to be put up of business and you know where I am going. There is so much money that is made in the medical profession. I wonder not to cast a person -- aspersion on you but how serious are wary about getting to a point where people do not need hospitals, they do not need doctors. They do not need the kinds of medical insurance we have. Can you imagine a time when we will get to a place where we will be so healthy that we can put doctors out of business? 

[00:02:48]


>> I am optimistic that we can do that. Doctors would relish the opportunity to take care of patients, to be looking at preventive ways to promote health. If you look at the new oath we take, it is modified. But of the cleric oath says i prefer to take care of patients for prevention. Rather than cure and that food be thy medicine. I am sad when I look at young people, middle age, or old folks who have diseases that are totally preventable. 70% to 80% of white people are in hospitals are self induced illnesses -- of why people are in hospitals are self ind illnesses. 70 or 80% of things we can control we would love to be able to take care of patients and be more partner with talking to my setting examples, being role models for things I can do to prevent these devastating chronic illnesses. 
>> When did the hypocritical both changer get modified and -- change or get modified and what was the reason for doing it? 
>> In the last 10 of 15 years and is about looking at what we're doing as physicians. In the old days as we would say, we did not have a lot. We did not have the antibiotics or surgery or anesthesia. You relied on the good lord to take care of you. Are putting things in our patients' hands and we want to partner. We're optimistic that if you teach, the word in dr. In latin means teacher and that is what i would like to do and that is what most of my colleagues would want to do also. 
Tavis: What is your view of obamacare and where people of color concerned? There is debate but we never got to talk about disparities in health care. Even with health care for millions of americans coming online we still have not got around to that disparity that exists and will exist when it comes on line. 

[00:04:59]


>> I love that term health care reform but if you were sitting in my office the word that you would hear is health-care reform. It is so much in our hands as patients we should not just rely upon our doctors, our religious leaders, our insurance companies but to the savings for yourself that you know to do the basic parts of taking care of herself dreadful therefore will care act, be able to talk with their doctors about things like domestic violence, getting your pabst merkel megyn your mammogram. There are excellent parts where people did not have to pay a copiague -- a copay. And strong healthy women can make healthier families. When I write and speak I like to use the board's health care reform. A lot of the things I recognize are there but we have to take ownership for what we do. And make these changes and do the right thing. 
Tavis: We now those forces that we're against for many decades 
-- know the forces that we're against for many decades. What are the forces against self care reform? 
>> Education. It is extremely important. It is easy to get seduced into the advertising dollars that are spent for on healthy food. We become mouth . Heroes and a couch potatoes. Educating, getting screening, if you have been diagnosed with a chronic illness, take the medication. Sometimes it is not compliant and a lot of it is living without understanding the long- term repercussions. Let's take hypertension that affects women and men. If you go to the dialysis centers, who is sitting there getting dialyzed? It is black people. They have not lost weight, stop smoking, moderation in alcohol. There are so m things we can do but we have become a society of super sizing everything and we just moderate, try some new things. A lot of these illnesses are so simple to treat. It takes self and we have to get out of this thought of having what I call access to convenience foods. It is quick and fast but sometimes you have to go back in your home and we learn things and your grandmother, great- grandmother's did every day. Cook, cook for yourself. If we look at what is in fast food, lots of fat, salt, sugar. You realize that a can of soda it is not die it has 12th tees tons of sugar. If you came to my house and i fixed eliminate and you put in 12 spun, that is kind of crazy, what is going on? How much salt and fat? It is a matter of becoming a consumer that understands what advertising is done and we have to stop being lazy in the kitchen. We have to get on our shoes, your tennis shoes. You do not have to join a thousand dollars a year spa. You can walk. It is easy and affordable. 

[00:08:36]


Tavis: What is the link that you see between less than healthy conditions of their patients and poverty? 
>> Party is a big-league. However, let's look at -- poverty is a big link. Some of our most educated african americans are overweight. When we look at organizations we belong to, other women's organizations, our children are highly educated. It crosses not just african- americans but all, this issue of wealthometimes does not make you any better as a consumer. It is almost an equal opportunity disadvantage by either being poor or also being rich or being middle class. It affects everyone. Certainly a little bit more in our community but it is not as if other communities are not affected. 
Tavis: Tell me about this program, celebrate sister read. 
>> It is the best thing for me and our community. I found it this this year and it is a day of information, celebration, education, time for women to learn a lot of information about health and we call it a day of edutainment. It is hands on and screening, testimonials, we started 7:30 a.M. The day to reconnect with our community. I partnered with the cleveland clinic because we live in an area of cleveland that is poor. Sometimes I wonder if it is the message or the messenger in terms of how health information is being delivered. I wanted to do something and i said -- when I say i, I have a great staff and a bunch of volunteers. To find great collectors -- lectures. We have topics on gyn, contraception, female sexuality, eating, and with a partner of mine we did a cooking demonstration for an hour and a half. It is a day of lots of fun, hands-on, and when I look at the things I do, I aeon. I think the role I am I am right now, there is more to be done with a mass group of people that one person at a time. This was a large group. I enjoy putting this on with the team and with the cleveland clinic behind me to help finance this and provide the resources to make the date unique and imploring. 

[00:11:31]


Tavis: You are from cleveland. Comedians have had a field day making fun of cleveland and it gets bashed for a lot of different things. It has been the butt of jokes for years but in the center of the city since the cleveland clinic which I am proud of. People around the wld literally do anything they can to get to the cleveland clinic. As one who was born and raised in cleveland, how does it feel to work at this institution? 
>> It is phenomenal. Cleveland is a comeback city and to work at an institution that is number one in so many areas, we're number one in gynecology, no. 3 in the country. Our heart institution is number one and it is a unique opportunity giveback. The institution is one in which it has been at the forefront for many things. We do not hire smokers. We got rid of unhealthy things. We want to set an example and positions want to set an example. We're trying to empower patients and make them take ownership of self care reform. Not to be passive about your health. We want people to live like many parts in the world to 100 and the biggest thing I would say that if you were healthy at age 50, you are likely to live to age 80. If you're healthy at 65, you are unlikely to live to age 90. If you are healthy at 70 you are likely to live to 100 years of age. We want people to take the steps. I think men and women, we are trying to empower schools and maybe teach some classes, the church is a big part of our community. When I am working with my church, it is one played at a time to show we can do. Children's are coming home. What can a 7-year-old or 10- year-old cook that is quick and healthy? Celebrate sisterhood was part of that project to educate and inform and the fun in teaching. 

[00:13:51]


Tavis: It is the road to health series. We're pleased to have dr. Linda bradley from the cleveland clinic. Next, jakob dylan is with us. We're back in a moment. Please welcome jakob dylan back to this program. He and his band is out with their first album in seven years. The disk is called "glad all over," and they are on tour with eric clapton. Th is "reboot the mission" ?????? you need a clue ?????? ?????? I want t tell you you have had it coming ?????? ?????? you had it coming ?????? ?????? look alive ?????? 
tavis: I am willing that video. I was saying that when I first heard that, I did not connect that to "the wallflowers." 
>> It is one of the groups, one of the things we have not gone to. The promoters of rock-and-roll are so wide. There is no -- I do not think we found a pocket that is the one you are supposed to stay in. We always try to find different groups. 
Tavis: What is the biggest challenge in getting back together for several years? The last time you were here to talk about your solo project. The band had not broken up. In music as you know, things change so quickly. Never mind that the expense -- expansive field, fans change and tastes change. 

[00:16:15]


>> We havebetter around a long time and we have a dedicated audience. I wish more bands did that rather than hitting bombs in the road and calling it quits. 
Tavis: Seven years as a long time. 
>> Our lives are not just about the band. I want to make a couple different records that probably were not appropriate for the band and everyone wanted to run around. They have other stuff to do rather than be in the band. Other than call it quits we were wise enough to take a break. I did not think it would be seven years. I thought maybe two or three. 
Tavis: When you come back together after that long of a bright, where the music is concerned, how do you figure out what makes sense for "the wallflowers," because the stuff you did needed to be sold. How'd you know what is right for the band? 
>> It is simple. There is five of us. They do not work unless you have the chemistry and it is not just the physical chemistry. It is the personal chemistry. It is the chemistry of personalities that make them count. It is about -- less about musicianship. It is about the chemistry of the band. That is something we're protective of that and we're aware of it. We respect one another. It is not going to be one pe's vision that makes the group great. We share that and when I make records of my own, that has nothing to do with that. It is about what do you want to do. 
Tavis: Was their starting point when you got back together? What was the genesis for the tracks on the project? 
>> It was different in some regards that we had gone down -- I had a couple of songs and lyrics and that was something that was intentional. Previously I was taking the burden of writing the 15 songs before we go. And making sure their buttoned up and finished and the guys want more involvement. I felt like I needed someone to share that with. When you started I do not think anyone else was writing songs but people have learned how to do that over time. It started with us in the room making a racket and chasing the songs as they developed and not be as precious as we have been about it. 

[00:18:45]


>> I am still in the racket phase. 
>> That is the best face. 
Tavis: I am there. Not know how much longer but I have not got past the racket part. Your father reference mik jones from "the clash," and he wanted to get mick jones on tour. He is on your project. 
>> I've but not say he failed. 
Tavis: It did not happen. I did not want to call you a failure and anything. 
>> Mick jones is admired by my generation. Some of this guy's come through and ty are wowed too. I am sure if they wanted to do something they would or could. 
Tavis: There must be a list of people who you love to gig with like mick jones. 
>> I don't have a wish list but when it pops up is good for everyone. That generation was kind to me and let me on their stages or came in the studios when I was working and like now it is good to get together. I am glad to get together and people come and listen to my band's music. It is important to have that exchanges often is you can. 
Tavis: You have said before that you are not comfortable having to explain the content of your lyrics. You think that every song is left to the interpretation of the listener. Not every song writer feels similarly. Tell me why you feel that way. 
>> That is what the exchange is. That is the responsibility of the artist and listener. I am depending on what I write songs, that is what I am depending on. If they find that relationship in there, that is required. I think I'm not writing term papersor people. 

[00:21:08]


[Laughter] there is nothing factual. Is meant to be listened to and i do not want to get in the way. We have an experience of listening to a song and when the author tells about iis often disappointing. That is important to the process. 
Tavis: You do have me thinking i wonder what is more lucrative, writing term papers were kids or hit records? 
-- For kids or hit records? 
>> I have not seen the numbers but I have a hunch. 
Tavis: That is pretty big business. I digress. How 0 excited is the band about touring with their clapton? 
>> I had a chance to put him on one of the solo records in 2008 or to those nine. I got some shows in germany with him. I got to play "crossroads" with him. I have a lot of fun. The guys did not play with me. 
Tavis: How do you know, circling back to the new project, "glad all over," have been trying to be glad all over for several years. 
>> We were talking about it. It does not mean that you are simply happy. It -- you could be glad that it is over. 
Tavis: I walked into that. 
>> I am begging on our relationship that you will figure that out. 
-- Banking on our relationship that you'll figure it out. It was covered by the dave clark five. You have to go with stuff that is dirty and solid. I like that. 
Tavis: Is there any trepidation when you got back with "the wallflowers" that once you got past the racket phase and people would get it and get it together?

(Slurps) That sure was sticky! Sticky, but pretty. 

[00:08:09]


Really pretty. But the hummingbird needs it for food. No, I can't take that one. If that's not the one to pick for your mother, then lets all fly off and find you another! 
  ??????
(Cat laughs) Now this is one funny looking flower! Hmmm. I've never seen one like this before. It's full of water! It is very special. Mom will love it! It's like an umbrella, the wrong way up. Catching the water in a flower shaped cup. Cool. The petals have collected water like a little swimming pool! Hey, now we can get all this sticky icky nectar off us. A swim in a flower! Now that will be fun! Hmmm....It must be the first time it's ever been done! And I brought enough floaters - to float everyone! Last one in is a dirty rotten egg... Weeeeeee!!! Weeeeeee!!!

Sometimes I drink from this pool. 
(Sings) ?????? La-la-la...   ??????
(clears throat) Excuse me! Oh, well, hello there. Pleased to meet you. I'm the Cat in the... ...rather wet hat. I'm a leaf litter frog. I live near this tree. And when I need to, the rain water in this flower is what I drink. But I can't if you're doing the backstroke in it. We're really sorry. Excuse me.... I guess we can't pick this flower now. No, the frog needs it to drink from. And your mom wants a flower, not a drink! <Pop!> That's better! What if I told you there was ANOTHER flower, an even more amazingly amazing flower? 

[00:10:10]


Ooh, show me, show me! I will, I will!!! To the Thinga-ma-jigger! If we're going to see it, we'll need to be bigger!!! Bye Frog! (slurps) Goodbye. Press the bigamaboodle! <Whirls and Pops!> 
  ??????
Ah-ha! (sniffs) Mmmm! Doesn't it smell fantabulous? (Sniff) Oh, yes! Look there's something wriggling and jiggling on this one! What could it be? Just wait and see! (Gasp - amazement) It's a butterfly! You're so right! Flutter by, butterfly. There's a whole bunch more here. 
  ??????
(sigh) I just can't pick this flower, if it's the butterfly's home. You are so kind, Sally. If I was a flower, I'd definitely pick you as a friend. It's just that every flower I like is needed by some other creature, like the hummingbird, the frog and the butterfly. Don't worry Sally, you're right to care. Maybe Nick's right, let's get mom a bear! Yes! (laughing) No! But I have decided we must find something else for my Mom. What, Sally? Wait and see! 
  ??????
There we go - finished. It's all the flowers and friends we saw in the Forest of Flora Fah-zoom! Each flower was used by a creature or two, Tonotbring them home was the right thing to do. This card shows it all, it's special indeed. What more than this could any Mom need? Yeah. Mom likes flowers but she loves the cards we make even more. For you! Oh Sally, (sniffle) I love it! 

[00:12:13]


(sniffle) In fact, I feel better already! (Blows kiss) A rainforest's quite a magical space, Where so many animals live in one place. So let us look closely at one single tree. And you'll be amazed at all you will see! At the top of the tree there are bugs, birds and bats. Things that have wings... but no ties and no hats. A rainforest is a great place to rest, And often a bird will build a big nest. Down here in the middle where branches are thick, We'll see Howler monkeys, that is, if we're quick. Here they find fruit and leaves that they eat, And even some bugs that they'll munch for a treat. A Tortoise likes to stay near the ground, And an Anteater licks up the ants he has found. And now my friends, I hope you've understood, This is not just a tree - it's a whole neighbourhood. <Happy noises> <Inquisitive noises> <Worried noises then gets idea> <Thing speak then blowing, sounds happy with self> <Happy sounds, giggles> <Happy sounds, giggles> 
  ??????
(packing snow efforts) Wow, Sally! We're nearly done. (packing snow efforts) There! Finished. It's just like the real Cat. Oh no, look, Nick! Where's his hat? It's gone! 
 Weee!     ??????
Ta da! It's the Cat! The Cat in the Hat! The Cat in the Hat! That's me! The cat! The cat in the hat! 

[00:14:13]


Oh, and this is me too. Two me's? How can that be? We made a snow cat in the hat. Er, but we lost the hat. Lost the hat? Oh my. A snow cat with no hat? You can't have that! Mmmm. Where can it be? <Pop!> Nope. <Pop!> Nope. <Pop!> Nope. Let me see... okay it.... (mumbles) oh..... (Laughter) Ugh! Is it just me or is it a little warm around here? Oh no! His arm's all drippy. He's drippy all over! We've got to do something, he's dripping away! This is one hot cat! Can't we take him somewhere cold? I know a place that's colder than cold. It's the Freeze-Your-Knees Snowland. (laugh) Snowland! Snowland! Ah! I see you're already sold! Will our snow cat like it there? You bet! And you will too. Let's go! Your mother will not mind at all if we do! (calling) Hey, Mom! Can we take our snow cat to Freeze-Your-Knees Snowland, to stop him from getting hot. (tongue in cheek:) Snowland? Okay. Just watch out for the polar bears! We can go! We can go! We can go! We can go! J know! I know! To the Thingamajigger!

Connecticut. A search warrant is being conductein hoboken, new jersey. That's where he lived. We know that shortly after 9:30 this morning, walked in to the mother's kindergarten classroom and opened fire. He killed her an he also killed at least 18 children. That's the latest. We'll continue right now. "The cycle" will pick things up from here. 3:00 here in new york. Five hours and 90 miles from the mass shooting. We have been following it for you throughout the d msnbc. Speaking of newtown, population 27,000, reeling this afternoon along with a stunned nation, after a gunman opened fire just after the start of class this morning. Federal sources say he was 24 years old with two guns and shot dead. The suspect reportedly from hoboken made the hour or so trip up north to sanly hook elementary school where his mother taught kindergarten. We're hearing that victims were found inside the kindergarten classroom and inside the principal's office. New jersey governor chris christie expected to speak momentarily about the suspect. Connecticut's governor up live this hour, as well. An update this hour from hospital. Monitoring that for you. Meantime, back in connecticut state police updated the very early investigation a short time ago. 
>> There were several fatalities at the scene. Both students and staff. There is no information relative to that. That's being released at this time until a complete and proper notification. The shooter is deceased inside the building. Suffice it to say the scene is secure. 
>> After news of the shooting, anxious parents rushed to the school picking up the frightened children, probably frightened themselves. The witnesses describe the scene they encountered moments after. 

[00:02:02]


>> We were gone during morning meeting. We heard like shots and everybody went on the ground and miss martin closed the door and we went to the corner. 
>> Nbc's michelle franzen is at the school in newtown. Michelle I read a parent said we thought that newtown was the safest place in america. What is the newtown you're finding today? 
>> Reporter: Well, the newtown that we're finding today, toure, is one that's grieving. Grieving for the children that were expecting to hear that we were killed and family who is are grieving as well as the families who rushed to that school early this morning to be reunited with the kids after the traumatic and tragic experience today and unfolded at the elementary school and this picturesque new england town where one road leads in to the main street and a few businesses and this elementary school sits on a hill. Of course, we have heard about these shootings all around the country in the past few decades before but this shooting involves some of the youngest students that we have been hearing about. You mentioned earlier the shooter going in what we believe we're hearing in to a kindergart room where his mom worked, opened fire there and in other areas of the school and investigators are still at that school at this hour obviously. A lot to deal with. A lot to pour over in terms of the crime scene. The governor is back at the school right now. We are told meeting with those families. Those families who also rushed to the school this morning only to be sequestered off in to another area to be told the worst information that any parent could possibly imagine hearing. And that's what we know at this hour. We know that the community is also pulling together. There's a prayer vigil already held. We'll se more of that community rally around each other in the coming days and weeks and hearing fr other communities in terms of colorado and virginia tech area where also shootings really, really just devastated those communities. They're reaching out offering their support and sympathy at this hour. 

[00:04:06]


>> Yeah. Michelle, you talk about a parent's worst nightmare, every parent can relate to that. Can you talk about any of the sort of mood that you can sense going on as these parents rush in to the school and try to deal with this american nightmare? 
>> Reporter: I think we can imagine whether we're parents or not but certainlparentses, getting the call. Most parents probably at work. Some may have worked in new york city which is about 60 miles away. They're rushing here and also word that many of the law enforcement or the first responders that were at the school knew or had their own children in this school that they were also trying to cope with so this really does hit home in many ways as we always hear. But any small community or any community anywhere throughout this country can imagine the pain and can imagine the tragic feelings that are unfolding in this town at this hour. 
>> Michelle, do we have any information on how the shooter was able to actually enter the school? 
>> No. We don't have any details like that so far. I would imagine that we are hearing -- we're going to get more word in the next half hour as the governor and law enforcement hold another press briefing but the initial reports is that he entered the school. He was wearing all black. Two handguns. And that he made his way to the school room where his mom taught. That's what we know so far. We don't know any other details. I am certain that everything happened very quickly. We heard about a 911 call coming in and the response was fast. And law enforcement said immediately they were in an active situation going door to door checking different classrooms so it was a very chaotic situation. But also, something that law enforcement says that they train for as well as school officials now throughout the country training for this very scenario. 

[00:06:09]


>> Thank you for that update. President obama will speak today at 3:15. Nbc's kristen welker is at the white house. What are you hearing? 
>> Reporter: Well, krystal, president obama was alerted about this tragedy at 10:30 this morning by the national security adviser john brennan. He is receiving updates throughout the morning and afternoon. White house press secretary jay carney holding a daily briefing today and talking about how tragic the events are and asked the initial response was. Carney held off saying that it's too soon and the president waiting for details and made the point that president obama is watching these events unfold today as a father as much as he iswatching as a president. The president reached out to fbi director mueller as well as the governor of connecticut malloy. Now, president obama is very reminisce ept of the aurora, colorado, shooting and president obama spoke to the nation. He was middle in the campaign at that point. He suspended the events. Spoke to the nation about how tragic it was, extended condolences to the people of colorado. I'm sure we'll hear similar comments of the president today. Jay carney was asked earlier today about the fact that president obama has supported stiffer gun control legislation. He was asked if today was the day to renew the efforts. He said today is not the day to talk about policy but focus on the victims and all of the people who are suffering in connecticut so again president obama alerted about this tragedy at 10:30 this morning. He is monitoring the situation, getting updates throughout the day, offering his assistance to the state of connecticut as well as his sympathy and condolences. 
>> Do we have any sense of how long the comments would be or if he would take questions? 
>> I'm sure he'll get shouted questions. I'm not sure the format specifically be. Generally hearing from the president ten, maybe 15 minutes when something like this happens so I don't anticipate a long speech but I would anticipate that the correspond ents in that briefing room have a number of questions for the president and because he spoke with the governor of connecticut and fbi director and point of stiffer gun control legislation and if he accepts questions, one or two correspondents ask about that, stiffer gun control. But certainly, we'll hear president obama really extend condolences, the sympathies to victims, people in connecticut right now and offer the full support of the federal government as that community deals with this uakable tragedy. 

[00:08:56]


>> Thank you. Craig melvin is following this since the news broke. What is the latest right now? 
>> We hear stories of sandy hook elementary school. We heard of a third grader describe screams being heard over the intercom system. We heard about a gym teacher to huddle together a number of her students in the gym to keep them safe but at this point, again, important to note for the viewer that is details about the tragedy continue to trickle in. And that it is at this point a fairly complex story. Three scenes, one in hoboken, one here at the elementary school and getting a picture above in newtown and the other not so far away, we found out from justice correspondent pete williams about 15 or 20 minutes ago a family member of ryan lanza, the 24-year-old, the gunman, according to authorities, walked in to his mother's classroom and opened fire around 9:30 this morning. But we're told that nearby, near the school, another family member of lanza's was found dead before this. So at this point, law enforcement trying to connect the dots but we know based on reports we have heard on the ground, folks who are in law enforcement, as well, we do know that he walked in to classroom in all black. At least two handguns. May have had a third rifle. There's confusion at this point over that. At least two handguns. Wearing a vest with pockets. Perhaps to store even more ammunition. And we also know that the lion's share of his shooting was directed at his mother's kindergarten classroom. At least 18 children between the ages of 5 and 10 years old were all dead. And they were killed inside their elementary school. Before he made the way to his mother's classroom, he stopped first at the principal's office and opened fire, as well. So again, at this point, 26 dead. 18 of them children. Eight adults. There are three folk who is are still in the hospital. At this point, we don't know whether they're adults. We don't know whether they're children or their condition, as well. All of this information of course all of these details something to find out here over the next few minutes or hours, as well. At this point, we also don't have any indication about a motive. That, of course, is the question that everyone who's watching and listening. That's the question that everyone wants answered. And even when we get that answer, it will not be sufficient. There's absolutely no explanation as to why someone would walk in to the classroom and in addition to killing their mother, kill defenseless children. We know that about the invest and transpired this morning. With folks not familiar with the town, about 27,000 folks. 'S very small town. There's also a federal prison there so you have a number of government workers who live in the area, as well. So that's the very latest. We continue to gather more information as we learn more and will, of course, pass it to you guys. Back to you. 

[00:12:04]


>> Thanks, craig. 
>> Again, the president will speak in just moments so stay with us and they're lower the flags right now at the capitol. Nbc's kristen welker is back for us at the white house. 
>> Reporter: Well, undersres the fact not just a tragedy for the state of connecticut but for the entire nation. President obama just releasing this statement. I'm going to read it to you. He says, quote, I here by order that the flag of the united states at half staff at white house and all public buildings and grounds at all military posts and naval stations and on all naval vessels of the federal government and the district of columbiand throughout the united states and the territories and possessions UNTIL SUNSET DECEMBER 18th, 2012. Again, the flag here at the white house will be flown at half staff and the other flags here throughout the capital. President obama making it clear that the federal government stands with connecticut as it endures this tragedy. And tries to cope with this tragedy. The president was alerted about this situation at 10:30 this morning by the national security adviser. He's watching the developments unfold. He's been updated on the situation throughout the day and also been in contact with the folks in connecticut calling the governor there a little bit earlier on this afternoon. But his press secretary jay carney making the point that the president is watching this tragedy unfold, not just as the commander in chief, as the president of this country, but also as a father who has two daughters. 
>> Kristen, do we know, are there plans for the president to visit newtown, connecticut, any time soon? 
>> Reporter: Well, I wouldn't be surprised if he visits newtown, connecticut. If you look at the history, the patterof this president, he certainly has visited states that have endured similar tragedies. Aurora, colorado. Tucson, arizona. And he goes to really be the healer in chief in those instances, to really stand with those communities as they really begin what will undoubtedly be a long and difficult healing process. There are no plans reported or read out but I would say it's quite likely to see president obama visit with the people in connecticut who are suffering so dearly right now. 

[00:14:23]


>> You asked -- you askedn important question, krystal, about how did the shooter get in to the building and the schools function as sort of lockdown situation and not supposed to be able to get in if you're not supposed to be there. You have a card or in my school they have visually recognize you in the main office so you have to be known to the community, perhaps he was known because his mother was there and then in terms of the architecture of the schools with one door, classrooms and the children cannot leave to run away from the teachers. So if you block the door, you have the whole school, the whole room as almost a fish bowl and just visualizing what could have happened, it's just very frightening to me to think about that architecture is structured. 
>> Horrifying image. 
>> Let's bring pete williams covering this all day long. What do you know? 
>> Reporter: What we know is that a man with two handguns walked in to this school about 9:30 this morning, went to the principal's office, fired a number of shots and then went to a classroom where hisother taught and devoted most of his attention there with devastating affect. We believe that the total number of childn killed is 18 and either 8 or 9 adults depending on whether the shooter ryan lanza is counted in that total or not. After the shooting and the police serving search warrants at addresses associated with the young man, they discovered another family member who was shot to death at a home in newtown, connecticut, which is where the school is. And at the same time, at the school, authorities detained the brother of ryan lanza to see whether he had information about the shooting. He is not being called a suspect. He is simply someone they believe may have information that's useful. He is in custody. Authorities are conducting searches in new jersey and other addresses connected with this young man to see what else they can learn. In terms of firearms -- 
>> pete, I'm sorry. We have to go. We have the president. 

[00:16:25]


>> This afternoon, I spoke with governor malloy and fbi director mueller. I offered governor malloy my condolences on behalf of the nation and made it clear he will have every single resource that he needs to investigate this heinous crime. Care for the victims. Counsel their families. We have endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. And each time I learn the news, I react not as a president but as anybody else would. As a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there's not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today. For the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors, as well. For as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early and there are no words that will ease their pain. As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it's an elementary school in newtown or a shopping mall in oregon or a temple in wisconsin or a movie theater in ora or a street corner in chicago. These neighborhoods are our neighborhoods and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. This evening, michelle and i will do what I know every parent in america will do which is hug our children a little tighter and we'll tell them that we love them. And we'll remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in connecticut who cannot do that tonight. And they need all of us right now. In o days to come, the community needs us to be at our best as americans and I will do everything in my power as president to help. Because while nothing can fill the space of a lost child or loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need, to remind them that we are there for them. That we are praying for them. That the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories, but also, in our ours. May god bless the memory of the victims and in the words of spriccher heal the broken hearted and binds up their wounds. 

[00:20:17]


>> That is an emotional president obama speaking just now about the mass shooting in connecticut earlier today. Let's get back to nbc's kristen welker at the white house. 
>> Reporter: Steve, this is probably the most emotional that we have seen this president as he comes out to address the nation to respond to these types of tragedies. The reason understandable. He talked about the fact that so many young lives were lost today. The lives of children who had so much ahead of them, children who had the rest of their lives to live, children who will not be able to have their own children. You saw a very emotional president obama today. You also heard a bit of a call to action. He talked about the fact that in the wake of this shooting, he would like to see meaningful action to try to prevent these types of tragedies from happening in the future. What specifically did he mean by that? Of course, that will evolve in the coming days and weeks. Right now, the president clearly focused on extending his condolences, his sympathy to the victims, to all of the people who are suffering right now in connecticut. You also heardim talk at the top of the remarks about the fact that he did reach out to the fbi director, as well as the governor of connecticut offering his sympathy, but also, offering the full support of the federal government as they begin what will undoubtedly be an incredibly long and difficult heal process so president obama becoming quite emotional as he addresses the nation about this most recent gun massacre that has unfolded in connecticut. Steve? 
>> Heart breaking and horrifying for the 600 students inside sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. We bring in dr. Joshua wiener, he is -- excuse me. A board certified in both adult and child and adolescent psychiatry. Joshua, you can understand it's emotional for everyone. There are reports that the children were told to cover their eyes as they fled past the school's main office. How do you begin even discussing this with children as you can tell it's hard for adults to talk? 

[00:22:32]


>> Yeah. I mean, this is an unbelievable tragedy. As a father of two elementary school aged kids, it is so hard to understand and wrap your arms around this. I think what parents need to be aware is with really young kids, elementary school aged kids, you want to keep it very brief and simple. You don't want to go in to any graphic detail. You want to answer whatever questions they may have and you want to be able to provide them with reassurance. Of course, there's no way to guarantee that the world is safe to your kid and when a kid is an elementary school aged child, you want to make things black and white for them and let them know that even though this tragedy occurred, they are very safe. Their schools are safe and they will be okay. Because kids very young have a very hard time appreciating and understanding probabilities. They're not going to do well with an answer that says, well, in general things are going to be safe for you s you don't need to worry. 
>> Doctor, we have actually been in my household I have a 4 1/2-year-old and she's been asking a lot of questions about death and what does it mean and how long will you live, how long will I live. How do you explain those sorts of life and death questions to young children? 
>> You know, the way I would typically start by answering those is asking more questions. Are you worried about howong mommy will live? If ends up asking the questions it's in their mind. I would suggest parents ask their child why they're asking the questions and I think you do again want to be reassuring and let them know that mommy, daddy, everybody's safe. We are going to be around for a long time. 
>> Doctor, one of the problems in these situations, I have a they don't know how to express them beyond the crying, being super happy and for parents multiple discussions a two-minute discussion, the next day, four days later, you realize they're still thinking about that and as parents we have to be prepared to have the conversation over and over. Right? 

[00:24:56]


>> Absolutely. I think you're right on the money there. Kids process this gradually over time. Let them know you're available to talk about this. You may want to initiate sometimes, say how are you doing? Are you still thinking about that? This is going to linger for a while for many of them and you want to keep a look out for regression in their behavio so this is going to be an indication that maybe they're struggling more than the average kid with this information. If they're having sleep problems, nightmares, if they're more clingy with you and not eating, if they're suddenly bed wetting again, parents should be aware these may be an indicator that your child is having a harder time dealing with this than you might expect and so because of that you might want to take more of an active role in asking them about this an you also might want to consider possibly seeking out extra help. But I don't think parents need to worry if the kid is exhibiting these for a week afterwards. I would say that's within the normal range. If it's going beyond that, that's a point where I think parents need to consider possibly getting extra help for their child. 
>> If you could speak to children who are survivors in this school or parents of survivors in this school, you know, children who second hand experience this, what would you say to them? 
>> What I would tell them is that kids, kids are resilient. They're going to be okay. I think adults need to understand that most of the kids are going to be just fine with this. You know, in general, the interesting thing is no matter the trauma, an adult or a child, so this could be war, school shootings, et cetera, in general about 15% othe people are really going to be the ones who exhibit the problems so the bulk of the kids are going to be okay. I would say to kids right now that they're probably experiencing such a mix of emotions and probably can't identify what exactly they're feeling. There's a term of derealization where it just feels like they're in a dream and not sure how to process this so over time you want to talk to them and give them words to help them understand and process what they're experiencing. But the feelings that they're experiencing today are different than the feelings they will have tomorrow and next week. 

[00:27:12]


>> Doctor, there is nothing more horrifying for a parent than the idea of losing their child. What would you say to the parents to help them get through this unbelievable tragedy? 
>> I think the parents need to seek the support of other parents. They need to talk about it and process it. In many ways I think this strategidy is harder for the parents than the kids. But they need to be careful because they're emotional and young kids take the cues on how worried to be from their parents. Parents, for instance, going to pick up the kids today, maybe more emotional seeing their kids and might give them a tighter hug but I think parents need to keep the emotions in check because if they run to their kids and crying and squeeze them, kids are a little freaked out and wonder what's going. Kids take the cues from the parents so the parents need to make sure whenever they're around the kids, they have their own emotions in check so that that way the kids end up feeling more secure and safe. 
>> Right. Easier said than done. Thank you so much for that. And in a situation like this, we know hospitals snap in to trauma mode. Dr. Mike am anderson is chief medical officer at university hospital's case medical center in cleveland and specializes in pediatrics. Is any er prepared for this situation? 
>> We drill for tragedies like this. We do mock drills, tabletops and talk it through, we bring in actors to portray victims and you drill it and the point's well taken. How do you prefair for a tragedy of this magnitude? How do you prepare for your own emotions? You saw e president take this very much to heart so hospitals do prepare. I think judging the last ten years better prepared than ten years ago but the emotion sometimes taking over and sometimes folks in trauma centers or children's hospitals have an adrenaline rush for two, four, six hours focused on the patients and getting through and then we're human and after that phase it's important that the caregivers are offered mental health support, as well. 

[00:29:26]


>> I wonder about that. At what point does the mental health of the doctor impact the ability to give care even seeing the president dab the eyes several times and this table we're having a hard time getting through it. Seeing small children come in, some living, some gone, how do you keep going as a caregiver? 
>> It's very difficult. I'm doing this 20 years and sort of seen a pattern. In the heat of the moment, you revert to your training. You know it's about suscitation, triage, finding the right resources to save the lives of that -- save the life of that child. It is about supporting the family and getting the resources and being honest and tell them what's going on with their loved one but when that adrenaline rush goes away and done for the day and getting in the car to go home, you have that letdown and as I said it takes many, many months to years to heal from this. But I think we are doing a better job as hospital and hospital administrators to know it's not just about the victims but the caregivers, as well. We have to take care of each other. 
>> You would have in this situation grieving parents there, as well. You know, what would the scene be like in terms of helping those parents to deal with their motions at that snoemt. 
>> It's unfortunate, we have drills and people reuied and try to reunite them with their families as quick as possible but you can imagine the terror of not knowing and minutes turn in to hours and providing as much support and love and honesty as you can is important and we drill for these things, a lot, but the emotion of this is just overwhelming. 
>> When you have a tragedy like this, the er's going to be overwhelmed. You don't expect several people at once needing acute care right away. Can you talk abo methodology and how that changes talking about pediatrics? 

[00:31:39]


>> It's surge plan. How do you surge up and take care of more patients? Good news, no the that it's good news but great children's hospitals across the country thategionalized well, prepared to help as they can and there's emergency departments and hospitals that don't take care of a lot of kids. Things like this don't happen that often and good organizations tried to reach out and say, not only prepare for that one sick patient, that disaster of one, but make sure you have affiliation with children's hospitals, make sure you drilled to take care of kids. Make sure you know where your children's hospital is and how they can help you and surging up for this kind of big mass casualty is unfortunately becoming more in need and we're drilling for it more often and i come back to the first point, it's tough when you have to do it. 
>> We understand the hospital drills for these things. Is that common protocol across the country? Is this standard at all hospitals and trauma centers? 
>> There is but there's drilling and drilling really well and we're trying to get better and better. There's the children's hospital association trying to set the best standard. One thing to do it on a tabletop and okay, imagine you got 20 injured or shot kids. It is much more intense if you bring in actors or kids to play the victims, if you will. Because then you have to see if the moving parts are working. Can you bring in two more surgeons? How would you clear out the waiting room to make a reunification? I think the country is getting better at it. It's unfortunate it's necessary because we are seeing incidents like this but I think that hospitals are taking this surge or disaster drills much more seriously over the last several years. 
>> Describe the scene you imagine in newtown in the trauma center there. 
>> Yeah. I think the trauma center is revved up. I think they're trying to figure out what kids can stay and i don't know the details of the numbers to be honest but what kids can stay, what children need to be transferred to a regional trauma center, how do we resuscitate those children and get the transport assets? What sort of medical things to get in. Those kind of situations really can be chaotic and also a truck which you are to it. There's a person in charge. There's somebody called t incident commander that sets the tone for the response. There are different people with different delegated responsibilities but it can be chaotic. But if you plan well, if you figure out what the structure is, figure out these sort of details before the tragedy strikes, then I think it goes much, much better. Back to the importance of roles. 

[00:34:18]


>> Doctor, I'm also wondering what kind of sort of chain reaction this has on neighboring hospitals. So if your hospital is receiving a lot of patients during the disaster, does it also spark area hospitals to prepare for maybe overflow or that sort of thing? 
>> It's a great question. That's a concept of coalitions. We know that one hospital itself can't prepare for something of this magnitude. It's difficult for one facility to really take this all in. So the concept of coalitions are one what are the other hospitals to help? How is ems involved in this? Does ems take one child to another low kigs and potentially children to another location not overwhelmed? How's the local children's hospital a part of that coalition? You are right. The best regions of this country have really practiced this and drilled this coalition. One institution is really going to be hard pressed to get through something like this. How do we operate as coalitions is a very important part, whether a tragedy like this, a mass shooting, something like an earthquake or god forbid another terrorist attack, this is important because one institution is very overwhelmed. 
>> Doctor, I'm curious. You have mentioned drilling several times. How many times has your hospital drilled this year? 
>> Twice with actors and pushed us because it was a very busy day and if you combine a busy day of a lot of patients with this, you know -- 
>> all right. Connecticut's -- sorry, doctor. We have to cut you off. Connecticut's governor dannel malloy is about to speak and give us an update. Looks like they are just setting up for that right now. That's dan malloy there in the middle of the screen. And panning away from him right now. Looks like he'll step up to the podium in a minute. 
>> Good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today a tragedy of unspeakable terms played its out in this community. Lieutenant governor and I have been spoken to and an attempt that we might be prepared for something like this playing itself out in our state. You can never be prepared for this kind of incident. What has happened and what's transpired at that school building will leave a mark on this community and every family impacted. I only ask that all of our fellow citizens here in the united states and around the world who have offered their assistance remember all of the victims in their prayers. To all of you in the media, we will do our best to keep you as informed as we can. After I'm done speaking, a representative of the state police will speak to you and give you some additional information. Earlier today, a number of our citizens, beautiful children, had their life taken away from them. As well as adults whose responsibility it was to educate and super vise those children. The perpetrator of the crime is dead. As is an individual who the perpetrator lived with. With that, I'm going to turn it over to paul vance who will answer or will give you some additional information and then later in the day perhaps we'll speak again. Again, I think on behalf of the people of the state of connecticut we extend our condolences as I have at the firehouse to the parents of these children, as well as the adult that is are there. I want to thank the president who has been on the phone with us today for his statement released to you a little while ago, as well as the statements he made to me earlier -- much earlier today as the hours rated by. With that, I should say there's a number of public officials and first select woman who's been on site throughout the day. We have state representatives, state senator, other select people who are here. We have the superintendent of schools who has done wonderful work in helping us get the information necessary to begin the processes that will be ongoing for a number of hours in advance. I want to thank senator blumenthal and senator-elect murphy for also joining us. With that, I'm going to absent myself. Mr. Vance will come forward and speak to you. Thank you very much. 

[00:39:37]


>> Hi, good evening. I just would like to restate some of the information that we made earlier. We'll take some questions but i must preface my remarks by saying this is a aktsive, ongoing investigion. There are a lot of things we cannot confirm or discuss as of yet. But shortly after 9:30 this morning newtown police department received a call for help at the sandy hook elementary school here in newtown. Upon realizing the intensity and difficulty of the situation, newtown called for surrounding police departments and state police to respond to assist. Upon arrival of law enforcement officers at the school, they immediately entered the school as we knew this was an active potential active shooter situation. Their focus was to search for students, faculty and staff and remove them to a safe area outside of the school. They did search every nook an cranny, every room and every portion of that school and accomplished that task. They took refuge to a staging area to reunite them with family members. As has been reported there were fatalities. There were 18 children pronounced dead at the school. There were two that were trance portded and pronounced dead at area hospitals and six adults pronounced dead at the school at the scene. As the governor reported, the shooter is deceased, deceased in the school. There's a great deal of work going on relative to that. That's the reason we have not identified him as of yet and by that I mean search warrants, areas of residence, employment and any ancillary things attached to the identity of that individual. The scene is secured. Newtown police officers, state police, major crime units of western district and central district have responded and are working with several agencies to process this scene. It is not a simplistic scene as you can certainly understand. We need to establish identity, document the entire scene and simply stated, answer every single question surrounding exactly how and why this incident occurred. As the governor said, we will be here through the night and the weekend and we're not pting a time stamp on this as to when we'll complete this project. We'll work with the medical examiner's office, establish positive identification and a great deal of work to be done here at the school. Again, very brief questions but understand that this is an active ongoing case and many things we cannot and will not discuss at this time. Yes, sir? 

[00:42:16]


>> Told there's two other crime scenes of the suspect's father-in-law and mother-in-law. 
>> There is a secondary crime scene here in newtown. That is, in fact, correct. There is an adult deceased at that location. I can't discuss any further information on that at this time. There is assistance depended to us by new jersey. I can't answer that. Yes, ma'am? 
>> Lieutenant, can you confirm that the children -- 
>> okay. I can simply state that the information that we have right now that we want to publicize the s the shootings in one section of the school in two rooms. Okay? One section and two rooms. That's as much as we want to go in as far as location. Our personnel are documenting that entire scene and will have literally everything mapped out and in a final report and final information and present the answers to those questions but right now I don't have anymore details than that. Okay? Yeah. You had a question. Someone -- 
>> one shooter? 
>> Right now there's one shooter. But again, we're still looking at every ancillary fact and circumstance related to the suspect at the scene. Yes, sir? 
[ Inaudible ] I don't have that information. New. 
>> Do we know -- 
>> to be determined. I don't have the answer to that question eat. Next step is medical examiner's office will assist us in answering a lot of questions, manner and cause of death of all of the deceased. 
>> I'm sorry. 
>> That's it. 26 deceased. 
>> Lieutenant, once again -- 
>> one person was injured. 
>> The children in one classroom? 
>> I'm sorry. 
>> Were the children in one classroom? 
>> One section and one area of the school. That's the best I can do on that answer. I don't know specifically how many rooms are involved. I was told there were two but in one section of the school building. 
>> And the adults? 
>> Everyone was in that same section of the building. 
>> Is that -- 
>> to be determined a. Section of the building is as far as we want to did. 

[00:44:18]


>> Did you say how the shooter died? 
>> We did not. That's to be determined once the examinations are complete. 
>> The shooter, as well? 
>> I'm sorry? 26 including the shooter? 20 children, 6 adults and the shooter. 
>> So 27? 27 total. 
>> And the house? 
>> Still one at the house. 
>> And the one at the house. 
>> That's at the school? 
>> That's correct. There's one more as we said at a secondary crime scene, a deceased adult at the secondary crime scene. Yes, ma'am? 
>> Do we know -- 
[ inaudible ] 
>> to be determined. That's something that the investigators will have to look at thoroughly and completely and takes some time to complete that question. 
[ Inaudible ] we have not made any positive identification. There's preliminary identification. We have a great deal of work. That's one thing to do is establish positive identification on the deceased and that's a time consuming process. 
>> Do we know the ages of the victims? 
>> I don't, no. I don't. It's a k-4 elementary school. 
>> When police went in to the school, were there still shots being fired at that time? 
>> That I don't know. I don't know the time sequence. That will be something we'll provide you. What I'd like to do -- no, we did not. What I would like to do is tell you that this is a briefing. We'll be back in 60 minutes. Myself and lieutenant from newtown back and see if there's anymore detail. I have some of the questions that I have poised and see if i can get you more answers to provide you with information and just about 25, quarter to 5:00. 
>> Was the shooter -- 
>> 20 children. 6 adults in the facility. Plus the shooter. That's 27. And then a secondary scene with an additional adult victim at the secondary victim. 28. 
>> Okay? 28. 
>> Okay. 
>> You said quarter to 5:00? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Do you have a -- 
>> I do not. I do not. 
>> One thing about the families, they don't want to talk to the media. 

[00:46:21]


>> One thing I would like to say is that we have been meeting with all of the family members. It's a very, very difficult scene for the family ms for the first responders. It's a tragedy. We have been asked by the family members to respect their privacy and leave them alone at this time. They're going through a tremendous amount of grief which I'm sure you can appreciate. I'm asked to ask you that personally by the family members. All right? I'll be back in 60 minutes with the lieutenant and answer any additional questions we can. 
>> Have you prepared -- 
>> I don't know. I'll get it. 
>> Real quickly, you prepare for scenarios like this. Give us an idea of the emotion that is are now envelopg the community. 
>> The community's come together. Certainly all the first responders are coming together. Counselors. It's amazing how the immense amount of family has shown here in the town of newtown. Everyone's coming together, supporting everyone, working together. Trying to answer the questions of how and why this occurred and lend support to the people involved including the victims. Okay? 
>> Lieutenant, how long did it take -- how long from when he started shooting to when he stopped? 
>> I cannot answer that question, ma'am. I'll see if I at least narrow it down somewhat in the next briefing. Okay? Okay. 
>> All right. That's paul vance from the connecticut state police. Before that, dan malloy, the governor of the state offering an update on the tragedy by today. It's a quaint new england town. Seeing the pictures of children leaving sandy hook elementary, hard not to think of past school shootings in the country. One of the worst, of course, columbine high school in colorado. Dave cullen spent ten years writing and researching about that massacre and joins us now. Dave, thank you for being here. I guess your book came out about columbine ten years after the tragedy and the most eye opening thing about what you're reporting found was that all of the -- everything we thought we knew about columbine in the first week, two months and months after it happened was basically false and a lot of false narratives. And you basically searched for a sort of satisfying motive that we could all understand and you couldn't really find one. I wonder based of your experience if there are lessons to keep in mind piecing together what happened here in newtown in the weeks ahead. 

[00:48:48]


>> Sure. There are a whole lot of lessons. One thing is that the media is pretty good in getting the facts right and there's always confusion in the beginning, especially the first hours and awful things like how many people have been killed and logistical things but it sorts itself out pretty quickly and normally the facts we do pretty well with. That's okay. It's the jumping to conclusions that's really the danger. Especially drawing conclusions about motive because we -- there's no way to know what's happening inside this person's mind, especially most cases the person ends up dying. And little bits of knowledge, you know, if you take three or four little bits may seem like an obvious pattern but just remember they're tiny little dots on something much bigger and need to resist the urge to try to draw conclusions. 
>> I'm interested in what you learned about the hearts of the columbine survivors, jumped out at me and I think people, the president said our hearts are broken also for the survivors whose kids' innocence torn away too early and I'm sure with the long view on columbine we can see that that happened to survivors. Did you learn anything about that? 
>> I did. You know, I don't know if this is too soon to say. I was -- I was really, really worried about the kids who lived through it at first. In fact, the day after columbine it was completely different than the day it happened. The morning after I was back there about 12 hours later, and there was no crying. There was no emoting. People were walking around with blank expressions, and they had lost the ability to feel, and they all told me about that and how they were -- they didn't understand why they were going through it, and I was really, really terrified about those survivors. Again, I almost hate to say this this soon. Theids were more resilient than I thought and it took many of them years and years to get over it, but 13 years out most of those are doing pretty well. It's the parents of the kids who died. They have a rough road, and some of them are still, I guess, most of them are still really struggling and I wish I had more to help them. But it's pretty rough for them. 

[00:51:20]


>> Dave, talk about how has the community of columbine, how have they tried to move past this, tried to go back to some sense of normalcy following that tragic day? 
>> Well, it took quite a while, and I mean I think the media has learned some things, too, the hard way. Unfortunately, they learned it the hard way. A lot -- certain aspects of the coverage were really difficult for them, especially the playing of certain images over and over again. I mean, I think everybody probably remembers the image of kids running with their hands on their heads. After a while the families requested the tv stations to stop playing that or to limit it as much as possible, and to a large extent they did. They didn't -- they weren't quite aware of the retraumatizing. There were weird things because there were so many helicopters circling for so long, lots of the kids associated just the sound of helicopters with danger and fear and that sound would send off a panic reflex. Some of it was just simple things that the local media can learn to stop retraumatizing people. But hopefully we in the media can -- they understand we want to interview people, we want to understand, and lots of them do want to talk and a lot of them will want to talk typically, and I'm sort of at a loss here because I don't know how to put this. Most media are pretty respectful about that. There are certain shows and certain reporters who are constantly going beyond the barriers and kind of hounding them, surrounding their houses so you can't even get down the street, and that really makes it hard for them. Some of them describe to me sort of a siege mentality they felt for weeks after when they were surrounded, and I would urge my colleagues in the media to think twice and three times about that kind of stuff. 
>> Dave, as you mention, there is no satisfying motive when these things happen. There is nothing to sort of make sense of this. I imagine in the case of newtown, that will be even more acute as you can't put any kind of explanation to a monster who shoots 20 children. What advice would you give to grieving parents and people in that community about trying to sort of get to the bottom of what happened and get inside a killer's head as they try to piece this all together and find ways to sort of make sense of this and move on? 

[00:53:56]


>> Well, I would say that often we can understand quite a bit about it. We can't always know -- we can't ever know the whole story, but most of the time we do end up with a pretty good idea of what was driving them, and there usually are answers out there, but we have to sort of go past the easy things. I will tell you there are three patterns of three different types of killers. There's no one profile but the three types are rarely a sadistic psychopath, more frequently but still relatively rare are people who are really psychotic is the term but really deeply mentally ill, usually schizophrenic. The most common are angry depressives. We're talking suicidally depressed. Obously there's a lot more to it than just depression. That's not an explanation. But I also don't think that we should throw our hands up and say, ohhing we can never understand, there is no understanding because the hard fact is every killer does do it for a reason. They had motives in their own brain and we can usually understand quite a bit. 
>> I'm sure we can try and understand. I don't know that those understandings are going to be satisfying to victims but -- 
>> exactly. 
>> Thanks very much. 
>> Let's bring in nbc news analyst clint van zandt. What kind of monster targets 20 children in a classroom? 
>> Well, you know, that's an interesting term. We're going to find out in the near future what drove this man, whether he was 20 or 24 years old, what was going on. We're going to find out that there were events in his life, whether as your last guest suggested that this was an individual who was depressed, perhaps clinically depressed. There's going to be anger, frustration, rage, but realize that this is someone who allegedly killed his own mother. If you're capable of committing that horrific act, the next most horrific act may be right alongside of it is to take the life of innocent children. This shooter today violated every taboo that we know of almost in mankind as far as a murderous act. He's done it today. My fear when we deal with someone like this, just like when nbc had to deal with cho, the shooter at virginia tech in 2007 and make a decision whether to run the videos that the shooter had sent to nbc prior to him taking those actions, do we give too much attention. Right now the shooter, even if the grave, in his mind believes that the country is talking about him, perhaps the president is talking about him, and what bothers me is the potential of individuals sitting on the edge of that emotional abyss ready to jump off and now they have yet one more model. We know people have modeled themselves after the columbine shooters. We don't want someone modeling themselves after the connecticut shooter. 

[00:57:00]


>> Clint, I know a lot of people use the sort of cliche of thinking well, this person snapped and did this. Is that really what it is or is it more of a long, slow build to this moment? 
>> I really don't believe in snapping. In the hundreds of situations, be it workplace violence or mass murders like this, there's always what we call psychological leakage. There's always text messages, e-mails, conversations with friends, visits to doctors, challenges with your parents or with your girlfriend or with your roommates or you're fired from a job. There's always multiple indicators. The challenge is that we don't pay attention to them. We dismiss them. The proverbial we don't have all the pieces of the puzzle to get -- to put together to understand the full picture of that individual, but as a society, we are still our brothers' and sisters keeper, and if we start to see these sign if we start to see someone not only experiencing mental illness but talking about violence as a means of conflict resolution, somebody needs to raise a flag, somebody needs to try to get that person help before we have to attend these mass burials like we're going to within the next week. 
>> And how do you know when that line is crossed where someone is not just depressed but actually potentially a threat to themselves and to others? 
>> Part of it is that we really don't have a litmus test. We don't have a form that we can have somebody fill out and we look at the answers and say, okay, five out of the ten questions they answered yes, so that means they have the potential of being a mass murderer. We don't have the ability to do that, but what we do have the ability is to see when someone is in distress, someone is depressed, or someone appears to be in need, we have to be able to flag those and as a community we have to take on that responsibility to either share that information with someone else in authority or do something about it. We are going to find whether it's buying guns, ammunition, discussing fighting with his parents, there are going to be those indicators there, but it appears at this point we know of no one who acted who came forward who tried to stop this rrible act that we saw today. 

[00:59:22]


>> All right. Clint van zandt, thank you very much. That does it for "the cycle." If you have kids, hug them extra tight when you go home. Martin bashir, it's yours. 
>> Toure, thank you. And we continue with this devastating breaking news. This hour, another horrific mass shooting. This one inside the sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. A grim new addition to the litany of lives lost in this country to mass gun violence. This time the majority of the victims were children. The death toll at the school has just been updated by connecticut

E'a bright side. We're grasping. We're grasping. 
>> You know what? I bet they get things done. After a fight, I bet they sit there and pass bills. Just like tip o'neal. 
>> If it's way too earlier, it's "morning joe," thank you so much for watching this week, we greatly appreciate it. Chuck and the daily rundown starts right now. 
>>> Steam dried, the u.N. Ambassador pulls her name from consideration to be secretary of state, telling president obama she doesn't want to be a distraction in telling nbc exclusively what she thinks about the politics of her critics. 
>>> Cleanup on aisle 2013. Just 18 shopping days left until the country dives over the fiscal cliff. Are there any deals left to be had? THERE'S A BARGAIN BID OF PLAN Bs That are starting to overflow on the on the senator side of capitol hill. 
>>> And a senior gets ready to ride over the fiscal cliff after decades in washington. Find out what he thinks about changing the senate's rules and working with five presidents. He's the latest in our senate interviews. I'm chuck todd. Susan rice will not be the next secretary of interstate, even after the prospect of her being the next secretary of state. Susan rice announcing her decision yesterday to nbc's brian williams. 
>> I didn't want to see confirmation process that was very prolonged, very politicized, very distracting and very disruptive. Because there are so many things we need to get done as a country. 

[00:02:09]


>> Were you set up? Were you a victim of circumstance? Bad data, bad information? 
>> I'm not a victim, I wasn't set up. You know, brian, I think it's best. I know who I am. I see myself on the television screen in all my different outfits. We're in a sad place, frankly when national security, national security officials, who are sitting in their jobs, serving the american people every day, and potential candidates for secretary of state get caught up in a political vortex. 
>> Well, the president signaled strong support for rice throughout this process. The white house was always divided about her nomination. Some advisors believe the political pric confirmation battle would be too high. So many fights on capitol hill including the fiscal cliff, was another protracted battle on a confirmation, especially when you liked your idea of secretary of state. And the secretary of state tried to steer -- there was also real differences in foreign policy philosophy between the two candidates, something that none of us have made as clear as we probably should have. Rice made the case for humanitarian action in libya, has always been more of an interventionist will. She's been criticized for downplaying -- she was using with cia written talking points that turned out to be wrong. Yesterday she explained those comments yet again. 
>> Secretary clinton had originally been asked by most of the networks to go on. She had had an incredibly grueling week dealing with the protests around the middle east and north africa. I was asked, I was willing to do so. It wasn't what I had planned for that weekend originally. But I don't regret doing that, brian. 

[00:04:17]


>> There was also a daily trickle of negative story on rice's investments, vetting her past roles in the government, and the campaign that the white house never really deftd her against. 20% view her positively, 24% negatively. In a "washington post" op-ed this morning. Rice writes this, in recent weeks new lines of attack have been raised to mall line my character and my career even before I was nominated for any new position. A steady drip of manufactured charges presented a -- rice isn't going anywhere, and by hangeding this gracefully, she may re-emerge when another job comes up. Which is not going to be america's top diplomat. 
>> Did you want the job? 
>> I would have been very honored to serve in that job, just as I'm delighted to do what time doing. But yes, sure, how can you not want to, in my field, serve at the highest possible level? 
>> Thursday night, on our nbc affiliate in sacramento, kcra, the president praised rice, but also seemed ready to move on. 
>> Susan is going to continue to be an outstanding u.S. Ambassador to the united nations. I hadn't made a decision about who would be my next secretary of state. There's no doubt that susan was qualified. There are other people who are qualified as well. 
>> The white house has made it clear that other people means john kerry. There were two the people on the list, two minus one is one. Kerry who has been very quiet throh this process, released a statement calling rice a, quote, dedicated public servant, saying I have defended her publicly and I wouldn't hesate to do that because I know her service and i know her commitment then he ducked reporters last night. 

[00:06:22]


>> I'm going to continue to do my work. 
>> But elsewhere on the hill, democrats were not exactly avoiding confrontation. The majority leader harry reid said this in a statement, quote, the politically motivated attacks on her character by some of my republican colleagues were shameful. Their behavior was a disgrace to bipartisan -- otherwise distinguished records on national security. Of course harry reid was a pretty vocal critical of george w. Bush's foreign policy and some folks there back in the day, for what its worth. But in statements, after the rice announcement, senators McCAIN AND GRAHAM MADE IT CLEAR That though they, quote, respected ambassador rice's decision, they had no intention of dropping the benghazi fight. 
>> We're not going to let this go, how could for seven hours nobody come to the aid of the people in the attack. Where was the president? 
>> Which of course always should have been the focus of the benghazi story, rice's decision presents the president with a cabinet that looks like an america problem. The cabinet in the -- looking like a leading candidate for the secretary of defense. If kerry is a shoe in, does that change the calculus four hagel? Or for white house chief of staff, kevin liu. Former advisors under secretary clinton re-emerge as top candidates for treasury. If kerry ends up being a nominee for secretary of state, there would be a challenge for his senate seat. Here's senator scott brown, in his farewell speech on the senate floor which oh, by the way happened to be yesterday. 
>> Defeat is temporary, depending on what happens and where we go, all of us, we may obviously meet again. 

[00:08:27]


>> There you go. After rice's announcement yesterday, the massachusetts democratic party tweeted this. Bring it on. In case you're wondering, the way the math works, assuming john kerry's resigned the senate seat after he's confirmed and that happens around january 20th, 21st. We're looking at a mid to late june special election in massachusetts. Finally, another day, another rhetorical standoff if you will between president obama and house speaker john boehner as the country moves another day closer to tumbling off this fiscal cliff. Boehner met with the president for 50 minutes in the oval office yesterday evening. It was as much about how to negotiate as what to negotiation. That's what the standoff is over, they don't even know how to trade proposals. Boehner was invited to the white house yesterday and you could tell as he whipped out a paul ryan style chart. 
>> Here we are at the 11th hour, and the president still isn't serious about dealing with this issue right here. It's this issue. Spending. 
>> But as the day wore on and the president knew he was going to get a face to face with gainer, he put on a happier face with the republicans. 
>> I remain cautiously optimistic, but I think what's most important is that members of congress hear from their constituencies. 
>> After the white house meeting, the two sides are back to releasing the statement statement, which might be a sign of good things to come, by saying the meeting was frank and as we have been saying for some time now, the lines of communication remain open. The president was asked about a so-called communication breakdown. 
>> Is there an issue of rest when it comes to negotiation? 

[00:10:28]


>> My sense is it's less of an issue of trust, I think it has more to do with politics, i think the idea of not raising taxes has become sort of a religion for a lot of members of the republican party. 
>> Aides say the speaker is heading home to ohio for the weekend, hardly a great sign. But they add, ohio is both self-phone service and airports. So if the president wants to talk or meet, it won't be a problem at all. A lot of senators are starting to get antsy, some of the remote possibilities for the cliff are one doing nothing and actually going off of it and two, doing something big. I think we're looking at a patch work punt if you will and it continuings to be the most likely outcome. 
>>> Up next, the capitol hill cliffhanger with two guys who know the key players and maybe now will speak more frequently. 
>>> Plus south carolina governor nikki haley, she's having a lot of fun with this senate opening she's got here. She's doing her due diligence before replacing jim demint. 
>>> First a look ahead at the president's schedule. Kind of a quiet day, he does have a meeting with susan rice this afternoon. All of it, though, off camera. No plans on the cliff front.

>>> Okay. 18 days now, maybe we'll start on the hourly count down clock. It depends on how they fashion the deal of whether we're going to have a budget cliff. In 2009, congress didn't pass the health care overhaul until christmas eve. In 2010, the $858 billion worth of tax cuts and stimulus spending, that got passed on DECEMBER 16th, RELATIVELY EARLY. And the social security tax cut didn't get passed until the day before christmas. Welcome to both of you. All right, I want to try to -- yesterday's meeting seemed, brad, I want to start with you, was about the fact that the exchange of offer as this week didn't go well. Do we still have a case where it's like the old movie cool hand luke, what we have here is a failure to communicate. They don't know how to communicate with each other? 

[00:16:32]


>> I don't think so, bob woodward wrote an entire book about how president obama doesn't know how to communicate with the hill. If you look at what's happening, during the election, republicans ran on the ryan budget, which is no new revenue. Democrats won the election, and the speaker said $800 billion in revenue. So what did president obama do to respond to thata he moved the revenue higher. So if you keep moving those goal posts, of course you're not going to have a willing partner on the other side, republicans are negotiating with themselves at this point. 
>> On the issue of the tax rate, it seems as if democrats want to hear john boehner say uncle, okay, they're going to go up, rather than just assume that boehner's going to agree with it, he just can't say it publicly. That's the issue here, boehner doesn't want to ever say it publicly. 
>> I keep on hearing this and for the life of me I can't figure out why politics has become patty cake and everything has to hear the right word from the other. As brad just suggested, the president won and especially after the debacle that was at a debt limit where the republicans took the debate to the hilt and threatened the full faith and credit of the united states, the president's made it very clear both pubcly an privately, he's not going to take a bad deal this time so it's up tohe republicans to take a step forward. 
>> Brad, it seems one of the problems here for -- in sort of the lack of communications is that boehner wants something in return for agreeing to raising tax rates and the white house is saying, huh-uh, we won that argument. If you want -- we'll give you something in return, say, for a debt ceiling. 
>> The president can't campaign on a balanced approach to debt reduction, a balanced approach. So you have a situation here where republicans are being asked to do something they think is bad for the country, that's raising tax rates, we don't believe it's good, that's why we're opposed to it. Well, the president won, the president is insisting on it. Where is the president's 5 to 1, 3 to 1, 2 to 1 cuts to tax increases r you willing to raise the medicare age? 

[00:18:59]


>> First of all it takes two to tango and I rarely if ever agree with "the washington post." And president's made very clear -- 
>> if you don't agree with them who does? 
>> I think it's kind of predictable editorial page. 
>> And the other thing is that the president's made it very clear that, once the republicans settle on a series of revenues, he's prepared to have a very serious talk about entitlement. 
>> Isn't it fair to say that neither side wants to own the plan that will be -- somebody will find any plan on entitlement reform unpopular. So the president doesn't want to write it, speaker boehner doesn't want to write it, is that fair? 
>> Republicans keep calling on cuts in entitlement reform. But again, everyone recognizes changes have to be made, but like I said, it takes two to tango. 
>> If you want republicans to talk got raising rates, which seems to be an insisting point here. 
>> But shouldn't speaker boehner put it aper. 
>> We passed a budget that's been put down on paper. The senate still has it. 
>> It's not like boehner's putting that on the table. I don't think the president would accept that, I'm sure speaker boehner would accept that if the president's hoping to. 
>> Very quick before I go, the 
-- unloaded on -- this relationship between harry reid AND john McCain, is it as bad as it looks? 
>> They have found times to work together in the past, but in this day and age, they have a hard time agreeing. 
>> Was harry reid itching for a fight? 
>> I haven't talked to him, i didn't have a chance to talk to him about it, but I'm pretty confident, not only he was looking forward to it and so was the rest of the democratic caucus, the nomination process is broken, something's got to change and I thought that would have been the way to go. 

[00:21:15]


>> I think we're going to have you back, we got 18 days, hopefully it's not on christmas. 
>> Come on. You know what? We're all going to go negative on everybody, if they ruin everybody's holiday plans. It's a long campaign. 
>>> Up next, president obama weighs in on the legalization of marijuana. 
>>> Plus which governor may want to keep the job long enough to challenge the state's term limit laws. And which senator defeated the only senator to be the first one to set foot on the moon? The answer and more coming up on the daily rundown. >> ?????? ?????? ?????? 
[ Male Announcer ] CAMPBELL'S GREEN BEAN Casserole. It's amazing what soup can do rash... Very sore looking kinda blistery. Like somebody had set a bag of hot charcoal on my neck. I was a firefighter for 24 years. But, I have never encountered such a burning sensation until I had the shingles. I remember it well. I was in the back yard doing yard work. I had this irritation going on in my lower neck. I changed shirts because I thought there was something in the collar of the shirt irritating my neck. And I couldn't figure out what was going on. I had no idea it came from chickenpox. I always thought shingles was associated with people... A lot older than myself. I can tell you from experience, it is bad.

>> We are preparing for the neighboring battling into turkey. Along with the troops necessary to man those batteries so that we can help turkey have the kind of missile defense it may very well need in dealing with threats that come out of syria. 
>> Have to wonder if this is also a response on the the chemical weapons fears that u.S. Intelligence has discovered. 
>>> Meanwhile arizona's republican governor anne brewer says she may seek another term even though the state constitution says her current term should be her last. Brewer inherited the office from janet napolitano, she was elected in 2010 to her current term which is up in 2014.

It's not the democrat's first time in the political ring, he ran for congress in 2010 against republican brett guthrie and lost by 25 points. 
>>> President obama is weighing in on the marijuana debate after colorado and washington voted to legalize it last month. He said even though the federal government has the power to enforce drugs laws in those states, they probably won't. 
>> It does not make sense in a prioritization point of view to focus on rreational drug users in a state that has already said that under state law it's legal. 
>>> Governor -- stephen colbert called on republican viewers to support haley. Among the findings that kolber attended a state trade conference as a representative of iran. That he didn't know the state amphibian was the spottal sal man manneder and he changed the pronunciation of his last name to appeal to republican elites. 
>>> Jim demint saying he believes nicky haley will announce his replacement today. 
>>> Our series of interviews with retired senators roll on. My conversation with jeff binghamton about why he wants to change the senate's rules and his own changing views on issues LIKE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. You just have to eat it as part of your heart healthy diet. Step 1. Eat the soup. All those veggies and beans, that's what may help lower your cholesterol and -- Well that's easy 
[ Male Announcer ] Progresso. You gotta taste this soup. ???????????????????????????????????????????????????? this? Oh, let me guess -- more washington gridlock. No, it's worse -- look, our taxes are about to go up. Not the taxes on our dividends though, right? That's a big part of our retirement. Oh, no, it's dividends, too. The rate on our dividends would more than double. But we depend on our dividends to help pay our bills. We worked hard to save. Well, the president and congress have got to work together to stop this dividend tax hike. Before it's too late. 

[00:31:25]


>>> Well, it's not just a fiscal cliff that looms at the end of the year. A number of washington veterans are packing up their offices and they're not going to be back in january. 10 senators, six democrats, three republicans and an independent, including joe lieberman are retiring or were defeated. And of course there's south carolina senator jim demint, he's resigning his seat. This week a handful of those senators gave their final speech on the senator floor, here's a list taste. 
>> When I started here in the senate a blackberry was a fruit. 
>> I was elected on the slogan in 1986 of yes we can. And somebody else used that slogan a few years later. 
>> Thank you for taking a chance on me, in that first election 24 years ago and renewing my contract three more times. 
>> By saying that I so APPRECIATE barbara McCulsky and john cornyn introducing the bill to name is homemaker ira for me. It will mean so much to me because I know it will help women long after I leave. 
>> Too often in recent years, members of congress have locked themselves into a slate of inflexible positions. Many of which have no hope of being implemented in a divided government. And some of these positions have been further calcified by pledges signed for political purposes. 
>> I worry we are losing the art of legislating, and when the history of this chapter in the senatwritten, we don't want it to conclude that it was here that it became an antiquated practice. 

[00:33:26]


>> Today the spotlight on a man who has spent nearly 30 years in the senate, but he's not somebody who seeks the spotlight very often. New mexico's democrat jeff binghamton who has built a reputation among his colleagues as a quiet workhorse. I asked him if the senate by its very nature forces people over time to become more politically pragmatic. 
>> Well, I think that that's happen to folks who came in when I did, like 30 years ago. But frankly I think it's more difficult for members to be flexible in their views coming into the senate today. There's so many litmus tests that you have to go through to get nominated and get elected that particularly on the republican side, I think there's a real effort to pin you down as to where you're going to be on very major issues that are facing the country. 
>> You have worked with five presidents now, if I get it right, you've served under five president, reagan, bush, clinton, bush, obama. Give me some of the pros and cons of how each of them dealt with the senate. Start with reagan, what do you think he did right and what could he have done better? 
>> Of course I had many disagreements with president reagan. We were running when I came into the senate very large deficits. 
>> Right now that would be the fiscal cliff solution. 
>> At the time, they were somewhat unprecedented for the period before that. And so we struggled with that throughout his presidency, trying to figure out how to get enough revenue, and how to control costs and that was struggle. I think president george h.W. Bush began to solve some of that problem by agreeing, finally, to a deficit reduction effort that congress essentially urged and forced him to accede to, which he did. President clinton took the next step and really made some major changes, both on the revenue side and the spending side and got the country on a sound fiscal footing, at least in my view. And of course, president bush's term, the main thing he's remembered for in addition to the tax cuts are the wars that we got into and I supported the effort to go into afghanistan, i didn't support the effort to go into iraq. President obama inherited a very adverse economic situation and given the hand he was dealt, i think he's done well in trying to get the country up on its feet again. 

[00:36:21]


>> Is there truth to this idea of the good old days of the senate? 
>> I think there's some truth in it. I think the senate was a better functioning place, certainly, when I arrived here than it is today. There's no doubt about that. 
>> Do you, I know senator reid's thinking about changing some of the filibuster rules. 
>> Uh-huh. 
>> And it seems to me that there's some democratic unanimity on this. You have been on all sides of this, but over to the majority, changing in is that rules, are you in favor of it? 
>> I'm all in favor of changing the senate rules, the ability to filibuster is currently being abused. 
>> It's too easyfilibuster. 
>> You should still have it, right? 
>> It's now a way to disrupt routine business in the senate. There are all kinds of things, we vote district court nominees out of the judiciary committee unanimously and we can't get them up for a vote on the senate floor, because someone says, no, no, we got to have 60 votes or we won't let you do it. 
>> Why do you think that new mexico went into seven out of ten of the last presidential elections has moved to the right. What in your observation has happened to the republican party? 
>> I don't think it's peculiar to new mexico. I do think that the republican party has moved very much to the right in it's views on some of these significant issues, on immigration, that's a -- it's not that it's a core issue for a lot of the hispanic voters in our state, but it's an indication of where the party is and whether the party is working on or willing to step up and realistically address real issues. You know the idea that we're going to send 12 million people home is just ludicrous to anybody in my state. 

[00:38:33]


>> Any votes you would take back? I'm sure there are a few you might say that you don't remember. But is there one or two votes you would take back in the senate? 
>> I think the supreme courts announced last week they're going to consider the constitutionality of the defense of marriage act. 
>> You voted for it? 
>> I voted for it. 
>> You wish you didn't? 
>> I think the two circuit courts that have determined that it's not constitutional, are probably right. That's my judgment today. 
>> Is that just something that you think culturally the country has to be ahead of the lawmakers on this? 
>> I think the country is ahead of the lawmakers on this. And I don't know what the supreme court will do, but it will not surprise me if they affirm -- 
>> you hope what they affirm what the lower court said? 
>> I think it's likely that they will. And, you know, that's one of those acts that probably should not have been enacted. 
>> You guys did it for, at the time, it felt like there was a little bit of president clinton worrying about re-electionsome. 
>> Yeah, president clinton supported it and I think, frankly it was done without sufficient consideration of all the factors. 
>> Let me try this as a closing question. If you could change one thing about the senate, what would you change? 
>> Well, if I could change one thing about the senate, I would get back to a better working relationship between the democratic and republican leadership. If we could have that -- 
>> is that really a bad place? I mean harry reid and mish McCONNELL STILL CLAIM THAT They're personal friends. 
>> I don't doubt that they're personal friends, I'm just saying that in getting agreement on how to conduct business in the senate, we have great difficulty. And that's -- that together with the abuse of the filibuster rule or the right to filibuster, those need to be fixed. 

[00:40:42]


>> Thank you, sir. 
>> Thanks. 
>>> For the full version of my interview, go to our website, msnbc.Com. We have a couple more exiting senators to talk to. Senator cole, senator nelson, senators luger and brown. Our gaggle will be here next. But you need to know it, who is soup of the day. At least it's a shiny one, shrimp and corn chowder, it's different. I love me some corn chowder. Shrimp in? It I don't know. 
>>> We get to watch our chicken out on facebook. . ...so as you can see, GEICO's customer satisfaction is at 97%. Mmmm tasty. And cut! Very good. People are always asking me how we make these GEICO adverts. So we're taking you behind the scenes. This coffee cup, for example, is computer animated. It's not real. GEICO's customer satisfaction is quite real though. This computer-animated coffee tastes dreadful. GEICO. 15 minutes could save you 15 % or more on car insurance. Someone get me a latte will ya, please? 

[00:44:46]


>>> Daily flash back, it was this day in 2004, when an iraqi journalist threw his shoes at president bush during a press conference in baghdad. 
>>> President obama meeting with susan rice today, 24 hours after she with drew her name from consideration of secretary of state and avoid a bitter confirmation process. A lot of stuff going on on capitol hill. Let's bring in our friday gaggle. Man, you expanded. 
>> I am trying to keep up the job creation statistics. 
>> I want to start with you about this issue of not wanting another fight on capitol hill. This was certainly the cold political calculus that some were making in the white house and the white house said they did not push rice into this, i think there's a lot of truth to that. But the president is a pragmatist on these things. More so than people realize. It was going to be a big fight. 
>> She probably could have gotten confirmed, but only after the president expended a lot of political capital. It would be filibustered by republicans, they would need 60 votes, which they could presumably get because there would be 65 seats in the next among. But, look, the president wants to deal with immigration in the next term. We don't know where they're going on the fiscal cliff, do we really want another major knockdown, dragout fight? 
>> One of the unintended consequences of this is that suddenly the three guys that are the leading candidates for the big job are all white men. 
>> I noticed. 
>> This is an election the last time I checked that president obama owed that he had a very diverse group of people supporting hiss campaign. Is that something that the white house needs to take notice on? 

[00:46:54]


>> What really bothers me is that the women's groups, the civil rights groups, we should have stood up more. 
>> Are you surprised that she was getting environmental groups going after her. And we know environmental groups are very close to john kerry, and if nothing else, they thought they were being helpful to kerry when susan rice was down. 
>> She got voted out of this, and we should have stood up and said, are you kidding me? She's not at fall. And I think it sounded sexist. 
>> At this point, white men at the state department is diversity. 
>> Warren christopher is the last white male secretary of state. 
>> I think susan rice avoided two additional problems here, if she had withdrawn and they picked somebody else, it would have looked like weakness on her part. The other thing is they don't want, I think, to extend the benghazi story and have a lot of questions. And the republicans now don't have a convenient hook to keep that conversation going. 
>> Although, we do have the hearings next week. 
>> Yeah, and they're bringing hillary up. 
>> But it's not the same as if you had a nomination fight where there's an actual vote going to take place at stake. 
>> This is largely a made up issue, this is crazy. 
>> Let's talk about cliff and where we are and yesterday's meeting with the president and speaker boehner, which from what I understand was as much about trying to figure out how do we negotiate versus what we negotiate. Senate leaders are getting antsy. 
>> They are, because no one really knows what's going on, other than the fact that it's not going very well. 
>> They don't like being 100 elect pundits. That's what they are, they're soft of observers and it's making them nuts. 
>> Even in the closed doors on the republican side and the democratic side. They're not getting much information. Gene spurring met with the republicans and the democrats, and they didn't have any idea where they were going. 

[00:49:00]


>> So what is the political problem that the president could face if we -- if no deem is had or if a really sort of -- we know the republicans are in bad shape here politically with the country and I had one say, well, we can't get much lower. The president could get dragged down with them. And that's what happened in debt ceiling. 
>> I tell you what, this is a manufactured problem. He's standin up for the right fights. I think the really important thing is for the democrats to take this message to, these people want to jeopardize the economy, these people want to jeopardize the credit rating of the greatest company in the world? 
>> Do you think the debt ceiling fight is the right one to hold? Do you think democrats are potentially setting tmselves up for a bad political fight? 
>> In 2009, they got spending cut, they got tax increases. They think they won. 
>> If they lost that public opinion, they lost that fight. They may have won -- 
>> they don't believe and they're right not to believe that any of the elections were lost over that fight. 
>> Well, that is a fair point. Stickround, I want to talk about bobby jindal day in the "wall street journal." We asked which silting senator defeated the only senator to ever set foot on the moon. We're like jeopardy, we're giving you a hint. The answer is jeff binghamton. He defeated jeff smith back in 1992. Repair Restore Revive Rejuvenate Rebuild Rebuild Rebuild 

[00:53:58]


>>> Let's bring back our gaggle. Selinda, I'm going to read you this read and you -- support last month for selling oral contraceptives without a prescription in the united states. That is the lead paragraph by the republican bobby jindal. 
>> An amazing move for the presidency, I would think. 
>> He makes a free market argument for it saying it actually costs more money, the idea that it's a prescription drug companies, it would actually become more competitive, bring down the cost of contraceptives, basically arguing you ought to bring this out of the beating the daylights out of the president. 
>> If you want to increase access to birth control without forcing people to cover things that might violate their consciences. I think it's a very clever argument. 
>> I do too. But I'm trying to figure out how this plays out in south carolina and how it plays out in the iowa caucuses. Nobody counts him out as a liberal. He's a conservative. 
>> I think it goes to show that a lot of republicans don't want to be arguing these social issues right now, they feel like they're on much stronger ground when they're talking about economics and fiscal issues and taxes. You don't hear the social argumenting coming out of republicans these days because they're worried democrats are bark them for it. 
>> These guys, they have had a pretty smart clever month for the 2016ers. Shameless plugs. 
>> My colleague and I did a story about how democrats in the house and senate are resistant to talk about medicare custs, except for medicare means testing which certainly is not enough for republicans. 

[00:56:11]


>> The family foundation just released a study on how women make mistakes and how it's harder to come back from them and how women establish their qualify cases. 
>> Margaret carlson and I over at bloomberg view are going to be talking about jim moran, and congressmen behaving badly. That will be up in just about an hour or so. 
>> No announcement for south carolina senate today, take that, jim demint. That's it for this edition of the daily rundown. Coming up next, chris jansing. Bye-bye. ?????? ?????? announcing the all-new 2013 malibu from chevrolet. ?????? ?????? with a remarkable new interior featuring the available chevrolet mylink infotainment system. This is where sophisticated styling begins. And where it ends? That's up to you. It's here -- the greatest malibu ever. ?????? ?????? from Is bigger than we think ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold? There's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies.

>> If you said yes, one point. No, zero points.

>> Warning sign, big x's. Here's why this is so important. 
>> Plus, if you're in pain -- 
>> these become clues to me. 
>> Signs you should never ignore next. 
[Cheers and applause] 
dr. Oz: All right, let me ask you this, how healthy are you? Today you'll get the answer by taking one simple quiz. All you need to do is answer yes or no to 20 easy questions. If have been watching the show, you're probably a lot healthier then you think. This entire audience has taken the quiz and everyone at home can also take it. Grab a pen and piece of paper. Let's get right to it. Question number one, are you ready? Pads out. Take a look at it. Oh, I love thi get ready. 
[Laughter] question number one, do you take a multivitamin or omega 3 supplements every day? If you answered yes, one point. You said no, zero points. All of the questions just like that, simple. Ideally for someone take both. Omega 3 for brain and heart health. I wish we got all of the nutrients from food but we don't so multivitamins help us for functioning. Question number two, have you gained less than three pounds this year? If you said yes, give yourself a point. If no, no points. Metabolism slows as you age. You know this. Gaining less than three pounds could be a sign you're not letting your metabolism, which is slowing slow you down. Metabolism is not taking over. Diet on track. You' doing just fine. Question number three, I love this one -- you take less than three pain relievers a week? Yes, gets a point. No is zero points. Here's why this is so important, you need more than three painkillers a week for unexplained aches and pains over your body may be a sign something more serious is going on. Besides the fact it can cause damage to your liver and kidney, what I worry about it means you're cover up things in your body, not the root issues. That's why this is important point on our quiz. Veronica, how are you doing so far? 

[00:02:48]


>> I'm good, how are you? 
Dr. Oz: I'm doing well. 
>> Two points so far. 
Dr. Oz: That's pretty well. How about you?S0 
>> two points. 
Dr. Oz: You're taking more than three pills? 
>> Yes. It depends what you call pain relief. 
Dr. Oz: Go ahead. 
>> Something a little to help you sleep. 
Dr. Oz: You knot in that category. 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: The reason I pick on these things if you need something, make sure you need it. Painkillers to me are often things we could or could not take. Those are the questions I'm focusing in on. Question number four, you eat read meat, look over here because I have it up, less than three times per week? If you said yes, give yourself a point. If you said no, zero points. Why do I pick on this? Red meat is high in saturated fat. Travels with a lot of stuff not so good for you. Too much fat and cholesterol in your diet can be bad for your heart, especially if it affect what's you have in your blood and linked to shorter life expectancy if you eat too much red meat. Question number five this,s comes fromfriend of mine. Dallas raines from our local affiliate abc 7 in los angeles. Take a look. 
>> Hi, dr. Oz. All the way from sunny, california. Here's our next question -- do you go outside up to 15 minutes a day without sunscreen? If you answered yes, give yourself one point. If you said no, it's a big, fat zero. 
Dr. Oz: Dallas said it right. Now, his last name is rains. Pretty funny name for weatherman, especially in los angeles who doesn't have much of it. The point is extra, your skin needs vitamin d. You get it from sun exposure. Your body healthier and brain stronger and bones strong as well. Question number six -- you have breakfast within two hours of waking up. You talked about this a lot. Hope you all get this right. You said yes, one point. No, zero points. Timing is so important on this and critical to me because it keeps those fat-burning hormones in check when you have breakfast early in the day. Especially a lot of protein. Science is clear. If you do this, ton of easier time sticking to diet and a lot less likely to eat later on. And question number seven -- do you get me time for at least five minutes a day? Think about this for a second. You say yes, that's worth a point. You say no, it's zero points. Give yourself a little bit of me time, it takes you away from the stresses of everyday life. Allows you to relax, which helps lower stress hormones. Attacks us and recharge and sprepts burning out so many folks think are happening in their life. Let's talk about family conflicts. Question number eight has to do with how you resolve conflicts before you go to bed. If you said yes because you do resolve them before you go to bed, then you get a point. If you say no, I don't resolve family conflicts before I go to bed, that's a problem. You don't get any points for that. Here's the big story, don't want you all going to bed after you had a fight without resolve it. Other thngs I would rather you be doing in your bed worrying about what you're fighting about. Thraze medical reason why you should never go to bed angry. If you go to bed angry, your brain could have difficulty calming down your body. So that transition of sleep sent so smooth as it needs to be. Talk stuff out before you go to bed. All right. Doing ok so far, everybody? 

[00:06:07]


>> Yes. 
>> Keeping up. Good. Question number nine -- do you know at least four numbers by heart? If you do, give yourself a point. If no, no points for you. Andrea, having a good time over there? 
>> Yes. 
>> You know more than four numbers by snart 
>> I'm pretty old school. Hardly ever use auto dial on my cell phone. 
>> What's your own number? I'm kidding! 
[Laughter] perfect stranger. Come on. 
>> I never dial my house. 
>> A lot of us use the send button, right. Challenging your brain to recall and store numbers will help your brain stay young and keep it staying healthy as well. Dial the number every once in a while instead of pressing send. Keep that in mind four of the big numbers, ten big-digit numbers or friends may commonly be calling off the top of your head. Question number ten, this comes via our resident sex expert dr. Laura berman in chicago. Watch this. 
>> When it comes to your sex life, here's what I want to ask every woman -- are you having sex more than two times a week? 
Dr. Oz: Sex more than two times a week. If you said yes, you get a point. If you said no, no points. National average for sex in america is 1.2 times per week. I can't tell you how important this is. We're so confident just being comfortable in where we are. I should point out at one point average for the country, married couples have a lot more sex then single couples. So -- 
[applause] yes, thank you. I'm in that category too. If you average it together, 1.2. Let's rod it up. More than two, that's the goal for all of us. Question number 11 -- open your shades in the morning? Seems innocuous, doesn't it. Opening shades in the morning. If you do it, earn yourself one point. If you don't, don't give yourself any points. Here's why it's so important. Natural light helps vet your body clock to start the day with full energy. Experts say even on a cloudy day, open the shades will help give you energy you need in your life. It's reset your rhythm and believe it or not, you will go to bed better at night if you open shades in the morning because your entire rhythm will shift, not just morning but throughout the rest of the day. Something you can all do, right? If you haven't done it yet, start doing it. Add up your points, much more to go. Up next -- how many times a week do you poop? You knew that was coming. How many cups of coffee do you have a day. Quiz continues. What your score means for your health. Don't miss it. Do you skip bread and butter when eating out? If you answered yes, give yourself one point. If your answer was no, zero points. Reaching for the bread guarantees you will take in up to 300 calories before your meal. So ask your server to skip it. Do you know where all of your moles are? If you answered yes, give yourself one point. If your answer is no, you get zero. Check at least once a month for any changes in moles and freckles and remember your back, top of your ears and scalp. Up next -- 

[00:09:23]


>> it's so important to sleep seven hours a night.

[00:12:14]


Dr. Oz: Do you season your food with spices other then salt? If you answer yes, give yourself a point. If your answer is no, zero points. Spices like cumin, oregano and curry not only pack flav are but healthy, healing qualities. Do you take the stairs instead of elevator when possible? If you answered yes, give yourself one point. If you answer was no, you get zero points. Choosing stairs over elevator is an easy way to sneak exercise into your day. Studies have found even two flights of stairs every day can help you lose up to six pounds a year. 
[Applause] and we are up to question number 16 in our healthy are you quiz. I'm here with lori, nicole and sandy, finishing up the quiz with everyone at home. Are you doing ok so far? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Don't brag yet. A couple more questions. Question 16, have you had your caffeinated drink before 3:00 p.M.? If you do, a point. If you don't, zero points. How did you do on that one, lori? 
>> I have to admit, I gave myself a zero. Every now and then I will have a soda with dinner. But it doesn't keep me up so i don't consider it a problem. But I know it can be. 
Dr. Oz: A lot of my friends who have caffeine in the early evening say the same thing, , it doesn't keep them up but i question them a little bit. When I push them, they acknowledge every once in a while have disrupted sleep patterns. It's so important to sleep seven hours a night. I didn't ask that question directly and ott quiz because i know you all know that. I want to get at it from other ways and being thoughtful about caffeine a big deal. Next question number 17, gastroenterologist dr. Ra sheeny. Take a look. 
>> We all know how important regular poop is to your health. Here's the next question -- do you have a perfect s-shape poop at leasthree times a week? If you answered yes, give yourself a point. If no, zero points. 
Dr. Oz: You all knew I would never do a quiz without asking about s-shaped poop. You knew it was coming. Nicole, let mem barse you. What shape is your poop? 

[00:14:15]


>> Today regular. And I -- don't know about the shape. I don't know if it's s shaped but regular and every day and good size. 
Dr. Oz: Is it a c, w? 
[Laughter] 
>> I don't know. Maybe more of an l? 
>> L,ly take an l. If it's close to s shaped, if it makes a letter in the alphabet and noes a period, I'm happy about it. The reason, of course, some people have l-shaped or s-shaped. What shape is yours? 
>> I'm not sure. 
Dr. Oz: Not sure. I know you look. What shape is it when you look? 
>> Now and then. Not sure. 
Dr. Oz: Not sure. Whatever the shape may be, ideally your intestines were predicted to be, come out nice, smooth piece, that's better. It means you're eting well-balanced diet, tons of fiber and enough water. That's a good sign. Did you get a point for that? 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: Same for everybody else. Question 18 you will love, comes from funny woman lisa lampanelli. 
>> Laughter is like sex. It's fun, it relieves stress and if you do it in the public library, probably get kicked out. Dr. Oz, do you watch tv or movie that's make you laugh at least twice a week? 
Dr. Oz: If you do that, if you watch tv's or movies that make you laugh twice a week, a point. If you don't, no points. Sandy, you watch comedic tv periodically? 
>> Absolutely, you have to. Laughter is something that keeps you upbeat and funny. 
Dr. Oz: Good for you. Question number 19, you know the date of your last menstrual cycle? If you do, get a point. If not, zero points. Anybody, listen carefully, anybody who's post menopausal who has bleeding, warning signs, big x's, pay attention. No ifs, ands or buts. Question 20, do you watch this show at least three times a stpwheek 
[laughter] that's a fix. This is the big question I'm trying to ask, do you educate yourself about your body three times a week? Web, magazine, the show and other forms of media work as well. If you do that and make yourself a bit more are what we're learning about the body, give yourself a point. If you don't, well, you don't get it. Do you watch the show? 

[00:16:27]


>> Absolutely. 
Dr. Oz: Do you do things -- 
>> d.V.R. It -- I have about 18 episodes ready to go. 
Dr. Oz: Show-off. 
[Laughter] again, any type of education about your body will get you point there. It's folks that don't ever pay attention to their bodies i worry about. Wlern new things. As information changes, keep up with it. Are you ready to add your scores? Tape the ones and add them up. Remember every time you said yes, give yourself one point. If you got between 15 and 20 points, you get an "a" in the class and I'm very proud of you. If you have between 11 and 14 points, then you get a "b" in the class. If you have 5 to 10 points, you get a "c." That's an average, by the way. Gentleman's c not so bad. Four or less, we will talk about awe in a second -- you in a second. How did you do? 16. 
Dr. Oz: A, wolf. Congratulations. 
-- Wonderful. Congratulations. 13. 
>> For less then four points, seek immediate medical attention. You don't have to do that, of course. It means you have work to do. Most of the time it's because you're not paying attention to stuff crituckly important. Beautiful voyage we call life that influences our health.

[00:21:19]


Dr. Oz: You look at the smiley faces most of the time to go along with it. The higher the number, the more pain you're in. Chart gos from no pain to the worse possible pain you can be in and it's important because it will help you track your pain and you know if it's getting bet are or worse because the pain will change. Also, easy way to assess how severe your pain is to get better relief. I've got news for you all, first question your doctor will ask you, how is the pain? Is it getting better? What makes it better? All of those questions can be helped if you use this pain scale. Shakira from the audience will join us to help explain how it works. How are you? 
>> Great to meet you. 
Dr. Oz: Nice to meet you as well. What pain do you suffer from? 
>> I suffer from extreme pain in my legs. My right leg. 
Dr. Oz: Always the right leg? 
>> Always the right leg. 
Dr. Oz: On this scale, draw me how much pain do you think you have? 
>> I would say in this range between four and six to a five. 
Dr. Oz: Right about there. Roughly a five. In between the not-so-happy distressing phase. 
>> Right. 
Dr. Oz: I want to compare your leg pain to other pains you may be having to get it on a scale to figure out where it belongs. We're all a little different. If you were to get a paper cut, how much would that hurt you? It doesn't hurt me, dr. Oz. I don't know about you. So I would say probably zero or one. 
Dr. Oz: I have a better question. Have you kids? 
>> I do have kids. 
Dr. Oz: How much kids do they cause you? 
[Laughter] we will keep them safe. Menstrual cramps, how bad do they get? 
>> About four or five moderate. 
Dr. Oz: Same as the calf pain you're having. Finally, what about really bad pain, let's say you broke your foot. Really hurt yourself. 
>> I have never broken a foot or arm or anything like that. But I imagine if I did, it would be excruciating, untolerable. So I would put porse pain possible. 
Dr. Oz: Now with have a spectrum. Understand where you long. From looking at this as a physician, your calf pain is the pain as your menstrual cramps so it's significant. We have to figure out, it's not a ten. Of course, pains that are tens, you will not ignore. But if it's the same token pain is one or two, a lot of mild pains are, you shouldn't ignore those either. Here's the big news here, mild pain can sensitize your body so you will sense any pain more. You may not have noticed this but will you in your lifetime now that I said it. If you have a toothache and stub your toe, your toe hurts more because your body is expecting pain. Gets paranoid towards pain. Pick out where it is, see where it's going. It could be a sign something wrong so never ignore t let's go back to the leg pain. First, you think charlie horse, is that what your guess is? 

[00:24:00]


>> I think it's a charlie horse, definitely. 
Dr. Oz: You think you sleep funny on your leg? That might be causing it. 
>> I don't think I'm sleeping funny on it. I don't know what's causing it. 
Dr. Oz: Let me show you an idea. For anybody who has weird leg pains. Some has to be in the back of your mind. That's why this is so important. I will show you what a deep vein thrombosis looks like. I had one. They hurt. Right in the middle, not the worst but I know it's there. Animation to show this to you. So here's -- this is -- next to me over here so you can see this better. Deep in the muscles are veins. There's the vein. Play lists are like gum and red blood cells that the gummy platettes, that gets caught up in the vein and forms blood clot, deep vein thrombosis. Right smack in the middle of the vein. Because it's there, it can begin to slip away. When it travels, it leeves the veins in the leg, up to the pelvis and ultimately into the lungs and flies up a bit to your lungs and that's called pulmonary embolism. 
>> Wow. 
Dr. Oz: Ever heard of that before? 
>> No. I'm scared. This worries me. It's why we use the pain scale. Come on back. Now we foe when a pull -- know what a pulmonary embolism is, will your leg pain lead to that? 
>> I hope not. 
Dr. Oz: Me too. If your pain is mild, let's say two or three. Instead of four or five, more in the mild area, good chance it's just a cramp. That gives me comfort. If it's something that climbs, instead of normally being two or three goes up to five or six or seven, that means that something is going on. It's not normal. It's not supposed to do that. Then if you squeeze the calf, think if there's a clot in your calf and squeeze muscle and it gets worse, that also to me makes me think about deep vein thrombosis. 
>> Thank you so much, dr. Oz. This is amazing information. 
Dr. Oz: It's useful. If you have all of those things, and you have to go to the hospital or doctor's office and get it checked out quickly. That's how the pain scale will save lives. 

[00:26:02]


>> Great. Thank you very much. Amazing. 
Dr. Oz: How many blame your lower back pain on lifting something heavy? I will show you why I never want you to ignore back pain. 
[Applause] 
>> up next -- lower back pain that could be a serious symptom. 
>> Pain on one side of the spine or the other. 
>> Plus -- abdominal pain you can't ignore. 
>> It can cause bleeding. ???????????? It's 50% off outerwear. Plus, members earn points on every purchase At Kmart. done! "Are you a cool mom?" I'm gonna find out.

[00:29:44]


[Cheers and applause] the question, do you know how to describe your pain? Pain doesn't have to be at maximum level to be concerning dull, mild twinge you tend to ignore can also be signs of something serious. Know one of the most common pains woman tend to ignore slower back pain. I will quiz you. Are you all ready? How many women out there think they're lower back pain is based on how they slept last night? Bunch of hands went up. How many because you lifted something heavy? Come on down. You shouldn't have sat so close. How are you? What's your first name? 
>> Linda. 
Dr. Oz: Welcome to the show. How ofpble do you experience lower back snain 
>> I say pretty much every morning when I get out of bed. File like an old man instead of 50. 
Dr. Oz: Why not an old woman? 
>> I don't know. 
[Laughter] I think I'm old and creaky and everything all over but especially my back. 
Dr. Oz: Why do you think it hasn't gotten better? 
>> Age, belly fat, could be my medications. 
Dr. Oz: Could be a bunch of things. You put your hands up and identified a few things in the back of your mind. Question, how will we evaluate this pain to get our arms around it. Most important thing is figure out intensity level. Put my scale back up there. On a scale of zero, no pain or worse possible pain, where would you put your back pain? 
>> Probably three. And then it goes away. Flsh flat there in the middle. 
Dr. Oz: Flat there in the middle. 
>> Yeah. I don't complain too much. Nobody would care if I did. 
Dr. Oz: Why would you say that? 
>> I have a house full of boys. Oh, quit your -- you know. 
Dr. Oz: Women have much better pain tolerance than guys do. We're wimps. 
>> I know, yeah. 
[Laughter] 
dr. Oz: But you're saying som women are feeling and not always articulating. You don't think people care or you want to be tough and rough. So you ignore pain you shouldn't. 
>> Until another pain comes along, like you said. Then yeah. 

[00:31:46]


Dr. Oz: One hand and one finger identify where the pain is for me? 
>> Right here. 
>> Right there. 
Dr. Oz: Right there. Am I right? 
>> Yeah. 
Dr. Oz: One of the first things you want to be able to do, one finger identify the pain is. Some are identifiable with one and others are not. Once have you done that, how severe it is and one finger so now you're on the road to fast pain relief. Can you target exactly what you're going to do. So if the pain gets worse or when it comes on catches your attention and I begin to think of something different. Walk over here. This is what I think you might want to pay attention to, possibility you might have kidney stone. 
>> I know. All of the side effects you see on medications. 
Dr. Oz: Medications, diets, weight changes. Let me show you what a kidney stone is and why this might mihm uck back pain. Way in your back, behind organs and bones in the back of big kidneys. Look at the side of the kidney, urine's coming out of it. Over time, kidney getting rid of toxic stuff but sometimes bacteria, particles collect and stone gets bigger and slides down and blacks off the ability of urine to come down. It backs up into the kidney . When it backs up, causes inflammation and irritation and kidney does not like that and sets up for infections and that you will feel. One thing to point out, remember kidneys are located on either side of the spine. It will send out pain. If it has discomfort. But again, since you have two kidneys, you will feel pain on one side or the other. Not feel it right in the middle. 
>> Ok. 
Dr. Oz: You pointed to a spot a little lower then where your kidneys are. See the wing bone in the back. This is what doctors do. Here's the wing bone there. Bang like that, beneath the wing bone. If you don't have discomfort, it means kidneys probably are not in danger. I hope that's helpful. 
>> It is. Dr. Beat up those boys of yours! 
>> I will. 
Dr. Oz: Thank you very much. I want to talk to you about a pain you should never, ever ignore. Abdominal pain that happens during painful periods. Chris toon from the audience to help describe it. How are you, christine? We talk about belly pain, especially abdominal cramps. I would love the idea on the pain scale I have up there, give me an idea where you would put the amount of pain. 

[00:33:59]


>> On my worse month, it's 10 and on a good month, it could be as low as it 2. It varies. 
Dr. Oz: There are time your pain is a 10? 
>> Or more. 
Dr. Oz: The pain, does it feel menstrualy, crampy in nature? 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: Has it been getting better or worse? 
>> I would say worse. As I get older. 
Dr. Oz: Here is the pain scale. You described to me two different extremes. 2 and 10 for the exact same problem. 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: Women often ignore abdominal pain because they figure it's part of normal cramps. Normal cramping doesn't go from 2 to 10 normally. And normal cramping with women would generally get better as they get older. 
>> Really? 
Dr. Oz: Generally. We're all different but generally I'm saying something true. These become clues to me. They're worrisome signs you might have something called endometriosis. Have you heard of that word before? 
>> I have. 
Dr. Oz: Have you thought that might be part of your issue? 
>> I did but I was never diagnosed with it, so -- 
dr. Oz: I have news for you, a lot of the pain conditions we diagnose together. Patient comes to us and tells us clue that's help us nudge us to make the right diagnosis. You're coming and telling me your pain saul over the place. Not constant and tell me it's getting worse as you get older, I have to in my mind think that's it's a possibility. Let me show what you endometriosis is. Stand here and it will help you see better. Normally tissue on the uterus is all in the uterus where it's supposed to be. Every month you have your period, you shed these. They go out of your body and leave uterus. What happens sometimes is instead of coming out from below, see the fallopian tubes, you push some of material out into the abdomen and actually start to layer materials endometrialal that should be down in the uterus here. Out of the fallopian tubes and lie along intestines. It can line the liver up here and stomach. A lot of places. When you have your monthly cycle, these tissues will swell. Depending what they're lying on, twist bowels together, stick intestines to the wall of the belly and that can cause weird pains and that gives you very erratic senses depending on what else is going on so it's not quite predictable. 

[00:36:14]


>> And also cause bloat something 
dr. Oz: More bloating. I worry because it can cause bleeding, internal bleeding. Again, you just want to know what might be out there for you. By thank youing about your pain more intuitively and trying to assess based on that scale where you are, you will be able to mack a bet -- make a better judgment. Is that helpful to you? 
>> Thank you. 
Dr. Oz: You might print out that scale on doctoroz.Com and keep track with your doctor? 
>> I will. 
Dr. Oz: All right. Thank you very much for sharing your story. I have a question for you, if you're buying eggs with added omega 3, are you getting your money's worth? Find out the truth when we come back. 
>> Up next -- health rip-offs found at your grocery store. 
>> Throwing money down the drain.

[Applause] 
dr. Oz: Some claim to make you healthier but in reality being scammed and lied to. Shining a light on the grocery store rip-offs most of you are falling for. Joining us us, editor of "consumer reports" smart shop magazine. And many are in the grocery store aisles. What's that rip-off? 
>> Most of these eggs are added omega 3's and you that I buy it, it's healthy. But they might not be the right kind so you're wasting money. Get them in foods that naturally cone taken them like fish, salmon and sardines. Or cheaper salt tive is buy supplements. 
Dr. Oz: Makes a lot of sense and what I personally do. I have see omega 3 in milk and dairy but there are brand-new places, never before seen wheres they this not so effective form are being developed. What are they? 

[00:41:26]


>> Packaged cheeses, butter substitutes, cereals s you're seeing it all over the place and these products are a waste of money. Throwing money down the drain. 
Dr. Oz: How much money? 
>> Milk can be twice the price with omega 3's and eggs for a dozen, you will pay another dollar. That's a lot of extra money you don't need to be spending. 
Dr. Oz: I was curious. Sent our eem team out to look at local grocery stores. Mihming with omega 3's, $4.49. Without $2.09. A lot of money. Less than half the price. Eggs $3.79, without $2.99. Big difference. It bothers me a lot. When I see people being taken advantage of and spending hard-earned money to buy something better for them, we need to fix that. Rewe will explain why not all foods containing omega 3's are created equally. Let say this is your brain and this is your mouth here. When you eat omega 3's, real stuff lisa mentioned, good stuff you can get from fish or supplements, what happens is -- put it in there, d.H.A. Goes into your intestinal system, easily absorbed by your body. Right down to where it can be used to protect your heart and protect your brain. Again, all of that nutrient goes right where it's supposed to go into the deep hole you have in your body. Smarter, heart beats better, all of the things we brag to you about taking d.H.A. Omega 3's. Let's say you're having some of those eggs or milk you paid twice as much as you're supposed to pay for. What they have are a.L.A. Omega 3's. This may not sound important but it's critically important. It's not the same stuff. It's related, distant cousit not the same stuff. You have to convert a.L.A. Omega 3's into the d.H.A. Omega 3's. This happens really slowly. So you don't reap the same benefits. Again, I will pour in my a.L.A. Omega 3's and what happens when I do this? Long route, holes in the pathway. Not so efficient and when that happens, guess what happens, folks. We don't get nearly enough down in the depot when you need the omega 3's. And no idea where it is and much less into your body with the original desire to give us d.H. Omega 3's. Right? 

[00:43:51]


>> Absolutely. 
Dr. Oz: So you will not get conned when they say omega 3 on the packaging. Next grocery store rip-off is faux fruit, fake fruit. What kind of faux fruit are we talking about here? 
>> This is a common problem. Blueberry pancake mix with no real blurries. Carrot cake with no carrots. Also seeing juice, for example, orange juice, beat sugar. Weird ingredients. Talking about fresh fruit smoothies with no fresh fruit. It may con sane sorbet and juice concentrates, which is as good as drinking a milkshake. Other way, talking about a lot of calories. You may think you're buying something healthy and good but you're not. 
Dr. Oz: Why would manufacturers do that? 
>> It saves them money and it can say something on the front label that definitely is not true. Look on the back label, have you to look at the nutrition facts and read what's in the product. What you might find is that you're just eating a mixture of fat and artificial flavors and colorings and that's not good for you. 
Dr. Oz: No, it's not. What's the best inexpensive way of getting fruit? 
>> Well, obviously, buy fresh fruit when it's in season. But if it's out of season or if it's out of your price range, go for the frozen stuff. It's just as good as fresh stuff. And when it's on sale, stock up because it lasts a long time. Be healthy and save money. 
Dr. Oz: I love you saving us money and time. Appreciate it. Thank you for being here. 
>> You're welcome.

[00:48:23]


[Cheers and applause] 
dr. Oz: Today we're vealing some health rip-offs at the pharmacy. What is and isn't worth your money? Pharmacist and columnist susie cohen is here with your answers. Your dear pharmacist column is fabelous. Touches the lives of 20 million people. What are the biggest rip-offs in your opinion? 
>> Wow. It's the body. The body is getting ripped off of vitamins and minerals by the medications we take and it causes side effects. This is scientifically called the drug nutrient eefesht but what I call drug mugger effect. Women who take birth control pills or medication for menopause. This can rob body of certain nutrients and minerals we need to make happy brain chemicals and thyroid hormones. Over time may develop hypothyroidism or depression and never connect it to medications. The big rip-off fwr millions of americans is the drug mugger effect and it's easy to solve. We're not just losing vitamins and minerals in the pharmacy. We're losing a lot of money in other aisles too. 
Dr. Oz: Talk about them money issues in particular. First rip-off, cold and flu section. This is partly monetary but also you're taking a risk you shouldn't. Explain what the big rip-off is here. 
>> People will pay up did-to-$15 or $20 for multitasking product and don't think they should. Focus medicine on particular symptoms, target it based on what you're feeling. Single ingredient could be about $5 compared to $15 or $20 for a fancy one. 
Dr. Oz: Give me an idea of the exact ingredient. Say if I have a cough. 
>> Cough dry and hacking, i suggest a single ingredient called d.M. Body eggs and pains, ibm or acetaminophen. Runny nose, antihistamine. Nose is stuffed up, pseudocxsgpreee fed ren. 

[00:50:23]


Dr. Oz: Again, we will put these on doctoroz.Com. That targeted approach keeps you safe because you don't have multiple chemicals in your body. 
>> And you don't feel like a zombie taking a product that addresses eight or ten symptoms. 
Dr. Oz: Next rip-off is in the travel aisle. This surprises me. 
>> Yes, this is annoying because basically you're going to pay up to $2 for a tiny shampoo you can use once or twice. You're paying for convenience here. If you're willing to buy a little plastic bottle and then just refill it with your favorite shampoo from at home, can you do this for 10 or 15 cents compared to a couple bucks. Remember, refilling plastic puts money in your purse. 
Dr. Oz: Very smart. Next rip-off at the pharmacy, filling unnecessary prescriptions. What do you mean by this? 
>> This is particularly important for people who don't have pharmacy coverage or who don't have a prescription co-pay. Basically, you wind up paying a pharmacist $200, $300 for a prescription and you may not be able to take it. Let's say you're allergic or you can't tolerate it for some reason, you're stuck with it. One thing you can do is buy an over-the-counter version. It's just a lower dosage. You can see if you can get by on that. If you can, it saves a lot of money. Now, if you can't get by on a particular dosage, talk to your pharmacist or physician about upping the dosage. But buying an over-the-counter version to a prescription counterpart can save a lot of money. 
Dr. Oz: I do this a lot in my own practice. If you have ache or pain, I get you less expensive version that's over-the-counter. Remember, it could be over-the-counter, use lower dose, give you a little more of it and save you a lot of money, easier to get and get similar benefits. Many, many examples of that. One other question, brand versus generic. 
>> Great question. You know what, I love a generic drug has to have same exact ingredients and have to be manufactured to the same quality levels as brand-name version. Buying a store brand generic will save a lot of money. You know what? Who needs pretty package when you can save all of that money. 

[00:52:23]


Dr. Oz: Your advice is wonderful. Thank you very much. Time for in case you missed it and I saved biggest rip-offs for last. 
[Applause] 
>> coming up -- dr. Oz's bonus take.

dr. Oz: Now it's time for "in case you missed it." Here's what I want you to remember from today's show. First off, how healthy are you quiz? How well you're taking care of your body. Here's some of most important questions to ask yourself. First up, open up your shades in the morning.

It could be a warning sign for other problems including kidney stones. Lower back pain can turn from dull to excruciating quickly. Finally, I don't want you to ever pay more for eggs or milk that claims to have added omega 3's. These are not heart-healthy kind. Save your money and buy regular milk and eggs from the store instead. Now time for bonus tip. Live a pain-free life and one of the easiest things you can do to get rid of pain, eat the right stuff! Top three favorite anti-inflammatory s I want you to eat every day to put burning pain inside of you on the outside. First off, swiss chard. Enriched with vitamin c, reduce inflammation. Vitamin c does that but provides one other ingredient called sulfur. Body needs it to make high-powered antioxidants. My favorite way is steamed but cook it two to three minutes and on top of boiling water. Steam it out keeps nutrients inside leaves and you can get half cup a swiss chard a day. Shrinks down and it's like this much by the time you're eating it. Next anti-inflammatory food are tart cherries. Eating or drinking chart terrys every day can reduce inflammation. Frozen tart cherries are available all year round. What I love pairing frozen tart cherries with yogurt or squeeze for sweet dessert. Last anti-inflammatory food is almond milk. Good source of vitamin e, sem for reducing pain and gives you some omega 3's. You can have two cups of almond milk to reduce pain. Long shelf life. Can be used in place of milk for cereal or morning coffee and most have no intolerance issues with it. This is what we have in my household and what we often use.

[Cheers and applause] 
dr. Oz: Today I'm talking about the choices you make every single day in your desire to get healthy. Cut out the butter and cut out the sugar and you use seemingly healthy substitutesnstead. Today I have brand-new information. These butter and sugar alternatives may be linked to cancer, weight gain, even alzheimer's. So are you at risk? Today you'll get answers. I'm going to start by setting the record straight on artificial sweeteners. Saccharine, america's first artificial sweetener. Revolutionized the american diet in the '50's when it went from being a sugar substitute for diabetics to being a godsend to dieters. Soon other artificial sweeteners kept popping up. Today there are over a half a dozen, including aspartame, and neotame. The most common place you consume them is modias but they can be found in 6,000 products sold in the u.S. They are so popular that about 15% of you use them regularly, spending $1.5 billion on artificial sweeteners every year. So today we're answering some of your biggest questions. Do sweeteners cause cancer, weight gain? Can you be addicted? Well, today you will get answers. I will start by setting the record straight on artificial sweeteners and answer your biggest questions. Do they cause cancer? Can they cause weight gain? Are they addictive? I hear these questions all the time from you. Let's start with weight gain. Make it real simple, yes. They absolutely can cause you to gain weight. But that's not all. There's other breaking news. New research shows that artificial sweeteners may be contributing to a nationwide epidemic. It's called metabolic syndrome and sweeping the country. I have talked about it bred but never made -- before but never made the connection to artificial sweeteners until now. Metabolic syndrome is the combination of three things that I fear the most about your health. Triple threat of high blood pressure, excess belly fat and insulin resistance. As a doctor I can recommend ways to lower your risk but I know it's much, much more than that. It's an emotional connection to the sweeteners and I want to hear from you. So I want you to meet self-proclaimed artificial swfetener addict ra nadia and her accomplice alicia. Welcome both of you. 

[00:03:17]


>> Thank you. Thank you. Ranada, let's start with you, how long have yo been using artificial sweeteners? 
>> For a very long time. I started, as soon as I started working, I would go out late with my girlfriends, go to work the next morning a cup of coffee. With that battling my weight so I didn't want to have as much sugar during the day and i started using artificial sweeteners. 
Dr. Oz: Describe to me your struggle withs they products. I want to understand when you say I need something sweet in my mouth and I don't want real sugar. 
>> I drink a cup of coffee. So I have coffee all day long. Actually if I don't, I pick cookies or whatever's sweet i can get so this is a better alternative, or so I thought. 
Dr. Oz: You feel like you're getting away with something? 
>> Yeah, yeah. 
Dr. Oz: How many times a day to you put something in your mouth that has artificial sweetener in it? 
>> I cstantly have a cup of coffee next to me. People say to me on a regular basis, you drink too much coffee or you're always drinking coffee or running to the store or offering to get one for somebody else when I go. More often then I care to admit but yeah. 
Dr. Oz: Alleva, how long have you been using artificial sweeteners? 
>> I have been using artificial sweetens since high school. Like ranada I struggled with my weight and always said, instead of sugar, let me use this artificial sweetener, diet sodas. That's my thing. 
Dr. Oz: Help me understand emotionally why you're so reliant on them. What are they giving you? 
>> Sweet. I'm tasting the sweet so it's helping me with my sweet tooth instead of, like she said, eating a cookie. I reach for the soda. I get sweetness and I'm addicted, totally addicted. I wake up. I have to have diet soda. I just have to. 
Dr. Oz: I will come back to the addiction concept in a moment because it's an important one. What's your biggest fear for being on so many artificial sweeteners? 
>> I want fearful until now. 
-- Wasn't fearful until now. I was fine with having my diet sodas but now you will teach me. You will. 
Dr. Oz: There have been rumors in the past. What I would like to do today if I can, explain and give you an understanding at a visceral level what's happening in your body when you use artificial sweeteners and we can have a conversation about what risks are in there. Have you ever heard either of you metabolic sin zphrome 

[00:05:32]


>> not at a 
dr. Oz: When I describe it, does it make sense big belly person, high blood pressure and sugar and high cholesterol? They do travel together. That's one of the things we will come back to. Let me show you an animation of what I think is happening inside your bodies when you take something in your body with an artificial sweepener. Take the sip and there are taste buds not just in your tongue and mouth but down through the swallowing tube, esophagus and down here in the stomach as well. Now, that does two things, those chemicals release from there will turn on the pancreas, which specifically releases insulin and actually gets resistant and more importantly sends chemicals to the brain to the ais diction center of the brain, where the brain senses you've got something sweet, satisfying but it's too smart to be fooled. It knows you didn't get real sugar. Guess what it does? Craving center says, I need more. I wanthat real sugar fix that throughout human history we have been able to get outside of our bodies. Restate, and this is an important principle, it's a double whammy. You get weight gain because i showed pancreas is releasing insulin. Insulin spikes and causes you to get fat and also leads to insulin resistance so your body won't listen to the pancreas anymore. You have sugar levels all over the place. Second part of the double whammy is you get weight gain because you cve sugar. Even though you drank something sweet, your body will keep pushing you, use the word addicted, alicia. That is what happens. The part of the brain we're relying on, addicts of other substances also have stimulated, gets stimulated in a similar way with sweets. Does that make snens 
>> yes. 
Dr. Oz: I hope that's helpful. When we understand that, we can start moving on. That little bit of heaviness in your midsection as a physician is a much bigger warning then just a cosmetic appearance from the outside p. Now, this is an important point. When you have midsection fat buildup and high blood pressure and cholesterol and sometimes diabetes that follows, it worries me in particular because I know just one soda a day with artificial sweeteners has been correlated to this metabolic syndrome. So you don't have to take very much to get there. So second big question, i promise to answer the big ones for you and this is one that i suspect, it's not mind some of the audience may be there, do artificial sweeteners cause cancer? Have you heard that rumor before? 

[00:07:58]


>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: I will be clear on this also. The answer is no. That's good news. I don't think it causes cancer. And data we have to date will support it directly does not. But that belly fat that i mentioned earlier, guess what? That belly fat that causes metabolic syndrome is also correlated with some big cancer risks. Including colon, pancreas, end meetreel and even breast cancer, in particular post menopausal women. So if you're going to gain weight, which which might be happening with artificial sweeteners, you will end up with problem with cancer risk from weight by itself. I just talked about artificial sweeteners and given you insights about them. Is this clicking for you a little bit? 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: Here's the deal, when we come back, I will reveal other big health problems they may be causing. Believe me, you will not want to miss this. 
[Applause] 
>> up next -- are you plagued with digestive problems? 
>> I get diarrhea. 
>> Think it's from sugar substitutes? 
>> I bet there are a lot of people hearing your voice saying that's exactly what I got. 

[00:11:52]


Dr. Oz: I'm back and we are talking about artificial sweeteners could they be making you sick. I have big news. New information about what they are doing to your body. We have spent millions of dollars solving your digestive issues. Things like irritable bowel syndrome. We are learning it could come down to the sugar substitutes you are eating. Angela is here. I will hear your story out a little bit. I suspect a lot of folks will find themselves in your story. Teach me about your digestive habits. 
>> This is so embarrassing. I feel like I can tell you. But I get diarrhea when I eat too much sugar. And I'm not exactly sure. Like I switched to artific to make it better and I have suchh a sweet tooth and I look for sugar everywhere. Pop, cookies and constantly reaching for sugar and trying to alleviate guilt I go for artificial sweeteners and it just gets me running. 
Dr. Oz: How many years ago did this start? 
>> I noticed it a few years ago. It started -- wow. Dr. Oz:10 years ago? 
>> I would say two or three years ago maybe. I was eating some chocolates at my desk and next thing I knew let's just say I know why they call it the runs. It crept up on me so fast and all I could get out was my stomach and I was making my way around to find some restrooms. 
Dr. Oz: Have you been able to correlate the specific foods that are doing this? You mentioned sugar in general. Artificial foods, or certain foods push you over the edge? 
>> I find more with artificial that I get some -- that is it gets going. I get headaches and a stomach ache but I get the diarrhea from the artificial. 
Dr. Oz: Any fevers when you have that? 
>> Oh, yes. I get hot, I get cramps. I get bloating. 

[00:13:55]


Dr. Oz: The whole body is involved? 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: There are recent reports making specific sugar substitutes to everyday digestive problems of the kinds you are describing. Part of the reason I want to spends time on this besides the big health catastrophe tha could happen is there are symptoms like you are describing that you are not aware and don't pay attention. A lot of people who are hearing your voice are saying that is what I have. These substitutes are called sugar alcohols. They are reduced calorie sweeteners that give food the flavor you want and all of that without sugar and there are chemicals in these low sugar substitutes, a lot of diet processed foods low sugar cookies, chocolate have them. Bars, a lot of gums have it in there. 
>> I chew gum. 
Dr. Oz: They could push you over the top. Let me show you what I'm talking about with this animation without using your body as an example. These specific sugar substitutes may cause diarrhea because you eat something with an alternative it goes into the intestine and the bacteria begin to digest because it is not absorbed. They give off gases and that creates a lot of gas and the body starts to absorb a lot of fluid into the intestinal system and as the water pours in it mixes with the gas from the bacteria and travels through your intestinal system and out of the bowel and you can't stop it because of these little sugar alcohols was what you are putting in your mouth with the sugar alcohols is really a laxative. It works that way. It takes about 10 grams of these sugar alcohols to cause problems. What does that translates to? Five sticks of sugar less gum. Five sugar-free mints. A tablespoon of sugar free jam. Half a cookie. 

[00:15:56]


>> I'm in trouble. 
Dr. Oz: Is that part of your daily diet 
>> oh, yes. 
Dr. Oz: I want you to understand what all of these foods sources are and the sugar. You asked what they are. The way you can tell if they are in your fad supply is it -- food play is it will say itol. Nutritional label will say something itol. Sorbitol. That is found in sugar free gum, canaday. And in baked goods, ice cream. You can finds them easily now that you know but think about how they ends, i-t-o-l. They will have those last four letters. Are you clear on how to identify it in the food? 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: Higher up on the label they are listed the more. So if your favorite sugar free cookie has it in the top couple of ingredients that may be why you run off to the bathroom. So next time you look at the label you will see these labels on the big screen. You are looking for that ingredient as a warning sign. The bottom line is if you notice you are having stomach problems d labels with sugar alcohols. We have covered that. But that is not the only problem. You could have the unexpected symptom that you never think would come from artificial sweeteners. You will be surprised. 
>> Coming up, the unexpected effect of artificial sweeteners. It could become hyper active. 
>> One packet can cause that. schiff formulas support your digestive health with a probiotic that survives ten times better. Take the digestive advantage 14-day money-back challenge. 

[00:20:27]


Dr. Oz: We are talking about artificial sweeteners. If you think you are doing the right thing by using them to cut out calories, you think that is the case but artificial sweeteners may be linked to a host of health problems. Renee is here because you wrote me about a health problem you are having. Could you slain the letter? Is -- explain the letter. 
>> I find myself going to the bathroom all throughout the day. I'm constantly going in and it is very frustrating, very annoying. 
Dr. Oz: When did it first start? 
>> About a year ago. And it was probably I noticed it more when I switched from regular, drinking regular soda because I was addicted to them and I switched to diet, artificial sweetener. Now I'm addicted to those. 
Dr. Oz: How often do have you an artificial sweet they are drink? 
>> Probably -- I have it in my coffee two cups and three sodas throughout the day. Along with my candy and sugar less gum. 
Dr. Oz: A fair amount but i think a lot of folks traditionally use it. 
>> I know a lot of people that do. 
Dr. Oz: Let me walk you through what I think is going on. Artificial sweeteners we talked about the bowels and metabolic syndrome but you could be wearing out your bladder with the artificial sweeteners. I will show you a demonstration. The bladder is a muscle that has to contract. You can be the contractor. Squeeze the muscles. Normally if you are urinate you first have to build up enough urine to push it out. You keep squeezing. As you fill up and get above the line of fullness the body will want to contract faster and you will begin to urinate. Faster, faster and you soon begin to empty the bladder. That is the normal. Let me show you what happens in you, I bet. There is a normal bladder with this muscle. This is your bladder. This is a bladder of someone taking a lot of artificial sweeteners. It is not full. It is not ready to go to the bathroom but the muscle is hyperactive because it is being stimulated by the sweetener which is a chemical. Put a little bit of urine in there. As soon as you put a little bit the body can't hold it and push there down and faster and faster and you will urinate even though you don't have that much in there. Even though I stop at the bottom it doesn't take much to fill you up. So go again, five or 10 minutes later a little more of what ever drink and you spasm again and urinate. Imagine doing calisthenics. That powerful muscle is not supposed to pump all the time. The shocking part of this is one packet of artificial sweetener can cause you to pee more than you are supposed to. Think about that. And it has a major impact on your overall bladder health. Who wants to have that? 

[00:23:43]


>> Not me. 
Dr. Oz: How many times a day are you urinating? 
>> Too many. Maybe about 18. Dr. Oz:18? 
>> Yeah. I told you I'm always running in there. 
Dr. Oz: You kept a log for us. 
>> I did. 
Dr. Oz: I looked at it and counted the number of times you went to the bathroom to urinate. It was 20. 
>> Wow. 
Dr. Oz: Any idea what the normal is? Where were you before you started driing soft drinks? 
>> Not that many. 
Dr. Oz: The most I would tolerate for the average person is about eight but I'm thinking anybody who is out there urinating more than eight times that could be why you are going to the bathroom. With that said, let's get back to the nitty-gritty. Whether works to get you to of that much artificial sweetener. What have you tried? 
>> I tried throwing water in there instead of diet soda but i feel the need for the sweet in my mouth, the sweet taste. So I go back to diet soedz don't or gum. 
Dr. Oz: You ought to learn alternatives that don't involve putting water in there? 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: I will have n do this at home. When I come back I will show you some of the best ways to cut back on artificial sweeteners for good. Stay with us. ???????????? It's 50% off outerwear. Plus, members earn points on every purchase At Kmart. done! "Are you a cool mom?" I'm gonna find out.

[00:28:23]


Dr. Oz: We are back talking about artificial sweeteners and here is a question you are all asking. Can I have any at all? Well, the answer is yes, which i think it is, then how much can i have. I know it can be really hard to cut them out and you are busy, trying to do the right thing to avoid sugar. To figure it out I brought in a registered dietician ashley koff and renee will join us. Ashley has three easy ways to cut back on artificial sweeteners. Walk us through. 
>> The first thing is it has to be easy. We have to be able to remember and renee you will have the easiest time. Three r's. The first thing is we want to reduce. Reduce our quantity. We want to replace. Move from artificial to natural. The third is to renew our taste buds. Three r's. 
Dr. Oz: Interested in doing this? 
>> Definitely. Can't wait. 
Dr. Oz: They are srapld and practical for -- valid and practical. Let's talk about reducing. What works for that? 
>> If you were having any artificial sweeteners during the day I want you to get down to one. You don't have to pick. If you are having diet soda and coffee and putting the packets in there I will break in and be easier and say you will have one diet soda and one packet. What happens if you are having five cups of coffee? 
>> One packet. 
>> There you go. If one cup? 
>> One packet. 
>> So you can split it up. So try to get down to the one. 
>> Ok. 
>> Think that is doughable? 
>> I'm going to try. 
Dr. Oz: Now another thing is to replace them with something we think is natural and suitable alternatives. You have a pretty good idea. 
>> The replace part is going -- we are still in the calorie free so it is the more natural state. So when you say you have the craving for the higher sweet we have this. 

[00:30:29]


>> I haven't but I wanted to try it. 
>> This is perfect. It stevia is a plant that exists in nature and the plant has something that is 30, 40, 50 times sweeter than sugar in nature so you are getting that extra bump of sweet. It is in a packet form and you can use it in tea, cook with it, different options. That will give us an option. 
>> Great. 
>> So we will have you taste this. 
Dr. Oz: I grow it in our back yard now. You can pick it and hang it up and let it dry and it tastes pretty good. 
>> You have the whole leaf. 
>> How does it taste? 
>> Good. 
Dr. Oz: It doesn't taste good in the pure form but it does in the mix. How do you know if you are getting a pure version? 
>> This became popular because it is calorie free. What we areking for and people want the more natural option. The issue is there are products on the market that unfortunately are taking either the leaf or parts of it and blending it with a bunch of the additives that are not natural. So, what you want to do is simply when you look at the labels, if you are buying the box or droppers, look for the word "stevia" there. So it may say stevia extract or organic but you want to have that word there. And you don't want to see a whole laundry list of other things. If there are four or five other ingredients I would pass. One of the challenges is you may find this and may see a packet that says stevia, say, at the coffee shop or on the table at restaurant and you don't know is it stevia or a blend. It is so easy. Just put a couple of these in your purse and you have it with you. So if you find yourself in the airport or running throughout the day and say I want to have my one packet, where do I get it and you pull it out of your purse. Because it is again still several times sweeter than sugar in nature we want to pay attention to portion size. What we want to do is just how i said the one diet soda and one packet, try with the stevia to keep yourself in the range of three to four packets in the day. It is not carte blanche to put it in everything or otherwise you are getting way too much sweet on your taste buds. 

[00:33:03]


Dr. Oz: Are you ready for a quiz? 
>> I am. 
Dr. Oz: If you look at these ingredient lists can you see that. You will notice one says stevia on it and the other doesn't. It has other stuff. You want it to say steve kwrafplt are you ok with that? 
>> Yes. 
>> You know what to look for? 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: The pronunciation is not the issue. And it doesn't matter what form you take it? 
>> What is great about the different forms is for a while we only got it in the packet and if anybody everried a packet of the artificial or natural to put it in a whole beverage you see clumps of stuff but with the dropper you can put it into a cold beverage and it will be fine. And when you cook sometimes you want something that has more of the liquid consistency. But because it is sweeter than sugar if you replace it in a recipe look online and see what you are replacements should be. 
Dr. Oz: The last option is renew your taste buds. You have to resuscitate the taste buds that have been knocked down by taking products several hundreds times sweetser than sugar. Ashley, explain the game plan. 
>> The ideas is for the results we are talking about earlier in the segment where away want to get the bodback to feeling great and good energy. We were talking about the results in terms of waistline. You are like absolutely. You will see the changes because when you give the bid what it recognizes best and what exists in nature, we are talking about mother nature sweeteners. A lot of times people say they tell me that if I'm craving something sweet to have an apple and people say it doesn't taste sweet. Sometimes we have lost. So we need to get back to where an apple is sweet or a berry or alittle bit of mother nature sweetness. Maple syrup, honey. Here we have raw buck wheat honey. Have you ever tried that? 

[00:35:16]


>> No. 
>> This is an exciting one. That is a portion size and I'm totally kidding you. Think about maybe breaking it up throughout the day because since this iseally dark and not refined this is how you would get it if you opened the hive it will be very strong and pungent. 
Dr. Oz: It is a very rich taste. See how dark the color is? It is not a portion size but you could take it down. 
>> One of the other reasons i love this and we try to get everybody over to the renew place is one reason people say they are having diet sodas or coffee with artificial sweetener is they need energy and they are looking for energy. 
>> I do needenergy. I find myself halfway through theday ready to take a nap. 
>> We get still hrapbtsz lantz 
-- stimulants but no calories. The calories will give you the energy so you can cook with this. You can bake with it. You can certainly drizzle it over an apple or put it with oatmeal or anything like that. This is real buck wheat honey. That entire jar is about $5. It will probably last you a year or two years, depends on how much baking you do. But it is going to stick around and you can get it at almost every store. So, even though it is something it sounds like raw buck wheat honey I have to go pick it myself, it is available everywhere. 
Dr. Oz: Enjoy it. Good luck with your bladder. Report back. 
>> I will. Thank you so much. 
Dr. : Another food substitute you are using in an effort to get healthy could be dangerous to your body. Up next, could butter substitutes cause alzheimer's? What you need to know. 

[00:37:26]

Dr. Oz: Recent headlines about an ingredient you eat you think is helping you cut down on fats. Artificial butter flavoring. How harmful is it to your brain. Could it trigger alzheimer's? Is that truth or hype? My e-mail blew up over this. So many say you are tossing out everything that has butter substitutes in t. You want to know what is going on. Should I throw it all out? The center is a chemical called diacetyl. Instead of real butter they put this in the food to give it that buttery flavor t. Is in cooking spray, margarine and charlottening. In -- shortening, cheese, crackers, baking mix, microwaver popcorn and one place you would never think. You know that glass of chardonnay with dinner, that buttery chardonnay. A lot of times they have dicetyl. It is the ingredient that gives you the buttery taste without the fats and calories. Choosing products with that artificial butter flavor twice as often as butter. It is in food you eat every day, cooking spray, margarine and shortening, cheese, crackers, baking mix and microwave popcorn. One place you would never suspect. That grass of chardonnay you had with dinner. Some say imitation is the best form of flattery but when it comes to your health is it better to fake it? 
Dr. Oz: I will invite robin in because she's been a big user of artificial butter. You stopped using real but the are about 20 years ago. 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: What prompted the change? 
>> Fat free, low cholesterol, low-calorie and so much easier. 
Dr. Oz: You feel proud about doing a smart switch. It is the same as sweet they are. Wha bothers me the most is you think you are doing the right thing but the body doesn't agree with you and so many problems can arise from making the substitutes because the body can't adjust that quickly. When you first saw the headlines about some of these artificial but the are substitutes causing problems potentially like alzheimer's what was your first thought? 

[00:43:50]


>> I was scared, worried what has it done to my family so far. 
Dr. Oz: Did you throw anything out? 
>> Not yet but I will when I get home. 
Dr. Oz: I will explain what I am concerned and when you listen you may want to throw them out. You took some pictures. Look at vegetables and you have them up there. How many sprays do you use for those? 
>> I'm embarrassed. A lot. At least 10. 
Dr. Oz: How about you have a pie up there. 
>> Three layers underneath. Below the filling and on top. 20. 
Dr. Oz: So, a lot of sprays. And they are not zero calorie and if you put 20 sprays in you get calories. I'm more concernedut the chemicals in there. Robin, like so many next out there, not only flavors her food with these, you actually use it to kbg. So you do a lot of things with it. 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: I will walk you through some information that broke over the summer about the potential risks of these. The first big idea was a study that linked these chemicals to alzheimer's. Do you have anybody in your family with alzheimer's? 
>> No. No one for decades. 
Dr. Oz: Let's show what happens with alzheimer's disease. If you look at the brain and this is what it looks like you have neurons and they are protected normally by the foods you eat. But when you eat some of the chemicals it takes the clumps of material this sap that gunks up the neurons and prevents them from working and paralyzes their ability to perform. It causes inflammation irritation. Once they are gunked up they don't function so well. You begin to forget things. That is what alzheimer's primarily represents. So, the study done in a test tube used this chemical and showed that that kind of clumping appears it-- to occur from that chemical. Now, again, it will be a long time proves there is happening in humans. But this didn't come out blue. They did it in part because factory workers in plants who make these were getting diseases in the lungs so there was a hint that high amounts ofs might be a problem for us and maybe could cause problems for people who have the exposure you have which is 20 sprays in the pie and 10 in the rice. 

[00:46:23]


>> That is scary. 
Dr. Oz: It scared me. I don't think that you all should be guinea pigs in this because although we don't know this today why wait to find out. Remember the controversy about popcorn? The same basic chemical. 
>> That with make sense. 
Dr. Oz: Microwave popcorn. The big question is you should throw everything away. 
>> I'm going to. 
Dr. Oz: I will hold for one more segment because I have strong advice. I will show you how to tell if artificial butter flavorings are in your favorite foods.

[00:49:21]


Dr. Oz: We are talking about butter substitutes. You think they are healthier and less fattening but what are you putting on your toast when you use it? The news headlines scared robin had loves butter spray and caught georgia's attention. What did you feel when you read that potentially linked to alzheimer's? 
>> I was mortified. I do puzzles to keep my mind sharp and we feed our kids the microwave popcorn. It is an easy go-to snack. When I heard the link I was mortgages fdny. 
Dr. Oz: The reality is iwill take decades to know if there is a true connection. Itis how long it takes in humans but why do an experiment yoon -- your kids. My recommendation is cut back on the artificial products. We have been talking about the fact that the body knows it is a problem when we've chemicals in our body we can't understand. It is better to be safer than sorry so I will walk you through other options. First, you want to know if you have it in the product. You can do that by looking on the ingredient list. If it says artificial flavors you have to assume that is a code for this chemical we don't want to have. 
>> So it doesn't necessarily have to say dicetyl. Dr. Oz unless it says it doesn't have it, you have to assume it. Anybody who takes it out will brag about it. Certainly after this show. It will say doesn't have it. Is free ofhe stuff that causes potential problems. I would play it safe. You have another question. 
>> I do. I'm a label reader and I try to be healthy and you get confused. I look at the plant sterols. Is that a safe alternative? 
>> I love them. The plants dove cholesterol the way animals do. They have stero ls. If you want to look for something that is the direction I would go. But I have one other big challenge. I know many of you are pretty picky and if you have a desire to have a real food alternative to that artificial but the are flavoring I have to be creative. Robin, you showed me how many sprays you take. 

[00:51:49]


>> Too much. 
Dr. Oz: If you remember what real butter tastes like? 
>> Probably not. 
Dr. Oz: This is going to be a fun moment for you. I want you to taste a little bit of that. Not the whole thing. 
>> That is good. 
Dr. Oz: Ptty good? 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: My alternao the sprays is whipped butter. Use half a tablespoon per rving. That is what that is. 
>> That tastes good. 
Dr. Oz: It is good, isn't it? 
>> Yes. 
Dr. Oz: It has half the calories. 
>> And more flavor than what i have been spraying. 
Dr. Oz: Your body those it is real and it has air in there because it is whipped and looks bigger than it is so you get the taste without the fat. It is easy to substitute the material and the body will love you for doing that. Are you in? 
>> I'm in. What a difference. I'm shocked. 
Dr. Oz: I want your body shocked, too. When it sees you are putting real food in it, it will enjoy it as well. Thank you very much. Up next I'm shaker -- sharing the funniest lines I have heard in a long time. . 

[00:57:22]


>> Now town police department responded immediately called for help. Surrounding local agencies sent officers and the connecticut state police sent off duty and on duty troopers to respond so that they had they could immediately gain act cities that building and begin that search process I alludeed to before. We had the state police team. K9 teams out here. We certainly had trooper one in the air and it was probably keep some of your helicopters away quite frankly. But we had ever possible asset came out to this seen the minute that this alarm came in or this call came in and it was certainly to do everything we could to protect certainly live and property. The community has been outstanding in supporting this effort. As you can see you've taken over their park and they're showing up, their offering condolences. They're doing everything they possibly can to support the victims, victims families of this horrific tragedy. The fbi crisis management team is offered to respond, to respond here to assist in crisis management torque assist not only with the families but family members, but with all the first responders. The police, fire, ems all working what I described before as very horrific and difficult scene. Certainly local mental health crisis intervention teams have been on scene and have been here all of today working and assisting in helping. I just want to make it very clear that there were 18 children who were pronounced dead at the scene. There were two children transported to area hospital pronounced dead at the hospital. There were six adults that were pronouned dead at the scene, and obviously, the shooter was also pronounced dead at the scene. I don't have much more detail about that secondary scene but there is a related scene that we discovered as we were continuing the criminal investigation and specifically investigating the shooter and you probably saw and someone asked me on the way in here about the bomb squad and, yes, we brought all our assets in case they were needed and when, h we own out with newtown officers to search or ex execute search warrants or examine other possible secondary scenes we all all those assets with us to make sure we could react if necessary that's about all I have as far as details that concern. I want to give you more one briefing probably just before 6:00 o'clock we'll try to get back up here for one more briefing. I'll take a couple brief questions but I must again tell

T street as opposed 
>> and I think what we need now -- 
>> congresswoman maloney, I'm sorry. We are out of time. I want to thank the congresswoman and josh horowitz, both for being with us. 
>>> That's going to do it here live from connecticut. I'm chris jansing. Nbc's coverage continues now. 
>>> Good evening, american, and welcome to "the ed show" from new york. There are tragedies in life that shake our souls and break our hearts. Today, the nation experienced one of those tragedies. Every american wl struggle to come to grip it's with what happened today in a small community in connecticut. Sandy hook elementary school and the sma community of about 27,000 residents was the site of a shooting rampage. At this hour, we know 26 people at the school were shot and killed by a lone gunman. 20 of those deceased were children. Survivingtudents and their parents said teachers ordered children to hide in closets. Witnesses reported hearing dozens of shots, as many as 100 rounds. Police found the shooter dead. Officers never fired a shot. The gunman's mother was found dead at a newtown location where the gunman lived. Police have released no motive for the attack. The weapons used in the shooting were all legally purchased and were registered to the gunman's mother. An emotional president obama addressed the nation this afternoon from the white house. 
>> We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few year, and each time learned the news, I react not as a president but as anybody else would, as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there's not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers and men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today. For the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults who were lost. As a country we have been through this too many times. Whether it's an elementary school in newtown or a shopping mall in oregon or a temple in wisconsin or a movie theater in aurora, or a street coroner chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children.Ner chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. This evening michelle and I will do what I know every parent in america will do, which is hug our children a little tighter, and we'll tell them that we love them, and we'll remind each other how deeply we love one another, but there are families in connecticut who cannot do that tonight, and they need all of us right now. May god bless the memory of the victims. And in the words of scripture, heal the broken hearted and bind up their wounds. 

[00:04:07]


>> Much like the president of the united states, americans are experiencing a wide range of emotions tonight. And it's difficult to process them. These are photos no one will be able to forget. The sight of crying children being led away from a scene of mass murder should shake the country to its core, and it has. The question must be asked, how many more scenes like this one are we going to see? As a nation, we need to do something, and something has to be done. This tragedy stopped the country in its tracks and brought the president of the united states to tears. As a parent, as an american, as a human being, it's hard not to have the same feelings that i had back on 9/11, that maybe all of us had. Connecticut governor dan malloy felt the same way. 
>> I -- I was mayor of stamford on 9/11 when our state lost many of its citizens, and I lost a number of my fellow citizens and friends. I never thought that in a public career that I would have to face these kinds of circumstances or that they would visit themselves upon this community or the people of connecticut. We'll get through this. And our prayers at this time have to go out to the families. And so as I began by thanking those who have expressed their desires to be helpful, the number one way to be helpful is to say a prayer or send a best wish, or to be thinking of these individuals who have suffered so mightily today. 
>> In the middle of the holiday season, america is reckoning with a crisis of our culture. Details will still emerge, but the sadness will not go away. Joining me tonight from the scene, the latest bringing us is going to be msnbc's chris jansing, who is in newtown, connecticut. These are days that we wish on no one in this business. It is very hard. It's very emotional. It's been a day of tears and broken voices all day long. Chris, I know that there is a lot of prayer taking place in that community tonight. What's the latest? 

[00:06:25]


>> You are right about that, ed. There are at least three prayer services, memorial services that are being heldn this small community. And the pictures we have seen coming out of one them show that the crowds are overflowing. People are wondering what can they do? How can they cope? And of course the question that happens always in these circumstances, and that is, why? Some of the details are beginning to emerge. We know all of this began this morning when a man who police say is 20-year-old adam lanza reportedly shot his mother in the home in they shared. Then went over to sandy hook elementary where she w kindergarten teacher, and we are told opened fire, killing 20 young children. This is a school where the students were from 5 to 10 years old, and six other adults, before turning the gun on himself. Police have never officially said that this was a suicide, but they say no officials fired any shots. And you saw the sound there from the governor just moments after he made that brief statement before the assembled media. He walked by me. And it was difficult not to be moved by the look on his face. In fact, within just minutes of coming off the exit and driving into this town a little earlier today, ed, I glanced into a car next to me. There was a very solemn driver in the car, a man, and then in the passenger seat a woman who was crying. And the emotion has been pouring out in this community all day long. It's been a day of some confusion. The alleged shooter was carrying apparently his brother's i.D. He was later arrested in hoboken, new jersey and told police that his brother had some mental health issues. So we may be able to start to get some idea of what was he mind of this troubled young man. It will do little, I assure you, to calm the deep sense of loss and immense tragedy that they're feeling here in newtown tonight. Now behind me I'll just make one last mention, that that is the volunteer fire station, which has been a kind of a staging area for some of the officials who have come here from all over the region, and federal officials as well. It is also where the parents gathered, those who were not reunited with their children and got the horrific news that their children would not be coming out of that school alive. It remains an active crime scene. It's expected to for several more days. And heartbreakingly, not a single person inside there has been able to be positively identified, ed. 

[00:09:01]


>> Chris jansing, there are the horrific details, and there are heroes. The first responders who were there, those professionals that were in that classroom that were dealing with the survivors. What do we know how they got them out and kept them from the tragedy as best possible? 
>> We know that they responded very quickly. There were tactical teams. There were local and state officials. There were k-9 units. Of course, by the time they got there, there was little they could do except secure those children and get them out of there. We know they went classroom to classroom. And we should say that the shooting happened in one area of this school in two separate rooms. They went from classroom to classroom. And the scene was so horrific, and they didn't want the children to see it. And many of them clearly were crying. They had them hold hands and asked them to close their eyes, and they were led out. I can also tell you from talking to a couple of local officials here, and I think it is important to note that the people who are working this, manyf them are people who live there. They know the people who were in that school. They know the teachers. They know the students. They're their friends and neighbors. So they are not only having to do their jobs, but they're doing it at a time of great very close and personal tragedy as well, ed. 
>> Chris, I know that you have covered tragedies like this in the past, but one of the things that this country is having a very hard time to come to grips with tonight is the age of the children. 
>> I don't think there is any doubt about that. I was at columbine for at least I think it was probably o weeks. At that time we had not seen anything like what we saw there. And there was lot of conversation at that point about how do we stop this from happening again. Well, 12, 13 years later, I was back in aurora, colorado, and talking to many of the same people that I had sadly gotten to know during the columbine shootings, and then earlier in the year I was in arizona when gabrielle giffords and the others were shot there, and you do have a sense everywhere you go, obviously, that there is a senselessness to it. There's a lack of understanding, that no amount of information that we get about the shooter can truly help us to understand how someone could do this, but there is a heaviness here that is almost undescribable, ed, and I think it is related to the fact that we're looking at these young, innocent children that if a shooter goes into a elementary school and opens fire on a classroom, he knows that the victims are going to be children who should by all rights, as so many people have said, have their whole lives ahead of them. And the sense of loss, the enormity of the loss, is difficult for me to put into words here tonight. 

[00:11:55]


>> Chris jansing in newtown, connecticut. Thank you for joining us tonight and reporting here on "the ed show" on msnbc. Thanks so much. The magnitude of this tragedy is enormous for this community of newtown, connecticut. People are turning to houses of worship and faith leaders, several churchn newtown held candlelight vigils tonight. "Nbc nightlyews" spoke with monsignor robert weiss earlier today who put in perspective the emotional damage facing the people of newtown. 
>> What can you say? I mean there is really no words to express the magnitude of this. You know, you send your child to school. You think they're going to be safe. They're happy. These are little kids. They didn't have any worries. And all of the sudden you get a phone call or you get a text that there has been a shooting at your child's school. You know, it's just a matter of hugging them and crying with them and praying with them. The intensity of emotion is really hard to put into words. There was sobbing, there was yelling, there was people throwing themselves on the floor in absolute upsetment. It was a whole range of emotion, and there was people hugging each other, settling down, and then it would come back to them again and you would hear an outburst periodically. But it was very, very heavy emotion. How do you recover from something as horrible as this, you know? How do you help a child have to walk into the front door of that school, you know, the next day that they have class and not see their principal or any of the other staff that really cared about them or their friends. I noticed this morning when the children were being dismissed, some of them wanted to go home, but they were conflicted because they didn't want to leave their friends. They were really conflicted this morning about whether to leave or not. They wanted to just be together. And yet their parents, you know, were here to take them home. It's surreal. It just doesn't seem real. Like one of the ladies, her phone just went off because it was time to take her little boy to a cub scout meeting. And she realized, you know, i can't take him now. So those kind of moments are really, really hard on these parents. Oh, it's awful. Excuse me. I mean, e are 20 people the week before christmas that just lost their joy, you know. How do live with that. And some of them are doing the best they can. And a lot of them are just absolutely -- they're devastated. 

[00:14:17]


>> We'll have much more on the tragic shooting in newtown, connecticut. Coming up, congressman jerrold nadler and dan grose of the brady campaign join me next to react to the white house's comment that today is not the day to talk about gun control.

>>> As a country, we have been through this too many times. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. 
>> President obama earlier today speaking about the school shooting in newtown, connecticut. Despite the tragedies in arizona, in wisconsin, and colorado, despite the countless number of people who fall victim to gun violence each day, every day, the president has not pushed for tougher gun laws while in office, nor did he offer any specifics on legislation that he might support today. In fact, white house press secretary jay carney told reporters earlier today that today is not the day to talk about gun control. 

[00:18:56]


>>> New york mayor michael bloomberg sees it differently. He is calling out the white house and congress for their inaction on the issue. With all the carnage from the gun violence in our country, he said, "it's almost impossible to believe that a mass shooting in a kindergarten class could happen. It has come to that. Not each kindergartners learning THEIR ABCs ARE SAFE. We've heard after columbine that it was too soon to talk about gun laws. We heard after virginia tech, after tucson, after aurora and oak creek. And now we are hearing it again. For every day we wait, 34 more people are murdered with guns. Today many of them were 5-year-olds. President obama rightly sent his heartfelt condolences to the families in newtown, connecticut, but the country needs him to send a bill to congress to fix this problem, calling for meaningful action is not enough. We need immediate action. We have heard all the rhetoric before. What we have not seen is leadership, not from the white house and not from congress. That must end today." That statement from michael bloomberg, mayor of new york city. Let's turn to dan gross, president of the brady campaign to prevent gun violence, and also congressman jerrold nadler of new york. Gentlemen, thank you for your time tonight. We have experienced a wide range of etions today. This is absolutely as bad as it could possibly get. Who could fathom something like this could happen? But mr. Gross, could this change anything? Could this horrific event really be a moment in american history where we actually do something about gun violence? 
>> I really believe it will change things. You know, there's been a national conversation that has been starting prior to this. We've seen people coming out, people like bob costas, even rupert murdoch, bill o'reilly talking about sensible measures. The american people want to solve this problem. Sometimes it's takes an event like this to catalyze thing. In 1989 there was a horrible school shooting where 35 people were shot in stockton, california. And that was the catalyst soon amp that. Ip think that we need to push, and it requires the american public speaking up and making their voice heard. But this is a conversation that the american public wants to have, and we need to make sure that congress and the president want to have it, too. 

[00:21:21]


>> Congressman nadler, do you stand with the mayor of new york when he says that what we have not seen is leadership from the white house and not from the congress? 
>> We certainly haven't seen leadership on this issue in a good number of years. I was heartened that the president said today that we have to take meaningful action. Unless that's simply empty rhetoric, that means that the president is thinking, at least, of taking the lead and really pushing congress on this, which is what it will take. This -- we -- these incidents, these horrible, horrible incidents that tug at all our emotions in which people are killed and now kids are killed are happening more and more frequently. And they will continue to happen more and more frequently, until someone with a bully pulpit, and that means the president, takes leadership and pushes congress and pushes the people to pushing their congress members to do something about this. You know, it hasn't been mentioned in the press, but there was an attack in china today by a maniac on an elementary school with a knife. 22 kids were injured, but not killed because he didn't have a gun. 
>> Do you agree with the gun laws here in new york city? Do you think this has curtailed violence in this city? 
>> Well, I think that it has curtailed violence as much as possible. The problem that we have, of course, is that the criminals go to virginia, and other places, mostly virginia, buy large quantities of weapons and ship them illegally into new york so they get around the new york laws. Which is why I introduced legislation a number of years ago to limit the number of weapons that a licensed gun dealer could sell to a person, to one a month, I think I said. Because no legitimate sportsman needs more than -- how many rifles can you have to shoot deer? 
>> Well, today the white house website was flooded with new petitions, but before we get INTO THE Xs AND Os AND CROSSING THE Ts AND DOTTING THE Is OF ANY Kind of legislation, it really needs to be recognized, for lack of a better term, a game changer. A moment in history where this changes public opinion. Do you think we're there? 

[00:23:32]


>> I think we will be there, if the president exploits it. And otherwise it will go to the next one. 
>> And dan? 
>> I want to point out, I don't think public opinion needs to be changed. It needs to be voiced to our elected representatives. 
>> And you think there has been a reluctance for that? 
>> No, I think there has been a disconnect. That's why we have come out with the notion wearbetterthanthis.Org. So the american public can stand up and say as a nation we are better than a nation that loses 32 people to gun murders every day. We're better than a nation where we can't send our kids to school without a terrible tragedy like this happening, without fearing for their safety. And when it all comes together and alesces, the public support is out there. 74% of nra members support criminal background checks. You know, that consensus is out there. We just have to make that felt in the halls of congress. 
>> But the important political consensus is of the organization, the nra, that can mobilize numbers of voters who will vote on that issue only. And the nra leadership has been the enablers of the mass murders, and they've got to be called on it. They've got to be called on it by the president and the leaders of congress to confront the nra leadership, as bob said. Nra members, they're okay with reasonable gun controls. The nra leadership has been fanatic and frankly functions as enablers to mass murder, and they've got to be stopped on that. 
>> And we have to face the value of some of the rhetoric. Lindsey graham was on tv the other night saying in response to talking about sensible gun laws that, no, I believe in the second amendment. I like to hunt. That is not contrary to the sensible gun laws that anybody is advocating. You know, when you talk about something like criminal background checks, that has nothing to do with a hunter who wants to hunt, or a target shooter who wants to target shoot. 
>> It's been reported that the shooter had some issues mentally. That's what has been reported. How do we keep firearms away from those who have challenges? 
>> You require background checks for sale of guns to anyone. You get rid of the gun show loophole where someone at a gun show can sell it to anybody. Can sell it to people on the terrorists list. Can sell it to convicted pedophiles. Can sell it to felon, and to mentally unstable people. There are ways of the doing that. You know, other countries do it. We're about the only country that doesn't. Stream industrialized countries in the western world, jemny, germany, canada, have 150, 170 people killed a year by guns. We have over 9,000. And the only difference is they have intelligent gun laws and we don't. 

[00:26:16]


>> And here is one very important basic fact. 40% of all gun sales in america don't require a background check. Which means through 40% of gun sales, a convicted felon, a terrorist, somebody dangerously mentally ill can get a gun without any questions asked. 
>> Well, in this situation, the mother purchased the firearm. 
>> And it's also important when we react to tragedies like this not to strive to prevent every possible tragedy. You know, maybe this one, maybe some others would actually still slip through the cracks. But the bottom line is you talked about the fact that there are 34 murders that happen every day in our country. To the extent that those murders are committed by people who could have been prevented from buying guns without background checks, then that's the kind of thing we should be talking about. 
>> Or even prevented from buying high -- not high caliber, a high number of magazines so that you can't get a clip that shoots 30 bullets. What hunter needs a clip that shoots 30 bullets with one pull of the trigger? 
>> Congressman jerrold nadler and dan gross, great to have you with us t evening. Appreciate it. We'll have more on today's tragic shooting in newtown, connecticut. Stay with us.

>>> Welcome back to "the ed show" for our continuing coverage of the shooting in connecticut. Let's turn now to lieutenant george sinko of the newtown police department. Lieutenant, thank you for your time tonight. I know this is not an easy time for you. I don't know how you train for something like this. You're human, too. You're not men of steel. You have hearts. You have souls. And this must have been a horrific day for all of your people there at the crime scene. What is the status of the investigation, lieutenant? What can you tell us tonight? 

[00:30:59]


>> Well, the scene is still ongoing. Newtown detectives as well as major crime from the connecticut state police are currently processing the scene. We also have investigators from the state medical examiner's office on scene. 
>> And has the identification of all of the victims been made, sir? 
>> No, it has not. As you know, it's a very sensitive matter, and we need to make sure that we're right on that. We have a lot of families that are hurting right now. And we're doing our best to move quickly with that, but it's a very long process. And so we want to make sure we're right. 
>> Lieutenant, are authorities convinced that the shooter acted alone without an accomplice? 
>> Yes. At this time we have no indication that anyone else was involved, other than the shooter. 
>> Were there any eyewitnesses that have helped out with the investigation at this point? 
>> Well, certainly there is many witnesses, people in the school as well as around it who have contacted us. We're going to follow every lead, every bit of evidence that we can. This is like a puzzle, and we have to put all the pieces together. And we're going to explore every avenue we can to come to a conclusion here. 
>> And lieutenant, how long will it take to put this together? How long will this be considered a crime scene? 
>> Well, it's difficult to say. Certainly throughout the night we're going to be there. We're going to be there the better part of this weekend. The evidence is really going to take us where we need to go with this one. But certainly through the weekend we're probably going to be working there. 
>> How much -- was there much coopation from the shooter's brother? I understand that there was -- he had -- the shooter had his brother's i.D. On him, and there was some confusion. Was his brother cooperative? 
>> We're not going to comment on any of the individuals that we're working with regarding the investigation at this time. We are early into the investigation. And we have many leads that we're going to follow up. And certainly any witnesses or leads will be followed up. 

[00:33:11]


>> How is the police force, lieutenant, dealing with the survivors in the community tonight? If you can put into words exactly what the scene is there, and what it's like for the community this evening. 
>> This is a very close-knit community. People try to help each other out here. They're hurting. The officers, this is a scene that most officers never have to deal with. I was very proud of the way our officers handled the scene. I'm sure a lot of them are going to be hurting after this. It's going to take a long time for everyone involved. But our efforts are going towards helping the family right now. They're the ones who are in our thoughts and prayers. And we're working as quickly as we can to try to give them the answers they deserve. 
>> And lieutenant, I would venture to say that some of your colleagues haven't been through anything like this before. We are talking about the murder of children. How are they holding up? 
>> Well, right now, you know, they're working off their training and instinct. I'm sure tomorrow when they've had some time to think about it, it may hit some of them harder than others. We're prepared, you know, to work with any of those officers that may need it. Counseling is available if they need it. But we have a strong group, and they're holding out pretty well. 
>> Lieutenant george sinko of the newtown police department, thank you very much for joining us. 
>>> Still more to come on today's tragic events. I'll talk with msnbc political analyst michael eric dyson and congressman keith ellison of minnesota when we return.

>>> welcome back to continuing coverage with the tragedy in newtown, connecticut. People have packed churches in newtown, connecticut, tonight in memory of the children and the adults killed at sandy hook elementary school. We continue to follow late-breaking developments here tonight. Police and fbi agents are still on the scene at this hour. The gunman shot 20 children and 7 adults in newtown before 10:00 this morning. School is supposed to be a safe place. The massacre at columbine high school should have been a wake-up call. But shootings on school campuses have increased over the last 13 years. This february a teenager fired into a cafeteria in charon, ohio. 3 students diped died. One-of-1 wounded. This morning's shooting is wne of many horrible tragedies. These are the worst in our history, and all of them have happened since columbine. A man gunned down 32 students at virginia tech in 2007. A teen took a gun to school and killed nine people in minnesota. Teens died at the school shooting in michigan. And five children were gunned down at a amish school in pennsylvania. But here is the most stunning number of them all. There have been 181 major school shootings in the united states since the columbine massacre. 181 shootings where students were either wounded or killed. Many of the school shootings involved teenagers. In los angeles last year, a teenager snuck a loaded beretta into class. The gun went off and wounded two other students. But young children are victims, too. In houston last year, a 6-year-old took a loaded handgun to school. The gun went off. Three kids were wounded. Many in this country say enough is enough. I'm joined tonight by congressman keith ellison of minnesota and msnbc political analyst and georgetown university professor michael eric dyson. Gentlemen, thank you for your time tonight. I'll have an open question to both of you. Professor, we'll go with you first. We talk about change in society. What does it take for us to change what we are seeing unfold before our eyes? 

[00:40:18]


>> Well, ed, our hearts go out to all the victims of this most recent crime and tragedy. The reality is we've got to face the fact that we are addicted to violence in this culture, that at every level we reinforce the notion that violence is an apt resolution of conflict. And beyond that, we've got to deal with the fact that the ready accessibility of guns has led to devastating consequences for untold americans. Because it's not only the immediate event that induces trauma, it's the psychic trauma that is endured by those who look at this event and have to relive it time and time again because they were there, or because they look upon it from afar and realize that they are similarly vulnerable. Unless we change the gun laws in this country where people have ready access to guns like this that end up, you know, wreaking havoc and devastation upon our culture, we're not going to be able to do anything. And to defend the second amendment as if that's the be all and end all without saying as you already pointed out in this program, layers to that. There are conditions to that. There are contingencies to that. We don't have an either. We have radical feel on the one hand to accept the second amendment, or on the other hand we curtail the law in order to defer to our common sense. I think we can have both, and we need to do that right now, or else this will be repeated. 
>> Congressman, what does it take to get change in this country to address what we are seeing, the gun vience in america? 
>> Well, it only takes us to make up our mind that change is going to have to happen now. I mean, this is such a horrific incident, such a tragic incident. Not even children, 20 kids are safe in their classroom that it must stir the heart of the nation. But I got to tell you, ed, i I remember my friend gabrielle giffords was shot down and her constituents were killed. We thought that would stir the nation. Apparently we haven't seen any real action in congress since then. There are heroes, though, ed. I don't want you to get the impression that nobody in congress is fighting for change. 

[00:42:25]


>> Oh, I know. There is just not enough of them. 
>> carol McCarthy. That's right. I'm going to tell you this, though. We're not afraid of the nra. We're ready to confront them. And we have legislation that we want to see taken up that would ban high capacity clips, stop the gun show loophole, and have mandatory background checks. These are reasonable things. And we need the american people to insist from the white house on down that we take these pieces of legislation up immediately, and that we pass them, and that we confront anyone, these second amendment extremists who think that any kind of a sane, sensible gun legislation is going to take guns away. Which is ridiculous. 
>> And gentlemen, I need to point out. Mothers against drunk driving made it uncool to drive drunk. 
>> Right. 
>> And smoking, of course, is now ruled as uncool in society. But what is it going to take to change the gun culture in america? Dr. Dyson, in black communities in this country, in poor neighborhoods in this country, we are seeing the penetration of guns and ruining lives. And now we're at elementary schools. I mean, what do we have to do? 
>> You're right. 
>> This is a culture now of violence. 
>> You see, drinking and smoking didn't have attached to them the immediacy of a constitutional amendment that would support their ostensible advocates. When you have got this gun lobby, it's so deep and so profound. I thank congressman ellison for reminding us there are those in congress who will stand up. But the gun lobby is so deep, their pockets are so profound, and they've got the ability to bully people, that we've got to stand up to them and say, look, this is enough. It happens at every level, in white communities, in brown communities, in asian communities, latino communities, we have to deal with it in america, because it's an american problem. 

[00:44:27]


>> I just want to point out to you, congressman, that seven nfl players surrendered their weapons this week in the wake of the kansas city chiefs murder/suicide. This was, of course -- 
>> congratulations to them. 
>> Well, your response to that. This was of course before the shooting that took place this morning. I mean, is it g to take that kind of leadership to wake this country up? 
>> Yes, it is going to take that kind of leadership. It's going to take congressional leadership, white house leadership, but also citizen leadership. Like you said, you can change culture. We've changed culture in this nation. And when nfl football players are saying you know what? I really don't need this gun around, and I'm giving it up, that is the kind of symbolic gesture that might provoke others to do the same thing. You know, and there are folks out there, americans who are sick and tired of this just promiscuous violence. You pointed out a great statistics, which is, over 181 school incident shootings since columbine. But there's been over 61 multiple homicide incidents as well that don't involveschools, pthat go beyond schools. This is a culture. We've got to change it. 
>> All right, congressman keith ellison of minnesota and michael eric dyson, great to have you with us tonight. 
>> Thanks, ed. 
>> I appreciate it so much. More of today's tragic events out of newtown, connecticut wh we return.

>>> Welcome back. Today's horrific school shooting shocked the small, quiet middle class borough of newtown, connecticut. Earlier today kate snow of nbc news met with some town leader and community leaders to see how they are coping with this tragedy. 
>> Reporter: This is what was supposed to be happening tonight. A christmas tree sale. Instead, firefighters stressed to the limit, all volunteers from the village of sandy hook. So many of those who rushed to the scene this morning know the children in that school, know the families they're comforting now. 
>> This is most definitely the worst thinat we've had experienced here in town. 
>> Reporter: Sandy hook is a quaint new england borough. The river runs past the main intersection. 
>> There's never any crime here. Everybody's happy. It's a family-oriented community. 
>> Reporter: In fact, the local paper says the area was once voted the safest place to live in america. 
>> This is a phenomenal town to bring your children up in. Very quiet, very family-oriented. It's a phenomenal place to live. Things like this shouldn't happen here. 
>> Reporter: At this local methodist church on the main street of town, they opened the sanctuary this afternoon. The red cross is setting up shop in the basement. 
>> I just want people to know this is a place to come and be with god and try to make some sense of this. 
>> Reporter: All over town, signs ask for prayers for their friends and neighbors. 
>> I have friends who work in that school. I know families who go there. 
>> If it affects one person, it affects everybody. Whether it's, you know, your own kid or not, it's like it's your own. 
>> Reporter: Marcy benitez runs a clothing store and haircut salon for kids. Like everyone in town, she is heart sick, desperately trying to understand what has happened. 
>> As heartbreaking as it is for something to happen, but so close to the holidays whether everybody is supposed to be happy and presents. 
>> You got to little christmas dresses right behind you here. 
>> Yep. 
>> It breaks your heart. 
>> To even think about it, it does. It breaks your heart. 

[00:51:08]


>> Reporter: Walking through town we saw state police guiding shellshocked families to their cars, their grief unspoken, but plain to see what this community has been through today is unthinkable. 
>> Everyone is coming together, supporting everyone, working together, trying to answer all the questions as to how and why this occurred and trying to lend support to all the people involved, including the victims. 
>> Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by this tragedy in that community tonight. 
>>> Coming up, what affect will today's shooting have on the future of our country's gun laws? That discussion is next. Stay with us. One Card Gives you 1% cash back on all purchases, plus a 50% annual bonus. And everyone likes 50% more...

>>> What has happened and what has transpired at that school building will leave a mark on every family and the community impacted. I only ask that all of our fellow citizens here in the united states and around the world who have already offered their assistance remember all of the victims in their prayers. 
>> In the wake of the tragic connecticut school shooting, there is no doubt the debate over gun control will heat up in the coming days and months. New york city mayor michael bloomberg has been front and center in the national discussion over gun control recently. In 2006 mayor bloomberg cofounded the group mayors against illegal guns. 24 group of mayors is dedicated to keeping illegal guns away from criminals. Since 2006, the group has grown to over 700 mayors, and now after today's shooting, mayors against illegal guns is calling for action to improve national gun control laws. I'm joined tonight by mark glaze, who is the director of mayors against illegal guns. Mark, good to have you with us tonight. I appreciate your time on this horrific evening. What is your initial reaction to today's shooting in light of the fact that we are collectively getting leaders in this country that are tryg to forge change? 
>> Well, your first thoughts always go out to the families. We work with hundreds of survivors of gunshot victims around the country. And they really never get over it. And the fact that some of them move on by working with us to change the laws is really awe-inspiring to me. But the second thought is that time after time, when we have the seemingly endless series of mass shootings we have elected leaders go out on the television and say it's not the right time. I was astonished when I heard jay carney at the white house go up to the podium and say now is not the time to talk about our gun laws when is the time? 

[00:57:20]


>> I wondered if he knew that he was parroting the nra's talking points. The time is now. The president's words were much better. He went out and said exactly the right things and said we had to place politics aside and do the right thing. The truth is I was moved by his words, but he is not just the consoler in chief, he is also the commander in chief. This is just one of the areas where he has fallen short, and now is the time for him to get it together. 
>> What do you hear from mayors around the country? Obviously they're signed on to this and a part of this organization, but how adamant are they for change? 
>> Mayors are the ones who deal with this every day. And they know how to do it in a way that is consistent with the second amendment, but gets guns out of the wrong hand, because they do it every day. When a cop is shot on the beat, they get the call, they're held responsible. The president doesn't get those calls. Members of congress don't get those calls. So it's mayors who think about this pragmatically. Many of them are gun owners. Many of them are nra memrs, but they understand that if you give everybody a background check, if you had a federal trafficking statute, if there were an atf director to give that agency the juice it needs to really get the job done, you could do a lot to keep illegal guns out of the wrong hands without doing anything to keep me or you from having all the guns we'd like. 
>> Mark glaze, I appreciate your time tonight. This may be a moment of change in american history when it comes to firearms. We shall see. Appreciate your work. Thank you. 
>>> We as americans will go to sleep tonight with a heavy heart. None of the words we used today seem to describe the heartbreak, the hurt and anger and the range of emotions all of us have felt. Our prayers are with the families and relatives of the victims. Tonight is a night for understanding. I think we can all understand that. And it's night that we need to cope with. But I do believe it's also a time we as a people come to grips with a changing society. We need to be the founding fathers on how to deal with the sickness in our country called gun violence. Hiding behind the second amendment doesn't cut it anymore. Hiding behind the second amendment can no longer be the shield for access. The people who wrote that document owned slaves, oppressed women, and were short wn tolerance. I say to you tonight that times change. People's attitudes change. And it's time our lawmakers realize that socty has changed. And despite the pressures of lobbyists, we need to move forward on gun violence in this country. And as a sportsman, I feel like I can speak with some freedom, that I have owned firearms for over 40 years in my life. I know we can change. I know I have changed. We need to have this discussion now. That's "the ed show." I'm ed schultz. He rachel maddow show" starts

(screaming) Gilda! Grab a disguise. Francine said I'm allowed to help you, but only for a couple of hours. I'll take what I can get. So here's the deal, as you know, today is the day of the Spooky Summer Soiree. The coolest costume party ever! Last year, I was a ferret. Well today, you can be anything you want to be, because I bought all the costumes at Haunted Hank's Discount Costume Store. Annie, didn't that cost a lot of money? Yes, it cost quite a bit of money, I had some help from my uncle, but this is important. Gilda...answer this question. Who is the most fabulous dresser in town? You, Annie, everybody knows that. Thank you, I think so too. But every year, every single year, Hector 

[00:02:00]


and his little pals have the best costumes at the costume party. And everybody loves them, and nobody notices me. Well, that is gointo change! Yeah! How? This year, they're all dressing up as animals dressed up as monsters, so cute. How clever. Marcus and Jessica haven't picked out their costumes yet, and now they won't have any costumes to choose from. And we can be whatever we want, and we're going to have the most amazing costumes at the party. And everyone's going to love me! And you too, of course. Here they come. I was thinking of dressing up as a bunny dressed up as a mummy, but then I don't want to get wrapped up in toilet paper. Marcus, you've been trying to figure this out for a whole week, and we got to get our costumes now. I know, I just want to think of a costume as good as yours. Ah yes...But not everyone can be spooky as a Hamwitch -- a pig dressed up as a witch. Man, that's good. Don't worry, we'll find something at the store. Sold out? What are we going to do? Hey, you guys!

   Electric Company... Electric Company!     ??????
What, is something funny? I can't take you seriously like that. Do not mess with Kittenstein, ok? Nobody messes with Kittenstein -- meow, meow. You want to add to that, Ghost-Rooster? Cock-a-doodle...Boo! Oh, that was so corny. Hey, you guys can say what you want, but we look awesome, and you guys just look like people dressed as people. But we just came from Haunted Hank's, and it was sold out. Wait, Hank's was sold out? Well, then why'd you guys wait 'til today? Because somebody couldn't make up his mind. That's you. Think Marcus, think. I've got it! I can be a chicken dressed as a vampire! I'm Count Chickula; I want to peck your face. Finally, Marcus! We'd be a little bird heavy, but I think it's pretty cool. (growling and howling) What do we have here? Bearwolf the werewolf, son! Nice man, where'd you get your costume at? I got it at a sidewalk sale down the street, this tail was only a quarter. Only 25 cents? Marcus, we should go. What do I need to become Chickula? Maybe a beak, nts, you already have a bunch of hats. Oh, a cape. Annie, I made a list of 26 possible costumes, would you like to hear them alphabetically, or sorted by creature? Gilda, I don't need a list, I am a brilliant dresser. You certainly are, Annie, I just thought you'd like a list. Francine loves my lists. Gilda, darling, today we do things my way. Come on, loosen up a little, huh? There you go, that's the spirit, come on, 

[00:06:06]


let's look at something else. Oh my, this is the one. You see that? Perfect. Let me see, let me see. Oh, ok! This is 100 pennies -- that's a dollar. Four quarters -- that's a dollar. Ten dimes -- a dollar. And three quarters, a nickel and two dimes -- a dollar. Marcus, we don't have time. Ok, so, I have seven dollars and you have ten dollars. I'll add my money to your jar. All right, that's $17, now give me the list of things that we need to buy. Ok. Perfect, so...we can use this to keep track of everything that we've bought and how much money we have left to spend. If we buy things, the amount of money will go down. I love it! Come on. Good luck, guys, time's a-wasting, we're gonna be working on the song for when we get to the party. And I like that costume! 
Let's do it -- ?????? Here come the animals...  ??????
What are they doing? Sidewalk sale. I think they're shopping for costumes. No, oh no, Gilda, do something! Uh... (humming) No, do something to stop them! Right. 
  ??????
So are we dressed as animals dressed as monsters, or monsters dressed as animals? Well, I am an animal, so I can't be dressed as an animal. So, you're just a monster? I thought you were a monster. I have not been this confused since werewolf wrote me a note asking me to take care of his kitten. You should watch this, it's funny. 
  ??????
Everybody loves good old letter "f." 

[00:08:08]


Sometimes it's the perfect fit, but sometimes we all need to spice things up a bit. Try "gh" and "ph" -- they both make the "f" sound too... So, if theetter "f" just isn't enough, try a sprinkle of "gh" and "ph" today. (howling) Help! (coughing) What's wrong? Werewolf's kitten has a co-ug. A co-ug? What? I don't know, werewolf left me this strange note. Werewolf has lost his mind. Oh, I see the problem. That says cough! See Mummy, sometimes the "gh" and the "ph" make the "f" sound. Now you tell me.

But it's still quite good. Why did you buy a pink button? It's a pig nose and it's only 35 cents. (snorting) Nice one, Hamwitch. All right, let's see... How much do we have left?

Meow! Hey, Hector, can you go online and search for a sidewalk sale on Summer Street? Yeah, of course. I'm at 714 Summer Street and there's no sidewalk sale here. Hold on, guys, hold on. Hey, I'm going to put you down for a second. That was easy, found it! "Greatest yard sale ever" -- 174 Summer Street. 174? It says, 714. Oh no, 714, 174! It was scrambled. Oh Scrambler! Kittenstein, get a hold of yourself. Jess, Annie's trying to mess with our costumes, ok? Just get to 174 Summer Street fast! Ok, I will. Come on, let's go. It's 174 Summer Street. If Jess and Marcus don't get their costumes, the Electric Company will only have the Frankenstein and the Werewolf, and the Foost. The what? The Foost. That says ghost. But I thought "gh" made the "f" sound. It usually does, but not always. Oh, I like when it does. Well then, you'll love this. 
  ??????
My neighbor is a space alien. Space alien! You only have two lives left. (chuckling) My animals are running all over the place, take care of them all or you're gonna t replaced. And he'll beam you with his eyeballs to outer space. Here we go. 
  ??????
You said "elepant." Elephant's the word. "Ph" makes the "f" sound in case you haven't heard. Yeah, yeah, Pesky Eddie, I got it, I know. 

[00:16:30]


Well, you better get it right, only one life to go. 
  ??????
You have succeeded, so we won't be needing you. Oh rats, this stinks! I just love what I do. "F" is by far the laziest letter in the alphabet, in fact, it's so lazy it doesn't even show up in theord "alphabet." But no "f", here's what I think happened... "F" called up "ph." "Ph!" "Ph!" I'm tired. Could you make the "f" sound for me in some words? Well, "ph" said... Ok, yeah, sure, I'd love to help out. So next thing you know, "ph" starts popping up in words like, Alphabet and Trophy. Whyy whyy whyy whyy So, "F" called up "gh" instead, and said... Oh man, "Gh!" "Gh," I'm tired. "Gh" said... Whoa, whoa, whoa Mr. Lazy Man, I'm busy. Please! I'll let you be in some cool words, huh? Like tough. Tough? I like tough. So next thing you know, "gh" started popping up in words like Tough and Rough. Until one day he said... "Enough! Where's "F?" And you know where "F" was? Fluffing pillows, for his four-day nap! I told you...lazy! 
  ??????
Hello Tom, nice costume. Thanks, I'm a pencil dressed as a monster. What's going on? Annie and Gilda are trying to stop Marcus and Jessica from getting their costumes. Wow! Now, they're all showing up at the same sidewalk sale. That should be interesting. 

[00:18:31]


Why don't you stop bouncing? 'Cause if I do, that happens. Excuse me, how much is this hat? Buy it, just buy it. Annie, you only have $11 left. Buy now, math later. How much does this cost? Ok here, three dollars and five dim, and a nickel; oh, I'll take these too, how much do they cost? 30 cents, ok, a quarter and a nickel; thank you. Annie, look. (gasping) Should we run for it? No, we have to keep shopping, quick, disguise yourself. Annie and Gilda, they're trying to buy everything, so we can't. Well, that's low. Better that they don't know that we know they're here. Marcus, shop like the wind.

Don't look at me, I never said it was B4. What on earth is a goo rocket? (yelling) Whoa! Crazy. But why is it called a goo rocket? Oh, never mind. Wait a second...Marcus, we can figure out the code. Look, the button is on the second row, so that's row B and it's two items over, B2. Uh...ha, ha! It's funny that you think that's right. So amusing. It's totally right.

=======================================================

Have anyone that survived it? 
>> One person was injured that suffered an injury and did survive. 
>> Can you confirm a body in the house was adult male? 
>> I can't confirm. I know about the secondary scene. It didn't have time to get in detail about that. I'll try to do it for 6:00. 
>> I'm not confirming the identity of the shooter. We have a tentative identification. We are still working with that. Not going to put it out there. He I'll identify the shooter at an appropriate time. But for our investigatortory purposes not appropriate to do that now. 
>> What is happening with hoboken, new jersey, the investigation there? 
>> It's part and parcel of what we do. I told you we will leave no stone unturned as we look at every facet of the investigation. Shooter, victims. We will look at everything. We will go in and out of state and work with the federal law enforcement, including the federal agencies if we need to, to answer every question to exactly what transpired here. A time-consuing process but we'll get it done. 
>> One shooter? 
>> Yes, sir. 
[ Inaudible ] 
>> it was k-4. Kindergarten through fourth grade. That is the school. They were all students of the school. 
>> All in kindergarten? 
>> I don't know the grade they were in. I don't know that. 
>> One class? 
>> One sect classrooms. 
>> I didn't find it out. Sorry. 
[ Inaudible ] that is the process. That is a good question. Are there students unaccounted for? We had to ensure we accounted for every student in the school, that includes someone who was absent for day because of illness that didn't come to school. That is part of the process. Now we have the identification process that is more difficult. It will be some time before we can give you that information. Probably won't be available until tomorrow. 

[00:02:15]


>> Can you identify weapon? 
>> We have seized the weapons, yes, we have. 
>> What kind of weapons? 
>> We will not discuss that. 
[ Inaudible ] 
>> we have been in contact with all the parents. We would not come up here until we have been in contact with all the parents. They have been fully informed and that's why it took so long to come up here. 
[ Inaudible ] 
>> that is a good question. Everyone believes that, you know, it's something that first responders do, that law enforcement does, we provided counseling for the first responders because this was a tragic, horrific scene they encountered. It's not something we want to see, not something we see every day. That is one thing we had done. The colonel made that perfectly clear that the people are to be spoken to and receive crisis counseling as required. 
>> Lieutenant, you have to be the face -- 
[ inaudible ] 
>> the lieutenant can tell you. A newtown officer. 
[ Inaudible ] sure. 
[ Inaudible ] 
>> the first thing I thought about was my own children. 
>> Lieutenant george sinko. S-i-n-k-o. 
>> Can you tell us now -- 
[ inaudible ] 
>> this is most definitely the worst thing we have experienced here in town. Tragic. Right now we're concerned about the family of the victims. Our officers are professiol and we will deal with this as well. 

[00:04:22]


>> Do you struggle getting together as counseling session? 
>> The local hospital, danbury hospital, offered their crisis intervention counselors. They will be available at reid intermediate school, on wasserman way. They are available right now if need be and they will be there all weekend. 
>> Are there pa gathering? Describe that. 
>> The parents certainly have gathered at the local firehouse, which is adjacent to the school. We have done our best to comfort them and try to reassure them we have done everything we can. But as mentioned, it's a difficult process to confirm the status of an entire elementary school. We need to be right when we do that. 
>> This is healing. We have to think about the families now and do everything we can for them. 
>> We can't confirm any of that right now. The investigation is ongoing. 
>> Are the parents finding out now? 
>> There are still parents there, yes. I don't have a number for you. I don't have a number for you. 
>> When did you realize -- what the magnitude was, how long did it take you to realize the magnitude? 
>> Minutes after our officers were there they realized what a horrific scene we had there. 
[ Inaudible ] 
>> I don't have a timeline on that. The officers responded immediately. As soon as they realized what they had, we asked for all the resources we could get. 
>> All right. Thank you. 
>> We're good. Finish this. What we're going to do, we'll come back just before 6 of:00, because I know of you around 6:00, get back with one more briefing and then we'll do scheduled briefings tomorrow. Some of you folks look tired and I'm sure you want to get some rest. We'll see if we can give you scheduled briefings for tomorrow. Okay? 

[00:06:40]


>> Where are you? Show me where. 
>>> That is lieutenant paul vance of the connecticut state police wrapping up the latest news conference in the tragedy in newtown, connecticut. Hard bitten officers, they're devastated by what happened when they found, when they walked in to an elementary school where at least one gunman walked in to that building and opened fire this morning. 26 innocent people are dead. 20 of them children. I'm john scott. Thank yo joining us for the special coverage of the breaking story. This is what we know so far. It happened after 9:30 a.M. Eastern time at sandy hook elementary school as classes got underway. Federal law enforcement officers are telling fox news that adam lanza was found dead at the scene. His brother is in custody in hoboken, new jersey. Their mother found dead at her house in connecticut. The f.B.I. Confirms two pistols and m-4 rifle found at the scene. Police have been updating through the day. And much of the information has been changing frankly. Three people rushed to the hospital, teacher and two children are all expected to be okay. The teacher was shot in the leg and the foot and the other children suffered nonlife threatening injury. Get to scene with rick leventhal who is there and has been throughout the day. Rick, describe what is going on there now. 
>> Well, john, we had another briefing from the state police regarding what they can tell us, what they are comfortable sharing with us at this hour. Remember the shooting was less than eight hours ago. The information has been changing throughout the day. But what we know now is they got a 911 call from the school, just after 9:30 this morning. Newtown, connecticut police officers went to the school. Immediately called for state police backup. When the rest of the officers arrived, they didn't wait. They went inside that school looking for children, looking for adults that could be brought out of the school and brought to safety with the knowledge that there had been a shooting inside that school. Officers located two rooms in one area of the school. That is where the 27 bodies, victims were found. Two of the victims were children who were taken to a hospital. And died at the hospital. 18 other children dead in a classroom. Five other adults dead in that school. Along with the shooter. 26, the shooter. 20 kids gunned down in classroom. There was confusion initially about the identity of the shooter. I have a apparently, the shooter may have been carrying his brother's i.D. He has been confirmed to us as adam lanza. 20-year-old man from hoboken, new jersey. His brother, ryan, at that address in new jersey, taken in custody by authorities. We are told ryan lanza questioned. Adam lanza the shooter who killed himself at the scene. We are told there is a secondary scene in new newtown, connecticut, police went to the scene, went in the house. Aapparently backed out and sent in a robot and located a body in that home. There is still confusion about who that person is who was located in secdary scene. We haven't been able to confirm. I've been told by sources that the mother was in fact killed. We can't confirm that is it the mother's body inside that home. The mother is a teacher. Apparently that was her kindergarten class. We're hearing that the kid went to the school to target his mother and killed every single kid in her classroom. As well as other adults inside that school. Horrific scene that played out in the quiet community. 60 miles east of new york city. In a very affluent community. The folks here are stunned. This isn't the thing that anyone expects to happen anywhere, let alone here in this quiet community in connecticut. Police at the school, still going through it, still processing that crime scene. It will take them days to do that. 

[00:10:37]


>> Understandably. Rick leventhal joining us live. Thank you. We'll check in with you later. Joining us now is brenda labinsky, the mother of a student at sandy hook elementary school. All of us as parents cannot even imagine the emotions that you went through today. How did you first get the word that there was trouble at the school? 
>> Well, I was home, i received a school announcement call. Normally we get if there is bad weather and the kids will be let out early. It's, it stated there was a shooting in newtown but didn't say the school. Or if it was the school. And all schools were lockdown. I didn't take it too seriously because we had something like this happen prior, but it was a shooting on the street and didn't have anything to do with the school. But then I received a text from the a.P. That stated there was a shooting at the school. That's where my daughter giz and I dropped her off. She is in the third grad. I drove my car and saw people I knew and they were hysterical. I said what happened? 
>> Were there police there? 
>> Yes. The fire house is by the school and you have to pass it. The fireman was there. Newtown police. Organized. Bringing the parents and the children in to the firehouse. All I heard was a neighbor who saw a little girl who was shot and she was dead and she was hysterical. Right then and there I thought oh, my gosh, my daughter! I run toward the school and i saw my daughter's friend katie. I said where isphia. I said where is she? And she said she is fine. And she was with her teacher. 

[00:12:37]


>> That had to be a moment of immense relief. 
>> Yes, the worst moment of my prior and the best one ever. But my heart goes out to this community, to this school. It's a wonderful, close knit school, everybody knows och other. It's very sad. 
>> There have been questions throughout the day as to the identity of the shooter of the ridgally it was thought to be ryan lanza. It turns out now police sayingite tess younger brother adam lanza, whose -- saying the younger brother adam lanza and the mother was teacher at the school. Did you know her? 
>> No. Never knew her. Never. 
>> Brenda, good to talk to you. I know that we are glad that your daughter is okay but so many people are suffering tonight. Our heart goes out. 
>> My player goes to them. Thank you. 
>> Ours as well. Brenda, thank you. So 26 people dead. 20 of them young children, tragedy that will ripple for weeks and months to come. When we come back, the president speaks to the nation about the tragedy. 
>>> Newtown, connecticut police department received a call for help at the sandy hook elementary school here in newtown. There were fatalities. There were 18 children pronounced dead at the school. There were two that were transported to area hospitals and pronounced dead at area hospitals and six adults pronounced dead at the scene, at the school. Governor's reported the shooter is deceased. 
>> We were just in the middle of gym when we heard some gunshots. And then the power went out and the gym teachers directed us to stay against the wall and everybody started to kind of panic. 
>> We heard a lot more gunshots and the ambulance came. But then the police addressed to us run out of the building and go to thement for. The fire department. 

[00:14:41]


>> It doesn't seem real. It doesn't seem possible. You read it in the paper or see it in the news and you're like my god, the poor family. Then something happened so close to home, it's like -- i think I'm still in shock to be honest with you. 
>> What has happened, what has transpired at the school building will leave a mark on this community. And every family impacted.

>> Jon: Fox news alert. Massacre at an elementary school in sandy hook, connecticut. 26 people dead. 20 of them young children. President obama getting emotional as he addressed the nation this afternoon. 
>> This afternoon, I spoke with governor malloy and f.B.I. Director mueller. I offered governor malloy my condolences, on behalf of the nation. And made it clear he will have every single resource that he needs to investigate this heinous crime, care for the victims. Counsel their families. We have endured too many of the tragedies in the past few years. Each time I learn the news, i react not as a president, but as anybody else would, as a parent. That was especially true today. I know there is not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelmingly grief that I do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teacher, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today for the parents, and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children. And for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well, for as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know their children innocence has been torn away from them too early and there are no words that will ease their pain. As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it's an elementary school in newtown or a shopping mall in oregon, temple in wisconsin, movie theater in aurora or a street corner in chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods. These children are our children. We are going to have to come together to take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. This evening, michelle andly do what I know what every parent in america will do, hug our children tighter. We'll tell them that we love them. Remind each other how deeply we love one another. There are families in connect who can't do that tonight and they need all of us right now. In our days to come they need to us be at our best as americans andly do everything in my power as president to help. Because while nothing can fill the space of a lost child or loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need. To remind them we are there for them, that we are praying for them. That the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories but also in ours. May god bless the memory of the victims. In the words of scripture, heal the broken-hearted and bind up their wounds.

>> Jon: Clearly emotional president obama making a statement to the nation this afternoon. Our chief white house correspondent ed henry was there. What was it like inside that room, sned 
>> Reporter: Jon, the reporters were trying to catch our breath. We have been covering this president for four years now and never seen him get personally emotional like that. Despite many tragedies. We have seen before, as he himself noted. This one hitting him and the nation perhaps a little bit harder. What you didn't see off-camera jay carney white house spokensman sitting a few feet away from me taking his eye glasses off to wipe his eyes. They have lowered the flag to half staff at the white house and boehner has done it as well. Partisan of recent days may be smaller, the fiscal cliff discussions interrupted. The president has now canceled a trip he was planning to maine next wednesday he was going to pressure the republicans to support his plan. Also, worth noting when the president talked there about taking meaningful action, he has been criticized from the left, after some of the other tragedies. For not getting specific. Not taking action on gun control. He now laid out a promise, basically, in the remarks in the second term he is going to, as he said, we need to come together the take meaningful action regardless of politics. The big question moving forward, though, maybe not today but moving forward will be what kind of action will it be, jon? 
>> Jon: That is the million-dollar question. Ed henry at the white house. Thank you. So chaos and heartbreak in connecticut. Town left trying to make sense of the horrible tragedy. Ahead we'll talk to bill hemmer who is just there on the scene. 
>> Earlier today, a tragedy of unspeakable terms played itself out in this community. Lieutenant governor and I have been spoken to in an attempt that we might be prepared for something like this playing itself out in our state. You can never be prepared for this kind of incident. ?????? ??????

>> Jon: Fox news alert. Shock and anguish in a quiet new england town. Gunman open fires in elementary school in connecticut. 26 victims killed in the school. 20 of them young children. Federal officials confirming the shooter is 20-year-old adam lanza. His brother also reportedly being questioned. Bill hemmer is live in connecticut where it all took place. Bill? 
>> Reporter: Good evening. We were on the air on "america's newsroom" when the news crossed it 10:30 eastern time. Initial report came out a teacher had been shot in the foot. We went a good stretch of time, as you recall, without a lot more information beyond that. Now this picture starts to come in full view about the absolute massacre that had taken place inside of this tiny elementary school. The thing that strikes you about that part of connecticut is how beautiful it is. We're a few hundred yards from the school. But imagine the young 5 and 6-year-old kids, they played here. This is their playground. In all likelihood on the weekend this is where they spent time with their families. This is stunning to come to towns like these and see reaction on the faces and in the eyes of the people you come across. We are at a coffee shop down the road an hour ago. We met a woman with their two daughters. I see in their eyes. I said how are you doing? They shook their head and said we're all right. The girl said, "today is my birthday." She asked me if it was her 9/11. She turned 11 today. She was not born on 9/11. A town understandably stunned. Just like the rest of the country. 

[00:31:22]


>> Jon: You know it will be some time before they reopen the school, maybe if at all. It will be filled with horrible memories for the children who were there. 
>> Reporter: Jon, I took a walk down there a short time ago. Through the woods down the hill. This wooded area surrounds the school. It's a tiny place. Kindergarten through fourth grade. It appeared to me like one single building there that was built in a square shape with a courtyard in the middle. The parking lot is not big. Right now, jon, there are state troopers, and investigators and cars that filled that entire parking lot. They had mentioned earlier today that in all likelihood they would not move the bodies for some time, because they want to assess the crime scene. You can imagine how grisly it must have been as they first saw the crime scene. Based on the news conference we have been given so far and tidbit of information there is so much still they do not know. 
>> Jon: Think about the anguish for parents who know or suspect their children are still inside that school. They cannot hold them, touch them or car res them or say goodbye. Not yet. 
>> Reporter: Jon, you think about christmas day, ten, 11 daysrom now. You know these parents already bought presents, some of them perhaps were already wrapped. Now they do not have a child to give that present to. You heard the eloquent words of the president a few moments ago. That's what so many parents feel tonight. To see the kids in person. To give them a hug. To express the love they have for them and gratefulness they have to be together. During the holiday season. So many in this town do not. 
>> Jon: Newtown, connecticut, which only saw one violent crime reportedly in the last year. Now this. Bill hemmer on the scene. Thank you very much. Let's take you to new jersey now, where the shooter's brother reportedly lived. Anna live in hoboken with more. What can you tell us what is going on there? 

[00:33:36]


>> Reporter: Jon, for people who are unfamiliar with the geography of the area, hoboken is southwest of manhattan. The building behind me is where the brother of the suspect, of the newtown, connecticut, shooting reportedly did live and was taken out in handcuffs earlier this afternoon. The streets have been blocked off. Cordoned off. They have police tape here, keeping the media at bay. We have spoken to police on the scene. They don't expect a lot more to be going on, although it was lot more of an active scene earlier today. There w also some preliminary confusion over the identity of the suspect in the shooting. If you will remember that, earlier today. We can tell you that 20-year-old adam lanza is dead and authorities say the brother who allegedly was here, ryan lanza is in custody. The home is in hoboken, new jersey, a tight knit community. They have been shaken by this. Police in new jersey are also dealing with some other things, too. There are reports that ryan lanza's girlfriend is missing. Another friend of his is also missing. 
>> Jon: That is interesting given what we know about what happened at the home where the mother lives. They have not identified the person or persons found dead in the home but the police have a huge investigation ahead of them. What about the neighbors there in hoboken, what are they saying? 
>> Reporter: They are completely shaken up, because a local newspaper earlier today $is a fluid situation. Reports are coming in. They are watching it unfold just like the rest of us are. Newspaper report came in someone was dead inside the home. So, of course, the neighbors are very concerned about that. Reports that the bomb squad was going through the building as well. All sorts of just terror. When they are hearing everything that happened just miles away. In newtown, connecticut. I did speak with the father of a little boy who is in day care. They were on high alert, because they are in the area and noticed the police activity. Take a listen to what he has to say. 

[00:35:52]


>> Obviously scary to see someone that can commit some act like this is living amongst you, you are walking probably in the same neighborhood. I don't know the person personally,be but obviously crossed paths from time to time. That is awful. 
>> The neighbors that we have spoken to are banding together and they say they will come through this stronger. No doubt has the community experienced the tragedy here lately. Between the flooding from super storm sandy and now all of this. 
>> Jon: Anna, thank you. 
>>> This event will rank as one of the worst school shootings in history. Harris faulkner has context and joins us now. 
>> Absolutely. Before I go to that, if you allow me to, I have been following other developments. This note in new jersey. Anna was talking about how one of the brothers, ryan lanza is in custody questioned in hoboken, new jersey. In the state of new jersey, on tuesday, december 18, this coming tuesday, the governor's office says they will order flags to be flown at half staff. N recognition and mourning of the victims in newtown, connecticut. And now the context, jon, that you were talking about. There is no way to compare one heart-breaking tragedy to another. We know that. And any other way that we would do it is maybe look at the place in history. Hard to concede that something could have happened worse than this scene. From april of 2007. A student killed 32 fellow students and faculty, at virginia polytechnic and state university in blacksburg, virginia. It is still the worst single act of gun violence in u.S. History. An the only school shooting that involved more fatalities than today. For so many of us today was a reminder of one day on april 20, 1999, when the now infamous became part of the american dialogue. We suffered great heartache as the two students opened fire and killed 12 other students about teacher and wounded 20 others before killing themselves at columbine high school. Looking further back to history now, really the first time the nation dealt with this kind of violence on a campus. August 1, 1966, austin, texas. A university of texas student killed 16 people and wounded 32 others in and a campus. Again today, now the second worst single day of violence at school. Virginia tech massacre in 2007 remains atop that horrible list. Jon, this is not unique to our nation. You will remember you and i were on there, reporting in july of 2011, in norway, that gunman who shot and killed at least 85 people at a youth camp there. Back to you. 

[00:38:41]


>> Jon: Similar events in russia as well. What would make someone want to do this? How do you help your child deal with it? Dr. Keith ablow joins us after the break to try to answer those questions. 
>> Teacher, which I'm so grateful for, there was just a small group, they rushed the kids in to the bathroom and they locked the door. And they just told the children that i hammering. Tried to keep them calm. The next thing I know, because it's hard to get a complete story, the next thing I know is that the police came in and knocking on the door to be let out of the classroom. When they were, she had seen GLASS AND BLOOD. ...so as you can see, GEICO's customer satisfaction is at 97%. Mmmm tasty. And cut! Very good.

>> Jon:26 innocent people slaughtered inside an elementary school in connecticut. 20 of them children. Take you to scene now. Rick leventhal is there and has new information. Rick? 
>> Jon, I have just gotten off the phone with a federal law enforcement source who has known given me the timeline of events, as the feds believe it went down this morning. 20-year-old adam lanza lived with his mother here in newtown, connecticut. Woke up this morning, shot her in the face. Then got in her car and drove to her school, sandy hook elementary school, where she was a kindergarten teacher and shot 26 people in that school before killing himself. 20 children were among the dead. 18 at the school, two taken toa local hospital where they died at the hospital. And six other adults killed inside that school. Then the shooter apparently killed himself. But again what I have been told is that this kid, adam lanza, 20 years old woke up this morning at his mother's home here in connecticut. Shot her. Then got in the car and went to the school with three weapons, glock, handgun and a rifle described as m-4 type assault rifle and shot up that school. Police are at the school now. It's still an active crime scene investigation. Everything has to be documented, and then the victims' bodies recovered. There is one adult recovering in the hospital. The shooter is dead. The father apparently is still alive. I shouldn't say apparently. His father I'm told is alive and is speaking to the f.B.I. At this hour I new jersey. His brother ryan also alive cooperating with authorities. Neither person is suspected of having any involvement in this. The brother adam described as troubled is the shooter confirmed to me by federal authorities. 

[00:45:30]


>> We should point out it was reported, quite widely, that the father had been killed. But as you are pointing out. 
>> I'm not sure where that came from. I don't know where the report came from. There were reports an active scene in new jersey. That is true. The brother is talking to authorities. Adam lanza identified as the shooter. Killed his mother and went to the school where she worked for no reason and slaughtered people inside. 
>> Rick leventhal, thank you for the information, awful as it is. Thank you. Let's check in with dr. Keith ablow, psychiatrist and medical a-teamer who joins us live from boston. You hear what happened, dock toker and it's -- doctor, and it's conceivable. Is it mental illness, sociopathic personality? What are we looking at here? Looking at something deeply disturbed unfolding here, obviously. If you think about the act of walking in to a school and being undeterred, by the injuries, fatal injuries that you are inflicting on one after another child then your capacity to feel for others is entirely shattered. What we call this will be determined in days and weeks to come. Was it a delusion? Did this person think that by doing this, he was ridding the earth of evil? That is one kind of illness. Was this person in some way devoid of empathy because of childhood events of his own? Did killing his mother really play in to this because of some horrible turmoil in that family? But I will tell you this, the bottom line is that we will find out, I would predict that there were signs. That this was a deeply disturbed person and that the signs should have or could have been taken more seriously, because we see that again and again in these instances. 

[00:47:39]


>> Jon: But why the children? I mean, the mother wasn't even there in the room. As sge or twisted as it may sound, I could imagine going to the school if the mother was there and then the children become, you know, part of this terrible shooting gallery. But she apparently was already dead. Why go to her classroom? 
>> It would all be conjecture at this point. Speaking from a psychodynamic standpoint what you have somebody who takes his mother's life and then takes the lives mof children. Were he here or could we speak to his brother we'd say I want to hear about your brother's childhood. Was it marked by terrible pain? Is this some kind of symbol? Symbol of what heed through? Did he have it in for your mother's job? Did he feel she should have been paying attention to him? Irrational but these are irrationm acts that still you can write a story that explains what has happened. Once you understand how that person has been thinking. My guess is that he revealed some of the thoughts before this. And we've got to get very serious in the country about taking those things seriously. And knowing what to do. We have to get the word out about community mental hea centers and police and the rest of it. 
>> Jon: Mental illness. Dr. Keith ablow, thank you. 
>> That's what it is. 
>> Jon: All right my friend. We expect to hear from the connecticut police again at the top of hour. We are awaiting a news conference with the latest information. We'll have it for you live as soon as it begins. the technology often comes with a set of equally impressive instructions ? Shouldn't something that's truly advanced, not need much explanation at all ? With the Nokia Lumia 822 on Verizon, there's not much to learn because it's powered by Windows... to let you do more than you ever imagined on your smartphone. Exclusively with Data Sense-- a feature that makes the most of your plan. Only on Verizon. ???????????????????????????????????????????????????? 

[00:52:59]


>> Jon: Fox news alert, we are awaiting an hourly update on the school shooting tragedy in connecticut. We know 26 innocent people were killed, 20 inside the school. 18 died at the school. Two were taken to a hospital and died there. Steve, a former police detective, a school security expert joins us now. How do you stop something like this? 
>> We have to review the current system. It's not working. We are putting this in the brains of individuals, to commit these crimes. Our educational institution, at this level with children that young are soft targets. Every school across america is a soft target. We need to revamp the system. If we have to put a police officer in every school, we need to do that. We need to train our teachers. They are the first line of defense. We need them to step up and answer for the young children. Older people, we can tell them. But the children have seen dozen of fatal shootings, none of them real. They are occurring on tv. They haven't got the concept. It's many years before the effects set in on them. 
>> The shootern't go in a police department, doesn't go to a military base. He goes to where there are absolutely unprotected individuals, unable to fight back. 
>> Cowardly act. Educational institutions are set up so this type of thing can occur. We have seen this time and time again. The school teachers, educators, right now it's not on their mind. It's not on their mind that they will have to go to school and defend themselves and the children's lives. 
>> The website said they lock it down at 9:30. The shooting happened at 9:40. Maybe a slight slip in brothers and maybe not. Apparently the shooter was a son of one of the people. Probably familiar with whoever operates the buzzer to let them in. 
>> And a soft target, such as the school, I would imagine that if you really want to get in, you are going to get in. More security, more techniques, it's got to be evaluated. It will have to be at the higher level. Put together a panel of experts review this over one period. This report is going to be extensive. 

[00:55:10]


>> Jon: I believe it was former new york city mayor rudy giuliani said even if you have armed guards at the school you'd probably wind up driving the suspect to some other place, where there are no armed guards tox a shopping mall or a public park or something like that. 
>> What you might do if you had an armed security law enforcement professional i would say that would engage him, it would give notification to the school and we could protect our children. Lock down, get the doors locked. You can't, I don't care how powerful the weapon you have, you won't shoot a lock off the door. Shut the doors have the bar interior, keep the kids on lockdown up againsthe wall. Lights off. Move to another classroom. The more time we have, the more time to get law enforcement there, when the seconds count it takes us minutes to get there. 
>> Jon: I remember being on the air in the 9/11 attacks thinking this is a day that ev changes in this country. It really did. You look at creation of tsa and the wars that came after. Is this event something that is going to bring about monumental changes, whether they are effective or not, in school security? 
>> I am hoping that it is. I believe it is going to prompt some changes; is such as, 9/11. I am feeling the emotional effects of what I felt on 9/11. It spent a week down there. It will profit change. Just like we had very lengthy study, with virginia tech. This is also -- they will be there for a long time and they may never go back and open the school up. 
>> Jon: But the world has always known mad men. If there are always mad men in the future, they will always find a way to inflict carnage, are they not? 
>> Beyond comprehension, beyond eel. We can learn for it. Yes, they will. If we protect ourselves. Reason, our schools, educators are the first line. If we don't have the law enforcement there. Every school across the nation has policy in place. Not good enough. It needs to be improved, revamped and improved. We have can't let it happen again. 

[00:57:14]


>> Jon: But that is easer is said than done, isn't it? 
>> I know. It's not a solution that will occur overnight. Lengthy solution over time. There will probably be more mass shootings between now and when we find a better way. 
>> Jon: You can't put police officers full-time around the clock in every school in america, can you? 
>> We have some schools that do that. Who would think newtown, connecticut, suburban community. 
>> Jon: One violent crime in the last year, we're told. 
>> We aren't prepared as a society to deal with carnage. We are not prepared to deal with this type of violence. When it happens, what happens, most of the people freeze. Look at the subway killings. The people had no clue what they should have done in new york city. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Jon: Just so our viewers know we are still waiting a news conference expected now at the top of the hour. From the state police in newtown, connecticut, where the terrible shooting happened. They have been updating reporters fairly regularly throughout the afternoon. After a morning in which there was precious little information about what happened there. The early reports indicated that three people might have been shot and taken to the hospital. But that there was no indication that bloodbath was as severe as it was. So if you were running things at that school, steve, what do you do when it finally opens up presuming it does again? 
>> Believe your eyes and ears but when you hear gunshots or if you see -- I can't comprehend he wasn't at some point observed by someone walking in to that school. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Calling an alarm. Believe eyes and ears. If you hear gunshot run from the carnage. The fatality did occur in one classroom. Disturbing as this is. 
>> Jon: That I believe is richard blumenthal, the former attorney general in connecticut who arrived the podium. The others, I'm not familiar with at this point. We are also expecting that we will hear something new from police about this incredible tragedy. Once again, 20 children murdered in their classroom. Six adults as well. We are going to continuebe to bring you the latest information throughout the evening here on fox news channel. I'm jon scott. "Special report" is up next.

=======================================================

Re with the victims and their families, fair, balanced and unafraid. 
>> This is the fox report. Tonight mass murder at an elementary school. Dozens are dead after a gunman opened fire on children. 
>> Just after 9:30 this morning, newtown police received a 911 call. 
>> It happened just as the school day was beginning. 
>> They didn't tell us anything. 
>> I just heard the principal was shot and killed. My son was in the gym when it happened. 
>> They rushed the kids into the bathroom and they locked the . 
>> By the time the gun fire ended, blood and bodies were everywhere. 
>> I know there is not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. 
>> Tonight the shooting spree at a grade school. I'm bill hemmer. Evening, in for shepard smith. We're live in newtown, connecticut, small town, 90 minutes north of manhattan that right now is dealing with the aftermath of an unspeakable crime. The murder of innocent children. It happened at sandy hook elementary, connecticut state police saying a gunman walked into that k through fourth grade school earlier today, around 9:30 local time, and opened fire. Investigators say he murdered 20 children and six adults. 
>> The kids were terrified. They were terrified. They had just witnessed something and they were terrified. 
>> Many of them were friends of ours and pple socialize with. It's painful right now. 20 children. This image shows connecticut state police leading children away from the school, each of their small hands on the shoulders of the children in front of them as they walk from the scene where a mad man killed their friends. This woman was on the phone waiting to hear about her sister a teacher at the school. We do not know tonight what happened to her sister, whether or not she's alive or among the dozens of dead inside that building. Reports indicate the gunman is named adam plan zoo, age 20. Segmenters say he died inside the school as well, apparently committing suicide after inflicting unimaginable pain on so many families. Including his own. State police confirm the gunman shot somebody else all before this at the school. Somebody he lived with. That victim, apparently his own mother. Fox news has confirmed the gun that he used were hers. All legally purchased and registered, glock and hand guns and a semiautomatic rifle. The weapons used to murder 27 people today and shatter countless lives in connecticut. We have team fox coverage. Molly line with us. But we begin with a fox report chief correspondent jonathan hunt with me live in newtown tonight. It is hard to imagine what these children went through today. 

[00:03:10]


>> It is the terror that they experience today, bill, unimaginable. The pictures that you see, those faces filled with tears, the faces filled with terror give you some idea. These were tiny children, ages between five and ten, we were told being brought out of that school in the middle of a horrific scene. Their terror perhaps only matched by the terror of parents who heard that this scene was unfolding and rushed to the school in a desperate search for their children. Listen. 
>> Doesn't even seem real. It just does not seem like it's even possible. 
>> There is no words. It's shear terror and a sense of immediate urgency and to get to your child and to be there to protect them. 
>> Now, we're told that as they were being led out, the children who survived this slaughter, were told by cops and teachers to cover their eyes. One can only imagine they were told that because they were literally stepping around and over the bodies of their classmates, bill. 
>> There has been a lot of confusion throughout the day on the facts of this story. We're trying to sort this through the hour and urge our viewers to be parent as we work through it. There is a lot of confusion about the shooter. What can we report? 
>> What we're being told now by u.S. Officials is that the shooter is 20-year-old adam lanza. There was confusion earlier because he may have been carrying his elder brother, ryan lanza's i.D., His elder brother is 24. He's in custody. He's helping the f.B.I. With their questions, apparently being very cooperative. Not a suspect in any way. But the shooter, we're told, this 20-year-old adam lanza. According to rick leventhal, who has been leading much of the reporting today on this, adam lanza woke thumb morning at his mother's home, shot her in the face and then came to this school. Imagine the scene right now in sandy hook elementary. Though the bodies of the children, many of them still there, we are told, and the difficulties are caught in identifying it, the only way because these kids obviously don't carry i.D., Is for the parents to actually identify the bodies themselves. Governor malloy talked about that difficult process earlier today. Listen. 

[00:05:40]


>> Our police personnel and others are doing the utmost to clear this situation as soon as possible to return these children to their parents or these led ones to their fellow loved ones as quickly as possible. And we'll work with all of the residents of this community and connecticut to make sure that we do, in fact, get through this. 
>> Just imagine, bill, that many of these parents have probably already bought and wrapped christmas presents, put them under the tree. They'll never be able to give them to their kids. 
>> Ten or 11 days from now. We have been told that inside that school it's a grisly scene and it's not simplistic,eaning that there is a lot of evidence these investigators have to go through. The mind reels when you think about it. If you're a police officer arriving inside that classroom FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE HORROR-x/ YOU Mn ????ST HAVE SEEN. There are accounts apparently that am so of the first responders are pretty broken up. 
>> Police officers and firefighters. There was a fire house very near sandy hook elementary school and some of those firefighters were among the first to get there. We heard reports, we did not see it with our own eyes -- but heard reports that many understandably were leaving the school in tears. They had gone in obviously, found 20 children among 26 dead. It is obviously there will be a lot of counseling for the children, for the parents, and as the cops said today, for the first responders. Listen. 
>> The first responders to come together, counselors, it's amazing how the immense amount of family that's shown in front of newtown. Everyone is coming together, supporting everyone, working together, trying to answer all the questions as to how and why this occurred and trying to lend support to all the people involved, including the victims.

>> Almost impossible, bill, i think ultimately to even put into words the amount of pain being felt in this community. 
>> I've been with you throughout the day and terrific work under trying circumstances and many in the town, you really feel for what they're going through. We should get briefing from the sheriff's department this hour. When that happens, we'll bring it you want to investigators say they found the suspect's mother dead inside her home. Not far from the school, about ten miles. That's what federal law enforcement sources are telling us tonight. Local police have not yet confirmed a lot of this, but molly line is working that part of the story. She is outside the mother's home here in nearby newtown. What do we know about what happened inside that house that was owned by nancy lanza? Molly, good evening to you. 
>> Bill, much of the information has been gathered from authorities here in coecticut at the federal level and from rick leventhal who spent much of the day with the authorities attending those press conferences and he'll have a lot more detail information to come in this hour. But what we know about what happened this morning is that adam lanza got up, shot his mother, nancy lanza, in the face, who is a teacher at the school where much of the horrific activities happened today. He then gathered her weapons, registered weapons in her name, two hand gun and a rifle, got in her car and drove to the school. Those are the activities that happened here in the neighborhood that we know about. A horrible circumstance, particularly when you look down a street, upper class homes, beautiful christmas decorations. Horrific activity, nothing would have been expected like this. 
>> Molly, you had a chance to speak to a lot of people in the small town. What are they telling you about how they're trying to process and understand this? 
>> You know, it was an emotional experience all across the community today, particularly when nobody had any idea what was going on, particularly when text messages were coming to parents' phones. We spoke to a woman who worked at a cafe. This is a small town with independently owned businesses lining the streets and she said there were a number of mothers at the school getting the phone calls and text messages, absolutely horrifying, running from her store and her fear is that she will know some of those children that were killed today. We had a chance to speak with a woman who owns a hair cutting place for kids, specifically for children. She says for many of the victims, she suspects she may have given them their first hair cut and their second hair cut and third hai cut. This is a very small community with small businesses lining the streets. Really the type of place where everyone knows everyone else and there is a wait and see now to find out who among them are among the victims. Bill. 

[00:10:35]


>> Indeed there is. Thank you. Molly line, about ten miles from our location right near the school here in newtown, connecticut. Thank you for that report. I met a young girl earlier today. She said it's her birthday today. She turned 11 years old and she asked her mother if this will be her own 9-11. There is so much confusion, as you can imagine, as people sort through this. We are learning, by the way, more tonight about the family of the suspected shooter. Harris faulkner spoke with a source close to them. She's live in our studios in new york and good evening to you. 
>> Good evening. As we've been saying for the first three hours of reporting on this story today, we were being told by authorities a man in his 20s named ryan lanza was the shooter and was dead. Tonight, of course, we know and have told you his younger brother, adam, is the one who is dead, suspected of carrying out the massacre, wearing his older brother's identification. But we also know that original suspect, ryan lanza, has been in custody for much of the derek being questioned in hoboken, new jersey. Officials believe ryan lanza is cooperating and not believed to have been involved in the rampage. Fox news has confirmed ryan lanza has a facebook page. It is active. We're not showing it here. But it lists him from newtown, connecticut, and living in hoboken. It caught our attention today when he or someone else on his behalf began leaving messages on-line via twitter about ryan lanza not being the shooter and saying his facebook page showed a man who had not done the horrible thing in connecticut. At the same time, a source telling me ryan was part of a family that lived a very quiet existence. The dad often visited ryan lanza when he was enrolled at quinn pee yack university and the two appeared to have a good relationship. But that ryan talked so little about his family that even those people who knew him for years knew very few details about them. Not one picture of his family inside his college room. No mention of his brother, adam. It seemed as though ryan's parents were divorced, but few people were sure about that. In fact, I can say that they are divorced. The dad, peter lanza, lives not far from the scene in connecticut. We're told he's still talking with f.B.I. Agents, but not suspected of having any role in what played out today. Bill? 

[00:12:51]


>> Hair I thank you for that. We'll be in touch later this hour. Harris faulkner report not guilty new york. Average class size in this school district for kids in kindergarten, 17. The last serious crime reported in this town? Two yearso. 2010. Much more ahead.

>> Bill: Our coverage continues live. The elementary school massacre in newtown, connecticut. I'm bill hemmer, good evening again. A shooter entered a school earlier today shooting to death 20 children, six adults. Alexis says she was in a classroom when police burst in and told everyone to hide in a corner. Nowhat happened with her daughter and good evening to you. Wow. What a day this must be. 
>> Unbelievable day. She's holding up and she's been a trooper. We're doing a lot of talking and a lot of communicating and a lot of extra hugs and kiss. 
>> Bill: How do you communicate with her now, lynn? What are you talking about? 
>> We're honest with her and she didn't know that the principal had been killed and so she had heard that on the news. I sat down next to her and explained to her what had happened and the man that did all of this is no longer here. We talked a lot about feelings and talked a lot about how are you doing and is there anything u would like or what do you want to talk about, or -- just in general, just how are you as a person? She's eight. She's not two. So there is, unfortunately, you can't hide things from children at this age. So we're just in constant communication with her to kind of check in and say, are you doing okay? Or what are you thinking about? Are you sad? Her and I journal back and forth very often. So we will continue to do this. And it's been a great tool for the two of us and we'll write diffent things that happened during the day or if we're feeling happy or sad or something is bothering us. So this will be a phenomenal tool that we will have going forward. But she's been open and honest and she is sad and so she's just like mama, are you okay? I'm like, honey, I'm more than okay. I'm just worried for you. I'm worried for their friends, for our friends at the school and everybody that we've been in contact with over the years. 

[00:19:13]


>> Bill: Lynn, you sound like a terrific mother and alexis is lucky to have you. I know tonight you feel very lucky to have her. Thank you for sharing part of your story with us today. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Bill: So many people across this country really, their prayers are in your corner. They're pulling for you. 
>> We appreciate everything. Thank you. 
>> Bill: You bet. Our best to alexis. Okay? B. 
>> You bet. 
>> Bill: All right. More from connecticut in a moment here. Also we're going to get a bit more from washington, d.C. As officials, including the president, expressed their shock and sadness today as our coverage continues. We are live in newtown, connecticut, tonight on a day that --?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? 

[00:23:13]


>> Bill: Now thehe scene inside of saint rose, a local church here in newtown, connecticut, a vigil began about 23 minutes ago. 7:00 o'clock local time as that service continues. There is a church down the road, st. John episcopal church. There is a sign outside that says, healing prayer today at all the churches in this community, including this one at saint rose, we watnd pull for the folks who are gathered here tonight. 
>> I haven't the words that makes the pain of what happened today easy to bear. I'm heart broken as I know all of you are. But nothing hurts more than the loss of innocence, but no more so with those that are left. I'm heart broken and I know many of you share my grief. I have a simple prayer, I turn to god in times like this. My prayer is very simple. Show me and show us the way to wrap our arms around those families that have been so affected by this event. Show us how we can heal and how we can help them heal. By great faith and love for this community. I know we are a good and gentle place. We will somehow manage to get through this horrible event burks we need to do it together and we need to wrap our arms and loving support around those families who have lost a child. I thank you all for being here. I knew that we would. 
>> Bill: This is only the beginning. Only the beginning for a very long healing process, only ten hours into this horrific story here in newtown, connecticut. Ientioned st. John episcopal church, which is down the road from here. It is open. The doors are open of the the lights are on and the sign outside says healing prayer today. As I mentioned, the healing is just underway. President obama fighting back tears, speaking to the nation from the white house about the school shooting. A gunman killing 26 people, including 20 young children. The president saying he reacted to this news not as a president, but as a parent. 

[00:25:30]


>> The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of five and ten years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. 
>> Bill: There is a lot of that emotion throughout the country tonight. The president ordering flags at the white house, all government buildings and military bases to fly at half-staff for the next few days. House speaker john boehner tweeting earlier he's doing the same with the capitol in tribute to the victims and their families. He added the hash tag, pray for newtown. Ed henry joins us live at the white house tonight. The president made it clear, the federal government stands by this town in connecticut. 
>> No doubt about it. Good evening, bill. You're absolutely right. You sought the raw emotion from the president. I was sitting a few feet away from jay carney, the white house spokesman. He took his eyeglasses off at one point, was wiping his eyes as the president spoke. You don't normally see that, obviously, around here at the white house when they've been going through the fiscal cliff and all these other major issues. All that is on the side lines now, at least for a few days. Bottom line, you mentioned the flags lowered to half-staff here. They have to go forward with the business of government, though, because as you also noted, the president called the connecticut governor today. He have also called the f.B.I. Director, robert muller, and pledged all federal resources to assist in this investigation, help state and local authorities. As I mentioned in terms of the fiscal cliff, the president was supposed to travel to maine next wednesday. Pressure republicans out on the road about getting a fiscal cliff deal. I'm told that trip has been canceled. They may obviously have to be dealing with a memorial service next week, bill. 

[00:27:30]


>> Bill: Ed, there was a mention today where the president seemed to make news on gun control. What was said there? 
>> He did. Earlier when there had been other tragedies, whether it be tucson or aurora, the president spoke generally about a national conversation on this issue, but had not followed up with action. Today he suggested very clearly that in a second term, that may change. Take a listen. 
>> These neighborhoods are our neighborhoods and these children are our children. We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. 
>> Bill: Captain mark kelly, the husband of former congresswoman gabby giffords, who is still recovering from that shooting in tucson, he today said that she sends her prayers from tucson to the people there where you are in connecticut and captain kelly added that he believes a meaningful discussion of those gun laws is long overdue. Bill. 
>> Bill: Thank you. Ed henry on the north lawn at the white house. We're watching this memorial here in newtown. The governor of connecticut has just gone to the pulpit there. Let's drop in here for a quick moment. 
>> May god bless our children who are with us today and those who were taken away. My god bless the adults who lost their lives today. Thank you. 
>> Bill: This is small town america, beautiful rolling hills, only 90 minutes north of new york city. Neighbors know neighbors and families know families and they're going to need each and every one to get through this. We have live coverage where shortly after today's shooting, police took the suspect's brother out in handcuffs. What happened there? A live look inside of saint rose church. You were just watching where members of the community gather for the first of many memorial services. That's coming up as we approach the bottom of the hour and the top of the news that on this day is so, so sad. 

[00:29:42]


>> You speak eloquently in community n embracing each other, not just by your physical presence, but by all of your emotions and sending a message to all of america, and believe me, the hearts and prayers of america are with you tonight. Thank you for being here obstacles military families face, we understan at usaa, we know military life is different. We've been there. That's why every bit of financial advice we offer is geared specifically to current and former military members and their families.

Police say a man walked into sandy hook elementary school, killing 26 people, 20 of them kindergarten children. 

[00:33:59]


>> Evil visited this community today. And it's too early to speak of recovery, but each parent, each sibling, each member of the family has to understand that connecticut, we're all in this together, will do whatever we can to overcome this event. We will get through it. 
>> Bill: We are piecing the story together literally as we move throughout the hour tonight. Here is what we know. The shooter, identified as 20-year-old adam lanza. Sources say he killed his own mother in her home where he lived before committing mass murder at that elementary school. Rick leventhal live at the spot where police have been updating us throughout the day and we expect a briefing again sometime later tonight. You have aot of information. What more too we know about how this unfolded tonight? Good evening. 
>> Good evening, bill. As you mentioned, according to sources, adam lanza woke up this morning in his mother's home in newtown, connecticut, shot her, apparently in the face with one of three weapons and he then took to the school, drove there in his mother's car. His mother apparently worked at the school. Some are saying she may have been a substitute there. In any ehave not, adam lanza, according to sources, walked into the school and began shooting innocent children and innocent adults. As you mentioned, there are 20 confirmed children dead and six adults. Adam lanza then apparently killed himself with one of those three guns. He used a glock, six hour and what's described as an m 4 type semiautomatic rifle. This shooting transpired just after 9:30 in the morning. Police, local police were called. They arrived at the scene. Immediately called state police and as officers arrived, they went right inside that school searching for students and teachers to bring to safety. They all -- they did get out, everyone else who hadn't been hit by this gunman, got out of the school. They were taken to a nearby fire house, which was set up as a staging area. Then as frantic parents who heard about the shooting were arriving on scene, those parents were reunited with their children at that fire house. Then were able to go home. Bill, you can imagine the terror many of these kids heard the gun fire, some of them saw the gunman. Some kids apparently saw this gunman come into their class and shoot their teacher and ran out and managed to get out. Unfortunately, 20 innocent children and six other adults did not. 

[00:36:44]


>> Bill: We are told in a many of the children were told to close their eyes and run and once they get outside, to run toward the fire house, which seeing the school and the fire house and the road that leads to it. This is a picturesque place to send your kids to school. A small community with a small school building, just about one building comprises the entire campus with a baseball field behind it. Now, rick, here is what we're trying to figure out. This gunman, who is now dead, apparently has at least one brother. He allegedly shot his mom in the face. She's dead. But he has a father as well. What do we know about the members of the family and whether or not they are giving information tonight? 
>> My understanding is that the father is with federal authorities in new jersey and is being questioned by the f.B.I. And other authorities in new jersey, along with the brother, ryan lanza, who earlier today was being identified as the shooter. Apparently there was confusion because adam lanza, may have been carrying his brother's i.D that may have led them to the brother's apartment in hoboken. That's where they found the brother, ryan, questioned him. I'm told he is being cooperative. His girlfriend being cooperative as well. And the father has been described as being cooperative, too. There are some reports that the family hasn't really spoken with adam much lately. We can't confirm that. What I can tell you is that the father and the brother are being questioned by the f.B.I any insight they may be able to give to adam's mental state obviously would be valuable in this investigation. Bill. 
>> Bill: Yeah. Absolutely critical. You're right about that. You have to think that investigators go immediately to the relationship that this killer ha had with his mom. Is there any sign that anyone has talked about that may have sparked this rampage? 
>> No idea. None whatsoever. And when I was talking to one of my sources, a federal agent who has seen it all and done so much in the field of law enforcement, he was as stunned as we all are at the way these events unfolded. Stunned that not only this young man who shoot and kill his own mother in her own home, but then more stunned that he would then go the school and open fire. His mother wasn't there. His mother was home. He went to the school and killed those people, according to authorities and it's just, at this point, no explanation why. 

[00:39:12]


>> Bill: Rick, thank you. Rick leventhal has been on scene all day. The news broke around 9:30 in the morning and about an hour later when all the details started to unfold, it just got worse every time a report came out and here we are tonight trying to piece this together. Police in hoboken, new jersey, say that they are talking and questioning the suspected gunman's brother, as rick was talking about. And two people who might be his roommates in new jersey. Hoboken right across the hudson river from manhattan in new york city. You might remember seeing pictures of it under water after super storm sandy. Anna kooiman is live in hoboken. What are you figuring out about the scene and what it's like behind you there? 
>> Bill, yes, we're piecing things together just as you are. The building behind us apparently, the apartment home of the brother of the shooter, 24-year-old ryan lanza, as well as two other people. The building is still roped off with polic tape. We got on the scene about 4:30 this afternoon and we counted about ten f.B.I. Agents and hoboken police here. They did begin wrapping things up shortly after. But earlier today, a very different scene. Chaos and confusion, which may have been sparked by a bit of information we received from a reliable federal source that ryan lanza's i.D. Ended up on adam lanza. That federal source also telling us that earlier this afternoon when ryan lanza pulled up to this apartment building with his girlfriend, he noticed police surrounding it. That's when he was cuffed and taken away apparently. He and his girlfriend both speaking with the f.B.I. And also cooperating with them. There had been reports that the girlfriend was missing. That apparently not the case. Also some preliminary reports that somebody was dead inside this building. That not the case, from everything that we're hearing. We've even heard it was possibly the father. Again, as rick leventhal mentioned, that federal source telling us that the father is speaking with the f.B.I. Here in new jersey, bill. 

[00:41:15]


>> Bill: You can imagine, too, we're trying to figure out what is fact and what is frankly not facts. Hoboken a crowded community and there are a lot of neighbors there. How are they react to go what they saw at that scene today? 
>> They watched it unfold just like the rest of us did and when the focus shifted ever so slightly to hoboken, of course, they became even more concerned. Some parents telling us the daycare in the area was on lockdown. They were getting e-mails about that. Let's take listen. 
>> Just rips through you. You don't know what to do. You don't expect on a friday afternoon at 2:00 o'clock that the jersey city bomb squad would be running through your halls. You think your family is having a normal day off afternoon and playing with his trucks and being who he is and he has to deal with this. 
>> Bill, residents in hoboken and connecticut really across america, hugging their children a little tighter tonight. 
>> Bill: Indeed they are. Thank you. Anna kooiman is on duty in hoboken, new jersey, following that aspect of the story. When there is more information from hoboken, we'll take you back there live. Our coverage continues here. In a moment, the emotional reaction that we're hearing from parents who say they have never imagined the horror would unfold the way it did today.

[00:45:21]


>> The identification. We have preliminary i.D.'S, but of two do it legally by law and properly. We would expect that the lieutenant and I will be here first thing in the morning between 7 and 8:00 o'clock and by that time, we're hoping to have positive identifications of all the deceased at that time. We will send you out a news release, a press release, if you're not on our e-mail list, get it off the a.P. Primarily it will include all the details we've given you for all the briefings we've given you during this evening. I see no need to keep you all here tonight. Do what you feel is correct, but we will do no more briefings tonight. Going to again, defer 'til probably 8:00 o'clock tomorrow morning. That's what we're shooting for. Couple quick questions and I'll try and answer them if I can. 
>> Anything about the injured victim? 
>> It was a female employee of the school who was wounded, who was injured. And is doing well. Definitely, yes. 
>> Are all the bodies still inside the school? 
>> I don't want to get into details. The medical examiner has been on the scene with all the proper personnel and they'll do what needs to be done. Again, primarily what we're looking at now is the positive i.D. To give some closure to people. 
>> We're hearing so many rounds were fired. Can you comment on that? This is going to be a very pain-staking process. 
>> I couldn't have said it better myself. This is -- the way we investigate major crimes and for those of you that aren't here on a regular basis, it's a very meticulous process. We leave no stone unturned. We use all the resources we have available to us. We will do that in this case and then some. This is a case of extremely large magnitude, as you know, between newtown and state police and our federal partners that we utilized and even out of state partners will help us reach out of state if anything crosses the state borders. It's going to take a long time. We will be processing this building and I'm just speculating right now, but at least until sunday. 

[00:47:35]


>> Have the parents been given access to the bodies of the children? 
>> No. 
>> How are you managing the identification. 
>> We've process in place and we're going to establish. We have a process established, i should say, in place that we're going to utilize to identify each individual. 
>> The identification tomorrow 
(inaudible). 
>> Cautiously optimistic we can have positive i.D. Tomorrow. That's the professionals telling us that, specifically the medical examiner and his team. Our investigators and working together, we're hoping to accomplish that. The families have been notified. The preliminary identification has been made and through process of elimination, the families have been told. We want to be absolutely, positively sure. 
>> You still had your eye on the scene earlier when it was crazy. What was their role? Is there still a role for them? 
>> Certainly, they're with us working with us. There were federal partners from the f.B.I., Atf, all offering a services and any specialization they have, offering a ability in case something crosses state lines. Simply stated, everyone has come together in the law enforcement community. This is a massive investigation. Many law enforcement agencies never have to undertake. We're certainly newtown, state police work side by side and utilizing any resource that we may need and we're very appreciative of all the help we're getting. 
>> You said this morning is there anyone but the perpetrator inside yet involved? Any accomplice? 
>> No, at this point in time, we're confident that we have the shooter in this incident. 
>> In the classroom, every child 
(inaudible)? 
>> I'd rather not do that, quite frankly. I've been a trooper a long time. My lieutenant has been in law enforcement a long time. It's just something that serves no useful purpose. It's horrific scene between our mutual experience and we've never seen anything like this. It's hard wrenching for us as it is for the families. I just would like to leave that. 

[00:49:43]


>> Is there an issue with the school? Did he attend the school? 
>> What we've got to do, we're looking at that. We're looking at all the history. We'll go backwards as far as we have to go in this investigation and hopefully we'll stumble on answers and we'll hopefully not -- but we want to be able to build a process and build a story and an investigation like this is like a puzzle. We want to put this puzzle together and form a complete picture so that everyone without any doubt whatsoever can understand what occurred. So what I like to say is that we'll come back tomorrow in the morning, let's say 8:00 o'clock in the morning, to let you know how we progressed overnight. As we prepare the list of positive identification, I want to do one list. I DON'T WANT TO DO IT[-WL8L q ??n7SQ?? PIECEMEAL Or a couple here or there. I want to do one final list. The minute that's done, we'll be here with it and we'll also post it on our web site so that it's available to everybody. 
>> How proud are you and the lieutenant of your officers with this situation, the way they were able to get those kids out of there and get as many out as quickly as possible? 
>> These guys, when they got to the door, were first in the door, and the surrounding pd's and the troopers, their training kicked in. This is something you train for. You plan for, you work towards. You hope you never have to use. And their training kicked in. They saved a lot of lives. They did a great job. Very proud of them. 
>> Tell us about the shooter. 
>> I'm sorry? 
>> What can you tell us about the shooter? 
>> I'd rather do that in the morning. Once we have positive identification of the shooter, we want to have all that information and hopefully we can tie up some loose ends first thing in the morning. I'd like to leave it where we are right now and we'll fill in the voids tomorrow as much as we possibly can. I'm sorry? 
>> (Inaudible). 
>> Medical examiner is managing the cases. He requests some equipment that's been brought in for him. They're there working now. 

[00:51:52]


>> How did you first hear about this shooting? Did you hear -- what were the first words? 
>> In a nutshell, it was a 911 call that came in to newtown police and the response was instant. 
>> From within the school? 
>> Yeah. 
>> One or multiple calls? 
>> I'm not sure. Yes, I believe so. But I don't know how many occurred. 
>> (Inaudible) what are they saying about the father and son? 
>> We've been in contact with any authorities, our investigators with any authorities that can assist them in furthering their portion of the investigation. Die know that new jersey has been mentioned. There has been two or three different locations have been mentioned, but not to read anything into that. Is if there is something significant about reaching over a state line or doing something that may be related to this case, we're not going to hide it from them. We'll make it available to you and certainly provide with you that information. But don't read something into it just because you hear we've gone to authorities in another state. That doesn't mean anything really. 
>> A number of resources you have here for this, how are you delegating in regard to the rest of the state? 
>> It's working fine. We've got people on extended shifts. Some people will work extra hours and suffice it to say, everybody is all hands on deck. We'll get this done and do whatever it takes to accomplish this in a timely fashion. I'm going to end it because what I'd like to do is give you a breck and give us a break and we'll be back at 8:00 o'clock tomorrow morning here. Okay? Thank you. 
>> Bill: That is lieutenant paul vance, connecticut state police. Frankly, he has been a standup gentleman throughout the entire day today. You just imagine what that man has seen inside that school building. Really rips your heart out. He said it himself, he has never seen anything like this in his life. It defies the imagination to see what he has gone through so far today. No more briefings tonight. The information is frankly it's been precious and few for several hours and there is a reason for that. The police here want to be careful that they're doing exactly the right thing at the right time with the right facts. Next briefing, he said, 8:00 a.M. Tomorrow morning when he believes there will be potive identification given not just on the victims, but also on the shooter, the gunman inside that school. My colleague, jonathan hunt, back with me this evening. Is is going to be a painful process and it just starts now. 

[00:54:28]


>> It will be a really painful process. You could hear the emotion there, bill, in lieutenant vance's voice when he talked about what he's seen. He talked about the training that the teachers have gone through, the training that the first responders have gone through. And how that kicks in. But at the same time, he had to admit this that there is no way you can train fully for something like this. That's why we heard and we were talking about it earlier, the reports that many of these first responders were leaving that school in tears. Just imagine witnessing that slaughter, the bodies of those tiny children on the ground. 
>> Bill: Yeah. The school itself is a couple hundred yards from our location here. We're at a local park called treadwell park. You know that those kids played here after school and they probably spent the weekends here with their family, soccer fields, football fields. You go through the forest here, down a hill before you come upon the school. Inside that school is the crime scene that they're trying to piece together so that we have a better idea what in the world was going on inside this young man's mind. 
>> And you think about what the community is going through, just to get back to your point about the kids playing here. This is a community. 
>> Sandy hook itself, about 10,000. So everybody is going to know somebody affected by this and then all the questions are going to be asked what, on earth was going through the mind of adam lanza, who has been identified as the shooter by federal officials talking to our own rick leventhal. He apparently woke thumb morning, shot his mother in the face, went to her school, went into that school and then for reasons we can not fathom, murder sod many children. 
>> Bill: Jonathan, we'll speak again had a little bit. Christmas is 11 days away. It was not supposed to be like this. Back live in newtown as our coverage continues. 

[00:59:23]


>> Bill: Another live look outside saint rose church where members of the community are gathering for the first of many memorial services and then the funerals start. Special coverage of the newtown massacre throughout the evening here on the fox news channel live editions of the factor factor and hannity and two hours with greta van susteren live here in newtown. When you are five or six-year old and 11 days away from christmas, you believe santa claus will be here very soon. In this case, on this day at 9:30 local time, the devil showed up.

=======================================================

Nbc, our continuing coverage of the mas shooting, this massacre at sandy hook elementary school will continue now into the night. Live from newtown, with chris jansing, please stay with us. 
>> Reporter:28 people dead in the nation's latest shooting massacre, but this time, the horror is at an elementary school. This is msnbc's live coverage of the shooting in newtown, connticut. The first call for help came just after 9:30. 
>> The school shooting at an elementary school in fairfield county, connecticut. 
>> Reporter: It is a small town, holiday lights are up everywhere. 
>> A young man wearing black. 
>> He entered the school, he was wearing all black. 
>> Armed with at least two weapons, carrying two handguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. 
>> And we are told opened fire, killing 20 children. 20 small children and several adults. 
>> We'll leave no stone unturned as we look at every facet of this investigation. 
>> This is one of the worst school shootings in u.S. History. 
>> They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings. Kids of their own. We are praying for them. That the love they felt for those they lost endures not only just in their memories, but in ours. 
>> Reporter: Good evening, I'm chris jansing. And in the volunteer fire department behind me there was supposed to be a christmas tree sale tonight. Instead, they're staging an investigation because 20 children and six adults were killed in a horrific act of violence here in newtown, connecticut. Twenty-year-old adam lanza reportedly killed his mother at their home, a kindergarten teacher, where they both lived. Then he drove to the sandy hook elementary school where she taught, and opened fire on the students and staff. 

[00:02:05]


>> I couldn't even process it here, like a shooting in newtown. And it was hours later when they started to come out with the numbers. And it just didn't seem real. It just seemed like, this is wrong. A lot of misinformation, and a lot of information given. You just have to say to yourself, this is not real. 
>> Reporter: The teenage brother of a sandy hook elementary school student described the terror in his little sister, the experience. 
>> She was very frightened when she came out. She was crying, all the other students were crying. And the thing she told me is that it really started when she heard gunshots and screams on the intercom, there were screams, the school was on lockdown, they were hiding in a tiny closet, all bundled up. When they left, the troopers, the fbi, told all the children to hold hands and close their eyes until they were outside. So obviously what was in there must have been very gruesome. 
>> Reporter: Now, police are still investigating a motive for the massacre, which is now the second deadliest school shooting in u.S. History, after the 2007 mass shooting at virginia tech. A police spokesperson s tonight that medical examiners are still on site and the identities of the victims are still being confirmed. Although the names could be released as early as tomorrow. 
>> It is a horrific scene, between our mutual experience we have never seen anything like this. It is heartwrenching for us. 
>> Reporter: Well, this afternoon, a visibly emotional president obama spoke about the tragedy. 
>> The majority of those who decide today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of five a ten years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings. Kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today. 

[00:04:43]


>> Reporter: Well, you can only imagine how this community is feeling tonight. Look at these crowds, an overflow crowd for a vigil held here in newtown tonight. And the connecticut governor, dan malloy, addressed the entire community. 
>> Keep in your prayers the children who lost their lives today. Keep in your prayers the adults who lost their lives today. Understand that a test is just that. That which we rise to, and answer. 
>> Reporter: Joining me now is david owens, he is a reporter for connecticut's hartford current newspaper. Thank you for joining us, I know you have done extensive reporting today. Let's start with the question, everybody is asking why, are there any clues today? 
>> State police say they have a lot of theories but they're not ready to talk about them yet. We don't know yet it is the classic profile. A guy wearing black, with a face mask, heavily armed and we're all just wondering why. 
>> Reporter: Heavily armed, we were told there were two guns on scene, two more in the car, legally registered to his mother. And then there was a report tonight that they found even more guns in the school. What can you tell us? 
>> My understanding, there were three weapons, a rifle, a handgun in the car, and two rifles with him in the school. 
>> Reporter: What do we know about the shooter? 
>> Not much, he was twenty years old, initially identified by his brother because he was carrying his brother's id. His name is adam lanza, we're trying to figure out. 
>> Reporter: And his bther did speak to police, because he was taken into custody in hoboken where he lives, and did suggest to police there was a history of mental health issues. 
>> That is what we hear, we just don't have confirmation on that yet. 
>> Reporter: And what do we know about nancy lanza? 
>> The neighbors, we spoke to them. They say she was just a loving person, somebody they really enjoyed. She was a fun person, they're just stunned. 

[00:06:52]


>> Reporter: There is no way to put into words how a community reacts to something like that. But you know this town, you know the people. As I said you have been spending the day here talking to folks. Is there anything that you could even say to try to help us to understand what it is like to be a resident here? 
>> Well, I don't live in newtown. I live in a similar community. And I think what we're seeing around connecticut is -- and around the country is people reacting with shock and horror to what has happened. And then, deciding that they want to try to do something to help. Whether that be offer a prayer, attend a vigil. Offer a hot meal. We don't know the names of these people yet. But there is a lot of people in newtown who do. And there is no doubt they have reached out and are comforting to the best of their ability, these people who have suffered this awful, awful loss. 
>> Reporter: You have been doing some great reporting for the current, thank you, so much, for being with us tonight. And joining me now is andrew paly, the father of two sandy hook elementary school students who thankfully were not harmed in this attack. Twin boys go to the school. Thank you for joining us. Good evening. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Reporter: Tell us first -- 
>> I'm sorry -- 
>> Reporter: Tell us first how the kids are doing? 
>> Remarkably well for what they went through today. We just got back from friday night services at our congregation, where there was a lot of support from the community there. And they even got up to speak to the crowd to let them know that they're okay. And that everybody else should be okay. 
>> Reporter: Did you have a chance to really talk them, to sit and talk to them about what they experienced today? And what did they tell you? 
>> That they were scared. We did have a chance to sit down earlier today. I was lucky that I was working at home. And when I got the call to go get them at the fire house, they -- you know, took the chance to get over there and hug them. And they told me that the first thing that they thought about was each other. That they were hoping that each other were fine, because they're twins and they're in separate classrooms. And they didn't know what was going on with either one until they got to the fire house. Each gave me their side of the story what was happening. And remarkably, they are doing extremely well. And you know, they heard shots. They were let out by police officers and their teachers. So you know, those -- they did very well. I'm very proud of them. 

[00:09:29]


>> Reporter: Were any of their friends lost? Do they know? 
>> Yes, obviously -- some of the adults that were killed, they knew very personally. And then, at least a few of the children they knew very well. One of them is a former member of our synagogu and the other is a very close friend to our synagogue. So with at least two that we know of, that died this morning we knew personally. So the boys are in shock. And scared. 
>> Reporter: And understandably so. And I can't imagine what it is like to be a parent and get that phone call. Describe to us, did you get a reverse 911? Did somebody call you? And what goes through your mind at that time? 
>> Yeah, there were reverse 911 calls. But it didn't seem like there was a lot of information. And a lot of information was coming in from a lot of different resources. Friends, people that I knew that were close to the situation. And they were -- I got a phone call after a lot of the reverse 911s. And it was from a mom named lisa. I don't know exactly who she is. But thank you, lisa, she called me and let me know that my boys were okay. That they were bh at the fire house and that they wanted me to come and get them. So I took the chance to jump in the truck and get to them as soon as possible. And we were all very happy to see each other. 
>> Reporter: I can only imagine. Are the kids sleeping now? Do you think that they will be able to get some sleep tonight? And have you been offered any services? I know there is counseling available, especially for the children who had to go through this. 
>> Yeah, there -- we have family coming over tomorrow for -- the last day of hanukkah. They're going to be there to suppthe children. They're making phone calls tomorrow to a lot of their friends just to make sure they're okay. We had friends over today at our house that were also from the school. And tomorrow, I know, tonight we had friday night services that we had. An outpouring of love and compassion and support from the community there. And then, tomorrow at 11:00, we're going to be having an open prayer service for the community here in newtown. 

[00:11:56]


>> Reporter: Well, we saw the response to some of the services tonight. And I do hope it is helpful to see the outpouring of support from this community. Andrew paly, it is so good to know that your sons are okay. And thank you for taking the time to talk with us tonight. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> Reporter: And this of course is an ongoing investigation with so many questions, just a short time ago I spoke with the spokes people for both the state and local police. Here is what they told me. And I'm joined now by lieutenant sinko of the newtown police department, and lieutenant vance with the connecticut state police. And I want to thank both of you under these difficult circumstances to be with us and for what you're doing today. I have to start with the heartbreak of this, if I can, lieutenant. Because I know that you were in that fire house behind me with the governor today when the parents were notified about the children who did not survive. Can you tell us a little bit about how they're doing, and can you describe even the emotion of that moment? 
>> It was a terribly sad situation to have to hear that message delivered to those parents, who had sent their children to school. To be educated for the day and to realize they will not see them again. It was heartbreaking, it was something that you know, we have seen death notifications in the past to see it done, to talk about such little, innocent children. It was heartwrenching, it was terrible. 
>> Reporter: We can only imagine what this is like for you, lieutenant. This is your community. You live here, I'm sure you know some of these victims. You know these families. How is this community coping? 
>> They're doing the best they can to stick together, everybody is pitching in together to do what they can. Main thing is keeping their families in their thoughts, right now, no words can really satisfy what they have to deal with right now. 
>> Reporter: I know that there is ongoing at the scene the efforts to identify the victims. And to be able -- for the parents to take their children home. And others who were lost there. What is the status of that? 

[00:14:09]


>> It is ongoing right now. We -- as you know, we have to be right with that -- the last thing we would want to do is tell a parent -- and give them wrong information. So we're doing everything we can to make sure we have it right. And as soon as we do, we will make those notification 
>> Reporter: By all accounts, this was an understandably chaotic situation. What are the unanswered questions you have, lieutenant, in your investigation? 
>> Well, there were many, as the lieutenant said. We're trying to expedite the identification for the families, to do it as quickly as we can. But even more so we have to peel this entire investigation , layer by layer, and answer every single question as to why this happened, how it happened. And certainly that will entail us looking into the background of the shooter, and the witnesses that we're going to have to speak to. Because we certainly want to paint a picture for everyone, a complete picture, of exactly what occurred there. 
>> Reporter: Have you been able to positively identify the victims? 
>> We have identified ten of them. But there is a process we work with the medical examiner to make sure there is no mistake in the process. And even as we speak, the medical examiner and his team are at the scene. They will w through the night. They're going to do everything they can to expedite this process and help the families in any way we can. 
>> Reporter: And I had heard a report that the state trooper is assigned to each family who has lost a child in this? 
>> That is correct, the colonel felt it was important to establish a communication link with these families. So there is no disconnect. They're not afraid to go and change clothes or have a bite to eat. Take care of themselves. But we want to make sure if they have any questions at all that we can immediately answer these questions. And if we have any information on scene during the investigation that we can immediately get it to them first, before anyone else has. 

[00:16:17]


>> Reporter: This is a tight-knitmmunity, there is a teacher who had a s that was shot by the alleged shooter in all of this, is there anything you can tell us to help us understand how or why this happened today? 
>> You know, no explanation is going to be good enough. All I can say is that we're going to explore every avenue there is, talk to every witness. Look you should every rock were. 
>> Reporter: Going to do our best to find out what happened here. 
>> Reporter: And -- 
>> right now, all I can think about are the families who have to live with what happened here. And -- they're the only ones i can think about right now. 
>> Reporter: And let me finally ask you about the investigation. I know a lot of different resources were brought to bear here. Do you have all the resources you need? And is this going to be a long and involved investigation? 
>> Well, yeah, the state police department is the largest department in the state. And what we've done is we have brought in not just one major crime squads, we brought in two major crime squads. And the detectives to work alongside with the newtown detectives so that we can do the complete picture. We don't just have the scene inside. We have the scene outside, that is every vehicle has to be looked at and examined. And we have a secondary scene that is away from the school that we'll have to process. So it is going to take several days just to complete the processing part of it. And several days to do the investigation that goes along with it. 
>> Reporter: Well, our hearts go out to everyone involved in this. And to everyone in the community, I know that you know not just the thoughts from the community, but the international coverage, and I know that from around the world, their thoughts and prayers are with you. Thank you, for the work you do. We do appreciate it. And coming up, we'll have more reaction from the scene, and details. And later, the emotional reaction from the president. 

[00:18:22]


>> Their children's innocence haseen torn away from them too early. And there are no words that will ease their pain. @ . 

[00:20:41]


>>> The first vigil services were held in newtown, connecticut. We'll have that next. This is an msnbc special report. 
>>> Her phone just went off because it was time to take her little boy for a cub scout meeting. And she realized, you know, i can't take them now. So those kind of moments are really, really hard on these parents. That was awful, I mean, these are people a week before christmas that just lost their joy. I mean, how do you live with that 
>> Reporter: That is a question so many people are asking tonight. And hundreds of people gathered together at local churches here, vigils were held tonight to pray for the victims and their families. Nbc's kate snow was at one of the vigils tonight. Outside of st. Rose church. And it looks like the turnout was just tremendous, this community coming together, kate. 

[00:22:59]


>> Reporter: It was overwhelming, chris. They can seat 900 people in the church. And I can tell you there were hundreds, hundreds, maybe even a thousand people outside of the church. Crammed outside, looking in the windows. I heard one group singing "silent night," which was quite moving. They all said they wanted to go together. This is a tight knit community, they all know one another, and just wanted to be in a place where they could be together, mourn together, and pray together. 
>> Reporter: Kate snow, thank you so much for that update. Let me bring in now the mayor of neighboring danbury, connecticut, roughly ten miles from newtown, where today's massacre happened. Mr. Mayor, thank you for joining us. I know there is no mayor here in this community. I know that you feel like this is part of your greater community. What were your thoughts when you heard what happened here? 
>> Well, obviously, it is just stunning, shocking, whatever adjective you can come up with, chris. And you're absolutely right, i have to hand it to the first mayor here, she is outstanding, and doing what she should be doing, being with the families who lost loved ones today. But it is the most shocking thing I certainly have ever experienced here in western connecticut. Our hearts reach out to family and friends, everybody who has been touched by this horrible, horrible act of absolute evil. 
>> Reporter: And there are two questions that always get asked in the immediate aftermath. The first, of course, is why. And we just talked to police who are trying to figure that out. But the second is, can we figure out a way to stop this from happening again. And as a politician who feels this very closely, do you feel there is an answer to that? 

[00:25:00]


>> Well, I don't know if we'll ever know why. God has plans for all of us. And only he knows why things happen to these wonderful people. And in terms of the larger, broader question, I think the debate and questions will happen over the next weeks and months and years even, if you will. Yeah, I think there is a way we can definitely limit these kind of events. And I think you have to combine good solid gun control legislation. Solid legislation that doesn't necessarily take away somebody's rights to own guns. But certainly, a way to regulate the weapons. That will require compromise on each side. And we'll have to learn about mental health, and how we handle mental health. There are a lot of people right now that are struggling with mental health issues that evolve into these horrible situations where they take matters into their own hands and hurting people. And we have not as a country, and as a nation done a good job with the folks who desperately need care. And tragically, these are outcomes that we see. 
>> Reporter: And we have heard these kind of questions being raised, sadly in the shootings that have happened over recent years. And there is a lot of conversation. But we don't see a lot of change. And I wonder, because I have been asked this question, even by members of this own community. Do you think that because this was so shocking, because a gunman went into an elementary school that 20 of the victims are tiny little kids, five, six, seven years old, do you think that that will make a difference? Will it spur people to do something this time? 
>> Tragically, it shouldn't have to take an event like this to make a difference and to spur that kind of conversation. But look, I would say this. That this is sort of symptom attic of the problem we have in washington, where people are so polarized, where nobody can find common ground on anything. And the reality is we need to have common ground, and have a system that highly regulates these weapons. But also, people who lawfully, legitimately want to use the weapons, use them. But also, not get them into the hands of people that are clearly incapable of using them. Obviously, when you have an instance like this today that person had no business being anywhere close to a weapon and probably should have been that institutionalized, because nobody creates that type of situation we saw today. I think it is time to work together and comomise all the big issues of the day. And recognize it can't be either way. And we have to find common ground. And yeah, I think it can happen. 

[00:27:48]

>>> We want to show these pictur s 
>>> we want to show these s of just a little while ago, ryan lanza, the brother of the shooter, left the police station in hoboken, new jersey. Nbc's pete williams has the latest information about the gunman. 
>> Reporter: Chris, this has been a day of confusion about who has involved, and exactly what happened. But tonight, it is becoming a bit clearer, though the central question of why remains unanswered. And we are learning more about where the guns came from. Investigators say the man who committed one of the worst mass shootings in u.S. History was just twenty years old. The son of a kindergarten teacher at the school he attacked. They identify him tonight as adam lanza, and they say when he entered the school he was dressed all in black, carrying two handguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. 
>> The minutes after the officers arrived they realized what a horrific scene we had there. 
>> Reporter: Adding to the confusion, the officials say, the gunman was carrying his brother's identification. When police traed the brother down in hoboken, new jersey, about 80 miles away, they learned the man was actually adam lanza, who was rumored to have mental health issues. 
>> The perpetrator of the crime is dead. As is an individual who the perpetrator lived with. 
>> Reporter: Tonight, authorities say they believe the victim at the house was adam lanza's mother, and that she was shot at home, not at the school, although that is still under investigation. A former fbi profiler says that is a disturbing and revealing fact. 
>> The children were loved by his mother. The children were part of her and she was part of them. By going and symbolically killing the children, he was also killing another part of his mother. 
>> Reporter: Tonight, the police are working to trace how and why adam lanza obtained the guns. And they're looking into anything in his background or recent communications that would shed light on what led him to plan and carry out this mass shooting. Tonight, the law enforcement officials say the guns used in the shooting were registered to adam lanza's mother and had been legally purchased. And they say the children who were all killed, were all shot at close range. Adam lanza's brother was questioned for hours tonight and released later tonight. They say they now believe that adam lanza acted on his own. 

[00:37:17]


>> Reporter: Pete williams, thank you so much. I wanted to bring in the fbi profiler and james fox, the professor at northwestern university. And james, let me start with you, the question everyone has is why. Does any information we're learning about the gunman give you any real clues. 
>> Well, it does, this is somebody who planned very well what he was going to do. The weapons, what he was going to bring, what he would wear. Not somebody who just snaps and has all of this ammunition in his car. This was an act of revenge, now, that may have been targeted to his mother, but also, by proxy. After all, he allegedly killed his mother, and all of those young children whom she loved. But the location of the crime was not random. 
>> Reporter: Clint, you and i were talking earlier. And it is just so hard to even fathom that somebody would go into an elementary school. We're talking about five and six and seven-year-old kids. I mean, what do you make of this? What does this tell you? 
>> Well, and you know, dr. Fox has done a lot of these studies. And so many times we look at these shooters and we break them down into two categories. Either those that are mentally ill. Or those who are sociopaths, anti-social personalities. And it seems a number of these we have seen recently have been on that mental ill side. It was said that the shooter was described as "somewhat autistic," indications that he suffers from asperger syndrome. That he has mental challenges that apparently he and his family were aware of. So as this planning continues there is this aspect of mental illness that allowed him to do two of the most unthinkable things we have. The biggest taboos would be killing your mother and killing defenseless children. This guy crossed the line on both of them today. 

[00:39:34]


>> Reporter: And we have that video of his brother, who was leaving police headquarters today after apparently some extensive questioning. And I'm wondering, james, what questions would you have for him? 
>> Well, obviously, we need to do the psychological autopsy of his brother. But one thing I do want to point out, though he may indeed have had psychological issues, perhaps profound ones, these are not signs that we can identify in advance that would be telltale that somebody is going to go and rampage, these crimes, fortunately, are extremely rare, unpredictable. And even though there are warning signs, those signs are only crystal clear in the aftermath. We are trying to tighten up who can get guns and doing better background checks. The problem is, mass murderers rarely fail a background check, they were able to buy them legally. Or if they can't buy them legally, of course, they can get them from the mother or steal them from a steal, such as in oregon earlier this week. 
>> Reporter: And of course, as we come to understand, clint, in some context, exactly, what the motivation might have been. And you can talk to people who may have been through any of these shootings. They do want to know why. But it doesn't change anything or bring their loved ones back. But is there any information that we ought to know from this that will help us going forward? 
>> Well, there is no test that i know of, chris, that we can give to somebody or differentiate, the next person who will be the next mass murderer. Psychologists believe we can identify children who are at risk. And we can do that many times in grade school. I mean, I have always been an advocate of having counselors, mental health professionals, to help children when they're in grade schools to start the develop conflict resolution skills that are not built on violence like they see on television. 

[00:41:39]


>> But can I add to this very importantly, when you hear a report that this man may have had asperger syndrome. I worry about all the people who now try to label the asperger syndrome folks as if they're dangerous. Which is just not the case. No matter what we find here it is just not possible to identify and predict, and I would hate to paint a broad brush of violence proneness for others who have psychological issues in their life. 
>> Reporter: It is a complex issue and one we'll talk about in the coming days. Thank you to both of you. 
>>> And up next, the president's emotional statement. 

[00:44:34]


>>> We are just getting reports by the associated press that somebody's quick thinking in the school may have saved lives. That somebody thought to turn on the intercom after the shootings that alerted classrooms to take immediate action. We'll have much more about this and how the nation's conversation immediately turned to guns after the shooting. That is coming up. mickelson. I've been fortunate to win on golf's biggest stages.

>>> Homeland security security adviser john brennan first notified president obama of the tragedy here at 10:30 this morning in the oval office. It took him until approximately 3:00 this afternoon, he had been thoroughly briefed. And he prepared his remarks in the briefing room. Named after the shooting attack on president reagan. Nbc also learned that the original remarks were longer than the emotional statement that the president, a father of two young girls, of course, eventually delivered. 
>> This afternoon, I spoke with governor malloy, and fbi director morell. I offered governor malloy my condolences and made it clear he will have every single resource he needs to investigate this terrible crime, care for the victims, counsel their families. We have endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. And each time I learn the news, I react not as a president but as anybody else would, as a parent. And thatas especially true today. I know there is not a parent in the america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of five and ten years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations. Weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today. For the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children. And for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors, as well. For as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early. And there are no words that will ease their pain. As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it is an elementary school in newtown, or a shopping mall in oregon. Or a temple in wisconsin. Or a movie theater in aurora, or a streetcorner in chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods. And these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. This evening, michelle and i will do what I know every parent in america will do. Which is hug our children a little tighter. And we'll tell them that we love them. And we'll remind our children how deeply we love one another. But there are families in connecticut who cannot do that tonight. And they need all of us right now. And in the days to come, the community needs us to be at our best as americans. And I will do everything in my power as president to help, because while nothing can feel the space of a lost child or loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need. To remind them that we are there for them. That we are praying for them. That the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories, but also in ours. May god bless the memory of the victims. And heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds. tough. ?????? ?????? doing it with a cold, just not going to happen.

>>> There is I'm sure -- will be, rather, a day for discussion of the usual washington policy debates, but I don't think today is that day. 
>> Reporter: That was white house spokesperson jay carney today. And not surprisingly, the talk in the nation turned to guns very quickly. There was a pro-gun control rally today, michael moore was there, other gun control advocates, immediately sending out a message saying this is the time to talk about gun control. But on the other side you had conservatives, erik erikson, immediately going on the defensive. Republican mike huckabee said, we removed god from our schools. Should we be so surprised that schools have become a place of carnage. Josh horowitz, former director of the coalition to stop gun violence. I want to thank both of you for being with us. I am sure you know that mayor bloomberg has been on the forefront of gun control. He tweeted today that the president needs to send a bill to congress. 
>> Well, there are already bills in place, we need to ban assault weapons again. We need to ban the massacre-style magazines that have up to 100 rounds that are not used to defend anyone. They're just used to massacre people. We need to close the gun show loophole, so that people cannot get guns without background checks. There are sensible, common sense things you can do that would help to end the gun violence in this country. We are ranked number four in the world in terms of the number of guns we have. The only -- and the violence that we experience, the only countries that have more are south africa, columbia, and thailand. And if people think guns bring safety, we should be the safest country on earth. We have more guns per capita than any country. So it is a time to really try to pass some of these measures. It has been a day of national mourning over the great loss. And we need to return with -- to congress with a national resolve to work in a bipartisan way to make changes to make it safer for our kindergarten grandchildren, for goodness sakes. 

[00:56:55]


>> Reporter: You're asking for change at a time when we all have seen and we all know the polarization in washington. We all know the shootings, look at what happened since columbine, virginia tech, 13 at columbine, the immigration center. Fort hood, the aurora movie theater. Unfortunately, josh, we could go on and on, is there anything that could tell you it could be different this time. From two sides, still so strong in their position could find a way to come together. >>Ell, I think the american people are ready for action. Unfortunately of course I think even before this, the summer, the shooting at the aurora theater and the sikh temple. It is time for change, and you see that reflected. First of all, the polls are surprising. It showed pretty quickly that 90% of gun owners want -- they believe we should have background checks on all guns. People want this. The other thing that is I think, important, is that people talk about the power of the nra. But when you look at the election results that happened this november, the nra had a terrible season. I mean, my home state of virginia they really spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to knock off tim kaine, who is a big supporter of gun laws. They were not able to do that. They went after tammy baldwin, and of course they went after the president. Everybody believes we should have reasonable gun laws. What is standing in the way is the nra leadership. We need to push them aside. It is not difficult. The nra is a paper tiger. It is time to get this done, the time is now, the day's events just showed what must happen in this country. 

[00:58:55]


>> Congresswoman, we have talked over the last several months about how there have been shifts on so many issues, many of them social issues, for example, gay marriage. That it does seem as if legislation is sort of catching up with public opinion, is that what is happening here? And is there a way to push it forward from your perspective? 
>> Well, I have to tell you, chris, after one of our colleagues was shot at a town hall, gabrielle giffords, we still could not get the republican leadership to put on the floor measures, bills to end the gun violence. When we go back, I'm sure there will be a flurry of activity and a flurry of speeches and statements and bills and hearings, and actions. And hopefully, the momentum will build that you reach a tipping point where -- where it changes. Where the number of people that are voting for -- to end gun violence are stronger than those

Now. 
>> Bill: "The o'reilly factor" is on. Tonight -- 
>> we all huddled and I kept hearing these booming noises. 
>> Fox news confirmed that as many as 27 people are dead, including 20 children. 
>> Bill: Unspeakable evil in connecticut. 
>> The gym teachers directed to us take against the wall and everybody started toic. 
>> Bill: Dozens of school children murdered. 
>> They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own 
>> Bill: Tonight what happened? How it could happen and can america prevent this kind of atrocity? We will have a number of reports. 
>> He's tough. A lesser person would have pleaded guilty. 
>> Bill: Also will president obama and secretary of state clinton demand the release of marine lance corporal jon hammer bein held in a mexican prison on bogus charges? We will continue our reporting on this disturbing story. Caution. You are about to enter the no spin zone. "The factor" begins right now. 
>> Bill: Hi. I'm bill o'reilly. Thanks for watching us. Mass murder in connecticut, unspeakable evil on display. There is little anyone can say when 20 school children are murdered. That kind of thing diminishes the entire country and deeply affects all good people. Here is what know at this hour. About 9:40 this morning at the sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut, 230-year-old adam lanza shot the principal dead and also killed a school psychologist. Then he entered two classrooms, killing the children. Four other adults died as well. Lanza hess mother, nancy, was a teacher at the school and he apparently murdered her earlier in the morning at the home they shared. Right now there is no known motive and we won't be getting any explanation from lanza who committed suicide at the school. This is the worst school shooting ever in connecticut. Second worst in the united states behind virginia tech. Here are some scenes in the aftermath of this appalling crime. 

[00:02:24]


>> Evil visited this community today. 
(Sirens). 
>> A call came in to dispatch. Police officers and resources from all over the state raced to that area as they converged on the school. The children obviously were very shaken. They were crying in the closet. When they were leaving, the police made them hold hands and told them to close their eyes. 
>> They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own 
>> the gym teachers directed us to stay against the wall. Everybody started kind of panics. 
>> There is no words. It's shear terror. 
>> Doesn't even seem real. It just does not seem like it's even possible. 
>> We all huddled and I kept hearing these booming noises. 
>> I just saw all these moms networking, trying to figure out what's going on. 
>> The kids were terrified! They were terrified. They had just witnessed something and they were terrified. 
>> Most traumatizing thing I've ever been to. 
>> My god bless the memory of the victims and in the words of scripture, heal the broken hearted and bind up their wounds. 
>> Bill: Three guns were found at the scene. Two pistols an a rifle. Police say they were legally purchased and registered to lanza's mother who again was apparently mumpedded by him. With us now, geraldo rivera. Between us, we pretty much seen what there is to see in this world, but this kind of evil has got to be at the top of the chart. 
>> You know, bill, I've been eye to eye with charles manson. I've been a war correspondent for seven years, covered the worse atrocities of iraq and afghanistan. This is the worst thing ever. I have a scene in my mind that i just can't get out of my mind. He had the three weapons. He had the glock and the six hour, both .9 millimeter, the 223 bush master. It's unclear whether or not he used it. Most reports are suggesting he left that one in the car, which means he went into the school, gets past security, gets into the classroom, one or two classrooms and starts firing at the little children. At some point he has to run out of ammunition. Even if he has extended magazines, at some point he has to reload. So the scene I have in my mind is these babies, between the ages of five and ten, as this grownup -- these are children who have never seen evil. These are children who are in the flower of innocence. Here is a grownup dressed in camo and bullet proof vest and he's got two hand guns and he starts killing the children and you can imagine the children screaming and then he's reloading and there is the dead children and there is the children yet to be killed. In this moment, just imagine the terror before he kills them. It is so unconscionable. It is beyond description. It is so evil doesn't do it. It doesn't explain sufficiently the wickedness, the depraved wreckless indifference to the lives of these children, just something as that father of five, I cannot get out miff mind. 

[00:06:15]


>> Bill: Nobody can. There is no explanation for it. It is evil. You would admit that's what it is. So when you look at things like this that happen and why they happen so much in the united states, you know. We saw the norwegian thing last year and all of that. But it's a good country, but there is insanity. There is strain of insanity now running through our country. We'll get to that a little later. You know, you go to the concentration camps, you know? You been there, right? 
>> That's what it most reminds me of. 
>> Bill: I've been there. 
>> A mini holocaust. 
>> Bill: Go to the concentration camps and go to cambodia and they still have the skulls, if you want to, you cano see them, and you go to china and you see what's happened in various places. It all comes back to one thing. It all comes back to there is an eviln the universe and you can't stop it. You can't stop it. We have to deal with it. We just have to deal with it. 
>> This young man, adam lanza, woke up and he killed his mother. Why did he kill his mother? We don't know. Maybe he thought his mother was paying too much attention to the children. Maybe it was something as -- 
>> Bill: We don't want to speculate tonight. 
>> As crazy as that. After she's dead, he then drives to her classroom. How best to savage your mother than to go and kill the children she cared for, that she nurtured, that she taught. And my brother craig was there all day. He saw a scene where all the parents collected their children, the surviving children, and the governor at some point says, those who haven't collected their children, there are no more children to collect. They are inside, the forensics are still ongoing. They were at the fire house. So there were families arriving late. Some coming from out of town. The school was almost a magnet because it was so good and parents coming during the course of the afternoon. He saw a scene where the parents were taking the car seat out of the back seat and putting it in the trunk, never to be used again. This is something that -- i mean, I don't think there is a person listening right now, a parent who can't just be so just defeated, deflated, outraged, sickened, disgusted -- 

[00:08:53]


>> Bill: And the worst part of it is, we can't do anything about it. There is nothing we can do. 
>> The other bitter irony is that this heroic principal, dawn hocksprung implemented security at the school. She put a buzzer system in the school that he apparently burst through to get to the -- 
>> Bill: If his mom taught there, they knew him and he knew how to get into the school. 
>> I want an armed cop at every school. I remember there were two school shootingsings and were there were amish kids in pennsylvania. And then I said, we have to protect these children as if they were gold. As if they were the material you use for atom bombs, you have to protect the children. 
>> Bill: I know that all over the united states right now, that, what you just said, is being discussed. In heightened security for all the kids. All right. Thanks for coming in. We appreciate . He's got special reports all weekend on saturday and sunday. Next on the rundown, we will go to the scene of the crime in connecticut and talk with fox correspondent rick leventhal, as well as th a third grader who survived today's mass murder. "The factor" will be back in a moment life. You won't take our future. Aids affects us all. Even babies. Chevron is working to stop mother-to-child transmission. Our employees and their families are part of the fight. And we're winning. At chevron nigeria, we haven't had a reported case in 12ears. Aids is strong. Aids is strong. But we are stronger. And aids... ?????? ?????? aids is going to lose. Aids is going to lose. ?????? ?????? used Miles To come home for the holidays. That's double miles you can actually use... Sadly, their brother's white christmas just got "blacked out." 

[00:11:22]


[ Brother ] BUT IT'S THE FAMILY PARTY! Really jingles your bells, doesn't it? My gift to you! THE Capital One Venture Card! For any flight, any time! That's double miles you can actually use! How illuminating. What's in your wallet? Let me guess, am on the naughty list again? Ho ho ho! from Is bigger than we think ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold? There's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies. Prescription TAMIFLU attacks the flu virus at its source. So don't wait. Call your doctor right away. TAMIFLU is prescription medicine for treating the flu in adults and children one year and older whose flu symptoms started within the last two days. Before taking TAMIFLU tell your doctor if you're pregnant, nursing. have serious health conditions, or take other medicines. If you develop an allergic reaction, a severe rash, or signs of unusual behavior, stop taking TAMIFLU and call your doctor immediately. Children and adolescents in particular may be at an increased risk of seizures, confusion or abnormal behavior. The most common side effects are mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. The flu comes on fast, so ask your doctor about TAMIFLU. Prescription for flu. 
>> Bill: Continuing with "the factor"'s coverage. Joining us from the scene of the crime, fox news correspondent rick leventhal. What's going on now? Lot of reporters obviously from all over the world have descended upon a small connecticut town. What are they trying to accomplish this evening? 

[00:13:41]


>> Bill, obviously everyone is trying to get the latest information and try to piece together what happened here today. I can tell you that I've spoken with a number of federal investigators, one of whom, a seasoned investigator, one of the biggest, toughest guys i know, and he was shocked as he related the news to me. The details of this horrific crime. When you hear from w enforcement the horror at what transpired, it really brings it home. The fact that this kid, would shoot his own mother in her home and then drive to the school where she apparently worked and slaughtered children, it's almost too horrific to believe. 
>> Bill: We get our reports from law enforcement that hundreds of shots were fired by this guy and he had planned it out. I mean, obviously he had taken three weapons with him. But there is no much else known other than he's a mass murderer, he didn't care about anybody, obviously his mother, children, nothing matter to do him at all. Do the acts that you talked to, did they describe the inside of the school? Did they tell you anything that specifically happened? 
>> Well, we've heard from law enforcement just in general terms how awful the scene is. It's going to take them days to process that scene. The medical examiner is inside the school at this hour attempting to work through the identification of the bodies, including those 18 children still in the school. That could be finished, they hope by tomorrow, bill. But we have also learned through law enforcement sources that the brother of this shooter, ryan lanza, was originally identified as the shooter, maybe because his younger brother was carrying his i.D he has spoken with federal authorities and described as very cooperative. He's telling federal authorities that he believes his brother had developed mental problems and possibly autism, and the boy's father also said to be cooperating with federal authorities in new jersey, being questioned, trying to shed light on this kid's mental state and what may have set him off. 

[00:15:44]


>> Bill: All right. So they have the father and the brother who are obviously trying to explain to authorities the condition of the dead murderer. When you cover a story like this, there is a lot of chaos and there is a lot of misreporting, as you just ntioned, the kid ryan, we just saw, the brother, was initially tied in to the crime, but now he's been totally exonerated, right? There is just one shooter. They believe it's one man who did these horrible things. Is that correct? 
>> Correct. Yeah. Bill, you can understand, in the aftermath of a major incident like this, there is a lot of confusion. In this case, if the shooter was carrying an identification, then that would lead investigators to previous that was him. Apparently it was his brother. His older brother. This kid is 20. His brother is 24. He may have had his i.D. On him for purposes of who knows? Alcohol. Who knows? 
>> Bill: I want to be clear. The shooter who is now dead, was carrying his brother's i.D that'she i.D. They found on him. And his brother and the father live in new jersey, not close to the scene. All right. Rick. We appreciate it. Thank you very much. Directly ahead, a third grader survives the murder. We will talk with her and her mother.

>> Bill: In the impact segment, no words can console the families of the dead children in connecticut. No words. There were more than 600 children in the sandy hook school today. The survivors will carry this crime with them forever. Joining us from newtown, brenda and her eight-year-old daughter, sophia, third grader at the school. Sophia, you okay tonight? You all right? 

[00:20:48]


>> Yes. 
>> Bill: Can you tell us what you saw today, what happened to you at school today? 
>> Well, we were at morning meeting and then we heard these knocking sounds and then miss martin, she closed the door and locked it and then told us to go in the corner and then we were like shaking and everybody was all squished. 
>> Bill: Did you know what was happening outside your classroom? Did the teacher tell you anything? 
>> No. 
>> Bill: So you were just scared 'cause she didn't know and you knew the teacher was concerned? 
>> Yes. 
>> Bill: How did you get out of the school, sophia? 
>> Well, someone was knocking done the door and our assistant, she looked out the door and it was the police to tell us to come out. So we went out and went to the fire house. 
>> Bill: Okay. Did you talk to your daughter about this? Does she understand it? I mean, this is so traumatic for everyone. Adults are breaking down. How is sophia dealing with it with you? 
>> I think she's still numb. She has her family around her. My sister came up, so I think the gravity of the situation hasn't hit her yet. She wasn't really exposed to any of the bodies or anything. They took her out a back door. 
>> Bill: That's good. 
>> Then went to the fire house. 
>> Bill: Did you know any of the children who were killed? Did sophia know them? I think they were younger, right? 
>> They were supposedly in kindergarten. We haven't been told any of the children's names. So I don't know. I do know that my friends that I've talked to, their children are safe. I made sure of that. Anybody I saw in the fire house, I hugged them. And I said do you have your babies? And they said yes, we're okay. It wasn't until later when -- go ahead. 

[00:22:54]


>> Bill: Sandy hook is a very, very calm place, newtown, connecticut, a beautiful suburb. 
>> Oh, yeah. 
>> Bill: No violence to speak of. 
>> Safe. 
>> Bill: This would be the last place on earth you would think at that this would happen. Where were you when you heard about this and what was your reaction? 
>> Okay. I was home doing my christmas cards on-line and I received a phone call from the school superintendent that we usually get if there is going to be an early dismissal, you know, something of that sort, saying that there was a shooting in newtown and that the schools were on lockdown. But she did not say that there was a shooting at one of the schools. So I wasn't that concerned until I received a text from -- i think it was a.P. News on my phone saying that there was a shooting in the sandy hook school on dickinson. That's where my daughter attends, so I jumped in the car. I went to the school. There was already parents there crying and I saw a friend of mine. I said what happened? And they were hysterical that they carried out a little girl and she looked like she was dead. I panicked. But luckily I saw my daughter right away coming with her teacher, 'cause they started walking the kids from the school to the fire house, which is almost adjacent to the school. 
>> Bill: By all accounts, the school handled the situation well and the police and the authorities did a good job. Is that what you saw? 
>> Yes. Absolutely. 
>> Bill: So everybody was reassured quickly? You say you panicked, but everything was contained. 
>> The children were being orderly, taken to the fire house. They went into a large room. There was a lot of crying. But the teachers seem to keep the kids calm and we kept every classroom was kept together, so the teacher knew where her kids were. As the parents came in, you know, she's over here, you know. She's okay. We had no idea the gravity of the situation until later on when I came home and I heard the news. I heard that the principal was shot and the little girl that i was told that was taken out bloody. But we had no idea that there would be 20 some odd people killed. 

[00:25:19]


>> Bill: Did you know this teacher whose son did this allegedly and wound up dead? Did you know her? 
>> I never heard her name before. I have older children. They don't know the boys. She's not listed on the directory in school as a kindergarten teacher. I do know that they started a preschool here this year. So I don't know if she was a preschool teacher. 
>> Bill: But you don't know her. Okay. 
>> No. 
>> Bill: All right. Sophia, we appreciate you telling us your story and we hope you're okay and miss labinski, if you need anything, you let us know. Thank you very much. I'm sorry you had to go through this. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Bill: Plenty more as "the factor" moves along this evening. Evil people, can we protect ourselves against them? We'll talk with two mental health workers. And then marine corporal jon hammer still in a mexican prison. We're trying hard to get him out. We have hope you stay tuned for those time...

>> Bill: Unresolve problem segment, how should we process evil and protect ourselves from it? Joining us from boston, psychotherapist dr. Karen ruskin and kansas city, dr. Russell, forensic scientist and attorney. Could evil like this ever be dealt with effectively, dr. Russell? 
>> Well, bill, you can't eliminate it, but you can minimize it better than we're doing. Not just by enhanced security practices. A couple big things, bill, one is we can rethink our deinstitutionalization policy where by far too often we actually show more compassion for an obviously dangerously troubled individual than we do for everybody in the society that that person may harm. And secondly, we can get back to being the kind of a culture in which kids grow up getting lots of messages at home, school, church, everywhere about being part of something larger than themselves. Thinking about the impacts of their actions on others because we've become coarsened and callus to the point! That a kid can grow up in this society and not necessarily internalize the kind of disgust that you and i feel, this visceral disgust for the kind of disregard for human life that we saw today. 
>> Bill: Dr. Ruskin, it seems to me that there is casual violence and very explicit violence on display more than ever before and that's, of course, thanks to the internet. I'm not sure whether this is having an unintended consequence on a generation of americans. It's hard to quantify that. But certainly the casual violence is on display far more than any other time in history. Am I wrong? 
>> I wouldn't you are not wrong. And we can't ignore the fact that our environment absolutely affects us. We must view things systemically. We are a system l it's television, whether it's parents being too busy to spend quality time with their kids, whether a kid is hurting and another child is mean about that, whether teachers are not noticing, whether parents are not noticing what's happening with the emotional well-being of their kids. Everything affects everything. The violence that we're experiencing is systemic and we need to put a stop to it by everybody playing a role, parents, very important. I believe that's where it all starts, at a young age. 

[00:32:12]


>> Bill: All right. So but it's almost impossible to legislate good parenting, dr. Russell. That's a problem on almost every sociolevel that we have in america. I mean, families fall apart. Fathers abandon children, mothers abuse children, whatever it may be, then the children suffer. So in a free society, you're always going to have dysfunctional people and you're always going to have evil. Always. I don't think a lot of people understand -- my mother, for example, doesn't understand evil. When I would tell her, hey, mom, I was in el salvador and I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head, she almost couldn't process it. She couldn't process it. You know. And I don't know whether we americans really understand the concept of evil. 
>> You're absolutely right that it exists. I'VEXftx+l9b??YMci=MM THE TABLE FROM It and I can tell you that there absolutely are people, they may not be mentally healthy, they're sane and they choose to hurt others just because they want to and we have to wrap our minds around that and you're right, we can't make everybody parent the way that they should. But what we have to society is not squander chances when we get them to intervene because the person has given us reason to, has shown a propensity to be dangerous. I predicted in this thing, we're going to find out there were signs all over thece. 
>> Bill: There usually are. There are usually signs. Although a ted bundy, the serial killer, tracked that guy all over the united states, nobody -- I talked to his mother. Nobody thought that he was a monster who would look a woman in the eye and then cut her throat because he came across as this preppy, regular guy. But sociopaths and nare city cysts, I think this is growing in our society. I think that this disease, this mental illness of sociopathy is growing and I don't know why. 

[00:34:17]


>> You know, there is a difference between the psychopath and the sociopath. The psychopath, they don't care even if it's their family that they're hurting. There is no remorse. There is no guilt. Whereas a sociopath may or may not feel guilty over hurt ago family member, but they sure as heck don't feel guilty about hurting somebody else. And the psychopath can appear very lovely to others, whereas this sociopath often you can tell that there is a disturbance, and I believe that in our culture, as we have become so self-absorbed and self-titled that we deserve to have loving parents, I deserve not to feel hurt, I deserve to have money. I deserve have a job. Yes, yes. Everybody deserves. But the fact is, we can not control the cards that are dealt to us. So rather we must work hard every day in our mental health and wellness and well-being and if we're noteeling well, we, we, we, I must take ownership of my own behavior and seek out help. 
>> Bill: That's a mature mind. Your point about we all feel we deserve all this and if we don't get it, some of us go into a rage and some of us lose it and start to inflict damage I think a good one. But only a mature mind will say, I need help. Doctor, I'm going to leave you the last word in kansas city. People watching tonight, there is no solution to evil. We just have to recognize it, i think. 
>> Two things. Don't call it an illness because this, what we're talking about tonigh transcends psychology. Everybody watching tonight has to decide what to call it. I call it evil. You call it evil. The other thing to keep in mind, you do a lot on the culture war. When you have an entire culture that's drifting in a direction, you're bound to have those people who are out there on the fringes of it anyway drifting even farther out of the bounds. 
>> Bill: Allall right. Thanks very much. When we come back, former marine unjustly imprisoned in mexico. Will the obama administration be able to get him out of jail? We'll have the very latest on a very troubling story. Then we will go back to the crime scene in connecticut. The latest breaking news with bill hemmer and "the factor" will return after these announcement

With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold? There's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies.

The flu comes on fast, so ask your doctor about TAMIFLU. Prescription for flu. 

[00:40:12]


>> Bill: Thanks for staying with us. I'm bill o'reilly. We'll go back to connecticut shortly. But first in "the factor" follow-up tonight, the talking points memo. Mexico insulting every single american citizen. 27-year-old jon hammer, former marine lance corporal from florida, remains remains in a mexican prison charged with gun possession. The charge is totally bogus. Last summer he registered an antique shotgun, handed down to him from his great grandfather with american customs officials in brownsville, texas. He was then told by the american agents to take the paperwork across the border to mexican officials and he would be fine to travel on to costa rica for a hunting trip. When he did check in with the mexicans in matamoros, he was promptly arrested and charged with carrying a deadly weapon. That was last august. Despite many attempts by the u.S. Government to get him released, mexico will not do it. So he sits in a filthy prison ten days before christmas. That's simply unacceptable. Everybody knows corporalammer did nothing wrong. So why doesn't mexico just release him in the name of goodwill? For years talking points has been telling you that mexico does not act like a friend to the usa. I've stopped going to the country 'cause they do not -- i do not believe they're looking out for us. The jon hammer case proves this. Mexico's new president should release hammer immediately. Right now. We understand high level negotiations are taking place and there is some optimism the corporal will soon be free. But why is it taking so long? And how did it ever happen in the first place? We will stay on the story. That's a memo. Nor for reaction, joining us from washington, congresswoman who is deeply involved in the case. I don't understand this. I really don't understand how you can have somebody in jail for four months who didn't do anything and everybody is involved, the state department, I assume the president knows about this. So try to tell me what's going on. 
>> Well, we are outraged as well, bill. In fact, it is so incomprehensible that when the mother first came to us with the case, we said, oh, something must be wrong here. Sometimes constituents stretch the truth a little bit. This cannot be happening. 

[00:42:24]


>> Bill: But it is. 
>> The more we investigated, that's right. We found out absolutely, everything that she was saying is absolutely correct. And, in fact, in my conversation just two days ago with the mexican ambassador, he told me that right now jon hammer is chained to his bed. Why? Because they had to move him from the general population of those criminals into an area that is less secure. And in that area that is less secure, it is so unsecure that they fear that he will escape and in order to overcome that fear, they have chained him to his bed. 
>> Bill: Does the mexican -- when you talked to the mexican ambassador, does he justify this? I mean, he doesn't have the power to release him. I guess the mexicanorney general would do this. But does he justify this travis see? 
>> I don't want to talk about conversations that I've had with this official or the other official. I can tell you this, bill, the mexican government is probably even going to be powerless because they believe that they're under siege by these drug lords and they have creed control to these gangsters. So the folks administering this terrible prison is not the mexican government, but these drug lords. 
>> Bill: Are you telling me, congresswoman, the president of mexico does not have enough power to release had american from that filthy prison in matamoros? Is that what you're telling me? 
>> I believe he doesn't have the guts o do it. Does he have the authority to do it? Yes. 
>> Bill: Of course he does. 
>> This is a case that will put him to the test. This is a country whose leaders, leader after leader, they love to lecture the united states about how badly we supposedly treat illegal immigrants. Hogwash. Here is another case, because it is not an isolated case -- of an american unjustifiably imprisoned. So we call on this president to do his duty and release this -- 
>> Bill: I want our president to do something, too. I want barak obama to speak out about this. He has remained silent. So has secretary of state clinton. I understand this much and i think you hinted at it. We don't want to muck up any negotiatns that might be fruitful by attacking anybody and calling anybody out making any threats. That includes president obama and secretary of state clinton. We're going to assume, you and tell me if I'm wrong, that the american government is doing what they should. I'm soaping they are doing what they should do. Is that right? 

[00:44:49]


>> I don't get that feeling yet, bill. Maybe I'll get that feeling -- 
>> Bill: So you want more pressure put on by secretary clinton and president obama? Do you want more pressure? 
>> Absolutely. That's why I've reached out to my congressional colleagues, over 50 of them have signed a bipartisan letter to hillary clinton and janet napolitano, the head of homeland security, calling for theirocacy for jon hammer -- 
>> Bill: They need to get out in front of this! The news media, "the factor" and you and senator nelson, although he didn't make himself available this evening and he should have, you guys have been out in front. Look, we'll give it the weekend. We'll come back monday. We'll see where we are. We'll keep in contact with you, congresswoman. We got to get this guy out before christmas. 
>> You are his life policy. I believe that -- 
>> Bill: We'll get him out because no american in -- we're going to call for absolute boycott of travel to mexico if he's not out. Simple as that. 
>> Thank you for saving his life. We got the whole community praying for him. 
>> Bill: We're going to work together and get it done. All right. Thanks very much. 
>> Thank you, bill. 
>> Bill: In a moment, we'll recap that horrendous mass murder in connecticut. Horrible story. That's next in The physical damage was pretty bad. The emotional toll was even worse. Our daughter had nightmares. What that robber really took from us was our peace of mind. With adt, we got it back.

>> Bill: Back of the book segment, let's go back to newtown, connecticut. Fox news anchor billll hemmer is standing by with an update. All right, hemmer. We're starting to now learn a little bit about what happened inside by the scene that the police describing. Tell us about that. 

[00:49:36]


>> It is a scene that can only be described as grisly and a scene that even hardened police officers working thetate for decades have never seen before in their lives. Bill, we believe all the bodies are still inside that small little elementary school down the hill from where we are and they will not be moved tonight or even possibly tomorrow or even into sunday. This is a grisly crime scene and the police are being very particular about making sure that they are careful about this evidence. This is a school, bill. It's a tiny place. Kindergarten through fourth grate. And you come up here to this town and you think this is the kind of community with you want to send your kids to school. You go down this hill through the forest and the school emerges there, bill. There is a short little driveway runs about 75 yards leading up to the parking lot of the school. You walk in there and you think, what in the world could possibly go wrong here? And today everything went wrong. Overnight tonight, these police officers and these investigators are working this crime scene to make sure they get positive identification, something that we expect at 8:00 a.M. Tomorrow eastern time to be announced to the rest of the country. 
>> Bill: Okay. We have an identification, the principal who was shot dead by this lanza. Tell us about her. 
>> I don't want to give out her name out of respect to the community here because police have not given out her name yet. She's 47 years old. She's been the principal for two years, going back to 2010. Which by the way, was the last year a serious crime was even reported in the town of newtown, connecticut. She has five kids. Two daughters and three stepdaughters, along with her husband whose first name is george and he, too, is a teacher in this school district. Here is the sad awful thing about this, bill. We're just getting into the horror of what happened here. Every hour, these layers peel away. We're going to meet these victims in a very intimate way overt coming days as we move through the funerals and it's only going to make us more and more sad as we work through it because these lives have been lost and when we learn about people like it woman who was a mother of five and based on the police accounts we have, the gunman walked in the principal's office first and counted at least four adults, all of which we believe, all of whom we believe were women, including the principal, and shot them dead on site at that moment. 

[00:52:04]


>> Bill: It's hard to comprehend any of this, of course. But I think people have to understand that even the survivors and there were over 600 kids in the school. I mean, it's a small school, but there are a loft kids there. All of them are going to be affected for the rest of their lives. You don't know -- you don't know how personalities absorb that. So not only are the dead and grieving families with their priority number one, but all of the other children, we just talked to one earlier in the program, who looked -- I don't know whether you saw that, but she looked like, you know, I'm eight years old and what am i dealing with here? Never goes away. It never goes away. So the community is going to have to provide services for those people and as you said, it's going to unfold a now we have a woman with five children and you're going to have a lot of those stories. 
>> Yeah. One thing to add on that, I met in a young girl before she talked to you, sophia. She was so charming. She had a huge smile on her face. I an, you look in her parents' eyes and you can see the tears in their eyes and they try and fight it back. They have their daughter for christmas and so many others do not. And I spoke with a woman earlier today, she has a daughter named alexis. She was a thd grader here, she's okay, too. She said throughout the day, they've been talking, she's been asking her questions. Then finally her daughter, from the third grade, age eight, said, mom, are you going to be okay? Your point is well taken about how they absorb this and how they try and interpret it and understand it. And they, just like it whole town, are now left to live with this for the rest of their lives, bill. 
>> Bill: The only advice I could give to anybody threw is be strong. Parents have to be strong for their children and they have to be very well aware that this thing is going to go on for a long, long time. All right. Good job. Thank you very much. As always, we really appreciate it. Bill will be on throughout the evening. Factor factor tip of the day. Some advice to avoid being conned this christmas. We'll have that for you in 60 seconds

=======================================================

Right now. 
>> Good evening. Thanks for joining us this hour after a day that will remembered in this country forever for awful reasons. For the people of newtown, we are with you today and in the weeks and months ahead that was the word today from ron barber, who was shot and wounded in the mass shooting in tucson last year that killed six people and wounded 13, including the grievous wounding of congresswoman gabby giffords. Ron barber, who took gabby giffords' seat in congress after she stepped down to deal with her injuries. He said today, as those of us in tucson know, senseless acts such as these tear at the very fabric of a community. Mark kelly, gabby giffords' husband said today I just spoke with gabby, and she sends her prayers from tucson. In oak creek, wisconsin, where four months ago this was another mass shooting at a sikh temple, another six people gunned down at that temple. A school superintendent there today told the local press that she cried when she heard the news out of newtown, connecticut. She said we always think it can't happen here, and we pray fervently that it won't. But as we know from our experience this summer, kit happen anywhere. The mayor of aurora, colorado, is still helping his community try to recover from the mass shooting there this summer, where 12 people were shot and killed and another 58 people were shot but survived. He said today from aurora, "our hearts go out to the people of newtown. "Colorado's senator, michael bennet said today as coloradans, we know how this type of tragedy can shake a community to its core. We are here for connecticut today. Colorado's governor, john hickenlooper, he said "we know too well what impact this kind of violence has on a community." He said that the first thing he wanted to do today was talk to his counterpart governor in connecticut, dan malloy. Governor hickenlooper said "i cannot put into words how impossible it seems to me that this can happen again so suddenly." Virginia tech was the site of a mass shooting five years ago, where 32 people were shot and killed on a college campus. Another 17 people were shot and survived. The president of virginia tech said today "we of the greater virginia tech community know from our experience of the unending sorrow and horror that has now descend on the newtown,connecticut community." Tim kaine, he said today our commonwealth knows too well the pain of senseless gun violence. Collin goddard, who survived the connecticut virginia tech massacre, he still has three bullets in him that were fired that day. He said today on msnbc, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the mass shooting that happened in oregon earlier this week. When I saw this morning that this had happened, I sunk in my chair. Youeally cannot do justice to what these kids and what these teachers have just experienced. In the classroom where collin goddard was shot at virginia tech, there were 17 people in that classroom. Only seven of them survived. Two dozen kids were shot and wounded in a high school cafeteria in springfield, oregon in 1998. 1998. The police chief there now, who was a first responder that horrible day at that oregon high school 14 years ago said today about newtown, "i know that there is going to be a lot of emotion in that community." He said," in addition to the victims and the families in newtown, that his heart goetz goes out to the police and the emergency services personnel that responded to deal with this, because this is going to take a toll on a lot of people." Beth nimo whose daughter was killed in the columbine high school mass shooting, she said today, as far as the parents go, they're not going to know what hp hit them for a long, long time. My heart is racing. I just feel like these parents, they're going to hurt so bad for so long. And there is not much you can do to console something like this. frank DeAngelis, still is the principal there today, he said when he heard what happened in connecticut today, quote, it just made me sick to my stomach. It just takes me back to what we FELT ON APRIL 20th, 1999. Even though it's going to be 14 years, it just takes us back to that horrific day. And dave cullen, who wrote the definitive book on the columbine mass shooting, he said today, "in my head I have always insisted that any death is just as tragic. But little kids, this is overwhelming me." We're going to be covering the latest news out of newtown, connecticut this hour. And there is new news. Law enforcement officer says the weapons used in today's shootings were legally purchased by the gunman's mother. Another victim believed to be the shooter's mother was found at a home nearby. Also, we're told that the gunman's brother, who was briefly misidentified by authorities as the shooter himself, he was questioned by police today after being picked up in new jersey. The brother is not believed to have had any involvement in the shootings. We're going to be getting to all of that latest information, including some reports tonight from live at the scene. We're also going to be talking about the policy debate that has to arise in the aftermath of this nearly unspeakable event, despite all the calls for that debate to not happen, at least not today. We're going to be talking about all of that this hour. But right now, the immediate question here is how we connect the specific horror of this particular tragedy today to the cumulative experience we have as a country with mass shootings. As a country that is subject to this kind of violence more than any other country on earth and more frequently than any of us could possibly imagine, if these previously unimaginable mass killings were not in fact happening to us as a country, month after month, year after year. This is the way we live as americans. Can we bring anything to the aftermath and the response to newtown from our national experience of living through this time and time and time and time again? Joining us now is david cullen. He spent years as a denver journalist researching and reporting on the columbine shootings. He wrote the book "columbine." Thank you for joining me tonight in these difficult circumstances. 

[00:06:15]


>> Thank you for having me. 
>> Is this the right question to ask is. Is there anything about the greater context that can inform the way we process what happened today? 
>> I think that's exactly the right question. You sort of took my breath away going through that litany. I kind of wasn't prepared because -- well, we all lived through all of those, and a lot of those names I know. But I think it brings home the point even more that there are things to be learned here that we haven't really stepped up to learn. And I think the biggest single thing is we do need to look at the big picture. Because when any one of these things happens, people feel like they want to know why. Like why did this happen. The small why of why did this happen and they're looking at the bigger why, which is why does this keep happening. The problem comes in we do a mental thing where we equate those, and we assume those are the same thing, and they're not. There were two really incredible studies done about this, one by the fbi, one a joint problem of the secret service and the department of education. Fantastic studies. Both came to the same conclusion there is no single profile of a shooter if we're looking for the type or the rationale or the motive, the thing, like the reason, it doesn't exist. But the good news is believe it or not, and this surprised me, there is really three types that cover most of the ground. Now there is some outliers that don't fit in there. It's not 100%. But the vast majority fall into three types. If we understand those three types and address each of those three, then one-half and the other half look at the gun picture, I think we can shrink this dramatically. 
>> Those three typeses, in some cases it's people who literally are so insane they don't know what they're doing. But that's a very tiny minority. 
>> It's unusual. It's true in some of the major ones in virginia tech and at tucson. It's a minority of the cases, though. It does happen. But that's one type. Another type even more rare is the sadistic psychopath. And that we saw with eric harris the driving force behind columbine. Also killers -- most serial killers fall into that type, ted bund city a classic. And these are people who are not mentally ill. They know exactly what they're doing. They're very capable. They're not out of reality. They just have no empathy for other people. Th don't care. And with sadistic psychopaths, they actually enjoy inflicting pain on others. They're doing it because they want to, and they want to do this horrific thing. We have those two. Believe it or not, the other turns out to be suicidally depressed people. And they're angrily depressives. We don't normally equate anger with depression. Psychologists talk about depression as anger turned inward. So you're beating up on yourself. You're presenting outwardly you're this morose beaten down person because you've been beating yourself up. But sometimes in a small number of cases when you turn that outward, then we have something like this. And most often when a deeply depressed, angry person does that, he will normally inflict it either just on himself, he'll commit suicide. The next wider thing is he will attack the person he feels to blame. So if it's his parents, his girlfriend, if it's at work, the boss, they'll shoot the boss, or it will be contained to the person he identifies as the causer. Then you go to a very small minority of people who will sort of lash out in that group. And kill not just the boss, but other people at work, or other people surrounding. And then you get the person who wants to lash out more wildly. So those are the three types. We got to be careful not to jump to conclusions too soon, but it's almost all one of those three. 

[00:10:06]


>> Understanding that sort of template, that matrix at least of why, why of course is the major part of our response. But based on what we have been through, and based on what you learned about columbine, if you could caution anything about a more healthy version less healthy or more constructive versus less constructive response as a nation and as a community there to this tragedy, is there anything that we have in terms of lessons learned? 
>> I think the biggest single thing is we need to address adolescent depression much more aggressively. There have been a couple of really blue collar panels, blue ribbon panels. That have studied this. They keep coming to the same conclusion. There is about 6% of u.S. Adolescents that are clinically depressed. That's not just sad. It's in a deep state that need help of one type or another. Whether it's counseling or drugs or whatever. They need some help. They're relatively easy to identify. And you can do it in a simple screening process. For very little money. We could have every kid when you get your high school physical, you also have to get checked out, or periodically before graduation. Because the thing is, most depressives, kids want to -- they want help. And they will tell adults. Usually the two adults they will not tell are their mom and their dad. And that's actually part of the screening protocol is that parents can't be in the room, because they will usually tell a teacher or a counselor or a family doctor. They will tell an adult, but they hide it from their parents because they're embarrassed, ashamed, all sorts of different reasons. So the parents are often blind to it because the child is sort of blocking their view. So parents have difficulty. But yeah, we can do so much. 
>> Each one of these things seems like it is so unique and unimaginable. But it is part of a pattern in our country and understanding why and how is part of modern american life and our responsibilities. Dave cullen, who wrote "columbine" and did the definitive work on that, thank you so much for being here. Nice to have you here.

>>> We are back with continuing coverage of this morning's massacre at a connecticut elementary school. Newtown, connecticut, is about 60 miles northeast of new york city. It's near danbury, connecticut. The young man who police say was the shooter reportedly walked into two different classrooms at sandy hook elementary. He fired dozens of rounds. He killed 26 people. 18 children pronounced dead at the scene. Six adults pronounced dead at the scene. And then two children who survived their initial wounds and were hospitalized later died in hospital. The shooter then killed himself at the school. The associated press is siting a law enforcement official moments ago saying authorities found more than the previously described two guns at the school once they responded. More firearms than the two we have previously heard about. They're not giving any further details yet. But that report just in from the associated press. The students who were not shot, none of them older than fourth graders, were escorted out of the building by police officers this morning. They were taken to a fire station next door. Police officers reportedly told some of the children to keep their eyes closed until they had reached the parking lot. Law enforcement officials later discover that another person, an adult woman, possibly the shooter's mother was also shot and killed at a secondary scene in newtown. A second is scene related to the case. Reportedly it is the house where the shooter lived with his mother. If that female victim is confirmed fob the shooter's mother, investigator says that what likely happened is that the shooter killed his mother at home early this morning before then driving her car to the elementary school where she worked where he committed the rest of the murders. If that is in fact what happened, that would bring the total number of people murdered in newtown to 27. 26 of them at the school, 20 of them children. Plus, of course the shooter's suicide. Officials are now identifying the shooter as adam lanza, 20 years old. They say he was carrying two handguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. At first law enforcement officials mistakenly identified adam's older brother ryan as the shooter that may be because official says adam, the shooter, had been carrying his brother's id. It was only when police tracked down the brother at his apartment in new jersey that police correctly identified the shooter as adam and not ryan. When he was arrested, ryan said that his younger brother adam had had mental health issues. But, again, the latest news from the associated press is that more than two guns may have been found at the scene of the school shootings. Msnbc's chris jansing joins us from sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut. Thank you very much for being here. I appreciate it. Did I just explain about what we know thus far, did that all sound right to you? Do you have any information for us, updates for us about any of that information tonight from the scene? I I do think it is important to give a little perspective to exactly what happened here today. And for all of us to take a moment to think about what it must have been like to be here early this morning. You described a scene where little children are told to close their eyes and hold hands and leave a school where they have scene their friends, maybe their teachers get shot. And they were brought here to this volunteer fire department behind me in this bucolic town in new england. It's a place where tonight they were expecting to sell christmas trees. And you could not but help be struck when you drove into town that all the christmas lights were up, as you see people in their cars and on the side of the road who are in tears. The parents got a reverse 911 call, rachel. We know that they came here as the children were brought here. And they went through the work, and we're talking about hundreds of kids now, of matching the children with their parents. In the end you have 20 sets of parents who are left. And it is left to be told to them. And the governor was among those who were there to tell the parents that your children are not going to be coming home. And so I think it goes without saying the devastation that this community is feeling. The sense of -- I wouldn't even can say outrage yet. In my experience at these things, the outrage comes later. But the total femaling of hopelessness and senselessness that has overcome this community as they try to figure out why something like this could happen, rachel. 

[00:19:55]


>> Chris, thinking about that initial response, thinking not just about what it must have been like to be personally connected to that, but to be a first responder coming upon that scene and needing to do the active shooter search that we know that law enforcement did once they determined that the shooter was dead, then assessing what had happened there, treating it as a crime scene, trying to identify the victims. Do we have any further information about how they have had to process this massive and horrific crime scene, the horrible but necessary forensic work of how they have been able to process the evidence andifiedify these victims? 
>> The coroner's team is at the school now. It's expected to be an active crime scene, at least to sunday. Probably into monday morning. And everyone that we have spoken to who has witnessed what happened inside there say it is beyond words. It's unlike any of them have ever seen, including a number of federal officials. Just absolutely devastating. There has been no formal official confirmation of any of the identities of the 20 people who were killed. You need to understand that there are state standards that they must meet. They have some preliminary ideas, some preliminary identifications. They're hoping to have more tomorrow morning. There will be at 8:00 a.M. Eastern time news conference to update. I think the details that we do know about what it looked like inside that room are not things that people even want to talk about or think about. It was just an absolutely horrific scene. And it is painstaking and obviously highly emotional work that they're doing right now. And will continue to do, we are told, throughout the night, because those parents who have not been able to be reunited with their children have not been able to see them yet or to make any plans. 
>> Wow. Msnbc's chris jansing at sandy hook elementary school in newtown. Chris, it is a comfort to us to have you onscene with your experience and capability on a story like this. I appreciate it. 

[00:21:56]

>>> the massacre in newtown, connecticut is unfolding in a way that may seem familiar. The first calls to 911, emergency members arrive, frantic family members converge on the scene. Government officials are called to account. For president obama, another instance of horrific violence requires a response, not only to the many individual tragedies of today, not only to the people of the community rocked by loss, but to the nation and to the question of what we can do as a nation to keep this from ever happening again. 
>> We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. And each time I learn the news, I react not as a president, but as anybody else would, as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there is not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers and men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today. For the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the suffers as well. For as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early, and there are no words that will ease their pain. As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it's an elementary school in newtown or a shopping mall in oregon or a temple in wisconsin or a motheater in aurora or a street coroner chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. 

[00:28:07]


>> As much as we think of this issue as a political untouchable, not the tragedy itself, but policy to prevent yet another tragedy like this. As much as we think of this as a subject that cannot be discussed in washington, president obama has spoken to this issue before today. He has been called to speak to it mostly in response to tragedies like today. But when you look at his remarks combined over time in full, it's just a remarkable chronicle of not just what he has said. What he said must be done. But it is a remarkable chronicle of what has not yet been done. 
>> It is part of our nature to demand explanations, to try to impose some order on the chaos, to make sense out of that which seems senseless. Already we've seen the national conversation commence, not only about the motivations behind these killings, but about everything from the merits of gun safety laws to the adequacy of our mental health system. And much -- much of this process of debating what might be done to prevent such tragedies in the future is an essential ingredient in our exercise of self government. 
>> I hope that over the next several days, next several weeks, and next several months we all reflect on how we can do something about some of the senseless violence that ends up marring this country, but also reflect on all the wonderful people who make this the greatest country on earth. 
>> Every day, in fact every day and a half, the number of young people we lose to violence is about the same as the number of people we lost in that movie theater. For every columbine or virginia tech there are dozens gunned down on the streets of chicago and atlanta, here in new orleans. For every tucson or aurora, there is daily heartbreak over young americans shot in milwaukee or cleveland. Violence plagues the biggest cities, but it also plagues the smallest towns. It claims the lives of americans of different ages and different races, and it's tied together by the fact that these young people had dreams and had futures that were cut tragically short. And when there is an extraordinarily heartbreaking tragedy like the one we saw, there is always an outcry immediately after for action. And there is talk of new reforms, and there is talk of new legislation. And too often those efforts are defeated by politics and by lobbying and eventually by the pull of our collective attention elsewhere. But what I said in the wake of tucson was, we were going to stay on this persistently. 

[00:31:27]


>> I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets. And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally? Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced. But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence. Because, frankly, in my hometown of chicago, there is an awful lot of violence. AND THEY'RE NOT USING AK-47s, They're using cheap handguns. 
>> As a country, we have been through this many times. We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. 
>> Regardless of the politics that is the crux, from tucson to aurora to being reelected to newtown, connecticut. Tohat we hope will never be next. CONGRESSWOMAN carolyn McCarthy joins us in just a moment.Ld him two things

>>> The msnbc policy analyst ezra klein put together a long piece today tying together what he knows about mass shootings and what seem to be policies that might relate to them as a social problem. Ezra, of course is a policy guy. So he was looking at this through a policy lens. And the data it turns out, some of it is what you might suspect. But some of it really isn't. For example, we all know that there are a lot of mass killings in the united states. Gun violence where multiple people are killed by the same assailant. This year alone before what happen today in connecticut, five people were killed in an atlanta suburb in february. A student shot up his high school cafeteria and killed three people later that same month at that christian university in oakland california back in april, there were seven people killed. A targeted shooting spree in tulsa, oklahoma was racially motivated. Five black men shot. Three of them died. Five people killed at the seattle cafe in may. There was the aurora massacre in july. 12 people killed, 58 additional people shot who were not killed. The sikh temple pass killing in oak creek, wisconsin, in august. That was the white supremacist guy. Six people were killed in that massacre. The gunman was also killed. In september, the minneapolis sign company with the disgruntled employee. Five people shot and killed there the wisconsin spa shooting in october, three people dead there plus the shooter. Just this week that mall in clackamas, oregon. Two dead plus the shooter. That was tuesday of this week. Incidents where someone with firearms kills multiple people. These incidents happen a lot in the united states. And we know that. But in ezra's piece today, we see if you put these shootings in an international context, it is even more striking. If you look internationally at the worst mass shooting incidents of the last 50 years, the worst mass shootings in a civilian context that have happened anywhere in the world over the course of the last half century, 15 of the 24 worst mass shootings internationally have happened in our country. Worldwide over 50 years, a majority of the world's mass shootings happen in one country, and that is us. They happen here. I might have suspected that, but I did not know that. Also interesting to note that there is not a direct correlation between the number of firearms in a country and the number of mass shootings they have. Yes, it's true we happen to have a lot of guns and a lot of mass shooting. But there are places that have a lot of guns like israel and switzerland there where there is not a correlation between their incident of guns and mass shootings. Ezra highlights an economist's recent research looking into whether gun violence in our country is correlated with a lot of other factors that we sometimes assume must be correlated with it. But it turns out that things like higher population density is not correlated with gun violence. It turns out that higher levels of stress in a definable geographic area are not correlated with higher gun violence in that area. Higher levels of mental illness are not correlated with gun violence in that area. The correlation you do find if you break things down to that level in the united states is that you do get less gun violence in places that have tighter gun control laws. Tighter gun control laws are correlated with fewer gun-related deaths. And that is correlation, that is not causation, but it's good to know, right? Ezra said today when -- ezra said today he first started to put together this index of gun-related wonk erie and data after the aurora, colorado shootings this summer. He says today in the "washington post," at this time when we first collected much of this data, the air was thick with calls to avoid politicizing the aurora tragedy. Ezra writes that is code, essentially, for don't talk about reforming our gun control laws. Let's be clear that is a form of politicization. It is just a form of politicization favoring those who prefer the status quo. Since then there have been more high profile shootings, ezra rights. Jovan belcher took his girlfriend's life and then his own. In oregon jacob tyler roberts entered a mall holding a semiautomatic rifle yelling "i am the shooter." And now in connecticut at least 27 are dead, including 20 children. If roads were collapsing all across the united states killing dozens of drivers, we would surely see that as a moment to talk what we could do to keep roads from collapsing. If a plague was ripping through communities, public health officials would be working feverishly to contain it. Only with gun violence do we respond to repeated tragedies by saying that mourning is acceptable. But discussing how to prevent more tragedies is not acceptable. Talking about how to stop mass shootings in the aftermath of a string of mass shootings, ezra writes is not too soon. It is much too late. Ezra there echoing comment there's from new york city's mayor michael bloomberg, who has long been very outspoken on this issue, but never more so than today. He says, quote, we heard after columbine that it was too soon to talk about gun laws. We heard it after virginia tech, after tucson and aurora and oak creek. And now we are hearing it again. For every day we wait, 34 more people are murdered with guns. Today many of them were 5-year-olds. President obama rightly sent his heartfelt condolences to the families in newtown. But the country needs him to send a bill to congress to fix this problem. Calling for meaningful action is not enough. We need immediate action. We've heard all the rhetoric before. What we have not seen is leadership, not from the white house and not from congress. That must end today. This is a national tragedy and it demands a national response. My deepest sympathies are with the families of all those affected. And my determination to stop this madness is stronger than ever. That is from mayor michael bloomberg. In 1993 there was a mass shooting on the long island railroad in new york. Six people were killed. 19 people were shot and wounded. CONGRESSWOMAN carolyn McCarthy's husband was among those killed, and her son was among those wounded. After that attack in 1993, carolyn McCarthy ran for congress on a gun control platform, and she won that seat in congress. Today in response to what happened in connecticut, carolyn McCARTHY SAID "THESE SHOOTINGS Are becoming all too common, and it's too easy for dangerous people to get the weapons that help them perform mass executions like today's. Leaders in washington from both parties and groups like the nra all say that now is not the time to talk about how gun safety laws can save lives in america. I agree. Now is not the time to talk about gu laws. The time for that conversation was long before all those kids in connecticut died today." carolyn McCarthy's mention of the national rifle association, the nra is what everybody is talking about when they talk about the need for leadership regardless of the political consequences on this issue. When the president today said we are going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics, he was talking there about the power of the nra as a lobby. And it is true that they have so dominated their field of policy that instead of having the gun laws most americans would like to have, it sometimes seems like instead we as a nation just have the gun policies that the members of the nra would want. That is the impression that we all have. But that is not at all true either. We do not have the gun policies in this nation that members of the nra want for this nation. Look at this polling from july of this year. This is nra members. 57% of the nra members believe that everyone who wants to buy a gun should have to pass a criminal background check. 71% of nra members support banning people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns. Those are not things that are true of american law right, which is amazing. If you are on the freaking terrorist watch list, you can buy a gun in america. If we're going to get past this almost hysterical fear of trying to do anything at all on gun rights, if we're going to try to puncture the myth that anything to reform or rationalize gun laws is absolutely politically impossible as a categorical thing, what would happen if we just started at the edges? What would happen if we just started even members of the nra say they want from national gun laws? Because they want a hell of a lot more than we've got right now. The organization they are a member of may not admit that, but when you poll their members, even they want improvements. Could we at least start with what nra members want? Joining us now is congresswoman carolyn McCarthy. She is a democrat of new york. Congresswoman, thank you very much for joining us tonight. It's nice to have you here. 

[00:43:36]


>> Thank you, rachel. And thank you for giving that important information out to your audience. 
>> We have spoken after previous mass incidents of gun violence in our country, meaningful conversations of gun control did not happen after tucson or after aurora. Do you think this time might be different? 
>> I'm hoping. Today when the president spoke, his tone seemed a little different. Maybe it's because of my hope, because we're going to need a president to lead us through this if we are going to do something. And I agree with you, you know, why can't the nra and many of us that are not trying to take away your right to own a gun, but to certainly make sure that the guns don't fall into the wrong hands. And as nra members have said, let's close the gun show loophole. Let's make sure everybody goes through a background check. Let's make sure that we can do whatever we can so the easy access to guns can save lives. You and I have had these conversations before. You're absolutely right. The nra and the gun manufacturers, which would supply them with the money through the lobbying firms are the ones that are basically making all politicians, the majority of politicians shake in their boots. We are supposed to be there to protect the people. We are supposed to be there to make legislation, to make lives better. And we're able to do that. But to be very honest, the american people and nra members actually go forward and say enough is enough. We can do better than this. You and I have talked about this before, rachel. We spend billions of dollars every single year because of people that die from gun violence and people that survive from gun violence. It's costing our society -- I've always looked at it as a health -- national health crisis. And this are so many things that we can do. You know, even just what we're going to be doing when we go back to washington next week, when they're going to be talking about cutting the budgets back. We've already closed many of our mental health clinics down. We're already cutting back on reaching out to young people. We're even doing that to our veterans as they come home. Where is this going to stop? What kind of mass murder do you want out there before we say enough is enough? If I sound frustrated, I'm sorry. I've been crying all day. And all the victims that I know across this country have been crying also. For the children that have died, for the parents that have to go through what they're going to be going through, not only this week, next week, but for a very long time. The christmas lights are up. The hanukkah candles are being lit. And these families are going to be suffering for so much longer. It's only the american people can say to their politicians do something.

[ Male Announcer ] POLIDENT. Cleaner, fresher, brighter every day. 
>>> We'll have more on the mass shooting in connecticut at this hour, but there is some other news to get to tonight. Sometimes on days like this is there is important news that gets crowded out because of the day's story. But there is other important stuff I want to make sure you know about. The first of these stories is that president obama this afternoon sent a formal letter to congress, which he is required to do by law, informing congress of where he has been deploying american troops. Since the 1973, the war powers resolution requires them to update congress on military decisions he has made without them. President obama's letter today explains that there are 66,000 u.S. Troops remaining in afghanistan. But it also includes places we have troops that we are not as familiar with. We currently have 79 troops deployed in uganda, 76 are in kosovo, that is left over from the peace-keeping mission from THE '90s. And in yemen, there are troops after the attack on the embassy, they were told in the president's letter that tonight the troops remain in libya and in yemen for the future. But even beyond that accounting from the president to congress tonight, we do have one more nation to add to that list of where americans are deployed abroad. They are deployed now to turkey. And this is the second thing to know in today's news that is swallowed by the vortex of the news today. They are being deployed to turkey in order to operate these. This is a patriot missile launcher, this is a u.S.-Made surface to air missile system, designed to seek out and find incoming missiles. Designed to shoot rockets out of the sky. As the syrian government is accused by nato of using scud missiles inside syria, the u.S. Is now sending to battles of patriot missiles. That is the nation of turkey, turkey had requested these patriot missile batteries earlier this month. Today we found out they are not only getting the missiles, they are getting 400 americans to operate them, ars well. And that will have huge diplomatic consequences of syria decides to project force over their border into turkey. Because there will now not be just turks there, but american uniformed military personnel, as well. More to learn other than what is going on in connecticut. The intelligence committee in the senate decided to approve a report more than three years in the making, a report detailing the cia's torture during the bush administration. The senate reviewed the 6 million pages of intelligence documents, now submitting their report which is 6,000 pages on what -- the chair of the committee says the un -- says the classified report uncovers" startling details about the cia and detention program." Before the report can be released to the public, and it is not even certain yet that that will happen, the cia gets a chance to review the findings, and essentially to give their side of the story. Well, tonight, nbc's andrea mitchell has obtained an internal e-mail from the acting director of the cia to all the employees of the cia. It says in part "we are well aware that this program has been the subject of much controversy. It is important to remember that the program was terminated by presidential executive order almost four years ago." Again, that was an internal e-mail obtained tonight by andrea mitchell from the acting cia director, michael morrell, to cia employs. A news day like this tends to occlude all the other news, for good reason, but that is what is going on, we'll be right back. ] bob, a regular guy with an irregular heartbeat. The usual, bob?

[ Gps ] turn left. I don't think so. 
[ Male Announcer ] FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN, And made a monthly trip to the clinic to get his blood tested. But not anymore. Bob's doctor recommended a different option: Once-a-day xarelto????. Xarelto???? is the first and only once-a-day prescription blood thinner for patients with afib not caused by a heart valve problem, that doesn't require routine blood monitoring. Like warfarin, xarelto???? is proven effective to reduce the risk of an afib-related stroke. There is limited data on how these drugs compare when warfarin is well managed. No routine blood monitoring means bob can spend his extra time however he likes. New zealand! Xarelto???? is just one pill a day, taken with the evening meal. And with no dietary restrictions, bob can eat the healthy foods he likes. Do not stop taking xarelto???? rivaroxaban without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping may increase your risk of having a stroke. Get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of bleeding, like unusual bruising or tingling. You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take xarelto???? with aspirin products, nsaids or blood thinners. Talk to your doctor before taking xarelto???? if you currently have abnormal bleeding. Xarelto???? can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. You are likely to bruise more easily on xarelto????, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop. Tell your doctors you are taking xarelto???? before any planned medical or dental procedures. Before starting xarelto????, tell your doctor about any conditions, such as kidney, liver or bleeding problems. Ready to change your routine? Ask your doctor about once-a-day xarelto????.

>>> This afternoon in washington, d.C., At roughly the same time, flags atop the white house and the u.S. Capitol building were both lowered to half staff. President obama ordered flags to be flown at half staff in all u.S. Public buildings and grounds and all u.S. Facilities and consulates in the world. In the wake of the massacre in newtown, connecticut. Flags will remain at half staff until sunset on tuesday. And it was the sight of the flags, the president wiping tears from his eyes, repeatedly, at the white house. Speaker john boehner issued a statement that the republican address will not be happening this weekend so that "president obama can speak for the nation at this time of mourning." I join the president in condolences and prayers to the victims' loved ones. And on sunday, there will be a prayer vigil at the church.

Listen. Are you going to see him now? You can give him some news for me. Tell him it's the worst prognosis ever. (laughing) Oh! I knew this day would come. Alough frankly, I thought it would have been a long time ago. You are very uncurious about your body. All right, Comic Book Guy. Tell me my origin story. I will not relive the horror of that day! The answer is "no," and I can say it in Na'vi or Klingon, which are pretty much the same. I have some theories on that which I will share with you never. You leave me no choice. I hold in my hands a mint-condition copy of the legendary Interesting StoriesNumber Oh! Oh, the first appearance of Radioactive Man. And if you don't tell us what we want to know... (cries out) How do I know that is not a cheap reprint? Are you willing to take that chance? Yes. No! No! No! I'll tell you what you want to know. Could we hurry this up? I am really uncomfortable being a girl in this store. Very well. I shall tell you what happened to you and your friends several years ago. But for you to understand it, I must go back a little further. Our story begins with the creation of Middle Earth, as recounted in the Ainulindale and the Valaquenta.

It was seven years ago, a time when "twilight" meant the end of the day and not the most barftastic horror franchise of all time.

Even though most of this town collaborated with the British, and we are still in informal talks to return to their empire, we all love fireworks! Crowd: Yay!

I love you kids with all my heart, but damn it, I need something for myself! I made you a coffee mug on Mother's Day! Isn't that enough? It's close, but no. I could light these, but it wouldn't be the same. (laughing) Well, I've put it off but today I'm finally getting this garage organized. (loud explosion) HOMER (dazed): Guess I'll put these tools away. Hang 'em on hooks and such. So Bart, the little dicke, was gonna set off an explosion to break us up. Can you believe it? (giggles) Actually, we can believe it. What are you talking about? Your son always was the bad apple of the bunch. You know nothing about my son and even less about apples. (gasps) (gun cocks, fires) I remember why I left this group seven years ago, and it's why I'm leaving now. Good day, ladies. Sorry you broke up with your friends, Mom. Oh, I think they were never my friends. Maybe true friends aren't random people you meet at a Mommy-and-Me class. They're random people you meet in a college dorm. Maybe Lisa and I can be friends. Not with each other, but with you. Oh... Ow!

Ah! Grr. Hey, does Dad know you and the cool moms broke up? Well, Homer got along so well with the other dads, I couldn't break it to him. Oh. Can we at least drink beer or something?

H is also dead at the scene, was also killed. She is a teacher and she was also killed at that school, according to our law enforcement sources. In addition to this, we are also told by our sources that another person is being questioned at this time but is not being called a suspect right now, and also that person is not being identified, wolf. So while the school is being called secure and safe by law enforcement authorities right now, they are -- they still have a lot of investigating to do. They have not officially released the name of the shooter or the other person being questioned or the names of any of the victims at this time. It's just an awful scene, and parents found out about this, wolf, when they received a lot of them text messages, alerts from the school that had them rushing over to the school as a 911 call came in. Police arrived on the scene, they tried to secure the scene and make sure that it was safe so that all the children were immediately evacuated from the school and brought to a safe location nearby where they could be reunited with their parents. We know this one thing from the shooter. We understand that at least three weapons were found at the scene. One of them a glock, one of them a sig sauer and one of them a 223 bushmaster. We don't know exactly what kind of models but we have that as well. And here's more about how it all came down from start to finish. These connecticut parents had dropped off their kids for a typical friday at school. Then about 9:30 in the morning, they received robo calls and text messages. Sandy hook elementary school was put on alert. 
>> I just got a message saying -- from the superintendent that there was -- there was an unconfirmed shooting and, you know, everybody is in lock down. 
>> I was a little scared. I felt sick to my stomach. 

[00:02:01]


>> Reporter: A gunman was firing away teachers went into lockdown and parents rushed to the scene. 
>> I heard screaming. And so we -- we went -- like we went to the wall and we sat down and then police came in. It's like is he in here? Then he ran out. Then our teacher -- then somebody yelled get to a safe place. 
>> Inside, children were hiding as a gunman fired away. 
>> They were crying in the closet. In the closet of the art room. And eventually, they were leaving and when they were leaving, the police made them hold hands. The police told them to close their eyes. 
>> Told to keep their eyes closed because a gunman was on a killing spree, killing the principal, a counselor, child after child. 
>> On and off duty troopers responded to the school. That included checking every door, every crack, every crevice, every portion of that school. 
>> Reporter: And again, our understanding is that all of this happened in one particular area of the school, just one area of the school where all the shooting occurred, according to police, in two rooms. They may be two classrooms. We certainly know that the shooter, wolf, was found dead in one of those classrooms as well. So a lot of questions, a lot of heartache and people walking around this small town now i connecticut, newtown, connecticut, it's so hard for them to believe and to understand what happenedhere back to you. 
>> They haven't said officially that the shooter wound up killing himself, have they? 
>> Reporter: They have not. They have not revealed that. They have not officially released the shooter's name either. We also understand, remember, there is another adult at another location who was also found dead and we believe that that has some connection to the shooter in this case, and yet someone else was also being questioned. So this investigation is far from over. There is a warrant being served at the place where the suspect lived with someone else, who was also involved in the shooting. And so a lot of questions, of course, as we all have at this time to find out how this happened and, wolf, why this happened. 

[00:04:21]


>> Many questions that law enforcement will be investigating. Susan, stand by. Joining us on the phone right now is lieutenant paul vance, a spokesman for the connecticut state police. He's in newtown himself. I don't know if you have the answers, lieutenant, and you must be overwhmed right now. But first of all, can you identify the shooter in this particular case? Can you give us that person's name? 
>> Wolf, we do have a tentative identification, but for investigative reasons we're holding back that information for our own purposes. You are correct in saying that there is a secondary scene in newtown away from the school at a private home where there's another deceased adult that may be related to this. Just for investigatory reasons, we're holding back that identity right at this time. 
>> Can you tell us if the shooter did have a connection, though, to the school? There's been a lot of speculation that the shooter's mother, for example, was a teacher inside one of those classrooms. 
>> We need to, again, be extremely cautious in releasing that information. That will be forthcoming, i would say, within the next three or four hours but at this time we haven't discussed that at all. 
>> Is there another suspect on the loose right now? I want to clarify that because we are getting conflicting indications. 
>> In the fashion of what occurred as far as this shooter is concerned, I mean we are talking to everyone who possibly had any connection with him whatsoever. We had to obtain search warrants to search his residence and place of employment and i iniewed friends and relatives and we are really ensuring or making sure that we leave no stone unturned into the background of this individual. 
>> To make sure that the numbers that we received are precise, 26 people were shot and 20 were children. The shooter himself, do we suspect he killed himself? 
>> That will be dwrmed by the medical examiner. As far as we know there was no law enfoent discharge of weaponry. It's important to note when the call came in, newtown police officers all responded immediately and upon arrival went in with tactical injury. Immediately entered the school and began searching every nook and cranny to perform a rescue of the students and staff we possibly could. We did accomplish that task, but encountered as you said the deceased students which numbered 18 in the school and two were transport and pronounced dead and six adults were pronounced dead at the scene and then the secondary senior which was another adult.

>> Can you tell us about this scene if there was a connection between the shooter and the person who was dead? 
>> It's all preliminary. I am directing 99% of my attention to the school. You can understand there is a great deal going on trying to keep family and friends and relatives informed as far as what we know. We certainly discovered that scene in concert with this investigation as I was saying. We did a lot of work we have all related areas. 
>> In newtown itself in this vicinity in that smalltown. 
>> It's a smalltown. It's not far away. I would be condit with you. It was in a residence right here in the town. The secondary scene was located by troopers. 
>> We have one crime scene at the school and another individual is dead. Are there others that you are searching or looking at? 
>> We have a great deal of personnel here. We brought in not just crime team, but another. We are responding and check everything and anything that could possibly be related to the tragedy participating here. John king is here with us here at cnn and has a question he wants to ask. 
>> Lieutenant, I know your officers are collecting evidence at the scene. What is your preliminary estimate of how many shots were fired in the school? 
>> That's a tough one. I wouldn't even venture a guess quite frankly. We will have to determine that with several systems of checks and balances. One certainly being a medical examination of the deceased and collecting physical evidence and shells and examining the weaponry and collecting any bullets that have been randomly shot. It will be a long process before we can guestimate that question. 

[00:09:30]


>> I know you are making sure you checked every box, but is it the understanding that the shooter came with a primary target armed for a mass killing and came for a primary target and sources said that was his mother. 
>> I can't answer that question because the information has not been provided as of yet. 
>> Were there explosives provided in addition to the weapons? 
>> No. That's a good question because once the scene was secure, we realized the tactical team will check th sites and the vehicles and anything to do with the shooter to ensure that there were in fact no explosives or no other issues needed to engage. 
>> Did the shooter in addition coming in with these weapons also have -- was he dressed in armor and did he have protection for himself? 
>> I don't know the answer to that. 
>> He was obviously found dead-on the scene and no other law enforcemen that came in to kill anyone. Presumably this individual wound up killing himself, but you can't confirm that yet. Is that right? 
>> That's correct. That's a good assessment as to what we know so far. 
>> John has one more question. 
>> We are told that the second scene that the neighbors were evacuateed from their homes around the home, was that as a precaution or do you have an indication or concern that there heavy weapons or explosives? 
>> It's a procedure of what we do and we want to be cautious and err on the side of caution. We evacuated the neighbors in the event that there was anything that was harmful as we begin to examine the scene. 
>> Was this person a known person of concern to local law enforcement or when you found out his identification, you are not releasing it and when you found it out, was it a total surprise? 
>> I am not aware of a specific history and that's something that the detectives will look at as they continue the examination of the entire case and we will make it a point to know his history. Everything that we will do in this case. 

[00:11:50]


>> When are you release the numbers, lieutenant, one thing in addition to the huge number, 26 people killed and 20 of them children. You pointed out that one person was injured. Only one injury. Does that say to you that 26 people were shot and killed and only one person injured? 
>> To put it bluntly, this is a very, very tragic scene for everybody. Certainly our hearts are broken for the families here. The first responders that had to go to the school and see the carnage and the deaths this time of year, I can almost have difficulty putting it into words for a very, very long time. I have seen horrific things and this is right up there. 
>> What a horrific story. Lieutenant vance, thanks so much for updating the viewers here in the united states and around the world. The story unfortunately is so ho hisk o risk, but people all over the world are appreciating what's going on and we are only beginning to get the beginning of this information. Lieutenant paul vance is with the connecticut state police. Thank you very much, lieutenant. Joining us now on the phone is a parent as well. Tell us where you were and what was going on. Your connection to the school. 
>> My daughter is a third grader and she was there actually in her reading class. They heard bangs and thank god for mrs. Summers. Her reading teacher grabbed my daughter and brought her into a bathroom. She locked the door along with another teacher. In a short time, some police were able to get them out of there and escort them through the hall ways. Unfortunately it was a messy scene for my daughter. 
>> I spoke with your wife, lisa and she said your daughter seems to be okay. You also have a 10-year-old son. How are the kids doing now? 

[00:13:57]


>> I don't know if my daughter is in shock or not, but from what she told me she saw, she is doing incredibly well. My son is doing great too, but there is a lot of fears. The game is changed from this point on. Per are what does that mean when you say the game is changed. 
>> My kids are asking when is it going to happen again. It was only a week ago we were talking about this type of situation and I said the chances of it happening are one in a zillion at sandy hook. I was wrong about that. 
>> We know you knew the principal, dawn hochsprung who was killed in the mass murder today. Tell us a little bit about her. 
>> She was just so nice and she loved her job. On a couple of occasions she went out of her way just to help us with certain things that we were working on with our daughter. This is all so surreal so forgive me if I am cloudy. 
>> We appreciate it and can't imagine what you are going through. John king has a question. 
>> Sadly in any community when tragedy like this happens, there notification systems and how specific was that information and obviously the officials at the school were dealing with a tragedy. Do you think that part was handled appropriately? 
>> I think they did the best they could do. I don't know how you prepare for something this crazy. My wife called me. I work in new york and my wife told me there was a shooting and I rushed home. My wife was already in town. So far the newtown school system has been great in leaving automatic phone updates with the parents. 

[00:16:00]


>> A sad story. Quick question before I let you go. At some point you will have to make aision about letting your kids go back to sandy hook elementary school. What are you going to do? 
>> This is all so new. I have been talking to my kids and explaining this is what happened. You do your best to communicate with them and do your best to -- it's funny that a bomb hits and there is a lot of smoke and it's still here. I haven't had enough time to really plan, but hopefully by the time they go back to school, I will have done a good enough job of making them feel as comfortable as they can be. 
>> How is your wife doing? 
>> She is hanging in there. 
>> Give all of them our love and sympathy and support. We wish them only the best. This is a parent of the kids from that sandy hook elementary school. The kids got out okay, but obviously 20 other children did not get out okay. 18 of them died on the scene and two others died at the hospital as a result of the injuries. 
>> I think a remarkable conversation dealing wi the unthinkable in trying to explain to young children in the middle of the holiday season that the unthinkable happened in their school and for many of the children when they go back, many of their friends won't be there. It's a tough task for the parents. I wanted to wrap up the conversation and understandably you covered stories like this in the past. The police are being careful what they say and I wanted to give you more of the information I have. Federal law enforcement officials based on information from their people on the scene and the state police on the scene do believe that the shooter showed up with the intent of obviously armed for a mass killing, but they believe his mother, a teacher there was the primary target and most of the devastation happened in and around her classroom at the school. That is the theory they are operating under as they collect the evidence in the scene and they found a family member slain at the second site in newtown and they are interviewing friends and roommates as they try to put this together. Their belief at this point is he arrived at the school and went directly towards and to her classroom and most of the killing was done in that area. 

[00:18:36]


>> The children were killed right there. They found three weapons, is that right? These are pretty sophisticated weapons they found. When you hear these numbers, 26 people kill and 20 of them children and one injured. If you have a situation where people are killed, there is a lot of other people. Looks like this person wanted to execute this person. I was told that the number of spent shells were mind-numbing. When the gunman opened fire, it was in a concentrated area. He was in the in the halls. In and around his mother's classroom, but that he just kept firing. 
>> He a lot of rounds. Some of the eyewitnesss were telling us they heard boom, boom, boom, boom. Nevering what they heard coming from the middle classrooms. 
>> The number of shots fired that I think is the reason why you don't have five, six, 15 people treated at the hospital. It's a low number. Because of the devastation. 
>> Mary snow is on the scene in newtown, connecticut. You are outsid the shooter's mother's home we respect in newtown, is that right? 
>> Reporter: That's right, wolf. You are talking to lieutenant vance of the connecticut state police. Presumably he was talking about this scene. Police have been here for hours now. Several hours. Just about an hour ago, we saw a s.W.A.T. Team leaving the scene. It has been blocked off. Not only to us, but to residents who can't go into the homes. We did also see an ambulance leaving the scene about 3:15 and police are being tight-lipped here about the location where they are. We can you from residents, one who lived near the suspect's mother said that police came in at about 11:00 to her home and told hershey needed to get out right away. At one point she was escorted back to her house and told she had to leave again. There is no time table being given to the residents about when they can reenter their homes. Many law enforcement vehicles are at this scene and in terms of what neighbors are saying, these homes are far apart. We haven't found many neighbors who knew the suspect or his mother, but we reached one woman who just described the suspect at troubled and saying the parents were divorce and didn't want to go further than that. This community is so shaken to the core and filling up with tears any time you approach them saying so many young children are in the community. 

[00:21:47]


>> This is a small community. To set the scene, only about 80 miles from new york city and 40 miles or so from hartford. Under 2,000 people live in newtown. It's a small community not far from danbury, connecticut. Peaceful and wonderful place where we heard from a lost individuals with families who moved there because the school system is considered excellent there and despite the sandy hook elementary school, kindergarten to fourth great is a wonderful school although this tragedy devastated so many folks. 
>> Reporter: Yeah. People had such high praise for the school system here and it has been described as a sleepy new england town. It's lined with beautiful homes on a very quiet road here. The shock is such an under statement to say that that's what people are saying. They just hear it over and over again that people never thought something like this can happen. 
>> They can't believe it and it is unbelievable, but it happened and it's real unfortunately. So real. Mary, stand by. Adam reece is in hoboken, new jersey across the river from new york city. He is joining us. What's the connection, explain to the viewers the connection between what happened in newtown, connecticut and what's going on in hoboken, new jersey right now. 
>> Wolf, we believe the shooter may have lived here. This may be the location where he may have set out from this morning to head up to newtown, connecticut. Police tell us they have in custody two people who may have been roommates of his. They are being questioned. They do not believe they were involved in the shooting. Fbi and local police and a lom squad have been here for most of the afternoon. Fbi agents went back into the building. It's a five-story building and has two halves to it. Three bedrooms inside. It's a rental and I talked to several residents here who live in the building and nearby. None of them know the shooter, alleged shooter or his brother who may have lived here. They have seen pictures in news reports. The pictures do not look familiar to them. You may know that hoboken is a waterfront community that looks across from new york city. It's a growing community for young professionals and hit hard by hurricane sandy. We wait and there has been no movement other than the police here that you see in the picture standing guard. Agents are coming back and forth. 

[00:24:37]


>> The whole area is cordoned off? We are looking at live pictures and police officers and we see the tape posted. Give us a description of what you are seeing. 
>> At least two blocks in east direction is blocked off. A huge media presence waiting to see what developed here and whether or not this is in fact the home of the alleged shooter, whether or not his brother lived here with him. What the connection is to newtown. What the connection is with his mother. There is a facebook page that indicates his home here, that he is originally from newtown. I cannot confirm that's him and his page. That's all we know. The area is cordoned off and at least two blocks in each direction. 
>>> Local police there saying anything providing the news media with any information? 
>> There was a very short briefing from the local police chief. As I indicated before, two people are in custody. They may be the shooter's roommates, but they don't believe they had involvement in the shooting. 
>> When we say in custody, it sounds like they had a role. Maybe more precisely, they are just being questioned about what they know or may have known about the alleged shooter. 
>> Right. I don't want to suggest they had any role. It just may be they are looking to find out more background information about the alleged shooter. 
>> I think that's an important distinction that or viewers appreciate. Anything else you want to update the viewers with? 
>> Anxiously anticipating what may come out of this and what's inside the apartment and may lead us to understand why someone may have done this. What kind of reading material he had and what is on his computer. We just don't know. 

[00:26:38]


>> There a lot of questions that will have to be answer and if there is a statement or indication as to why this individual went to the small elementary school, sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut and opened fire killing a teacher or principal and 20 children in greats kindergarten through fourth grade. What a shocking story. We will stay in close touch with you. A young boy at the school where the shooting happened described how he and other children escaped. 
>> I was in the gym at the time. So the teacher and we heard a lost bangs. We thought it was the custodian knocking stuff down and we heard screaming. We went to the wall and sat down and then a police came in and said is he in here and ran out. Our teacher and someone yelled get to a safe place. We went to the closet in the gym. We sat there for a little while and then the police were knocking on the door and they were like we are evacuating people. We ran out and there were police at every door leading us down this way, down this way, quick, quick, come on. We ran down to the firehouse. There was a man pinned down to the ground with handcuffs on and we thought that was the victim. We didn't get a good glance at him because there was a car blocking it. Plus we were running really quick. Then we got to the firehouse and we sat in our classes and we were all really happy we were all alive. 
>> By the way, when we intrude these young kids, we do it only with their parents's permission. Their parents are there on the scene. We don't talk to the children unless the parents say they want the child to speak out and they are there to watch these interviews. We are very sensitive to young children in these kind of tragedies. Obviously a lot of families are feeling the pain right now. We heard earlier from the president of the united states. Let's bring in dr. Drew pinsky, the host of dr. Drew on our sister network, hln. We have been talking about what's going on. These kind of tragic incidents often can be prevented if loved ones, family members and neighbors and friends pay attention to warning signs. 

[00:29:21]


>> That's right, wolf. Paying attention is the big lesson from so much we have been hearing in thenews. Denial by family members and parents is the enemy. You cannot imagine how many situations I have been in where I give family members very specific directions to prevent disasters and they choose to stay in denial and come to terms with the fact that their loved one is not doing well and may not be trust worthy and may be aggressive or violent. As I sit and listen to the story, I have been watching this wonderful coverage you have been providing that helps us understand what happened as the days go on. We will try to understand why it happened. E feelings that rush over me and run from sadness to disgust and rage myself. Disgust is mostly where I find myself today. Disgust that these lives should have been extinguished so young, we cannot allow these lives to have been lost in vain. You did a remarkable interview with a father of a young child in one of the rooms. He said they had just discussed the issue and I'm sure he was talking about the oregon shooter and reassuring this is children this could never happen in their community and now he is addressing them with the question they are asking him, when is this going to happen again? That is the question that every one of our children will ask us tonight. They will feel vulnerable and when is it going to happen to us and happen again? These stories are flooding the news and we must, each of us as a household lead our way out of this. This requires leadership. Our political leaders are sort of not giving us quite what i think we need today. We will be okay. This is a rient country and we will get through this. We are in a new zone when evil prevailed. We are not going to allow this. It's okay to be firm and empathetic with people if someone is misbehaving. Be firm and take action. We will get through this. It's going to be okay. That's what we have to tell our kids. 

[00:31:29]


>> What motivates someone to go out and shoot and kill children? 
>> You are asking a question that ills me with disgust to have to answer. It's one thing to explain what happened in oregon. Perhaps this young man had a break or was exposed to a chemical or something that caused him to think in a distorted way. This is not just that. This is somebody who felt entitle and justified to act out. This is grandiosity and feeling special. This is feeling like he is more important than any of these other lives or exposed us to this violence and is going to show why he is so important and feel very justified in what he is doing. This is a longer term kind of distorted thinking than what we saw in oregon. 
>> Then this person supposedly winds up killing himself. It seems so totally y. 
>> Right. Why wouldn't he just kill himself? Why does he have to take the lives with him? That is the grandiosity and the distortion and the entitlement and aggression. When people talk about evil, i suspect that's what we are talking about here. I don't know what happened and the details about this man's mental health, but I suspect it's going to be chronic severe troubled behavior that for whatever reason was not properly managed. 
>> Before I let you go, chemical imbalances in the brain, sometimes you hear psychiatrists and psychologists talking about something that snaps and causes people to do this. Give us your sense. 
>> That's what I was talking about just days ago in relation to oregon. That was more that kind of a circumstance. This no doubt there was stress. All human behavior is because of this instrument up here. Something obviously did cross a threshold for him that caused him to act out violently. Again this is something of a more chronic, severe, structural wiring nature in the brain and regions not firing or never firing that would allow someone to be em pathic or feel like a part of humanity. There parts of the brain that allow us to feel that way. Those parts of the brain in terms of misfiring the brain, i suspect those are the areas we will see chronically were not operating normally. 

[00:34:06]


>> Not normally at all. Thanks very much for your perspective. Our producer has been in a firestorm here where the panic rushed to find their children and many of the parents are inside right now including parents who have lost their kids. Describe the information you have seen and heard. 
>> We had imagine vehicles in and around this firehouse and they make their way towards the school. This is the stopping point where emergency vehicles stop at and head towards the school. We have seen atf and fbi. Many of them carry assault weapons and wearing gear and like you mentioned, there families still inside this firehouse. I think it's a short while ago really quite a moving scene. There were three sets is of prarnts that we can only assume are parents. Three sets of couples walking out of the firehouse and their eyes were bloodshot and lips trembling and the firemen es coring them out seemed as visibly shaken as them. They are not talking to anyone, but it's a small slice of what's happening and it happened throughout the day here. Since I have been standing here, you see those parents you see the individuals and nurses and you see school cafeteria workers. You see nuns even walking in and around and speaking with those emergency workers and speaking with parents. There few words that you can put to someone. Ask them about what they are feeling. I was thinking about what i might say about all of this. It's one of the few instances that leaves you without words to capture the tree magnitude of what hned here. I walked into town earlier and sat in a restaurant and people are watching the news. They will pick their head back up and watch again. Others are at the media staging area to get a sense of what is transpiring and the sense of wanting to be with the community. Like you mentioned, this is a small sleepy town in new england. There is a cemetery that sits over the overpass that looks on to that firehouse and down the road is the school. When you think about what transpired in that school, it's like dr. Drew said, it leaves with you a sense of disgust. 

[00:36:46]


>> Total disgust. It's going to be dark there pretty soon, but the firehouse where you are, the parents and loved ones are being consoled by grief counsellors and others. Clergy inside as well. We spoke to a rabbi who is inside consoling the family members. 
>> What you can do to console someone who just lost a child. Someone at that age, I can't begin to imagine. The word inconsolable applies here. This is something that the community is going to be dealing with and realing for for a long time now. You talk to residents and get the sense that a lot of these people know each other. A lot of people moved to the area from what they told because of the school system. I talked to a treecher who said that. To have something like this take place in one of the schools and one of the elementary schools at that, it just leaves you without words. 
>> David, tnks very much for that update. One of our producers on the scene. We have mary snow there and susan candiotti. We have other reporters and producers watching what's going on in newtown, connecticut. Also we saw adam reece on the scene in hoboken, new jersey, a connection between a residential area and what unfolded at the small elementary school in newtown, connecticut. I want you to listen it a local nurse who ran to the scene soon after the shooting and described what she saw. 
>> I see you have been crying. 
>> Yes. 
>> Is it because of what you saw? 
>> No, they wouldn't let us in the building. All I can say is one of the cops said it was the worst thing he had seen in his entire career. It was when they told all these parent who is were waiting for their parents to come out, they thought they were still alive. There is 20 parents that were just told their children are dead. It was awful. 

[00:39:05]


>> Awful indeed. Ashleigh banfield is now on the scene for us in newtown, connecticut as well. I know you got there a little while ago, but give our viewers a sense of what you are seeing and hearing. 
>> I'm in the same place that the connecticut governor dan malloy updated us all. You can see from the collection of microphones this is a concentrated media center. There dozens of reporters here and arriving every moment. I hate to bring this up, but it gives me the sense of columbine and how massive the scope of this story has become. One of the updates we got, devastating detail on this. That is the investigation that is about to ensue. Wolf, the bodies of those children are still in the school. 18 children died in the school and were dead on the scene. Two more taken to the hospital and died there. The six adults also who died at the school, their bodies are still there. The police who updated us told us that the scope of the investigation, the amount of work they have to do to piece this all together is going to take a very long e. You can imagine how the parents are dealing with the ft that they can+t even get the information or at least know that their child is being brought out of that school. It is just overwhelming in this tiny community of 27,000 people. In the sticks. When you drive here, you are winding roads and hills and the hoare far apart and yet the community is quite close together. A couple of other things that shed light on the detail on how the shooting took place, the policeld us that the shootings were concentrated and they were in an area of the school, particularly two rooms. There wasn't running through the halls as they described it. No shooter running through the halls and shooting. It might give some description as to why we think there was a concentration of one entire dlasz is unaccounted for that the shooting happened in those two rooms. There was another crime scene now in this tiny town of newtown, connecticut. Police are inigating another in a home. We can tell you that there were many couch terms being used. People are being very careful in how they report this, but they said the shooter in the school lived with one of the victims. We also know that his mother was a kindergarten teacher and shot dead in the school. Whether that is the home where they are investigating as well is unclear. His father living in the town as well and a brother too. There is a lot of detail we need to piece together. Another detail that came from the mouth of a child with the sweetest voice who is being intrude earlier this afternoon. This child told a story of how the teachers tried to protect them from the information as they were getting them out of the school, saying there was an animal in the school and that's why they needed to lock the doors to protect them from the noise theyould hear which was a wild animal that got into the school. To hear that tiny voice telling that, it was pretty remarkable. 

[00:42:11]


>> I know this is a difficult story for all of us to cover. I know you have children. 
>> I have two small children in a connecticut school about 30 minutes away from here as well. When the news broke it was tough to sort out where it happened. Which elementary school it was. As the details roll in, everybody has been immensely affected and apologize, but it is remarkable to see this many seasoned reporters who I have been in the field with for 20 years all having the same reaction to what's transpired. 
>> You choked up and the president of the united states is choking up and wiping away tears as well. Your girls, how are they? Your kids. 
>> My kids are fine. What's interesting is even though they are about I half hour away from here, when i called the school to find out is everything okay and are we under lockdown and what's the protocol and are you sending the kids home? It affected them deeply. They did perimeter checks and made sure that all the locked doors were locked. They did something I didn't know about. They went into an information protective mode and said no one is allowed to discussions the details within the school walls. In the only 30 minutes away, but they would have staff and security outside that school just to handle the potential for children to hear about it. They clearly want the kids to hear about it from their parents. They are all going to hear about it and ask questions and make sure they are sensitive to the surrounding children as they can be. It is a really overwhelming feeling to live here and to be here as a reporter. 
>> It's a powerful, powerful image that you are presenting and just think about it. Saturday and sunday, kids don't have to go to school, but monday morning, kids in your neighborhood and newtown, connecticut and all over the united states, they are going to be going back to school the week before christmas and what an awful time to have to endure this pain. 
>> I tell you what, wolf. The school is beyond those trees. I don't know if it's light enough to see. We are located in the staging area where the police wanted to make sure the hundreds of media they would send here would be able to be safely park and out of the way of the residents. Beyond this playing field and over those trees is where the school is located. Because one of the descriptions that came in from someone who was in a meeting with sev grown up when is this happened, there were roughly 100 rounds that this parent could hear. A woman telling her story. The investigation alone, once the tiny bodies are removed and the adults are removed. The investigation of the trajectory and where the bullets landed or angle the bullets came from, there was so much that will need to be known. I doubt anyone will be coming to this school for a long time. 

[00:45:02]


>> Police are going to be getting their investigation. Please stand by. I will come back to you and i know you are collecting more information here in washington. Ere is a vigil outside the white hoand a lot of people are gathering right now. The president ordered all flags flown at half-staff until DECEMBER 18th. You can see the pictures coming in from the white house. These are people who want gun control and they are holding a vigil outside the white house right now inside the white house. A little while ago, president obama went into the briefing room to address the american people and became very emotional. 
>> This afternoon I spoke with governor malloy and fbi director mullen. I offered governor malloy my condolences on behalf of the nation and made it clear he will have every single resource that he needs to investigate this heinous crime, care for the victims, couple their families. We have endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years and each time I learn the news, I react not as a president, bz anybody else would, as a parent. That was especially true today. I know there is not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers and men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. Our hearts are broken today. For the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well. For as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early and there no words that will ease their pain. As a country we have been through this too many times. Whether it's an elementary school in newtown or a shopping mall in oregon or temple in wisconsin or a movie theater in aurora or a street corner in chicago. These neighborhos are our neighborhoods and these children are our children. We are going to have to coming to andake meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this regardless of the politics. This evening michelle and I will do what I know every parent in america will do which is hug our children a little tighter and tell them we love them and we will remind each other how deeply we love one another. There families who cannot do that tonight. They need all of us right now. Our days to come, that community needs us to be at our best as americans and I will do everything in my power as president to help.

>>> We are continuing the breaking tragic news oust connecticut. 26 people were killed and 20 of them children when a gunman opened fire in a small elementary school. Children killed were ages 5 through 10. Kindergarten through fourth grade. How do families and children cope when a tragedy happens like the one that unfolded toda in connecticut? Lisa sylvester is here and taking a closer look at this story. It hit so powerfully. You have kids and the period has kids. We heard asigh banfield react. 
>> I have a kindergartener and you say you waive goodbye to your child and they have their backpack and you assume you will see them later. I don't think there is a parent out there who has seen this story and not impacted by wt happened today. For parents it is hard to comprehend or say the words 20 children killed. We are talking about a class of very young children. Do you make sense of it all? It's hard as an adult and a parent, but it's tougher if you are a child. If there is an image that sums up this story, it is this. Any parent out there can relate. Psychiatrist charles raisin is with the university of arizona's college of medicine. 

[00:54:34]


>> How do you wrap your mind around something like this? With a good deal of heart break with the understanding that will it take a while and there will be people that were closely impacted by this who will never wrap their minds around this. The human minds are not infinite. This is appearing to be probably the worst school catastrophy in history. There will be a huge fallout for this that will also impact the people's emotional well being and we need to gear ourselves up for the fallout. This is a horrible thing. 
>> The news is traumatic for parents and children. This happened at a school w kids are supposed to feel safe. 
>> How do you explain it to children? It depends on the age of the child, but simple forthright explanations are the best. One of the things I tell children is there some bad people in the world and sometimes bad people do terrible things. A terrible thing happened and there have been children killed. This is terrible, but you are safe and you necessary a situation now where you are not going to be harmed. >>. 
>> The american academy of pediatrics said take into account the age of the child and do not offer details that may ah larm them. Ask them what they know and answer questions. Parents can share feelings in the way they are coping and find ways to help others. 
>> Children are resilient and what matters now is how we help them understand what's happened and even I think more importantly -- here's the police chie let's listen in for the latest. 
>> We are limited as to some of the details we can give out to you for obviousreasons. First let me state that I have told you the number of deceased in the building and the hospital and the secondary crimescene. It's our policy that we have to establish positive identification of those victims. It's a time consuming process and something that will take a great deal of time. They worked closely to expedite that and get it done as efficiently as possible. As I told you, the families have been assigned a trooper or officer as a line of communication. That was done to ensure the families that they have constant communication with the investigation and they won't have on sit and watch television news or anything. They will be the first to know any of the progress that is made as the investigation continues on. As I stated earlier, the assets utilized initially were when the call came in, newtown police department respond and called for hospital. They sent out officers and the state police sent off duty and on duty troopers to respond to gain access to the building and begin that search process that i alluded to before. We had the say the police team and canine teams out here. We had trooper in air and take some of your helicopters away, quite frankly, but every possible asset came out to the scene the minute this alarm came in or this call came in. It was certainly to do everything we could to protect and property. The community has been outstanding in supporting the effort. You have taken over their park and they are showing up and offering condolences and doing everything they possible low can to support the victims. The victims's families of this horrific tragedy. The fbi crisis management team offered to respond here tomorrow to assist a crisis management and not only with the families and the family members, but with all the first responders and the police and fire and ems. All working at what I described as a horrific and difficult scene. Certainly a local mental health crisis intervention team had been on scene and have been here all of today working and assisting and helping. I wanted to make it clear that there were 18 children pronounced dead at the scene and two children transported to area hospitals and pronounced dead at the hospital. Six adults pronounced dead at the scene anbviously the shooter was also pronounced dead at t scene. I don't have much detail about the secondary scene, but there is a related scene we discovered as we were continuing the criminal investigation and specifically investigating the shooter. You probably saw and someone asked me about the bomb skad and yes, we brought all our assets in in case they were needed and we went out to search or execute search warrants or examine other scenes, we took them with us to ensure they were right there to react if it was necessary. That's about all I have as far as the details are concerned. I want to give you one more briefing and try it get back up here for more briefing. I will take a couple of brief questions, but I must tell you there certain things we cannot discuss. 

[01:00:03]


>> Do we have anyone in the hospital now that survived this? 
>> No, sir. One person was injured that suffered an injury and did survive, yes. 
>> Can you confirm the body of the male? 
>> I can't confirm. I know about the secondary scene and I didn't have time to get into detail. I will do that for 6:00. 
>> What's the shooter's identity? 
>> I will not confirm that. We have a tentative identification and working with that. We will not confirm the identity and put that out there. We will at an appropriate time. It's not appropriate to do that right now. 
>> What happened with the investigation in hoboken? 
>> It's part and parcel of what we do. We will leave no stone unturned as we electric at every facet of the investigation whether it's the shooter or the victims. We will look at everything. We certainly will go in and out of state and work with fellow law enforcement including federal agency fist we need to to answer every question to exactly what transpired here and it will be a cross that will get it done. 
>> Right now, one shooter. Yes, sir. 
>> It was k-4. Kindergarten through fourth grid. That's the school. They were all students of that school. I don't know the grade they were in. I don't know that. It was one section and two classrooms. I couldn't tell you. I didn't find that out. Your question? That's part of the process. That's why it took us a long time to get here. Any students unaccounted for, we had to ensure that we accounted for every student and that includes maybe someone that was absent for the day because of illness and didn't come to school. That was part of the process we had to go through and now we have the identification process which is even more difficult. It's sometime before we are able to give you that information. It probably won't be available until sometime tomorrow. Did we identify the weapons? Yes, we have. 

[01:02:23]


>> How many 
>> we will not discuss that at this time. 
>> You reaching the parents? 
>> We would not come up here until we have been in contact with the parents and communicating with them since they arrived here at the scene. They have been fully inform and that's why it took so long to come up here. 
>> How were the first responders dealing with this. No one can expect to walk into a school and see those mass c casualties. 
>> That's a good question. Everyone believes that it's something that first responders do and law enforcement does, but we provided counseling for the first responders because this was a very tragic horrific scene they encountered. It's not something we want to see. It's not something we see every day. That's one thing we had done and the colonel made that perfectly clear that those people are to be spoken to and receive crisis counseling as required. 
>> You have to be the face of what's happening and -- 
[inaudible]. 
>> The lieutenant can tell you. 
>> A person -- [inaudible]. 
>> Can you say your name, please? 
>> Lieutenant george cinco. Sinko. 
>> You can tell us also the ones you have. 
>> This is most definitely the worst thing we had experienced here in town. Tragic. Right now we are concerned about the families of the victims. Our officers are professional and we will deal with this as well. 

[01:04:23]


>> You can describe the scene with the parents and the place where people are getting together? 
>> The local hospital offered crisis intervention and will be available at reed intermediate school and they are available right now if need be and will be there all weekend. 
>> Is there a place where parents are gathering and can you describe that? 
>> The parents have gathered at the local firehouse which is adjacent to the school and we have done our best to comfort them and try to reassure them that we have done everything we can. As mentioned, it's a difficult process to confirm the status of an entire elementary school. We need to be right when we do that. . 
>> We have to think about the families right now and do everything we can for them. 
>> Was one of the teachers -- 
[inaudible]. 
>> We can't confirm that right now. The investigation is ongoing. 
>>> The parents still there? 
>> There parents there, yes. I don't have a number for you. I don't have a number for you. 
>> When did you realize the magnitude? How long did it take? 
>> Minutes after the officers were there they realized what a horrific scene we had. 
[Inaudible] 
>> I don't have the exact timeline on that. Officers responded immediately and as soon as they realized what they had, we asked for the resources. All right? Thank you. 

[01:06:24]


>> We just finished. We will come back around 6:00 and get back with one more briefing and a scheduled briefing probably tomorrow. Some of you folks look tire and want some rest. We will see if we can give you a schedule for tomorrow. Okay? 
>> There we have the latest coming from the state police from local law enforcement in newtown, connecticut. We want to welcome back the viewers in the united states and around the world. This is breaking news. Unimaginable horror grips the nation in one of the deadliest school shootings in u.S. History. A tragedy so wrenching it reduced the president of the united states to tears. Right now 27 people are confirmed dead in connecticut's sandy hook elementary school massacre. 20 children and six adults and th alleged shooter. All of this happening within a matter of a few hours. Watch this. The sights and sounds of this tragedy as it played out. 
>> When I was getting in my car, I heard sirens going off continuously. Car after car after car. Some of them were flying past my house and coming around again and going to the school. This house is three houses away from the school. 
>> When we first arrived, there was not a lot of security to guard. There were three children that came out. One of them had a very bleed face. 
>> He immediately jumped in the car and headed down here. It's troubling. It was mayhem in the room with the kids and the teachers and trying to identify your kid and making sure they are and finding out what the situation was and making sure everyone was safe. It started with the neighbors and the rest of their friends. 
>> What did your daughter say to you? 
>> They were immediately crying. Petrified of what happened and what did it mean and they are older than the other kids in the school so understanding what happened, my son was in the gym when it happened. I think they heard the gunshots. 

[01:08:38]


>> We saw police officers and heard them on the roof and in our building. 
>> Did you hear gunshots or anything like that? 
>> The police officers were kind of. There were police officers out the door trying to find the guy. 
>> It was shocking. I got the call at work this morning. I can't believe a small down like this would have anything like this happen. To be in an elementary school, it's unheard of. 
>> It doesn't even seem real. It does not seem like it's even possible. You read it in the newspaper or see it in the news and you are like my god, that poor family. Then you have something happen so close to home. I think I'm still in shock. 
>> Ian tell you that our hearts and prayers go out to the victims of this terrible incident. Very tragic. Our police are currently working closely with the newtown police department and mutual aide that allows us to provide assets they may not have along with the state police that have taken the lead in this investigation. 
>> It was terrifying and I'm still in shock about it all. 
>> Was everybody crying and scare and want their parents to come get them? 
>> Yeah, they were and some people were even like kind of felt like they got a stomach ache. 
>> They wouldn't let us in the building. One of the cops said it was the worst thing he had seen in his entire career. When they told the parents and they were waiting for the children to come out and they thought they were still alive. There is 20 parents that were told that their children are dead. It was awful. 
>> Awful. You can't imagine how awful it must be for the parents and loved ones and the family members in the small town of newtown, connecticut. This is a small elementary school. Grades kindergarten through fourth great. 5 through 10-year-olds. 20 of them gunned down by a killer today. Six adults killed as well. Mary snow is joining us now from outside the suspect's mother's home we believe. Is that correct? 

[01:10:50]


>> That is correct. We just left the location and we had been there several hours throughout the afternoon. The investigation stretched to that home and it's being treat said as a crime scene. We found s.W.A.T. Teams and we can tell you that the residents near that home were told to evacuate earlier today. We talked to one neighbor who said she was told around 11:00 this morning by police to get out right away. She is out of her home able to get into her house. As far as what we saw, they are being tight-lipped about that location where the investigation had continued. I can tell you that in addition s.W.A.T. Teams, we did see an ambulance at one point while we were there leaving shortly after 3:00 this afternoon. Neighbors were numb really. A number of them couldn't even talk to us. They are so filled with emotion. One neighbor did talk to us. She knew the family of the suspect and described him as trouble and didn't elaborate further than that. It is being put together with the suspect's family. In newtown, connecticut outside the suspect's mother's home. We are getting more information. Susan canned lotiy is getting more information. Walk us through what we know at this point. All of this is subject to change. The information is still coming in. Walk us through what we know and how it went down. 
>> You are absolutely right to caution about this. What we do know. I covered an awful lot of school shootings over the years and the early information always seems to change. This is what we know about the timeline of the shootings as reported by law enforcement and witnesses and the lay out of the school as best we can piece it together. Remember this is just a very rough approximatation. About 9:30 this morning, class has been under way for about a half hour. More than 600 students, the school principal and vice principal and the school psychologist and several other adults were having a meeting up here in this part of the school. They gathered near the office area at that time. Around 9:40 according to what a lot of eyewitnesss have to say is when it appeared the gunman enters the building. We don't really know how. We know that later today police were looking at a car out here parked by a fire lane. Based on what eyewitnesss said, there was a good reason to think he came through the front door into this area. We don't have a guarantee, but it sounds like that. Right away people throughout this entire building started hearing shots. Some cases they said it sounded like bangs or someone hammering. People started saying they could hear something. By 9:41 or so, calls were coming into 911. The principal and the school psychologist according to witnesses were in a meeting in this part of the building came out of that meeting and they go towards the gunfire out here in a hall way. Here or here. They go out there and the people in the room say they hear many, many more shots and a lot of shouting and the vice principal comes back in wounded. The other two do not. Authorities say the shooting appears to have happened in a relatively short period of time and the gunman does not roam around and stays right in the area here. You heard it over and over again from the officer there. Two rooms is where it all happened. Around 9:45 or so, teachers in the rest of the building from all we can hear from students and other people who have spoken about it are doing all they can to protect their students. They don't know what is going on. They were near the gym and told to hide in closets and that sort of thing. Others it appears the school went into lockdown, but they started leading students away from the school. I'm not sure of the timeline, but we know that by the time the officers showed up on the scene, you started having a situation where students were being led away by officers and teachers and everybody who could try to get them out to safety. Sometime later, we will put it at 9:50, but we don't really know because it's murky and we will get clarity overtime. It's not clear how or when the gunman dies. We know officers said no officer fired a gun that leads you to believe he shot himself. We don't really know. As officers arrive on the scene, they immediately take control of the entire building. They spread out and securing rooms and making sure they know that if they have the funman, it's 1 and there is not someone else. They are looking everywhere for the pockets of children. They know there kids hidden in the building. In all the school shootings i have seen, this is a common occurrence and the shooting begins with many teachers helping them and go into hiding. That is a very, very dangerous situation when the officers go into the building. I had officers say you have people popping out behind you who were in closets and rooms and the officers have to be professional and calm to get through that and control the situation. That's precisely what they did and at that point you have a situation where you were able to see the of officers securing the property all-around and trying to make sure they can see that the gunman was there and leading the kids out as we heard passed actual victims of the shooting. Again, all of the timeline is very, very tentative right now and we are going to get a lot more, but the bottom line is it looks like it took maybe 20 or 30 minutes at most from beginning to end from the time to shooter walked in to the time the police officers essentially had everything secured and were going through to make sure they had everything taken care of and the kids cleared out. That's a long process that is going on all day. 

[01:17:24]


>> During the few minutes, 26 people were murdered. Six adults and 20 young children. What a horrific story. Thanks very much. Let's go to the scene right now in newtown, connecticut. Susan canned lotiy is there. 
>> I learned that the mother of theected shooter who has been identified as nancy lanza was found dead. I have been told that no physical body was found in another home in hoboken, new jersey. There have been other published reports about that. Two sources do tell us that someone was taken away for questioning from that house in hoboken, new jersey and that concern is believed to be the suspect's brother in this case. In other words, the brother of the suspected dead shooter in this school shooting. The shooter has been described to me as having worn or dressed in black battle fatigues and a military vest when he came into the school and began firing away. I know according to sources that at least three weapons have been recovered. One described as a model 223 bush wacker, a military style semi automatic gun. Some of the ammo is used in afghanistan by our soldiers there. That two other guns were also found that are described as hand guns. One a glock. 
>> The bottom line is that the mother who was a teacher at that school was found dead at her home where mary snow is outside that home because originally we thought the mother was engine the classroom where the gunman opened fire. 

[01:19:25]


>> Earlier we had information that she was found in the classroom, however now I'm told that in fact her body was found at the suspect's residence here in this particular area. We don't know whether she also lived there. We don't know. We also don't know the timeline. When was she killed? Was she killed before the shooting began at the school? These are the things that authorities are still trying to piece together. Also we have conflicting information about the shooter's name. We have had the name for quite sometime and there is some question as to whether the shooter is described -- which brother's name is which. We have their ages and the names, but we are trying to sort that out. Officials have yet to officially release that yet. 
>> This kind of story, it's not unusual that conflicting information comes in and we constantly update and revise as we get more details. Initial reports prove to be inaccurate. We are getting conflicted information. We will piece it together in about 20 or 25 minutes. The connecticut state police will have another briefing and maybe we will get more detailed information at that time. Susan is on the scene and we have all of our reporters and producers there in newtown and also the investigation continuing in hoboken, new jersey. Heart breaking news coverage resumes after this. 
- 

[01:24:07]


>>> I saw some of the bullets going past the hall that I was right next to and then a teacher pulled me into her classroom. 
>> You heard sounds? 
>> Yes. 
>> What did it sound like? 
>> It sounded like someone was kicking a door. 
>> It didn't sound like gun shouts? 
>> No, it didn't. 
>> That was a young boy from the sandy hook elementary school. His parents are there when our affiliates are there and when we speak to them, we only do it with their parents's permission. We want to update them on that. So many of them came close to being killed boy a killer who went into that school. We went through point by point what happened. The teachers were over there at the school class and attendance sheets came out. It was close for so many young kids as we watched and more details. Our local affiliate watched what was going on and caught up with a mother who was thankful to the teacher who saved her son's life. 
>> I am so grateful to the teacher. 
>> She saved his life? 
>> She definitely did. She pulled him and another child into the classroom. 
>> What are could have driven a man to open fire on defenseless children? I am joined by a psychiatrist and chief medical correspondent dr. Sanjay gupta. You are a highly trained medical professional and walk through what goes through your mind when you hear the details of a mass killing like this in an elementary school. 
>> I think for most of us here in los angeles, you think about your own children. These events make you want to hug your kids a bit tighter tonight. I have three children as you know, wolf, and having covered so many of these tragedies as have you, it is common for lots of people around the country and around the world who were not involved with this to have symptoms and to really be affected by this. In many ways. Many people are going through the same thing. Your community and the people around you become a real sense of support. If people develop these symptoms and it can last for days. If they develop into nightmares or anxiety or depression, it is time to see somebody and get help. There going to be people who need that as a result of what happened. Wolf, something you talked about, we talked about together. S that this notion that we think of mental health as being vague and harder to target and predict and harder to treat. Much in the same way we think of heart disease or cancer, they can be predicted and can be treated. One of the thirst things that went through my mind is this is a reminder. 

[01:27:19]


>> Lisa is here. So many experts said after other killings along this line over the years, there these warning signs and a lot of folks and family members don't pay attention. 
>> That's not entirely fair. I will tell you why. I have been in this business for 25 years. There plenty of families who are distraught and have members of their family who are children that they know are dangerous and live with this anguish of not being able to do anything for them for weeks and months and years. The reality is we don't have the legislation thllows the officials to do what must be done until the person committed a crime and that's what when they come to the attention. It's not true that people are in denial. 
>> What are the warning signs that people should be looking to start killing kids? 
>> There plenty of families who do respond to the warning signs and will call the authorities. 
>> What are they? 
>> They will see a child is angry, isolated, clearly potentially responding to ought tori hallucinations and hear voices and maybe a fascination with guns and maybe at a shooting range. They know something is wrong. You can't call and say my son is acting weird, he needs help. They don't have justification. In most jurisdictions, it is almost impole to intervene in a way that can protect our society. The legislation has to be changed so we act before a crime. 
>> Sanjay, you study the brain all the time. Are there chemical imbalances here and chemical problems that could create a kller like this? 
>> I think so and I agree with your guest as well. These things used to be in the realm of the anecdotal and there is evidence of what we can see happening in the brain. There may be people who are more predisposed or set up for it and something pushes them over the edge. It is clear and most of these situations. I think that to think of mental illness as a disease and when you think about it like that, it changes everyone's perspective and you think about it more like you would think of someone with heart problems or cancer or diabetes. It changes perspective of how you potentially think about it and getting it diagnosed and treated. I agree with the guests. It's hard to do. We are not talking about showing up and taking a family member away, but someone being able to talk about it openly and make sure they have the resources and they can go see somebody. It's not easy and not even available for many people around the country. 

[01:30:15]


>> If no one committed a crime and there signs out there, letters and I want to go out there and kill people and they are going to practice ranges, is it usually an indication of a psychiatric problem that can be treated for example with medicine? 
>> Sure if you can get them to take it. Usually when you have a person like that, they won't acknowledge there is anything wrong. Try getting them into treatment and getting them to take th pill. They won't do it. Not everybody is out there doing this, but for those who do, it's because they have most likely refused treatment. I will bet you anything that most of the people that we are talking about and the one person we are talking about today was clearly to his family a danger and they just didn't know what to do. They didn't have the legislation and that's the problem, to back them up to take action. I will at this. A number of decades ago, we were fearful that people be into a hospital because they were different. We wanted to protect them and we enacted laws to protect people. We had gone too far in that direction. Now we have to face the reality. Ackne that we have to step up our work and getting people into treatment when they need it. Letting doctors make the decisions and not just lawyers and judges. 
>> Thanks for that expertise. Sanjay, thanks to you as well. Let's bring you up to date on what we know so far in the deadly shooting at sandy hook elementary school. We are awaiting a live press conference coming up before the top of the hour. Here's what we know. 27 people are confirmed dead. 20 children and six adults and the alleged shooter. We just learned that the mother of the suspected shooter was found dead in her son's home near the school. We also have been told by a source that nobody has been found in a house searched by authorities in hoboken, new jersey although the search continues. A law enforcement source said the gunman was dressed in what are described as black battle fatigues and a military vest. The source said the semi automatic weapon was found along with two hand guns. The connecticut governor dan malloy has been meeting with the parents of the children killed in the horrible tragedy and spoke out a little while ago. 

[01:32:42]


>> You can never be prepared for this kind of incident. What happened and what transpired at the school building will le a mark on this community and every family impacted. I only ask that all of our fellow citizens in the united states and around the world who have offered their assistance remember all of the victims in their prayers. To all of you in the media, we will do our west to keep you as informed as we can. After I'm done speaking, a representative of the state police will speak to you and give you additional information. Earlier a number of our citizens, beautiful children had their life taken away from them as well as adults whose responsibility it was to educate and supervise those children. 
>> Connecticut governor dan malloy. We are awaiting a press briefing by the state police that is supposed to happen before the top of the hour. Cnn's ashleigh banfield is in newtown, connecticut and joins us once again. Describe a little bit more of the mood of what you are feeling over there and seeing. 
>> Reporter: 
>> It seems every ten minutes there is another dozen or so reporters and trucks and gear that shows up. This is obviously an extraordinary story of national and international importance as international countries start to respond to this. It's obvious from the number of people who are coming to report it how hard hitting this has been for so many people. I want to let you know mechanics of how things are playing out. As nightfalls over the town, the firehouse has been a center for the parents and dan malloy, the governor himself who was the one who broke it to many of the parents who were still waiting there earlier this evening and had not been reunited with their children. He broke it to the parents that if you haven't been reunited by now, it's over. The problem is they can't make a positive and formal notification. As you heard the state police saying earlier, the id process is going to be an overwhelming task with that many tiny bodies and those six adults as well. 18 little bodies that have to be identified is a massive crime scene and a massive undertaking. It undoubtedly will go on throughout the night. I wanted to let you know another detail. The principal is one of the victims. She had just this fall instituted a brand-new security system at the school in which like in many schools if you want to visit the school, you have to hit a buzzer. You are seen by an electronic system and be buzzed in. Those lockdown by 9:30. Before 9:30 you can go in and out. After 9:30, it's the buzz in process. Possibly he got in before that happened and who knows since he a connection to the school according to police that it would have been an easy access anyway. A basketball coach at the school told him he had two children in the school. They are okay, but they are terrified tonight. Color from the parents who are coming out of the school and are reunited with their children. It has been difficult. Of course this reporting from our susan candiotti saying the mother of the shooter was found in her son's residence. Trying to put the pieces together, but the state police announced earlier that the shooter had targeted a person that he lived with. It was a family member he lived with. Whether or not this was the mother's residence, the kindergarten teacher who suffered at the hands of the shooter, whether it was hers or his residence or they shared the residence is unclear. That is the secondary crime scene here in connecticut that they are looking into. As far as how this night will progress for not only the families affected, but this town. There two vigils that will get under way about 7:00 tonight at two churches. We have seen signs elsewhere for smaller vigils as restaurants and businesses. Definitely two at two of the churches here in town that should get under way at 7:00 tonight. I can't even describe the mood for you. I'm sorry. It's one of the things that i think we will all know where we were when we heard the news break. 

[01:37:34]


>> We will and you live not that far away in connecticut. Give us a little sense of this newtown that maybe our viewers around the united states and the world are not familiar with this part of connecticut and this town. 
>> It is very remote. Earlier today when this was breaking, I described it as off the grid. Very remote and rural. Gently rolling hilling and thick wooded areas and large properties that are few and far between the pous hows and spread out. Definitely the kind of place you would say you could never imagine it happening here. A lot of people say that, but this is not the kind of place you would think something would happen like this. Not only that, it's remote in the sense that yes, some people who live here do commute to new york city for work, but it's a long commute. I commute an hour every day to where I live and this is a solid hour and a half. It's a longer commute, but the people who live here live here for the safety and the security and the terrific school system. This is what you hear over and over. We came here because it's the place to be save and secure and ensure our children are going to have a great upbringing. That's what we hear over and over. This is so unbelievable that this can happen in a place that is like a hell scene when you drive through. 
>> The connecticut state police will come once again and brief us on what's going on. They have been cooperative and not providing names yet. Not providing specific information because this is an ongoing investigation and only just beginning. 
>> Yeah. Just imagine the bullets that were described to us earlier today from a parent who was in a meeting with some of the school teachers and principal and the school psychologist and said it sounded as though there were at least a hundred rounds. Imagine the amount of investigation that has to go on before they can really piece together what happened here. They have to do this. Obviously with the reports that the shooter is dead, that does help in the matter in terms of not trying to amount to prosecution and collect that kind of evidence, but let me tell you, 18 little children's bodies are in that school right now. Two additional children were rushed to the hospital that died in the hospital. Adult bodies are here and the shooter himself. What might be different than investigating the columbine massacre as compared to this one, police tell us it was in a concentrated area. You saw the report showing the lay out of the school. It's essentially two rooms where most of the killings took place. It's hard to say that because i know I'm talking about an elementary school. That's what they are up against right now. Positive identification of each and every one of of the children and adults andthe grand away of the bullets and the fragments and the bullets and disaster and try to come up with a forensic story. 

[01:40:51]


>> We will stand by with the next briefing. Stand by for that as well. We are getting more information and we will take a quick break and resume our special coverage after this. the do.

>> >>> We will carry this around forever. This town will never be the same, I'm sure. What I find myself talking to other people, I can't believe i am comparing this with the worst tragedies in the united states. Columbine and the virginia shooting. 26 people gunned down by a shooter. Six adults and 20 children age 5 to 10. In the small town in connecticut. Newtown, connecticut. Rare if ever we see the president of the united states cry during an address to the nation, but we did see that today when president obama spoke to the country not just as the commander in chief, but also as a father. 
>> I know there is note a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them. Birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers. Men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today. For the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children and for the families of the adults who were lost. 

[01:46:15]


>> There is the white house right now. You can only imagine the conversation the president and the first lady are having with their two daughters right now like million of other parents are having with their children. You saw the flag half-staff at the white house. The president ordered all flags half-staff between now and december 18th in memory of those killed today in newtown, connecticut at sandy hook elementary school. Let's bring in jessica yellin. You covered this and have you ever seen the president like this before? 
>> No, wolf. I have never seen the president so emotional. He was crying not just in that clip, but throughout his comments today. Openly wiping away tears the whole time and speaking in incredy personal and emotional terms. The president unfortunately has come out and addressed the nation repeatedly after mass shootings and wolf, usually when he does, he tries to find a silver lining and talks about an heroic act by somebody who was with victims in the room or a medical miracle that happened at the hospital. A story of american resilience. Today the facts were too grim. Instead of playing consoler in chief, he led the nations in grieving and expressing our own sadness and in mourning. You can see the president almost struggle for his own composure at one point. He talked about his girls are slightly older than these kids, but you see how much it hit him on a personal level and how he talked about this sort of being a moment for everybody to put aside whatever differences we have and focus on your own lives and what you can be grateful for and help others. I would point out that he did say while this is not a time to talk policy and I will quote, we are going to have to coming to and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this regardless of the politics. We have to to wonder if that's an indirect reference to fighting for some of those assault weapons banned and reinstatement he once supported or other gun actions he once stood for and has not fought for in the first term. We will follow-up on that at another time. 

[01:48:41]


>> Any indication when the president will be going to connecticut? 
>> No. I asked at the white house and they said they don't have any travel to announce to connecticut, but you and I both know that will no doubt most likely appear on the president's schedule sometime next week. I would expect at some point he would put in calls to either families of the victims or of the survivors, but I asked about that and they have nothing to report yet. 
>> Thanks very much. A powerful moment at the white house where we saw the president of the united states repeatedly wiping away tears as he spoke about this massacre at this school in connecticut. We are standing by to hear from the connecticut state police. They are about to brief us once again on the latest information coming in. We will have live coverage after this. ] ?????? hark how the bells, sweet silver bells ?????? ?????? all seem to say throw care away ?????? ?????? from everywhere, filling the air ??????

>>> Looking at live pictures from newtown, connecticut. Getting ready to hear from the connecticut state police. They'll brief us on the latest communication coming in. Paul vance will tell us the latest as we await this briefing. I want to bring in tom fuentes, the fbi's former assistant director. Tom, thanks very much for helping us in a situation like this. I want to clarify what we earlier like other news organizations were reporting, that the suspected shooter was ryan lanza, age 24. We now believe the shooter was not ryan lanza. Ryan lanza was taken into custody, we're told, earlier in the day. That perhaps his brother was the suspected shooter, perhaps the connecticut state police, lieutenant paul vance, will clarify this. But we're getting more information on what's going on. So we do know that lanza's mother was among those killed, found dead at the -- at her home near the school. She was a teacher at this school, the sandy hook elementary school. When you heard all these details coming in and you've studied these kinds of mass killings over the years, what did you think? 
>> To be frank, wolf, as I was hearing the early reports and you had many news organizations reporting who was where, who was killed, who was the shooter. And then when the police did their briefing, they wouldn't confirm it. That told me immediately that there's a lot of false or conflicting or confusing information being put out and the police were still in the process of trying to sort out exactly what they had and exactly the identity of that shooter. So that's why oftentimes in the race to get news out first, it's not necessarily the right story. 

[01:54:12]


>> What is the role of the fbi in a mass murder like this? 
>> In a case of this, whether it's one person or a mass murder, the police are in charge. So in this case -- 
>> the local police or the state police? 
>> That's to be worked out by agreement between the city, town, county and state police but it's a local matter. It's for the connecticut authorities to determine who's in charge. If it was organized crime or if it was an act of terrorism, it would be a federal violation. As soon as they determine that the shooter is not a member of some neo-nazi militia group or something where he's a terrorist -- 
>> or a hate crime, the fbi would get involved. 
>> Or a hate crime. But as soon as it appears it's going to be a disturbed individual, then pretty much the police are going to be in charge of this. Also, from the law enforcement standpoint, it really is not critical at that point whose case it will be. It doesn't appear there's going to be a prosecution if the shooter -- the offender is dead and no other participants or co-conspirators are identified. In this case, the police, the fbi, the atf, all other agencies from the area that will be working on this will be working very closely together but it will be under the command of the local authorities. 
>> Because connecticut state police says the shooter is dead, no one shot at the shooter. We assume the shooter wound up killing himself after killing all these kung kids and killing the adults. But if others may have known about these plans, there could be criminal prosecutions of others who may have known about it. 
>> There could be. But often there's not in these cases. You may have other members of the family or friends or maybes who say, well, I knew he wasn't normal, I knew he had some problems but I didn't think he would go this far, I didn't know he had guns, didn't know he was planning the event. But that's part of what the investigation is going to be all about in the days ahead is obtaining his e-mail records and phone records to see who has he been in contact with and what did he tell them? What do others that knew him -- what do they know about his thought process leading up to the event. 

[01:56:25]


>> You've been involved in law enforcement your whole life. Anything we can learn from this and move forward to try to make sure it doesn't happen again? 
>> No. 
>> It's going to happen again? 
>> It's going to happen again. We don't change anything of the basics. We haven't made the improvements of our mental health system to take care of people who are severely disturbed. We haven't done anything to prevent the severely disturbed from obtaining the weapons that are so prevalent in our society. As long as you have disturbed people able to obtain weapons and act out with weapons -- 
>> a lot of folks will say that assault weapons are too available, too easy to get. 
>> What we say now is we can't talk about it. Everybody's in mourning. It's too soon, it's not appropriate. So later when it is appropriate, we don't care. And nothing changes. And I had a daughter at virginia tech down the hall from the first shooting, people were killed in a room ten rooms away. What's changed in the state of virginia? Not one thing. 
>> Your daughter okay? 
>> Yes. 
>> Thank god for that. Tom, thanks very much for coming in. Brian todd is bringing us some of the most emotional reaction coming in so far today. 
>> Reporter: The account of a young boy said to be delivering an attendance report to the office at sandy hook elementary school when the shooting took place is surreal. 
>> I saw the boards going past the hall that I was right next to. And then a teacher pulled me into her classroom. 
>> Reporter: He said he heard a sound like someone kicking a door. His mother, clinging to him, had words of thanks. 
>> I'm just so grateful to the teacher who saved him. 
>> You think the teacher saved his life. 
>> She definitely did. He had bullets going by him and she grabbed him and another child and pulled them into a classroom. 
>> Reporter: Brendan murray, a fourth-grader, described the chaos. 

[01:58:26]


>> I was in the gym at the time. So the teachers -- we hear lots of bangs. And we thought that it was the custodian knocking stuff down. We heard screaming. And so we went to the wall and we sat down and then the police came in. It's like, is he in here? Then he ran out. And our teacher -- somebody yelled, get to a safe place. So w went into the closet in the gym and we sat there for a little while. Then the police were knocking on the door and they're like, we're evacuating people. 
>> Reporter: Cnn is only airing sound of children whose parents gave permission. As one woman walked away from the school, she was heard crying, why, why? A policeman was heard saying, it was the worst thing he'd seen in his career. A nurse from nearby danbury hospital described the scene there as parents waited for word about their children. 
>> These parents were waiting for their children to come out. They thought that they were still alive. There's 20 parents that were just told that their children are dead. It was awful. 
>> Reporter: The father of a young girl who survived was just trying to process it all. 
>> It was shocking. 
>> Here he is, the governor of connecticut, dan malloy. 
>> We have heard from in the ensuing hours since this unspeakable and tragic event occurred here. As you know, there are a number of victims, teachers, support personnel in the building and children, beautiful, beautiful children who had simply come to school to learn and their day ended a very different way than any of us coul possibly have imagined. And quite frankly as we stand here today, still can't imagine what transpired there. Evil visited this community today. It's too early to speak of recovery. T each parent, each sibling, each member of the family has to understand that connecticut -- we're all in this together. We'll do whatever we can to overcome this event. We will get through it. But this is a terrible time for this community and for these families. Our police personnel and others are doing the utmost to clear this situation as soon as possible and to return these children to their parents or these loved ones to their fellow loved ones as quickly as possible. And we'll work with all of the residents of this community and connecticut to make sure that we do, in fact, get through this. I was mayor of stamford on 9/11 when our state lost many of its citizens and I lost a number of my fellow citizens and friends. I never thought that in a public career that I would have to face these kinds of circumstances or that they would visit themselves upon this community or the people of connecticut. We'll get through this. And our prayers at this time have to go out to the families. And so as I began by thanking those who have expressed their desires to be helpful, the number one way to be helpful is to say a prayer or send a best wish or to be thinking of these individuals who have suffered so mightily today. Thank you. 

[02:02:58]


>> That's the governor of connecticut, dan malloy. I think we're going to be hearing from lieutenant paul vance as well from the connecticut state police. If he comes to those microphones, of course, we're anxious to hear what he says. It looks like he's not speaking over there. But we will continue to monitor what's going on. A horrific, horrific day in connecticut as we're watching this story unfold. The breaking news continuing to explode not only here in the united states but around the world. We want to welcome our viewers from around the world. The state police lieutenant, paul vance, he tells me authorities are interviewing everyone who possibly had any connection to the suspected gunman. Kate bolduan is here helping us with our coverage as well. This is a story that continues to resonate for parents, grandparents, loved ones, everyone, those kids, and a situation like this unfolds, it's hard to believe. 
>> Everyone has been affected by this and will continue to be affected by this. The governor, I think, said it well and very simply put that evil has visited that town today. I think that's absolutely at least one thing that we can all be sure of that has happened. The investigation is unfolding. The grieving, though, is only beginning. A church vigil, many are under way and due to start soon in newtown where this tragedy has unfolded. Let's bring in our jason carroll, who is on the ground there. Jason, are you at the site of the vigil? 
>> Reporter: That's correct. That vigil set to take place just about 7:00 here at st. Rose lima church. I spoke to the dee can here earlier. It was an emotional discussion. He told me throughout the day, at least 100 people have come through the doors at the church here tryin find peace, looking for answers, trying to find some sort of comfort. So he has been doing that throughout the day. And this is personal to him. It's personal to this community. He told me that a number of the victims went to church here. This is where these children had their first communion. This is where they sat in the pews with their parents and listened to certainliens. He knew some of the victims and he talked about that just a little earlier. Take a listen. 

[02:05:18]


>> This is a very tight-knit community, it's a largand dynamic parish. Everybody knows everybody here. I don't know for sure, but I'm sure that quite a few of the kids that we lost today are in this parish. 
>> Reporter: And I can also tell you th in terms of what people are asking is there are lots of questions. They're asking questions, why? Why did something like this happen? And he said because of the newness of it all, there's no way to try to answer that with something profound. But he did say this, he said, quote, there are some questions that are only meant for god to answer. And he said, that is what he's telling people. Listen to a little bit more in terms of what he had to say about that. 
>> I heard one of the victims -- I'm not sure about it. But I heard that one of the victims -- recently she -- i think it was birthday money. She got her birthday money. She donated it to the parish to give to the hurricane sandy victims. 6 years old. So that's -- that makes it very, very personal and very intimate. 
>> Reporter: And that was when he was telling me about a 6-year-old girl, one of the victims, he says, who went to this church. He used to look at this girl every sunday. So you can imagine how painful it is for him, how painful it is for this community. Once again, the vigil is expected to take place here at just about 7:00. When I asked what will be happening, he said, this is unlike any vigil obviously they've ever had in the past. And a lot of it's going be off the cuff. There will be a mass. Expected to last for about an hour. He said all we can continue to do throughout the night, throughout the coming days and the m cooing weeks is be there and try to provide comfort to these grieving families. 

[02:07:23]


>> Jason, it seems the dee can himself is struggling for words and how to cope with this. Has he at all been contacted by any of the families, anyone from the school? It seems it is a very small community there. 
>> Reporter: He has. He has been in contact with the families. Some of the other priests here have been down at the firehouse consoling the families throughout the day. And he has children himself. So this is personal for him. They did not go to this elementary school but to another one. But he knew these children. He knew the faculty at the school. The faculty sat in these pews as well. And so not only does he have to provide comfort to some of the victims, the victims' families, but he also has to try and find understanding himself because in his words, he's got to be their rock. He's got to be the person here providing the support, which is difficult for him. He said what he's going to do is take a little bit of a break, go home, hug his own daughter, give thanks and come back and provide the support that is so badly needed here. 
>> Being that rock, much easier said than done at a time like this when such unspeakable tragedy has hit such a small community. Jason carroll live outside where a vigil will be starting in just about an hour from now. Jason carroll, thanks so much. 
>> What a powerful, powerful report. Let me just remind our viewers what's going on. For those who may just be tuning in, around 9:30, 9:40 a.M. This morning, a man went into a small elementary school in newtown, connecticut, and began killing people. 26 people all together. Six adults and 20 children. This is a small elementary school. The sandy hook elementary school. Fewer than 600 children in that school. Only grades kindergarten through fourth grade inside. We have no idea the motive, what was behind what was going on. 26 people were killed and then the shooter, we believe, killed himself. Separately, the mother of the shooter, we believe, was killed separately at a home not far away from this school. You're looking at live pictures coming in from newtown, connecticut, right now. The police are continuing their investigation. And I suspect the connecticut state police will be briefing us fairly soon. These are pictures coming in from the sandy hook elementary school. Susan candiotti is on the scene for us as she's been now for several hours. Update our viewers. What's the latest, susan? 

[02:09:50]


>> Reporter: The latest is that in addition to trying to piece all of this together to find out the motive, more about the shooter, we also understand that for a few hours now, police took into custody or at least took someone in for questioning someone who's been identified to us by sources as a brother of the dead shooter here involved in this school incident, the sxool shooting. And they're asking him questions about his brother. He is not being called a suspect at this time. But they do want to try to find out at the very minimum what information he may have about the dead gunman here at the school. Also trying to find out more about the mother of the shooter who you know has been identified as a schoolteacher and she was found dead, we are told by sources, at a residence nearby the school here. So all of these pieces and parts of the puzzle being worked out at this moment by investigators to try and find out exactly what led into this and what the time line was as well, wolf. For example, was the mother shot before all of this began? We don't know. Wolf? 
>> We can only imagine if the shooter, though, susan, was found dead at the scene, no one shot him, we assume the shooter committed suicide. And all that took place between 9:30 and 10:00 a.M. Or so, approximately 20 minutes or half an hour. The assumption I have is that the shooter presumably killed his mother at the home before driving over to the school. 
>> Reporter: That seems to be, of course, a fair assumption here. But no one officially is saying that. In fact, they haven't even officially released the name of the gunman in this case. We do know from sources they recovered the at least three weapons from the scene. Two of them handguns, including a glock and a sig sauer. And another one, a semiautomatic weapon identified as a .223 bushmaster. We don't know how many bullets were fired. A number of witnesses say there were a lot of bullets that were heard. We also do not know -- trying to find out, for example, how much ammunition the shooter came to the school with and did he have any extra magazines with him, gun magazines, ammo? Those are the kinds of things we're also trying to find out, wolf. 

[02:12:20]


>> We'll be getting more information in the hours to come, susan, thanks very much. Tom foremais joining us now. He's been looking at the layout of this l skoo. What are you seeing, tom? 
>> Susan was raising a good point as you have. Piecing all this together is grim and difficult, difficult work because there are so many movi parts to this equation. That's what the investigators are trying to do right now. In more than 30 years of covering massacres and school shootings, I've seen this happen many times. The early hours, it's hard to know exactly what the time line was, exactly how things unfolded. We're piecing it together as best we can as well. So take this time line as being a bit loose but we'll work our way through it. About 9:30 this morning in this school, classes were under way here. They had a good crowd in there, about 600 students in the school, 50 faculty members. And at that time, a meeting had just broken out up in the beginning of the school here. A small meeting with the principal, vice principal, the school psychologist and a few adults up here in a room near the office. School started at 9:05. At 9:30, half an hour under way, they'd be going up there. At 9:40-ish, best we can tell, it's different depending on whom you talk to, somewhere around 9:40 is when it would appear that this gunman enters the building. How? We don't really know. Police have spent a lot of time today -- keep see pg pictures of a black car. They've been looking at that car right here. If that is connected to the crime as we think and based on what the eyewitnesses have said, that would suggest the gunman came in through the front door here. This little red part here is a covered walkway. He would have come in here. And everything transpired in this area. As soon as he came in, from all we hear from various people there, people throughout this entire building started hearing shots being fired. Some of them thought it sounded like hammering. Some of them heard loud bangs. Some of them also knew what it was. By 9:41, we had calls going in to 911. The principal, vice principal and school psychologist who were in that meeting came out and went toward the gunfire, according to a witness. They headed toward it but only the vice principal returned and the vice principal was wounded in the leg or the foot. It's not clear which. Nonetheless, at this point, everything is clearly getting very tense because people know something is going on that's very bad there. Now, the time line gets even looser at this point because we don't know how the progress of the gunfire went. We know that the people who were in this meeting and witnesses up here said they heard a tremendous number of shots. We know they heard yelling and screaming. Authorities say the actual shooting happened over a relatively short period of time for all the shots that apparently were fired. And the gunman did not roam around. But, again, generally from all accounts, stayed right in this area in two rooms in terms of where all the shooting happened. And in fact, he was found in one of those rooms. Now, at the same time that all this is happening -- again, bear in mind, this is a very loose time line we're talking about here. The teachers are trying to protect students all over this school. In some cases, they seem to be trying to get some of them out. In many other cases, they're trying to hide them within the school. They're locking the doors, going into lockdown as people described it and say they have to stay there and be safe. That's not really clear because some of the students are talking about being evacuated and it's not clear if a teacher tried to lead them out or as, in this case, law officers were leading them out which happened a little bit later. The bottom line is, though, as this progresses, the gunfire seems to have stopped. At some point law officers arrived on the scene from both the local police and the state police, local police said fo the state police, we know we have a serious issue here. Is not clear when in this process the gunman dies somewhere up in here. We know from lawmen that none of the officers fired a shot during this time. As you suggested a moment ago, wolf, that would suggest that somehow he shot himself at that point. But we do know that when these officers arrive at the school, they quickly sealed the entire school off and they spread into the school rapidly, locking down everything. Making sure there's no other gunman. And frankly looking for those children who are hiding in there. And I know from past school shootings, this can be a very, very dangerous time simply because these officers are possibly looking for a gunman but they're suddenly walking past closets very opening and people are coming out and they walk past doorbayways and people emerge behind them. It's a very dangerous, tense time when officers have to be very professional and disciplined and make sure something awful beyond the horrid event that's already happened does not occur. Bottom line, those officers went in, they secured the school, they started clearing the kids out of the school. And when all is said and done, this whole event probably took 20 to 25 minutes, maybe 30, wolf, from a normal morning at school to this tremendously awful event that will be around a long time. And now comes to long, complicated work of figuring out exactly how those events unfolded and when. 

[02:17:49]


>> Can only imagine the horror that the parents, the kids, they felt as this was unfolding. Tom, thanks very much for that update on what we know right now. Mary snow is in newt for us as well. I understand you just spoke with a mother and a child who was in the school during the shooting? 
>> Reporter: Yes. We're outside a church where people have been coming to come and just say some prayers. A mother took her 9-year-old boy -- he heard gunshots. He heard yelling and then at one point his teachers told the children to hold hands and to run as fast as they could and to not look into the principal's office as they passed. And he said he did. They ran out of the school. And then they were taken to a firehouse. And that is where parents were reunited with their children. Obviously talking to him and his mother, just so stunned. And they've come here just for a short time for some peace. And people have been filing in. There is going to be a vigil here later tonight. And others are coming out talking about stories that they have heard of teachers really trying to protect these children. 
>> Mary, you were outside the sut's house, I guess, where the mother was found dead inside. Describe what you saw there. 
>> Reporter: Police were on the scene for several hours and it was blocked off. From where we were standing, i was told by some of the residents that the house was about a quarter of a mile in the road. So we couldn't get that close to the house. But there were more than a dozen law enforcement vehics. By the time we got there, the road was blocked off. We saw s.W.A.T. Teams at the scene. And then in the 3:00 hour, we did see an ambulance leave that house. But residents were evacuated. One woman I talked to said police came to her door at around 11:00 in the morning and told her she needed to leave right away. She was escorted back for a short time later in the afternoon but buzz then told again to get out. And as far as I know, is still out of that home. 

[02:20:22]


>> Mary, we'll stay in close touch with you. Obviously you're collecting more information as this story unfolds. 
>> As mary was recounting her conversation with one student and their mother as this all unfolded early this morning, let's take a listen to another student and her parent as they open up about what happened. 
>> We saw police officers and we heard them on the roof and in our building. 
>> I was pretty shaken up, didn't know who or what happened. I knew there were shooters in the building or a shooter. Just worried about who else was left in the building at this time. 
>> It doesn't even seem real. It just does not seem like it's even possible. You read it in the paper, see it in the news. You're like, oh, my god, that poor family. And then you have something happen so close to home, it's like, I think I'm still in shock, to be honest with you. 
>> The police were knocking on the door and they're like, we're evacuating people, we're evacuating people. So we ran out. There was police about at every door. They were leading us down this way, down this way, quick, quick, come on. And we ran down to the firehouse. There was a man pinned down to the ground with handcuffs on. And we thought that was -- we didn't get a good gla at him because there was a car blocking it. Plus we were rng really quick. 
>> It may not seem real but you can be sure the reality of this tragedy is setting in for so many families this evening. Cnn will be providing updates on ways you can help the victims of this tragedy and their families. Go to cnn.Com/impact for the latest information on that. We'll be right back. to and...

Xarelto???? is the first and only once-a-day prescription blood thinner for tients with afib not caused by a heart valve problem, that doesn't require routine blood monitoring. Like warfarin, xarelto???? is proven effective to reduce the risk of an afib-related stroke. There is limited data on how these drugs compare when warfarin is well managed.

Stopping may increase your risk of having a stroke. Get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of bleeding, like unusual bruising or tingling. You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take xao???? with aspirin products, nsaids or blood thinners. Talk to your doctor before taking xarelto???? if you currently have abnormal bleeding. Xarelto???? can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. You are likely to bruise more easily on xarelto????, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop. Tell your doctors you are taking xarelto???? before any planned medical or dental procedures. Before starting xarelto????, tell your doctor about any conditions, such as kidney, liver or bleeding problems. Ready to change your routine? Ask your doctor about once-a-day xarelto????.

>>> We just told a little boy about his sister now. He said, I have nobody to play with now. Excuse me. 
>> So many people have been moved, understandably so. I don't know how people can cope right now. 
>> Words cannot express. You can just see the sorrow on everyone's face. You can see the pain even in the president's words today. This is just a moment when it is difficult to wrap your mind around how this could happen. 
>> The president of the united states has to hold back tears and starts crying speaking to the american people. 
>> It is a national tragedy. 
>> I spoke just a little while ago with a man whose 8-year-old daughter attends the sandy hook elementary zool. Tell us where you were and what was going on, your connection to the school. 
>> My daughter's a third-grader. And she was there actually in her reading class. They heard bangs. And thank god for mrs. Summers. Her reading teacher grabbed my daughter and brought her into a bathroom and locked the door. Along with another teacher. And in a short time, some police somehow was able to get them out of there and escort them through the hallway. Unfortunately it was a pretty messy scene for my daughter. 
>> Earlier in the day, I spoke with your wife, lisa. She says your daughter seems to be okay. You also have a 10-year-old son. How are the kids doing now is? 
>> I don't know if my daughter is in shock or what. She's doing incredibly well. My son is doing great, too. But there are a lot of fears that this kind of thing -- everything -- the game's changed from this point onward. 
>> What does that mean when you say the game has changed -- 
>> I mean, my kids are already asking when's this going to happen again? It was only a week ago that we were talking about this type of situation and I said, the chances of it happening are one in a zillion at sandy hook. And I was wrong about that. 

[02:27:40]


>> We know, declan, you knew the principal well. She was killed in this mass murder today. Tell us a little bit about her. 
>> She just -- she was just so nind she loved her job. And she actually on a couple of occasions went out of her way just to help us with certain things that we were working on with our daughter. This is all so surreal. So please forgive me if I'm a little cloudy right now. 
>> No, believe me, we appreciate what you're going through. We can't even imagine what you're going through. John king is with us as well. He's got a question. 
>> Sir, sadly in any community when tragedy like this happens, there are always questions about the notification system. How did you first learn? How specific was that information and obviously the officials at the school were dealing with a tragedy on the scene? But do you thinkt part of it was handled appropriately? 
>> I think it's the best they could do. I don't know how you really prepare for something this crazy. My wife called me. I work down in new york and my wife called me and told me there had been a shooting and so i rushed home. My wife was already in town and she ran there. But so far, the newtown school system has been great in leaving tomatic phone updates with all the parents. 
>> Sad story. Quick question before I let you go, declan. At some point you're going to have to make a decision about letting your kids go back to the sandy hook elementary school. What are you going to do? 
>> Well, I mean, this is all so new. I've been talking to my kids and explaining, look, this is what happened. You do your best to communicate with them and you do your best to -- it's funny, a bomb hit, there's a lot of smoke and it's still here. I haven't had my -- enough time to really plan. But hopefully by the time they do go back to school, I'll have done a good enough job of talking to my kids and making them feel at least the most comfortable they could. 

[02:29:50]


>> How's your wife, lisa, doing? 
>> Well, she's hanging in there. 
>> Please give all of them our love, our symphy, our support. And we wish them only the best, declan. A parent of two kids from that sandy hook elementary school. We're following the breaking news here in "the situation room." One of the worst school shootings in american history, even more horrific because the carnage was at an elementary school. Here's what we know right now. Police say a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at the sandy hook elementary school in the small connecticut town of newtown. These were young kids, including kindergarteners. Terrified children were led out of the school after the shooting this morning holding onto one another. Parents rushed to the scene to find out if their children were dead or alive. 
>> These parents were waiting for their children to come out. They thought that they were still alive. There's 20 parents that were just told that their children are dead. It was awful. 
>> Police have not identified the gunman but they say he did die at the scene, apparently killing himself. We are told the mother of the suspected shooter has been found dead at her son's home in newtown. An emotional president obama wiped away tears as he offered support and prayers for the families of the victims of the school tragedy. 
>> This afternoon, I spoke with governor malloy and fbi director mueller. I offered governor malloy my condolences on behalf of the nation and made it clear he will have every single resource that he needs to investigate this heinous crime, care for the victims, counsel their families. We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. And each time I learn the news, I react not as a president but as anybody else would, as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there's not a parent in america who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do. The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken thousand dollar for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well. For as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early and there are no words that will ease their pain. As a country, we have been through this too many times, whether it's an elementary school in newtown or a shopping mall in oregon or a temple in wisconsin or a movie theater in aurora or a street corner in chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. This evening, michelle and i will do what I know every parent in america will do, which is hug our children a little tighter and we'll tell them that we love them and we'll remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in connecticut who cannot do that tonight. And they need all of us right now in the hard days to come. That community needs us to be at our best as americans and I will everything in my power as president to help. Because while nothing can fill the space of a lost child or loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need to remind them that we are there for them, that we are praying for them, that the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories but also in ours. May god bless the memory of the victims and in the words of sp rishgsczer, heal the broken hearted and bind up their wounds. 

[02:35:19]


>> You see a live picture of the white house flag flying at half staff. It's not often if ever you see a president of the united states break down like that. 
>> Absolutely not. He's known to be very stoic even going as far as saying he can come off as standoffish. But not the case today. He said, our hearts are broken today. I think everyone watching how this is unfolded throughout the day -- all asking the same question, how did this happen, why did this happen? And everyone's searching for if there are any kind of words that could be said to try to help these families begin to heal. We all know that thog can fill that void right now. 
>> He break down the first time when he said these kids were 5 years old to 10 years old and he spoke as a parent. He's got two girls he sends to school every day. You assume they're safe and secure and they're going to come home every day. Andhat happens like this? All of a sudden, boom, it's such a shock. Dr. Drew pinsky is joining us for a little analysis. Dr. Drew, you see the president breaking down. People are breaking down all over the country right now just listening to the president. 
>> Wolf, that's absolutely right. One of the most important things he did there was to show us, reflect for us feelings that we are all feeling. I don't know about you, every five minutes, I'm sort of taken over by a wave of a different feeling. I've gone from heartbreak like he mentioned. Then I go to anger and rage and disgust. Ten minutes ago, I was feeling numb and fatigued and depleted. Now I'm back to disgusted again. I've completely, completely disgusted that we are here having this conversation about yet again another unbelievably senseless act. There is no reason for this. But I will tell you this. One of the things the president did say is that we need to say our prayers for the families that have lost someone in connecticut which categorically we do. But I'll tell you what, each and every one of us have to pay attention to our children in our families tonight because every family in america is affected by this event. That amazing interview you played a few moments ago from declan, the father of a young one at the school, his children were asking him, daddy, when is this going to happen again? That's the world we live in, wolf, where some people are being pushed in front of subways. People are not safe in the mall. They're not safe in their elementary school. When is this going to happen again? It's incumbent upon us, our households, our communities, to make sure now it never happens again. 

[02:38:09]


>> Dr. Drew, how do you begin -- what is your advice to parents as they're watching this? Kids are very perceptive and can pick up signals from their parents and can see all this unfolding on the television if they're watching it. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> What is your advice to parents and how they begin to explain this to children? Because it's impossible for even us as adults to try to begin to wrap our minds around something like this. 
>> That's right. It's important to help them to try top identity their feelings, to reflect back to them, that it's appropriate to be scared, that it's reasonable to be confused, that this is senseless. But it's really our job to lead our families out of this and make them feel secure. Think about our family systems in this country today. Not every child feels secure and safe in their family. And it is incumbent upon the big people to take care of the little people so that horrible things like this don't happen when they grow up. So really it's double down, make your kids feel safe. Allow them to express their feelings but let them know that you will be sure that they grow up and flourish because that is your job. 
>> And one quick final question, dr. Drew, a little child sees mommy or daddy crying right now. They say, mommy, daddy, why are you crying? What do you say? 
>> You say, it's good. I'm having feelings about these poor people that have lost something. I'm having a feeling. Don't worry. It's not because of you. Children will feel that everything that happens in hair life is because of them and everything that has happened in the world is going to happen to them. So they feel vulnerable because other kids have been hurt and they're going to feel out of control when they see you be emotional. But just express it. I think the president did a wonderful job today of really modeling that sort of behavior for each and every one of us. But it's also important for us to hear from our leaders that it's going to be okay. The governor of connecticut said connecticut will get through. Those are more the reassuring words that we all have to hear so we can each individual lead our communities, lead our households. 

[02:40:12]


>> Dr. Drew pinsky from our sister network, hln. Dr. Drew, thanks very much. Powerful, very important words. Let's take another quick break, resume our special coverage of this horrific tragedy in connecticut right after this. understands come back from rough economic times.

>>> Susan candiotti is on the scene for us in newtown, connecticut. Susan, I understand you're getting new information about the shooter. 
>> Reporter: That's right. And contrary to conflicting information that investigators themselves had earlier and had passed on, we can now tell you according to several sources that the name of the shooter in this case is adam lanza. He is 20 years old and his brother's name is ryan lanza. It is adam lanza, 20 years old, who is the shooter. His brother, ryan, is t one that was taken away for questioning by authorities in hoboken, new jersey, and is expected that he will be released. He is not considered a suspect. We don't know when he will be released. We also have this additional information that the father of the shooter. There is no indication that the er is a suspect in this case. He is divorced from nancy lanza, identified as a victim in this case. He remarried and lives in the same area where this shooting occurred. So that is the new information that we have about now. We have the name of the shooter as adam lanza, 20 years old. His older brother, ryan, 24 years old, is the one who was questioned in hoboken, new jersey. He is expected to be released. We don't know when. The father of both of them also questioned for information about the shooter in this case, his son. But there is no indication that the father is considered a suspect in any way. Wolf? 
>> Just to recap, the video that we saw of somebody being taken away, this is ryan lanza, there it is, courtesy of our affiliate wcbs in new york. That is line lanza. I believe he's 24 years old. He's the older brother of the man now suspected of being the shooter, adam lanza who's 20 years old. There you see the police officer taking ryan lanza away. Their mother, nancy lanza, was found dead in the house in newtown. That's right, susan? 

[02:45:42]


>> Reporter: That's right. That is correct. She was found dead at that residence here in newtown. And we are still waiting for all of these names to be officially released by authorities. They haven't done so yet. But we've been able to confirm this through several law enforcement sources. 
>> And the parents are divorced and so the father lives elsewhere. And there's no indication he had any knowledge of anything along these lines, is that right? 
>> Reporter: There's no indication of that at all, no indication of that at all, wolf. 
>> Susan, thanks for clarifying that. I suspect those microphones behind you will be used fairly soon, the connecticut state police, local law enforcement, i assume, will be coming to brief the news media on specific information. But there you have it, kate. The latest information from susan candiotti. 
>> Doing great reporting for us. Let's go to producer adam reese. He's on the ground in hoboken, new jersey. He's on the phone with us. Adam, we were just seeing video from our affiliate, wcbs of the suspected shooter's brother. We're looking at it again here. This is the brother of the suspected shooter, this man's name that you're seeing in this video is ryan lanza, we are told. And the shooter, as susan candiotti, is learning from sources, is adam lanza. What more are you learning on the ground in hoboken this 
EVENING? >> Reporter: Well, the police here have just opened up the streets outside his apartment, 1313 grand, the name of the building is called the metropolitan. The police have just dropped the police tape, opened up the streets there are still several offices and an fbi agent in front of the building making sure only residents go into the building. As you just reported, the shooter's brother, ryan lanza was taken from this apartment building earlier today in handcuffs. He looked a little bit dazed based on the video we saw. The building is a five-story building, one, two and three-bedroom apartments. It's a residential neighborhood. Hoboken is a growing community of professionals. It's right on the water facing manhattan. In addition to ryan lanza, two roommates were taken into custody. They were taken in for questioning but they are not believed to be associated with the shooting, at least according to the police chief who briefed the media here earlier today. So there's still plenty of media. But I can say this scene here has died down quite a bit. 

[02:48:16]


>> Adam, you said the authorities seem to be opening up the street near this apartment building where ryan lanza lives. We must take that as an indication that they don't think there's any more investigation that needs to occur there which works with the reporting from susan candiotti that her sources say that she believes that ryan lanza will be released from police custody at some point, she just doesn't know when. 
>> Reporter: That's my understanding as well. That he will be released at some point, that he is being questioned and apparently we a told he is being cooperative. And we are waiting for his return here at the apartment building. 
>> Adam, many threads to follow in this still-developing story and this tragedy as we're watching. Thank you so much. 
>> Joe johns is here, our crime and justice correspondent. You're getting more information on the weapon or weapons that were used today? 
>> Right. We're talking about three different guns here, a glock, a sig sauer and a bushmaster .223. That was the kind of weapon that was used in the beltway sniper shootings years and years ago. An assault weapon. It turns out, according to law enforcement sources, who have talked to our carol kraddy, that all three of these weapons were registered to the mother of the shooter. 
>> Nancy lanza. 
>> Nancy lanza. That's right. We don't know anything more about that. We do know that the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms does lots and lots of tracing of these weapons whenever you have a situation like this. They believe that they're going to go through all their traps. But bottom line is, these weapons were apparently purchased legally by nancy lanza, not by the shooter, adam adam lanza. And that apparently is the end of the investigation. 
>> Adam lanza is dead, apparently took his own life, the 20-year-old shooter. Nancy lanza is dead, she was killed at presumably at the house in newtown, connecticut. This information, carol, I'm getting information from her as well, these are records that come in from the connecticut firearms registration system which is a pretty sophisticated gun control operation in connecticut. 

[02:50:33]


>> Yeah, it's a complicated trace that the atf has to go through. They have to go to the manufacturer, then they have to go to the first distributor, then they have to go to the first purchaser. And if there's another purchaser, then they have to follow the chain all the way through. That's the way the law works. But a lot of times in these big cases, they're able to look at the situation, find out who owned the guns, who purchased the guns, very quickly. Apparently the authorities have been able to run those traps. 
>> Which she's also suggesting, the glock and the sig sauer handguns were found inside the school. 
>> Right. And the bushmaster outside. 
>> Found in the car. Obviously that was not used. 
>> That's right. 
>> At least not in killing these kids, the teachers, the principal. 
>> Absolutely. The question is, at least one of the many questions we've been asking the authorities and haven't been able to get to yet, is whether the magazines on those weapons were -- the large, extended magazines or whether they were the magazines that typically come with the firearms. That will be interesting. Because that's all part of the gun control debate, whether those magazines are appropriate for people to have just on the streets. 
>> We saw the pictures of those guns. Obviously they killed a lot of people. 
>> Now I think -- let's take you to some live pictures I believe that we have. It's st. St. Rose of lima roman catholic church. This is where we're speaking to a couple of our correspondents. This is where a vigil will be taking place starting any minute now. This is in wtown, connecticut. According to correspondents on the ground this has been a site where many people in the community have come to just seek some quiet, seek some solace, and jason carroll roll, our correspondent who's been on the ground, spoke with the deacon there earlier today and even the deacon found it very hard to find -- he was even lost for words, trying to figure out how to provide the kind of support and love to the many parishioners who will be coming there obviously for this vig jit. I think we see cars streaming in, it could be starting any minute now, you know we'll have much more live coverage of that as we'll be watching this unfold. 

[02:52:42]


>> What can you say, a story like this. 
>> Nothing you can say. 
>> It's obviously a horrific, horrific tragedy. All of us, everyone in the country, everyone in the world might be watching right now, can relate. You send a kid to school, somebody in kindergarten, a first grade, second grade, third grade. Joe, you're here. Just so sad to think about it. Let's take a quick break, resume our coverage right after this. you shipping store. Look this isn't my first christmas. These deals all seem great at the time... But later...

>>> These are live pictures of the st. Rose of lima roman catholic church in newtown, connecticut. A vigil is about to begin right there. Just a few moments ago we did get some reaction from someone who knew adam lanza, the suspected shooter in this case, the 20-year-old who went into that school and opened fire. 
>> Just a kid. 
>> Reporter: Just a kid? Never anti-social? 
>> No. Adam's got a -- no. 
>> Reporter: Troublemaker? 
>> No, definitely not. 
>> Reporter: Noticeable? Did he just kind of blend into the background? 
>> Yeah. Nothing -- nothing that would warrant any of this. 
>> Reporter: They're saying he went after his mom and her class of kids. Can you wrap your head around that? 
>> No, I cannot. I don't know who would do anything like this. 
>> Reporter: So your general sense is what? 
>> This is -- this is unspeakable. I first heard about it -- I'm still in shock. Just give me a moment, I want to go. I've got to go. 
>> Very difficult time for so many people. 
>> Yeah. That's some classmate of adam lanza, the 20-year-old shooter in this case, speaking out, saying he's just an average kid. 
>> Average kid. We've heard that so many times. 
>> We always hear that. 
>> You always hear that, every time. 
>> Shocked by what's going on. 
>>> The president, the first lady, and many people all across the country may be having some heartfelt and difficult conversations with their kids tonight. You can be sure of that in the wake of the horrific connecticut school massacre. Lease sa sylvester has more on this. 

[02:57:28]


>> Reporter: If there's an image that sums up this story, it is this. Any parent out there can relate. Psychiatrist charles raisen is in the university of arizona college of medicine. 
>> How do you wrap your mind around something like this? With a good deal of heartbreak and with the understanding that it's going to take awhile. And that there will be people that were closely impacted by this who will never wrap their minds around this. You know, human minds are not infinite. You know, this is now appearing to be probably the worst schoolyard catastrophe in history. There's going to be a huge, long-term fallout for this that is also going to impact people's emotional well-being. And we need to gear ourselves up for that fallout because it's coming because this is a horrible thing. 
>> Reporter: The news out of newtown is traumatic for parents and children. This happened at a school where kids are supposed to feel safe. 
>> How do you explain to the children? Again, it depends on the age of the child, but I think simple, forthright explanations are the best. And I think one of the things that I tell children is, there are some bad people in the world. And sometimes bad people do really terrible things. And a terrible thing has happened and there have been some children killed. And this is terrible. But you're safe. And, you know -- you're safe, and you're in a situation now where you're not going to be harmed. 
>> Reporter: The american academy of pediatrics offers this advice. Take into account the age of the child and provide basic information without offering details that may only alarm them. Ask your children what they already know and answer questions. Parents can share their own feelings in the ways they're coping and find meaningful ways to help others. 
>> Children are resilient and what really matters now is how we help them understand what's happened but even I think more important is the sense of protection and safety that we give them starting this moment and for the next weeks and months. 
>> Reporter: For those who witnessed, those children who saw, those who covered their eyes and ears to shut out the horror, they need me, love, and prayers. You know, president obama said it. Parents are going to go home, they're going to hug their children, and even just to process this as a nation, that is going to take some time. 

[02:59:46]


>> I think all of us are trying to deal with this. You can imagine, if you're one of those parents, 20 kids killed. 
>> There is not a parent out there that -- people, it's no a

=======================================================

Gwen: Shock and tears from a small town in connecticut to the white house, tonight on "washington week." Another mass shooting. A visibly shaken president. 
>> The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. 
Gwen: What will this mean for the all-too-familiar debate about guns and violence. In washington, the woman who will not be secretary of state. 
>> I withdrew my name because i think it's the right thing for the country, and I think it's the right thing for the president. 
Gwen: How politics derailed u.N. Ambassador susan rice, even as at least one critical foreign policy matter heats up, syria. 
>> I think the regime in damascus is approaching collapse. 
Gwen: On the domestic front, the slow march towards the fiscal cliff continues. 
>> I'm pretty confident that republicans would not hold middle class taxes hostage. 
>> It's clear the president is just not serious about cutting spending. 
>> Covering the week, reid wilson of "the hotline," david sanger of "the new york times," martha raddatz of abc news, and john dickerson of "slate" magazine and cbs news. 
>> Award-winning reporting and analysis, covering history as it happens. Live from our nation's capital, this is "washington week" with gwen ifill, produced in association with "national journal." Corporate funding for "washington week" is provided by 

[00:02:13]


-- 
>> we know why we're here. To chart a greener path in the air and in our factory. 
>> To find cleaner, more efficient ways to power flight. 
>> And harness our technology for new energy solutions. 
>> Around the globe, the people of boeing are working together to build a better tomorrow. 
>> That's why we're here. 
>> This rock has never stood still. Since 1875 we've been there for our client through good times and bad. When their needs changed, we were there to meet them. Through the years from insurance to investment management, from real estate to retirement solutions, we developed new ideas for the financial challenges ahead. This rock has never stood still. And that's one thing that will never change. Prudential. 
>> Additional corporate funding is provided by -- norfolk southern. Additional funding is provided by the annenberg foundation. The corporation for public broadcasting and by contributions to your pbs stations for viewers like you. Thank you. Once again, live from washington, moderator gwen ifill. 
Gwen: Good evening. If it seems like we have been here before, it's because we have. But this time the fatalities included 2ementary school-aged children and 7 additional adults, including the shooter. Shocking violence, innocent victims, expressions of outrage and from the president today, a promise to act. 
>> As a country we have been through this too many times, whether it's an elementary school in newtown or a shopping mall in oregon or temple in wisconsin or a movie theater in aurora or a street corner in chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. 

[00:04:32]


Gwen: But what if anything can or will government do about it? The newtown shootings provide more fodder for a debate that interestingly enough we didn't even have in the 2012 presidential election. Any sign so far anything will be different, reid? 
>> I think there were. I think the signs were those two words president obama used, meaningful action. We haven't heard him talk about actually doing something about gun violence, about gun control in his first four years. Instead we heard a lot of discussion about the second amendment and respect for the sort of existing laws on the book, enforcing the existing laws on the book. The only time we ever heard about gun control during the presidential campaign was when he was asked during the town hall debate on long island, and he started out sort of discussing what he would do to ban assault weapons by talking about how important the second amendment was. This now has changed. He's never running for re-election again. He doesn't have to sort of face the political power of the gun lobby. 
Gwen: But he said take meaningful action regardless of the politics. The politics have not changed. 
>> Acknowledgment since gun politic are something of a third rail in the discussion right now. I think it's fascinating though to take a look for the first time there's actually money going behind some of the pro-gun control candidates. I spotlight new york city mayor michael bloomberg, who started a super pac this year and started targeting candidates who were targeting maybe unfortunate choice of words there -- trying to go after some candidates who supported gun rights in favor of candidates who were much more on his side in supporting gun control. He actually beat one longtime democrat joe baca in california with a last-minute money dump and now a pro-gun democrat is being replaced by pro-gun control democrat. 
>> Isn't the problem on this issue the people who want to protect gun rights are the ones who really vote on the issue, and that's always been the problem because they're energized, the ones who want to restrict gun rights or have gun control laws are not as motivated. 

[00:06:39]


>> Democrats remember just how bad the n.R.A. Was for them back in 1994 after the assault weapons ban passed. N.R.A. Went after a number of rural democrats in areas that weren't inside the city and effectively beat a number of them. There are a lot of democrats who still blame the n.R.A. For losing control of the house in '94. 
>> You mentioned this barely came up in 2012 campaign. It's been very hard to understand exactly what president obama's own position has been on this. But he has been cautious usually in the past not to take the moment of these shootings and use that for a political purpose. It's a very delicate thing. Some critics have said if you let the moment pass, you're back to the normal politics. Will this play out differently in the next stpwheek 
>> I think it will. I thought the white house did an interesting two-step earlier today. Jay carney, white house press secretary said earlier in the day this is not a time for politics or time to discuss some of these measures. I think there was such an outcry that because of who the victims were here, because they were elementary school children, that maybe now is the time and president obama himself spot lighted the meaningful action. I think that was a very telling word. By the way, let's not forget this is the second major shooting in a public place in less than a week. There was a shooting in a mall in suburban portland. That was yesterday -- yet another moment that passed. President obama ticked off the list of tragedies that happened since he's been president. He didn't mention tussin, when former congresswoman gabrielle was shot. 
>> And he said he wouldn't. 
>> Or ft. Hood or binging tom, new york or 400 murders that have taken place in chicago through the end of october. It's not like hasn't had the moment to actually start this conversation. Now it looked like he took the first step towards doing so. 
>> What would the second step somebody where would the debate begin on this? This apparently the man today who did the shooting did not use an assault weapon sofment where does it really begin? Where do you go after? 

[00:08:46]


>> What president obama said in his first term he favors enforcement of existing laws. Well, I think the next step is to realize that's not enough, that simply enforcing existing laws that say a felon can't get a handgun don't work if you don't have the sufficient infrastructure for background checks to try to figure out who actually is a felon, who's not supposed to have a gun. It's clear I think the white house or somebody on this side has to -- has to say something to the effect of, we have to take another step. 
Gwen: Can I ask you something briefly z. -- Briefly, does it have to be out of the white house? Does it have to be on capitol hill? 
>> I think it doesn't exist on capitol hill. It starts with the fact the republican party controls house of representatives and republicans are much more closely aligned with the national rifle association and its agenda then the democratic party, obviously. Even in the senate, there are a number of pro-gun and rural democrats. I find it hard to believe a democratic senator from north dakota or montana or basically anywhere in the midwest would vote for something that the n.R.A. Opposes. 
Gwen: It's kind of like a civics lesson. We will continue with tonight's civics lesson by talking instead about laws, the laws of politics. This week's object lesson, ambassador susan rice, who by most accounts was the president's preferred choice to succeed hillary clinton as secretary of state. That's until she pulled herself out of the running yesterday. 
>> I made the decision that it was the best thing for our country, for the american people that I not continue to be considered by the president for nomination for secretary of state because I didn't want to see a confirmation process that was very prolonged, very political sized -- politicalized, very distracting and very disruptive. Because there are som things we need to get done as a country. 
Gwen: What really happened here, david? Sometimes you think what you see is what you get and sometimes it's not quite. 
>> It's not quite in this case. The ostensible reason here is what ambassador rice said on several sunday morning tv shows about benghazi, the attack in libya that ended up costing the lives of four americans. But by the time that whole thing played out, it was pretty clear that she was reading talking points that were put together by the intelligence community. She had very little, if nothing to do with embassy security itself. She happened to be on those shows themselves because secretary clinton had just come back from a trip and said she was too tired to go on them. There was more under way here though. Part of it was a little bit of her style, which was very confrontational one and that probably didn't serve her all that well when she went up to capitol hill a few weeks ago and tried to talk this out between senator john mccain, lindsey graham, others who had opposed her. Little bit of it was the white house I think after president obama came out very strongly in her support. She was afterall one of the first people to sign on to his foreign policy team when he was a pretyim probable candidate. After that, the white house did not come out in sort of a full-throated defense. I think this week she claim to the conclusion they might not come out with that. Lastly, this is odd, but some democrats I think weren't super eager to see this battle go on and a few of them thought it really was john kerry's turn. Senator kerry, head of the foreign relations committee, is the presumed second choice for the president. He would cruise through in confirmation, we think. There are some democrats who felt his moment should come. 

[00:12:35]


Gwen: Could she have made it through? 
>> This is going -- 
>> I know early on I kept hearing oh, she had the votes, she could make it through, but 
-- 
gwen: If the president wants to make it a fight, she could win. But? 
>> My guess is and we will never know the answer to this is she probably could have. The question is, at what price to the president? One thing we learned about this president is, he wants to do one fight at a time. He's fight, until the shooting 
-- his fight until the shootings today was entirely fiscal cliff. 
>> Not about people. 
>> He may now if there's a gun control argument, that might become the second one. I think he was probably going to put all of these nominations off until the beginning of the year had she stayed in. Now that she's left, I suspect he could announce his team next week. 
>> How far would they have stuck with her had she decided to drag this thing out? 
>> Probably far enough until they could actually count votes and answer martha's question. 
>> It's hard to know since there was never a nomination on the table. 
>> That's right. Never was and you never had to sit there and count how many would be with her or not. I had a lot of senators say to me they thought in the end where a lot of people have very hard time voting against her. She clearly has the background and experience. I have known ambassador rice for 15, 20 years now. You could argue about various things she did or don't when she was assistant secretary for a.F.C. But -- for africa, but she knows her briefings. 
>> What would there difference be between secretary of state kerry or secretary of state rice? A big policy change for the administration? 
>> I don't think it's a big policy change of the remember, we're not in the first term here. The major elements of the obama administration strategy, lightfootprint, focus on pulling, no longer doing big, attritional wars but instead focusing on cyber and focusing on drones and the use of special forces and even diplomat approach around the world is one that's pretty well set. The difficulty here is ambassador rice knows how barack obama thinks. She's been with him so long, helped form so many of his views that she didn't need many instructions. That's not necessarily the case with senator kerry. 

[00:15:02]


Gwen: I wonder quickly, I have this thought because hillary clinton is so teflon these days is what happens with teflon, bullets bounce off and maybe hits somebody else. I wonder if she would have been the one on the sunday morning shows we would be having this conversation? 
>> I suspect we probably wouldn't. Secretary -- ambassador rice said yesterday she didn't regret going on those shows but have you to think that given how the whole thing played out, she must have second thoughts about whether somebody else could have done those shows that morning. 
Gwen: Wow. There was another sticky situation? This week for the obama administration and that was in syria. The u.S. Stepped up missile defense along syria's border with turkey, hoping to stave off the potential use of chemical weapons against anti-assad rebels. For the first time the u.S. Is formally recognizing rebels' attempt to overthrow president assad and we are at the end game, or are we? Martha? 
>> I think we're closer then we have ever been certainly. I think even two weeks ago there were a lot of people saying this could be months and months and months. We have no idea when this will end. But I think if you look at where those rebels are advancing in damas cass, I think it really could end there. You've got suburbs. You're seeing this extraordinary video coming out of damascus with the suburbs virtually on fire. The thing I think is most frightening about this is everybody, the rebels, regime, everybody is just trying -- destroying everything in their path. Then you get into the terrible thing with retribution. You have rebels advancing. You have regime fighting back. But I think asan has to be feeling the pressure. I think he's probably moving from people I have talked to say they believe he's probably moving around somewhere in damascus and probably reeling feeling the stress and yet feels great sense of entitlement. But I think we're closer to an end then we've been. You have heard the talk, he's finished. He's finished. For two years -- 

[00:17:04]


gwen: As the u.S. Tiptoes from the sidelines, as it tiptoed from the sidelines in egypt and tiptoed from the sidelines in libya doesn't always lead to what we had in mind, that is someone who could actually take over. 
>> Most definitely. I think recognizing an opposition group doesn't mean they have anybody that they think could take over. I think really what you would see afterwards is as much chaos as you have right now. I think assad would be out of the way and then it would be who's next? And I don't think that is at all clear. 
>> Martha, when you think about what a critical role syria plays, maybe strategically much more important for us then lib cania ever was. If he does fall and if the country splits up as some people suggested it may for a while, what does that do? Does that give any advantage to iran? Could he move in? Does it give any advantage to the russians or us? 
>> Everybody is probably trying to figure out exactly what would happen and who would have an advantage afterwards. And I don't think we know. I think it is unclear. Certainly you heard russia this week sort of seeing the writing on the wall. Maybe our great ally isn't going 
-- isn't going to stay maybe assad will fall. Those were the strongest words we heard, which is another indication that might happen. 
>> Martha, you talked about retribution and the fact all sides will destroy everything in their path. Side gets cornered and there's talk about chemical weapons. Is that in play, he could use chemical weapons? 
>> I think that is the absolute key here. Two weeks ago -- it was two weeks ago, right, chemical weapons, the u.S. Intelligence spotted the syrian regime putting chemicals, putting precursors of chemicals in actual bombs and they were near airfields and that scared everybody. That's the day you saw president obama come out. Intelligence in the last couple of weeks since then, they aren't as worried but those chemicals can last in those so I think that threat is out. There's nothing that scares the u.S. More than that. He would probably if he used chemical weapons and was backed into a corner used it against his own people but you have also got -- one of the reasons you have patriot missile batteries they're going to move into the area to try to stop and it would only stop chemical weapons if they were on scuds. It couldn't stop them if it was on anything smaller. 

[00:19:28]


>> What are the implications of the u.S. Moving 4,000 troops and two patriot missile batteries into southern turkey? How does that change anything? 
>> Thousands on the ground -- 
>> it's not really. I think, frankly, this is more of a political move because i think most of the batteries would be quite far away from the syrian border. So it's not -- I think one of the really important things is to see exactly where those batteries would be located, to see if you really could set up a no-fly zone, whether they would be affected. What I have seen so far they wouldn't be and it's more support turkey and more domestic problem for turkey so they want something on those borders. But I think generally, the 400 people on the ground aren't really us putting troops on the ground. They just have to man missiles. 
>> A lot of borders to protect in syria. We will be watching until we start putting missiles everywhere. Thanks, martha. Finally to the continuing and apparently stuck negotiations over a deal to avoid tax hikes and spending cuts at year's end. So-called fiscal cliff, good news or bad news when nothing seems to be happening on a week like this, john? 
>> Did depends which of the dramas you're watching. One of the difficulties covering this story is there are two dramas. There's the public drama, press releases, tantrums that all signs are giving about how the other side isn't doing any work. And then drama going on inside the room. We don't really know a whole lot about what's going on inside the room. The president met with john boehner fo50 minutes and all we know is it was a frank exchange. Usually a euphemism using language we can't repeat on television. But what what is happening in that room and we're not hearing anything and that's a good sign for the things you can squeeze a good sign out of all of this. What that means is they're giving a little. Each side is testing the other out. Big questions here, taxes. Will republicans vote for tax increases versus entitlements. Will the president go for big cuts in teen titlements. Both saying give a little here therein but they have to do it in private and can't leak. The minute it leaks, the conservatives and liberalless go nuts. 

[00:21:40]


Gwen: What do we know about what's on the table and off the table? 
>> The president wants a lot on the table so he wants tax rates to increase. He wants some investment spending. He also wants no debt limit fight next year because we're about to have this fight all over again, sort of the sixth chapter in this if they don't get debt limit question removed. That's what the president wants, all of those things. Republicans want big entitlement cuts. And the bigger the tax increase republicans have to vote for, bigger entitlement cuts the president has to agree to. 
>> Can we talk about public opinion? I imagine everybody out there saying not again, why can't they come to some agreement? 
Gwen: I think we're saying that actually. 
>> And you hear people like us saying they're going to do this and it might go over the fiscal cliff a couple days and it will be fine. What is public opinion showing? 
>> It's in the president's favor and why the president feels so good over at the white house and that's the core of the message in all of the interviews, they feel very confident about where they are and two reasons. One, the public is very much in support of the president's position, and that is to fix -- we will step back. What we're trying to do is the country is headed towards starvation diet. That's what the fiscal cliff is. And they're trying to move from a starvation diet to sort of figuring out kind of a weight watchers diet. So at the center the country said to get into the weight watchers plan, we agree taxes should go up on wealthy and spending cuts, balanced approach. If we go over the cliff, if the starvation kicks in, we will blame republicans. These are two things that help the president. But republicans in their district, two-thirds of them republicans brought back to washington with 55% of the vote. They have different constituents. The constituents in those districts, tea party-backed candidates, they want to see taxes not go up. There are republicans who show support republicans for letting tax rates increase but my point here is the house republicans, who are the ones who have to vote for this deal have a different set of political instincts and polls mean different things to them then this big national poll. 

[00:23:41]


>> John, if that's the case, let's say that speaker boehner comes up with an agreement with the president. What are the chances he can sell this to his own caucus? This is the equivalent question could susan rice have gotten through. It's hard to figure this out. How much is his own caucus with him? 
>> That's the key question. At the white house they don't have a lot of favor of john boehner to sell this to the republicans in the house and boehner said he wants a majority of the majority and they're republicans. Boehner is the only guy they're dealing with y will it be so hard? Boehner will have to sell a tax increase. Everybody knows this. Boehner has privately, according to sources from the democratic side, has agreed to some -- has in these private meetings wasn't supposed to hear about some kind of rate increase. But if he's going to go back to his republicans and those republicans have to go back home to districts and talk to constituents that say why in god's name did you vote for tax increases, they have to see, well, I got this and this will have to be big entitlement change, whether it is increased in the eligibility age or means testing or something, but there has to be a big prize on the entitlement side. 
Gwen: Quickly. 
>> What is the private discussion going on, back channel? 
>> Back channel is basically how much are you going to give me in entitlements and president is saying I will not give you things on entitlements until you tell me you vote for tax increase. 
Gwen: See you christmas eve, john dickerson. Tell us what's really going on. We have to go for now. We will pick up where we left off in "washington week" webcast extra.

Later in the show. 
>>> First, a bombshelln capitol hill yesterday. Susan rice will not be the next secretary of state. The u.S. Ambassador to the united nations withdrew her name from consideration yesterday after a standoff with republicans led by senator McCAIN. Who vowed to block her nomination. After notifying the president, rice sat down with nbc's brian williams to explain her decision. 
>> I made the decision that it was the best thing for our country, for the american people that I not continue to be considered by the president for nomination as secretary of state because I didn't want to see a confirmation process that was very prolonged,ery politicized, very distracting and very disruptive, because there are so many things we need to get done as a country. 
>> Controversy surrounding rice stems from her september appearance on theunday morning talk shows where she repeatedly characterized a terror attack against the u.S. Consulate in benghazi as a protest gone wrong. A statement from the white house maintains herments were based on intelligence she had at the time. Rice explained why it was she and not secretary clinton answering those tough questions on national tv. 
>> Why was it you that sunday morning? Of all the people in government, why the u.S. Ambassador to the united nations answering questions on the attack. 
>> It wasn't that usual. I've done shows in the past. Secretary clinton had been asked by most of the networks to go on. She had an incredibly gruelling week dealing with the protests around the middle east and north africa that enveloped our embassies. She had to deal with the loss of our four colleagues in benghazi. And console the whole state department, greet the families and the bodies. And she declined to do it. And I was asked by the white house if I would do it as the next senior american diplomat. We were talking about a range of issues that week. It wasn't just benghazi as you'll recall. It was a broad spectrum of foreign policy and national security issues that I talk about publicly every day. So I was asked, I was willing to do so. It wasn't what I had planned for that weekend originally but i don't regret doing that, brian. I think when you're a diplomat and a public official and a tragedy happens and it is related to the work that you do, it's our obligation to try to explain it as best we can to the american people. That's what I did. 

[00:02:30]


>> Last night, president obama says rice would remain a close member of his national security team. 
>> Susan's going to continue to be an outstanding u.S. Ambassador to the united nations. I hadn't made a decision about who would be my next secretary of state. There's no doubt that susan was qualified. There are other people who are qualified as well. Her interest is in serving me but more importantly, serving the country. I could not be prouder with her. She will continue to be one of the top members of my national security team. 
>> As for two of rice's biggest CRITICS, SENATOR john McCain's office released a statement saying, he wishes her well but will continue to seek all the facts about what happened in benghazi. Last night senator lindsey graham echoed that. 
>> We're not going to let this go how could for seven hours nobody come to the aid of the people during the attack? Why did we leave the consulate open? Where was the president when the british decided to close their consulate in june? And afterwards, how did the intelligence get so screwed up for lack of a better word? So we're going to keep pressing this so we can learn from it, not have it happen again. 
>> With susan rice out of the running, the spotlight immediately turns to senator john kerry. A white house official tells nbc news it's almost certain kerry will be the next secretary of state. Saying, quote, there were two people on the list, two minus one is one. Leaving capitol hill last night, kerry, let's just say he was coy with reporters. 
>> Earlier today and I'm just going to continue to do my work. 
>> Kerry released a statement praising rice as a dedicated public serveant saying in part, quote, as someone who has weathered my share of political attacks and understands on a personal level just how difficult politics can be, i felt for her throughout these last difficult weeks. I also know she will continue to serve with great passion and distinction. Kerry was mentioned at one point as a potential defense secretary also. Bun this latest cabinet shake-up, that post appears to be going to a republican. According to reports, former nebraska senator chuck hagel is the administration's leading candidate for the top defense post. Hagel reportedly disssed the position with president obama earlier this month at the white house. Officials say he may be nominated as soon as next week. Joining us now to break down this news, vice president and executive editor of the new msnbc.Com and msnbc politico analyst richard wolf. Let's start with who gets the blame for what happened yesterday? 

[00:05:06]


>> This was whipped up by john McCAIN. He made it personal. He was dogged with it. Fox news, let's face it, were also driving the story considerably. In the end, this came down to susan rice's decision and my sources who are very close to her said, this wasn't someone who was pushed. She made the decision herself. She could have got confirmed but decided to pull back because it would have been messy. 
>> She honestly said in her op-ed, it was for the best interest of country. You believe she feels that. 
>> Everybody says for the best interest of the country. There is a calculation you make about whether it's worth it to yourself, your family, to your boss, the president of the united states, they would have taken on water to get her through. I think they could have got her through. I think she thinks she could have got through but the political costs, given the campaign, the crusade, if you will, that was being led here was really hard. 
>> Messy to say the least. It is as simple as john kerry's next? Is there anyone that can sneak into this conversation? 
>> Nothing is simple. John kerry has other problems of his own. For instance, if you're john McCAIN AND YOU'RE HAWKISH ABOUT Intervention, you might not like the idea of a john kerry. On the other hand, they're friends. I'm not saying anything is smooth sailing but john kerry is certainly the front-runner. There aren't any other strong candidates. 
>> You'd be surprised if it wasn't him. 
>> I'd be astonished. 
>> We'll hold you to that. 
>> Thank you. 
>> We'll need you to weigh in on another story. 
>>> Today on this show, let's call it the budgetary boondoggle. Both sides met last night in what they'd call a frank conversation. Boehner earlier in the today accused obama of dragging this out. 
>> I've been pushing all year for us to address this problem. Here we are at the 11th hour and the president still isn't serious about dealing with this issue right here. It's this e. Spending. 

[00:07:09]


>> If we go over the cliff will you permit a vote to decouple that and fight again on the -- 
>> IFs AND ANDs AND BUTs ARE Like candy and nuts. If that were the case every day would be christmas. My goal is to get to -- I know, it's going to be here real soon! My goal is to get to an agreement with the president of the united states that addresses this problem. 
>>> Wall street's optimism may be throwing some cracks. All three major indices closing lower yesterday. It's looking less and less likely that both sides will reach a deal before the christmas break. Richard, as an outsider, when thearkets get nervous, I start to pay attention and I get nervous. When's the collision in this political game of chicken? 
>> The markets are going to get nervous. This uncertainly is not good for anyone. We'll have it now and around this debt ceiling thing we had last year as well, which was a real problem for world markets. But look, it's strange. You have two people who are pretending to negotiate and they come out, at least the speaker comes out and says we have got nothing done. Why meet up if there's no room for agreement? I think this is the dance phase of it. It's going to annoy people but of course on both sides they look like they're tough to their own base. There will be a deal. There will be a compromise. They are really dragging this out, though. 
>> I keep hearing on "morning joe," the longer it drags out, the better for the white house, the worse it is for republicans. You believe that. 
>> It's bad for everyone. They know where the deal will come out. Why not just do it. John boehner has to say he was tough, he went for the best deal possible. He's doing it a couple of beats too many times, right? That's why everyone is saying is there really a deal here? Yes. If there wasn't a deal he wouldn't be driving to the white house at all. 
>> Let's hope so. Good news maybe under the christmas tree. 
>> I'm a dogged optimist. 
>> You have to be. Richard, thanks for being with us early on this morn we'll see you in a few minutes with your excellent insights on "morning joe." 

[00:09:11]


>>> Overseas news now, new signs of trouble for the syrian government and its embattled president. Russia is offering a bleak outlook on how things might end for president assad. They said they were preparing to evacuate thousands of russian citizens from e country. With rebel forces closing in on the capital, damascus, richard engel witnessed firsthand the tough fighting still being waged in the larger city of aleppo. 
>> Reporter: The syrian regime appears to be cracking but the rebels remain outgun and unable to protect civilians, especially in aleppo. An ancient once-bustling city the size of chicago. We followed a rebel fighter. We're going to go to one of your sniper positions. He runs across intersections exposed to government fire and joins his unit. They peek around corners, fire at government soldiers. And shout insults at them. "I joined this revolt because of the tyranny and for religion, because for 40 years we have been oppressed" says this sniper, who painted furniture before the war. The fighting has left this once beautiful city devastated. Historic mosques destroyed, bread lines, gas shortages, power outages. This was one of the only hospitals residents say available to the opposition. Now that it's been destroyed, the rebels could only provide the most basic of first aid for their wounded. This clinic operates in secret. It, too, could be bombed. Nurses change bannedages by flashlight. Medical supplies are scarce. Syrian-american doctor kati came from los angeles to help. I asked him what aleppo needs most. 
>> Everything. To simple pain killers. There's none. They have tylenol here, which has to be brought in. 

[00:11:19]


>> Reporter: Rebels hope their sacrifices will be worth it, once aleppo falls, they say, damascus will follow. Until then, syria's largest city is suffering. 
>> That was nbc's richard engel reporting. 
>>> This morning it's being reported that secretary of defense leon panetta has signed the order to send patriot missiles to turkey. The order is part of a nato effort to help shield turkey from chemical weapons or missile attacks coming from syria. 
>>> As always, let us know why you're awake. Shoot us an e-mail at waytooearly@msnbc.Com. 
>>> Still ahead on "way too early" -- ?????? I made it out of clay ?????? ?????? when it's dry and ready ?????? ?????? then dreidel I shall ?????? 
>> that would be so much better if we didn't know that was jeremy lin and the houston rockets. The toughest competition, the classic hanukkah dreidel song. 
>>> Also, highlights from the football game last night. That was miss what are the eagles doing? 
>>> And not happy with the way the politicians are handling the fiscal cliff? Wait until you see how the ukraine parliament settles their disputes. All of that when "way too early" comes back. from fruit, something this delicious could only come from nature. Now from the maker of splenda sweeteners, discover nectresse. The only 100% natural, no-calorie sweetener made from the goodness of fruit. The rich, sweet taste of sugar. Nothing artificial. ?????? ?????? it's all that sweet ever needs to be. New nectresse. Sweetness naturally. 

[00:16:13]


>>> WHAT'S TODAY, THE 14th? 11 days tilt christmas, counting down and going fast. Now for a quick check on weather to get you out the door this morning. The rainiest spot in the country, not where you'd expect it. Arizona and the deserts out there in phoenix and tucson and vegas are getting the wet weather. This storm will travel across the country. On the east coast, sunday, great lakes, midwest, saturday. Let me show you what's going on, enjoy this nice pattern while it lasts. East coast unsettled from sunday right through wednesday. Enjoy the sunshine while it lasts. It will be a beautiful afternoon today. Temperatures aren't even that cold anywhere in the country. That's why I'm not talking about a lot of snow and rain in the days ahead. Mostly rain. The forecast today, another beautiful day. Jen told me yesterday 49 was too chilly for lunch in d.C. 53 probably is, too. Maybe a nice walk off lunch. How about that? THE NORTHERN PLAINS, IN THE 30s. The weekend forecast, again, saturday's the best day in new england and the mid-atlantic becauson sunday, that's when it will be cloudy and rainy and a little bit snowy in areas of northern new england. Keep that in mean. I've been teasing that big possible east coast storm tuesday into wednesday. Still a possibility. 
>>> Now on to sports where the only thing you need to know, in my fantasy football semifinals, I was going against the bengals defense. Not happy. Eagles, their dismal season continued last ght. First quarter, trying to get the punt off, it's blocked. By his own teammates and recovered outside the 10 yard line. Let's take another look. marvin McNut. He gets pushed back into the pun. It's been that kind of year for the eagles. Bengals down by three in the third quarter. Andy dalton takes off. Nice tackle by number 95. 11-yard touchdown run, enof the this, thsh, bryce brown takes the handoff, leveled. Scooped up by wallace gillbury and takes it for the defensive touchdown. Bengals scored 24 unanswered points in a hurry. They go on to win 34-13. Now they have a record of 8-6. Atlanta is currently holding down the last playoff spot. It looks like the steelers or bengals for that spot. 

[00:18:28]


>>> Lakers in town. Carmelo anthony unstoppable. Looking like the mvp this year. Melo had 22 points in the first quarter alone. The most by any nba player in a quarter. The ankle gets caught behind him, scary moment. Sprain not severely, not broken. He could possibly be out another game or two. To the fourth quarter, the knicks trying to hold off the lakers. Without melo, felton to chandler there. They did hold them off. They finish with a victory. The lakers lose again, 116-107. The knicks perfect at ho 9-0. No word on the exact specific time that carmelo anthony will be back. 
>>> The houston rockets decided to livan up your next hanukkah party with their rendition of the dreidel song. 
>> ?????? I have a little dreidel ?????? ?????? I made it out of clay ?????? ?????? when it's dry and ready dreidel I shall play ?????? ?????? dreidel dreidel dreidel ?????? ?????? I made it all of clay ?????? ?????? when it's dry and ready oh dreidel I shall play ?????? ?????? it has a lively body with legs so short and thin ?????? ?????? when it gets all tired it drops and then I win ?????? ?????? hey ?????? 
>> just waiting for one of them even with a half decent voice. Brutal. Coming up -- but punfy in coming up at the top of the hour on "morning joe," president obama's short list to replace hillary clinton as secretary of state just got a little bit shorter as u.S. Ambassador susan rice withdraws her name for consideration for the top cabinet post.

>>> Are you blameless in all this? 
>> Brian, I don't think anybody is ever wholly blameless. But I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't mislead. I didn't misrepresent. I did the best with the information the united states government had at the time. 

[00:23:27]


>> We told you at the top of the show that susan rice had withdrawn her name from consideration from the secretary of state nomination. This comes months after intense scrutiny from the gop regarding rice's characterization of the attacks of the u.S. Consulate in benghazi. If you want to sound smart today, tell your friends that at 48 years old, susan rice would have been the youngest woman ever to become secretary of state had she been confirmed. Condoleezza rice was 50 when she was nominated by george w. Bush back in 2004. Enough for the real news. Let's gather around that water cooler to watch politics ukrainian style. The newly elected ukrainian parliament had their first session yesterday. Shortly into the daythis erupted. On the floor, a mass fist fight between the ruling party and opposition. The two sides were arguing over voting rules when opposition members stormed the podium, punching, grabbing, bite, choke holes and body slams. And full nelsons? Also there, but not seen in the pictures, boxing heavyweight and great, klitschko. When asked why he wasn't getting involved, klitschko simply said, quote, I understand many people want klitschko to launch an offensive but I would like to remine them the fists a world champion are considered nuclear weapons. We will not use these weapons for now. It's not the first time the ukrainian politics have resorted to actions worthy of detention. Back in 2010 lawmakers threw eggs and set off smoke bombs in the chamber over a vote to keep the russian navy stationed at a ukrainian port. 
>>> A small victory for the nerds today. President obama must respond to a petition responded by t.J. On the white house's we the people website, asking him to start constructing a death star by 2016. I'm talking about the death star from "star wars." The one with the planet destroying laser beams who remembers the planet? What was the planet? No one? No one? You guys are geeks. I thought you'd know it for sure. The white house promised it would answer any petition submitted to its website that gets 25,000 signatures. This one now has 27,000. The petition says a death star weapons system could help strengthen our national defense. And help create jobs. You had ten sections on google and no one could help me out? Calderon. Thank you.

Wild Kratts is made possible by The Corporation for Public Broadcasting and by contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you. Thank you. Hey, it's the Kratt brothers here. I'm Chris. And I'm Martin. And we're searching for-- Over there! The Monarch butterfly, one of the most amazing creatures around. And the reason they're so amazing? Wait! Oh, he's going this way! Here's one! Come back! Whoa! 
(Laughing) Oh, he got away. Milkweed. Hey, but butterfly might have gotten away, but if you're looking for monarch caterpillars, milkweed is the place to find them. Martin, over here. Oh. All right! Oh, they're big fat ones. Oh, yeah, look at them munching away. Keep on growing buddy. We'll check on you later. 
CHRIS: Yes, it's happening. He's changing into a calis. The caterpillar sheds his outer skin. And inside is the chrysalis. 
MARTIN: And this is the chrysalis with the developing butterfly right inside. And over the next 14 days, an amazing transformation takes place. And they emerge as... Butterflies. You're looking good, buddy. Oh, now, monarch butterflies aren't just your ordinary beautiful butterfly. They are long-distance voyagers. Monarchs are the only butterflies in the world to take a miraculous 3,000-milerney. Imagine if we could be a monarch. Then we'd be able to join the most incredible journey in the insect world. What if? What if? ?????? On adventure with the coolest creatures ?????? ?????? From the oceans to the trees ?????? ?????? The Brothers Kratt are going places you never get to see ?????? ?????? Hanging with their creature friends ?????? ?????? Get ready, it's the hour ?????? ?????? We're gonna save some animals today with ?????? ?????? Creature Power ?????? ??????

Gonna go wild, Wild Kratts ?????? ?????? Gonna go wild, wild, Wild Kratts ?????? ?????? Go wild, wild, Wild Kratts ?????? There's got to be one around here somewhere. What about this one? Hm, that looks like a Swallowtail caterpillar. Yup, Tiger Swallowtail. Starts as a caterpillar that looks like this. Turns into a butterfly that looks like this. 

[00:03:04]


AVIVA: Beautiful. So if we're going to find a monarch caterpillar, tell me what they look like. Well, they're black with white and yellow stripes like-- Kind of like that, just not so blue. He's got the markings of a monarch. He's got the feet of a monarch caterpillar. And he's got the face of-- Martin? Martin? Hey, guys. I found a monarch caterpillar. Meet Maxilla! Cool, my caterpillar programming works for monarchs too. Oh, yeah, but these guys, they don't have much in the way of powers except the power to eat milkweed. , she's a milkweed munching machine. 
CHRIS: Yeah, but just wait till she becomes a butterfly. That's when she'll show off her power to take the longest, most incredible journey of any insect in North America, 3,000 miles to Mexico. 
AVIVA: 3,000 miles? No way. How can a little butterfly make it that far? That would be like someone our size-- 
MARTIN: Traveling all the way around the world two times under our own power, no planes, cars, nothing. Get out! No way I'm going to believe that. Okay, we'll, prove it. We'll follow one butterfly on the entire voyage side by side with one of the greatest insect travelers in the world. That would be Maxilla here, a.k.a. Captain Maxilla. We'll go with her when she hatches. Okay, big talkers. Koki, how much time does that give me to make a butterfly adventure vehicle? Let's see. Well, Maxilla already hatched from the egg. And judging from her size, has been a growing caterpillar for about 11 days, which means she's about to become a chrysalis for about 10 days until she emerges transformed into a butterfly. Right on, Koki. Maxilla's changing into chrysalis mode right now. I better get moving. Mexico, here we come! Hey, wait up! Ah! Oof! I told you I need something really divine for this fashion season. What else do you have? You like it? No, I don't like. What else do you have? No, too cold. Next. Oh. Hey. A worm? You expect me to do something with a worm? Donita Donata makes living fashions, not magic. Make it disappear! Keep looking. Day 10, monarch-o-rama! 

[00:05:52]


(Cheering) Cool! Awesome! Monarchs, here we come! Right on time, Maxilla, 10 days. Wow. 
JIMMY Z: Hate to burst everybody's chrysalis, but her wings are all shriveled up. Not for long, Jimmy Z. Get those wing fluids pumping, Maxilla! Okay, all set. Where's the butterfly vehicle? Wait, there's a big mistake. She's never even flown in her life, and she's going to fly all the way to Mexico on those flimsy wings? Oh, yeah, but don't worry. We'll help her if she needs it. Martin, she knows how to pull this off better than we do. Nature's got know-how. I'm just hoping we can keep up. Well, this will help. Ta-da, the Butterflier XT! It's tiny. It's butterfly size. You don't want an advantage, do you? Uh, yeah, I'll take an advantage. Hey, if the butterflies can do it, so can we! Ready, Martin? 
MARTIN: Oh, yeah! Okay, tag ready. She's #12. Don't lose her. 
MARTIN: We won't. All systems go. Mission Monarch ready for takeoff. T minus 3 seconds and counting. 
AVIVA: Three, two, one, lift-off! Got to webcast this action. 
(Gasping) 
MARTIN: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Adios! Bon voyage! 
MARTIN: Whoa! Good luck! 
(Panting) , 10 days and still no fashion breakthrough. You need a break? I need a break. No, no, no, not until I have what I'm looking for. I didn't become the #1 live-animal fashion designer by giving up! Pass me the sun screen. What is that? It's guh-guh-gorgeous with a capital "guh"! I can't believe-- Oh, it's a butterfly! Oh, yes, live hair adornments. Butterfly barrettes! I want you! Come back here! Catch it, Dabi??C Catch it! Catch them all! Uh, oh-oh. 

[00:08:16]


DONITA: Get them! 
MARTIN: Whoa, smooth it out, Chris. I never get carsick but this is ridiculous. I've got the zig down. Now I just have to get the zag. 
(Gasping) 
MARTIN: Whoa, swallow attack! Oh, yeah, it's the erratic flight pattern defense. Fly all zigzaggy and it's harder for a predator to catch you. That's when zigzags come in handy. Well, I hope you got it down now, dude, because that blue bomber just circled around on your left! Got it! Zigging now! Whoa! Whoa! Yeah! Can't catch us! Chris, on the right! Uh-oh, this calls for the zag. Not zag. Whoa! Yes, nailed it. Whoo-hoo! Bye-bye, tree swallow. 
(Both gasping) Ow. Hello, windshield. Where's Maxilla? Oh, she's fine. Us, not so good. 
DONITA: There's one! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Capture it. Get me that butterfly! I'll get you, butterfly. Whoa! Uh-oh, our wings are pretty mesd up. Yeah, but at least it still flies. Let's wing it! Oof! They're just little bugs! Are you telling me you can't catch bugs? 
CHRIS: Okay, now we know that cars are like predators to the migrating monarch. They're dangerous. And Donita, she's after these butterflies too. 
AVIVA: Don't worry about Donita. We'll keep an eye on her. Oh, and, guys, watch your energy. Don't forget to refuel. 
(Beeping) Uh-oh. Uh-oh. 
BOTH: Now she tells us! 

[00:10:17]


(Groaning) This is going well so far. Couldn't be better. Day 3 of Mission Monarch and things are off to a shaky start. Hey, nice day for flying. Have you seen Maxilla,? Thirsty? Yeah, we're filling up our tank too. Wow,ow, that's a cool straw! 
CHRIS: Built in and portable. Just roll it out and have a drink of sweet nectar. Nice touch, Aviva. Just like a butterfly's proboscis. Here's some untapped nectar, Martin. Yup, sugary sweet. The perfect energy food for a butterfly. Fill her up. I can't believe we lost Maxilla. Oh, we got to find her so we can help her if she gets into trouble. Martin, we're just barely surviving here. Maxilla's got nature's know-how. I'm suhe's doing way better than we are right now. You think so? I know so! Look! 
(Gasping) We can't be going that way. Okay, we're going that way. Yikes. Day 14 of Mission Monarch. The brothers have just left a Wild Kratts Teamer's butterfly garden. and are now attempting to cross the Great Lakes with the monarchs. They'll now be crossing 100 miles of water in a single flight. 
JIMMY Z: No, no, no. They can't do it. It's impossible. You're freaking me out. Jimmy, it's okay. I put extra energy capacity in the Butterflier. Just like a butterfly, they'll store fat in this part of their body, the abdomen. That should give them just enough energy to make it across. As long as the weather holds. 
(Jimmy Z moaning) He's fainted again. Better get the pizza. This windstorm came out of nowhere. We're not going anywhere. We're too light. I know. We're running out of energy fast. Look. Is that--? That's Maxilla! Hah, #12 with the curled antenna. She's going down and so are we. When you're in trouble, nature's know-how can pull you through. 

[00:12:31]


(Horn blaring) 
CHRIS: Hey, a boat. 
MARTIN: Whoa, everybody's waiting out the windstorm. Yeah, a butterfly only weighs about as much as three tissues. So when it's windy or rainy, they just have to sit tight. Hah, I wonder who the nice people are that are letting us all rest on their boat. 
DONITA: Butterflies, get them! No free rides today! Catch those barrettes, all of them! 
(Dabio grunting) 
(Growling) 
(Groaning) 
CHRIS: Wind levels are down. Ready for takeoff. Hurry, dude. Here comes Dabio! Whoa! Whoa! 
(Both screaming) 
(Both panting) 
MARTIN: Ooh, nice day for a swim. I will get those butterfly barrettes if I have to go to the end of the earth to do it! Mission Monarch day 36: the cold weather is on its way up here. All the milkweed plants that the monarch caterpillars need to eat are dying. With no food and cool weather on its way, it's no wonder the monarchs headed down to warmer weather. Chris, Martin and Maxilla have made it 1,000 miles and counting. We've just received word from a Creare Teamer that they made it to Georgia, about 2/3 of the way to Mexico. Hey, want to see a loop-the-loop? Whoa! 
MARTIN: Yeah, Maxilla, we're doing about 120 miles a day, pretty good pace. I'd say it'll be smooth sailing from here. Maxilla, she's gone. Gone? Where did she go? There! Oh, no! You're right, Martin! Now she does need our help! Hang on, Maxilla. I'll get you out! Martin, behind you! (Gasping) Uh-oh, I'm too late. Nice spider. Okay, we're just passing through. Whoa! 

[00:14:33]


(Metal clanging) Got you, bro. 
MARTIN: I can't believe it. Why did the spider cut her loose? Why did he let her go? Monarchs taste bad. Yeah, I'll stick to hotdogs. No, really, it says right here that they're poisonous. Look at this. All it takes is for a predator to try eating a monarch once, and he gets so sick, that he'll never eat another one as long as he lives. 
(Shrieking) 
(Gulping) So that's why the spider didn't eat Maxilla. He knows monarchs are poisonous. Wow, it really helps ave a few tricks like that when you're on a 3,000 mile journey over forests, through cities, until after 2,000 miles, the butterflies have to pass through this thin strip of land to their final destination, Mexico. 
DONITA: Ah, yes, Dabio, we're going to Mexico. 
(Laughing maniacally) Where's that? 
CHRIS: We must be getting close. They're all going into that forest. 
MARTIN: Whoa, we have arrived. Amazing. The secret winter hideout of the monarch butterflies. All the monarchs from across eastern North America right here in this tiny forest. Maxilla, I knew you could do it. 3,000 miles on 4 inch wings. And the amazing thing is, you've never even been here before. Yeah, when you started the trip, you just emerged from you chrysalis. Nobody knows how you guys find your way here but you do. That's what I call nature's know-how. Hey, the butterflies are settling down. Everyone's finding a place in the trees. Of course. It's getting colder. It's hibernation time! 
AVIVA: And it's even colder up here, Chris. We've got the first snowstorm of the season. This must be why they left in the first place. Right, guys? Guys They couldn't survive up there. But here they can huddle together through the winter and so are we, butterfly style. 

[00:16:42]


(Yawning) Butterfly blankey. 
(Chuckling) Migrators turned hibernators. Well, if they hang out with the sleeping butterflies for four months, it will give me time to work on butterfly programming for the Creature Power suits. Sweet dreams. 
(Snoring) This isn't Mexico! 
(Bird screeching) 
(Snoring) This isn't Mexico! Huh? 
(Snorting) 
(Snoring) This isn't Mexico! Ah. 
(Snoring) Finally, Mexico. It took me four months, but it was worth the wait. Dabio, hurry up! (Screaming) 
(Donita laughing maniacally) 
(Donita laughing maniacally) Stop! No, leave them alone! Back off! Wait, who are we talking to? Whoa, sorry. I just had a nightmare. I dreamt Donita was here taking branch-fulls of butterflies. Chris, I don't think that was a dream. Look! Oh, no. Oh, you're just trying to get a good four-month sleep, and Donita snatches you just as you're about to wake up and head home. It's true. Look. Everyone's waking up. Oh, morning, Maxilla. Glad you're here. Come in, Tortuga HQ. Oh, hello, sleeping beauties. Welcome to spring. Aviva, where's Donita? I don't know. I've been so busy adding butterfly programming to the suits. Last report, she was wandering around the Arctic. She'll never find that secret forest. 
CHRIS: Well, this is never. And the secret's out. Oh, no. You guys use your suits. They're done. We're on our way. We'll find her. Jimmy, teleport! Zappy. I got it. I got it. Activate! Activate! 

[00:18:55]


(Whimpering) Not caterpillar mode! Ah, that's better-fly. I mean, butterfly! Chris? Oh, no. Chrysalis mode. Butterfly power! 
BOTH: To the creature rescue! 
(Panting) 
DONITA: Hurry up, o. I'm tired of delays. I need to get these butterflies back to the mansion. 
(Panting) Ugh, greasy. Hey, looking good. 
DONITA: Dabio! (Gasping) 
(Panting) Ah, yes, beautiful barrettes. Soon everyone will be wearing them. What? What--? What is happening to my butterflies? They're dying! No, no, no, no! Stop dying! I order you to stop dying right now! Maxilla, wake up. Are you okay? Wake up. I'll do a medical check. 
(Beeping) Oh, no. I think she's-- She's dying. No, Maxilla, don't. You can't do that. Martin, over here. She laid an egg. And look. So has she. A new generation of monarchs is on the way. In just four days, these monarch eggs will hatch into tiny caterpillars and start the whole lifecycle over again. Lay eggs and then die. I know. It's just how life is for lots of insects. Yeah, but she lived a super-long life, bro. Four months, 3,000 miles. Maxilla saw more of the world than most people do. Yeah, all that and she never made it back home. Hey, what if she's not supped to make it home? Yeah, maybe he's supposed to keep the journey going! Yes, nature's got know-how. They lay eggs so the babies can continue the journey home. Martin, Chris, I found Donita. I think she's killing all the butterflies. It's not Donita. The butterflies are just doing their natural butterfly thing. It's their lifecycle. But we've got to rescue them so they can lay eggs and keep that lifecycle going! And I've got a plan that might work. Do not die on me now. I need living butterfly barrettes. Do you hear me?! Living! 

[00:21:25]


DABIO: At least they're easier to catch now. Not as easy as you are. 
(Grunting) What are you doing? Let me out of here! You kept trying to net these monarchs. Now it's your turn. But I still have the butterflies. How are you going to get them? Like this. 
BOTH: Milkweed, anyone? Go lay your eggs, beautiful butterflies! Follow us! We know of a great milkweed patch! No, no, no, get back here with my butterflies! Stop! 
(Dabio screaming) 
(Donita groaning) 
DONITA: That hurt. Ow! Ow! 
(Both groaning) 
(Donita screaming) 
(Both groaning) That hurt! Whose bad idea were butterfly barrettes anyway? Don't answer that. Ah, the thing every monarch needs to lay its eggs, a milkweed patch. And when they hatch, those milkweed-eating caterpillars of yours will have a feast! Wow, the lifecycle of the migrating monarch is saved. So let me get this straight, guys. The butterflies that live during the fall migrate 3,000 miles to Mexico to escape the cold. And when they get to their secret forest, they hibernate. 
CHRIS: Then they wake up in the spring just as the milkweed is starting to grow back. 
MARTIN: But they don't make it all the way home. It's their sons and daughters who will finish the trip. They lay eggs before they die that will hatch into caterpillars. The caterpillar eats and eats, forms a chrysalis and finally becomes a butterfly. The sons and daughters of those original butterflies will continue the journey home. That is one incredible life story. The new generation of monarchs is here. Safe and sound and heading north. Yay! Look at them go! Yay! Come on, Maxilla Jr. You're doing great. Ah, your mom would be proud. With their o creature know-how a little help from friends like us, little creatures can do amazing things. 

[00:23:40]


MARTIN: Woohoo! 
CHRIS: Woohoo! (Martin laughing) So monarch butterflies have what it takes to make one of the greatest migrations in the creature world. Right now is the beginning of fall. And the monarch migration is underway. And we're here at an important pit-stop place for migrating monarchs. Why is it so important? That's why! This huge body of water is what the monarch butterflies have to cross, Lake Erie, 100 miles across. 
CHRIS: That group of monarchs has spent the night roosting in the trees. They're resting up for their urney across the lake. And as the sun warms up their bodies, they begin to move and work their muscles. And one by one, they take off. The butterflies also fuel up here. They drink nectar from the flowers to get the energy they need to make it across the lake. Get a good drink. 
CHRIS: Oh, there he goes! All right! Before they cross, they'll check the wind. If it's blowing south, it will help them across the lake. There he goes. He's ready. Good luck! With the forests in Mexico being cut down and more and more habitat along the way being destroyed, the monarchs could use a lot of help from us. One thing you can do is plant a butterfly garden, your own pit-stop place for migrating monarchs. Monarchs love to fuel up on butterfly bush, and sedum. You can also help monarchs by helping scientists track their migration. Tag a monarch. That way scientistcan track an individual monarch's journey. 
MARTIN: This monarch's ID is NEC 650. Then when you tag the monarch, hold it gently by the leading edge of its wings and put the little tiny tag right on this part of the lower wing. There, the tag is light and won't bother the monarch when she's flying. And if this monarch makes it all the way down to Mexico, a scientist may find her, and, because of the tag, know exactly where she was released and when. 

[00:25:58]


CHRIS: You're ready to fly? There he goes. Have a good trip! Bon voyage! Monarch butterflies, little creatures that can do big things. We'll see you on the creature trail. Did you know that a rattlesnake's rattle is made of special scales? And these scales are made of carotene, the same thing our finger nails are made of. Wow. Look at that rattle. 
(Rattling) Specialized scales that rattle as a warning call, saying, "Boff, or I'll strike." The eastern diamond-backed rattlesnake is one bnake. All right, Martin, we got a mystery animal right behind you. Who do you think it it? Okay. Shh. I hear panting. Could it be a mammal? Yes, it's a mammal. All right. Can you give me a colour clue? Red. Red? A red mammal. That narrows it down-- Does it have big hind legs? Oh, yeah! Can it jump like crazy? Oh, yeah. One of the best. Is it a red kangaroo? You got it! The red kangaroo of Australia. Oh, yeah! A monitor lizard. A lot of lizards bask in the sun to warm up their body temperature so they can move. Lizards are cold-blooded. That means they don't have a constant body temperature like we do. So, they need the heat from their environment to warm them up.

Narrator: Hey, kids. Today's featured words are dupe and hoist. School newspaper editor todd "scoops" ming is interviewing word girl for a local news segment, and he's asking her the question on everyone's mind. Do you think doing tv will hurt my repution as a serious journalist? Huh? Maybe just his mind. Eh, forget it. Superheroes--they're just like me and you. Hi. I'm todd "scoops" ming, here to prove that word girl has more in common with regular people than you might think. For example, word girl, what's your favorite hobby? Flying. Oh. Ta-da! Ha ha ha! I guess some people out there in television land can relate to that. Oh! Can you transform into your secret identity so I can interview her? Really, scoops? You think I'm gonna fall for that? Sorry. Guess I should know better than to try and dupe a superhero. Yep. Um, listen. I have to be somewhere. Any more questions? Several. What job, other than superhero, would you like to try? Oh, that's easy. I would want to be the star of my favorite tv show "pretty princess and magic pony power hour"! I know it's a cartoon, so technically that's impossible, but a girl can dream, can't she? Ok, this is great stuff. Now-- I actually have to get home right away to watch it. I never miss an episode as long as I don't have a crime to stop! Bye! So what's it like being a-- um, what kind of animal are you again? 

[00:02:56]


[Screeches] 
[high-pitched tone] watch it. I never miss an episode as long as I don't have a crime to stop! Bye! Or to not stop, once I use my brand-new mind control setting on you! Hee hee hee! Sir, do you plan on turning word girl into a horse? No! That's not a bad idea, though. Write it down. Actually,make it a pony. You were saying about this plan... Yes! I'm making word girl believe she's part of her "princess and pony" show by controlling her mind through television! Mmm. And then what? Oh. Well, um, I'll--i'll control her. Her mind. And then make her do what? Uh, capture every citizen in town in--in giant pet carriers-- yes, yes, pet carriers, that's perfect! And the--then she'll hoist them up in the air and fly them all out of the city! Mu ha! Oh, mu ha! Mu ha! And ha ha! Why do you want word girl to take everyone out of the city? Because then the city, you see-- the city--stay with me here-- the city will be mine! I mean, who else-- who else's would it be? Heh heh. Ye-- everyone else will be out of the city! Brilliant as usual, sir. Thank yo lesl-- wait are you being sarcastic? I can't tell anymore, sir. No matter because once word girl is duped into thinking she's inside her favorite show, I'll send my orders to her through this microphone. Maybe you should try to make sure the message only goes to word girl so you don't ruin the show for anyone else who might be watching. Oh, what a coincidence. It's time for my break. I'll be in the tv room, eating my lunch and nowatching "pretty princess magic pony power hour". Just make sure you punch your time card, leslie. I don't pay you to eat. Ahh. Finally a little peace, a little quiet, and some "p.P.M.P."! It's just nice to lose yourself in the magical world of princesses and magic ponies and dragons and mr. Big's face. 

[00:05:25]


[Soothing voice] hello, word girl! Welcome to "pretty princess magic mind control." I'm going to empty out the city, thanks to viewers like you! Mu ha ha ha! Mu ha ha ha! Mu ha ha ha! Mu ha ha ha! Oh, welcome, word girl. 
[Neigh] pretty princess? Magic pony? Is this really happening? 
Mr. Big and Pretty Princess: Yes, it is. This is not mind control. Wow! The enchanted city! Amaaazing. Ok, just a few questions. Is sparkletopia really just a place in your imaginations, or was that just another one of count cloudy's tricks? What? Also if the pretty flower mobile runs on sunshine, how did the wondertown elves ever get out of darkness mountain? I mean, come on. What? 
[Normal voice] i--listen. Just... 
[Soothing voice] save your questions for later. 
[Normal voice] word girl thinks she's in a tv show. How ridiculous! I totally duped her! Mu ha ha! Mu ha ha ha! Oh, this really isn't as fun by yourself. Leslie, get in here! You interrupted, sir? Yes. Initiate phase two of my plan. The button right next to your hand, sir? That's the one! Word girl will think she's doing good things for that princess when really she'll be doing bad things for this princess! I mean prince. Of course you do, sir. I'll just press this button and get back to my show-- I mean, lunch. I need your--i-- 
[soothing voice] I need your help, word girl. I need your help, word girl. That evil bad guy-- count cloudy? That's the one. He's threatening to invade the enchanted city! This is amazing. It's up to you to fly everyone out of the city before it's too late! You can hoist them up in these giant pet carriers. Wait. Why do you have pet carriers? Won't you help us, word girl? Won't you pretty please with cherries and gum drops and kittens with mittens... And oodles of noodles and carts full of hearts and... Snowflakes and cream cakes and-- yes! Yes, a thousand times yes, I'll help you! I've been waiting for this my whole life. Are you kidding me? Come on, everyone! Into these giant pet carriers! Free pet carrier ride from word girl. Awesome! We must leave the enchanted city before count cloudy arrives! Yeah, ok. Hoist us up, word girl! 

[00:08:12]


All: Hoist! Hoist! Hoist! Hoist! Wait, wait, wait. Why are we saying, "hoist"? Hoist means lift up or raise. Ohh. Well, hoist! Hoist! Hoist! 
[Screeches] 
Scoops: And so the superhero word girl and her trusted sidekick colonel koala head are revealed to be ordinary, run-of-the mill-- hey, what's happening over there? Cool! This is todd "scoops" ming with the best ending to a report ever. Yeah! Wait for me! Wait for me! 
[Eeeh] 
[aaah] your work here is almost done. Soon, the city will be completely empty! Can I just say what a huge fan I am? I mean, seriously, I don't normally get star-struck, but-- 
[distant squeaking] hmm. That's weird. Does anyone hear a squeaking? It's just sounding really familiar. Whoa! Free pet carrier ride and a jumping bear? Could this day be better?! 
[Squeaking] do you hear that squeaking, pretty princess? Uh, uh, what squeaking? There's no squeaking. There's no squeaking at all! Oh, there's squeaking. Definitely squeaking happening. Oh, right, that squeaking. There's a loose pipe, in the...Rainbow sprinkler system. Mu heh heh. Hmm. The enchanted city rainbows are made by a sprinkler system? Uh, yes, it's all powered by mr. Big water supply! Oh, that's just not true! The rainbows are made by magic sunbeams that shine over the valley of unicorns, and their power grows stronger whenever someone buys a pretty princess magic pony accessory! Everyone knows that! 
[Soothing voice] leslie, what are you what are you-- 
[normal voice] what are you doing?! I'm a superfan, sir. Leslie? Mr. Big water supply? Wait a minute. No, word girl, don't go. Stay here with us! It's what you've wanted! It's what you've always wanted. Come on, more hois! Hoist! Hoist! Hoist! Holy cow! Mr. Big? He duped me using my favorite show?! Hey. I want my money back! But it was a free ride. Let's go, huggy. He doesn't know what superhero team he's messing with. 

[00:10:52]


[Squeaking] that's right. Us. Word up! Freeze! Uh, uh, you... 
[Soothing voice] you want to go home... And leave mr. Big alone. Game over, mr. Big. 
[Normal voice] ok. But you admit i--i totally duped you, right? Well, dupe means trick, and you definitely tricked me. So... So...Duped you! Say it. Yes, but it won't happen again! Ha ha ha! We'll see about that! 
[Aah] 
[screaming] mm-hmm. Haven't you tried that one before? Yes. But not this one! 
[Yawns] or this one! Or, uh, this one! Or this one! Or this one! Ugh. Terrific. I know you were being sarcastic that time! Great. That time, too! Uh, uh-oh. I can fly, remember? I also have super strength! Let's leave those two for the police. I guess I was so obsessed with my favorite tv show, I completely lost sight of-- you know, actually, we hurry we can probably catch the last 5 minutes of the episode. 
[Huggy squeaks] 
Narrator: And so word girl and captain huggy face save the day. Well, mainly captain huggy face since word girl was duped. Well, you were, but maybe she won't be next time, on another colossal, stupendous, fantastic episode of-- hoist! Hoist! Hoist-- "word girl"! handsome, is... "May I have a word?" As usual, the player who correctly defines today's featured word will win a fabulous prize! Let's play... "May I have a word?" Yes, you may! Today's featured word is shatter. To give you a clue, here are some clips from "word girl" that show the meaning of the word. 

[00:13:06]


[Screech] uh, huggy! What are you doing? I'd like to answer the question, but huggy shattered my buzzer. I mean, it's totally broken into pieces. Hmm. You're right about the definition. Shatter does mean to break into pieces, but, uh, well, you didn't buzz in. How could I have? With your buzzer. Oh, right. Sorry. Judges, emily did correctly define the word. Can we accept her answer? We can?! Ok. Huh? Oh, this tie? No, it's not new. Well, I like your tie, too. Sure you can borrow it. Congratulations, emily! You are today's winner! Huggy, show her what she's won! An official "word girl" rope swing! That's it for today's episode. See you next time on... "May I have a word?" ?????? ?????? 
Narrator: Pssst, listen for the words debate and substitute. One afternoon at the botsfords'... Isn't this fun, bob?! The school debate club is having a special debate today. We're deciding on a club mascot! I can't wait to explain to everyone why i think we should be the unicorns. How is this not fascinating for you? Supermarket superheroes! Word girl is making an appearance at the grocery store ribbon cutting ceremony today! Wow! I've got to leave. Oh, no! How could I have forgotten?! I mean, I wrote it down in my calendar! Aw, but I was so looking forward to the big debate! I always have to miss fun stuff because I'm word girl. I wish I could send a substitute in my place. I've got an idea! Perfect! I'll tell you what's going on. You, bob, are going to be word girl's substitute at the ribbon cutting ceremony! 

[00:15:13]


[Awk] substitute. You know, my replacement! We'll dress you up like word girl, and you can go to the ribbon cutting instead of me. 
[Whimpers] you won't have to say or do anything. Just show up, smile for the cameras, and come home. Everyone will think you're really word girl! I think. 
[Squeaks] hmm. Good point. You are very small. Here! Just hand them this note, and you'll be fine. 
[Squeaks] ok. Fine. Here's an emergency distress button. Only press it if there's an emergency. 
[Squeak] a real emergency. Have fun being my substitute! I've got a debate to get to! 
[Whimpers] ok. Well, there she is! You know, we were just about to replace you with someone else. Replace me? I don't need a substitute. I'm here, and I'm prepared to debate. Greetings, ms. Botsford. It is indeed an honor. Likewise, mr. Ming. May the best argument win. Okey dokey! Let's get this meeting of the woodview elementary debate club underway. Now is anyone here for the very first time? Anyone? Well, I'm not a mind reader, but I bet some of you are wondering, "ms. Davis, why is your skin so smooth, and what exactly is a debate?" What does the word debate even mean? I'll inform them! Of course you will. When two people with different ideas explain why their idea is the best, it's called a debate. Today, scoops and I will each try and convince you that our animal would make the best mascot for the debate club. At the end, we'll take a vote, and the animal with the most votes will be our new masc! Becky botsford, you make my job so easy. Now let's begin! Becky, which animal do you want to be the new club mascot? I think our new mascot should be the majestic unicorn. And scoops? I have chosen a different animal, the industrious armadillo. Ok. We'll start with... Becky. Ahem. Fellow debate club members, allow me to tell you why I believe the unicorn would be the best mascot for the debate club. 

[00:17:24]


Narrator: Over at the grocery store, word girl's... Substitute arrives for the ribbon cutting ceremony. Word girl? You look a little... Different. Oh. A letter. Well, I'll read it. "Dear everybody, please forgive me "for being so quiet and tiny. "I seem to have lost my voice while shouting at evildoers, "and I am, for some reason, feeling short today. Sincerely, I am really word girl and not just a substitute." That letter put me at ease! Thanks for the explanation, word girl. So glad you could be here to celebrate the grand opening of aisle 11! 
Narrator: Meile, across town, all the city's villains have gathered for their annual villain convention. And so let there be no debate, discussion, or argument that i, lady redundant woman, am the best, greatest, and supreme choice for villain association president! Um, can anyone tell me what's missing from this year's villain convention? Could it be there's no snacks?! Yeah! No snacks! What's up with that?! Why no snacks? Whose job was it to bring the snacks? 
[Indistinct chatter] oh. Heh. My bad! My fault! I am to blame! I completely forgot I was on snack duty this year. Won't happen again. I guarantee. I vow. Ha! A promise is no substitute for snacks! Ohh! Well, are yogonna go get some snacks or what?! I'll be back in a flash, in the blink of an eye, in no time flat! 
Narrator: Back at the ribbon cutting... So let me welcome you to aisle 11, featuring ice cream and pickles! And a special thanks to word girl for lending some of her super-celebrity for today's event! 
Lady Redundant Woman: Ok, everybody, this is a robbery! A stickup! A heist! Get ready to give me all your snack food! The villains are hungry! Bring me 3 of everything! Word girl! Help me! They're about to steal all of my food! 

[00:19:39]


[Customers screaming] 
[beep beep beep] 
Narrator: Back at school, the debate is heating up! Furthermore, they are special, one-of-a-kind creatures that cannot be replaced. There is no substitute for the unicorn. Therefore, it must be our new mascot! Thank you. 
[Applause] ha ha ha! Becky, I am afraid I must disagree. The armadillo is by far the better choice. Did you know that, when threatened, armadillos roll into a ball to protect themselves? Armadillos are clearly better. Are armadillos magical, and do they have princesses for friends? I don't think so. Well, maybe not, but they do have armored shells, which are awesome! I-- oh, no! Not now! The debate's not finished! 
[Screaming] here's another reason armadillos should be our mascot. They make funny sounds when they eat. What am I hearing? Um, wow. That electric pencil sharpener I was holding sure did just suddenly and dramatically malfunction, didn't it? Maybe I should go find a substitute so we can all keep our pencils sharp! Ugh. Got to work on my excuses. Carry on with the debate! Should I keep going? I'm shrugging. Why aren't you doing anything, word girl?! This is criminally ridiculous! What's that you were saying? You got your voice back! Wait a minute. Did you just get taller? I was just about to ask you how you got shorter. How could I have suddenly gotten shorter? You were just a tiny, little-- there's no time to debate the issue. I've got crime to fight. Huggy! 
[Squeaks] look at you-- yochanged outfits! 
[Squeak] that's right! You did substitute one costume for another. Nice vocabulary. Now let's get to work! You stop the copies from leaving the store. I'll deal with lady redundant woman! Hmm. Do I want lemon-lime, or lime-lemon? Oh, I'll treat myself and get both! You'll get neither, lady redundant woman! Word girl! Did you get taller? Bigger? Larger? Uh, that--that's not important. What is important is you putting all this food back. No can do, sister. I've got a convention hall filled with villains who are hungry for snacks, and no pint-sized pontificator is going to stand in my way, block my path, or interrupt my progress! Huggy! Arms of steel! Like me, you're probably wondering how long can my monkey sidekick hold on to those automatic doors? Not long, I hope. Go, girls! Keep pushing. Do you hear that siren, lady redundant woman? It sounds like the police, the cops, the local law enforcement. What do you want from me? Wish from me? Desire from me? What do you want? I want you to pay for the food you're taking. Oh! Is that all? Well, here's some money, cash, moolah. Why, this is exactly enough to pay for all the food! No problem, officers she's all paid up! Well, if we're all done here, I should be getting back to my convention, my gathering, my meeting. Not so fast, lady redundant woman. The food may be paid for, but the store is still a mess. Oh, well no problem! I'll just make some copies-- whoa, whoa. Hold up. You can send a substitute to the convention. You'll be here cleaning up this mess all by yourself. Huggy, keep an eye on her. I've got important business to attend to. Word up! Am I too late?! Is t debate over?! Ok, now it's time to vote! Everyone who agrees with scoops that our mascot should be the armadillo, raise your hand. Yeah! Wow, scoops. You must have given a convincing speech. Armadillos are my passion. 18, 19...7! And everyone who agrees with becky that our mascot should be a unicorn, raise your hand. Whoo! You have chosen wisely. Two and two, subtract one. That's 7! It's a tie! A tie? What does that mean? I don't know. I'll check the club rule book. Let's see. "It should be chosen by the teacher in charge." Who knew? I get to pick the new debate club mascot. Well, what animal are you going to pick? Unicorn. Pick unicorn. Armadillo. Pick armadillo. Ok, everybody. Settle down. I've made my decision. The new debate club mascot is... The magic turtles. The magic turtles? What's a magic turtle? It happens to be a combination of a unicorn, which is magical, and an armadillo, which has a shell. Magic turtle. That's a terrible mascot! There are so many reason why unicorns are better than magic turtles. I disagree with this decision, and here's why-- how do we know armadillos don't already have magical powers, huh? Fine, but how do we know that unicorns don't also sometimes have a shell? But if they had a shell... 

[00:24:47]


Narrator: And so with becky, scoops, and ms. Davis debating the substitute mascot, we come to the end of another fantastic episode of "word girl"! handsome, and this is the bonus round of... "May I have word?" Our returning champion will have a chance to play for even greater prizes on the bonus round! Emily, you correctly defined the word shatter. You ready to play the bonus round? You bet! Great! Take a look at these 3 pictures and tell me which one shows the definition for shatter. Give it a shot, emily. I'm gonna go with number one. Mr. Big's golf club has clearly shattered a hole in the window. That's correct! You're our bonus round winner! Show what she's won, huggy! An official "word girl" tub of chocolate pudding. S-save some pudding for me! That's our show! See you next time on... "May I have a word?" city doom. She crushes villains' evil plans with one swift move. And she still has time to play with her unicorn collection! Watch "word girl" only on pbs kids go! Word up! larry's warehouse! I'm uncle larry, and I deliver the best prices, the best! The most variety... The most! And the biggest bargains on the furniture you want for you lair! We know you love sitting on your sofa in your mom's basement, but are you comfortable?

SHEEP: Ooh, or a balloon. 
(gasps) 
SHEEP: Or the moon. Ooh! Ooh! Ah... Hold on there just one minute! He's adding another letter! He is? You're right. He's adding the letter "L" to go with the "oo." That makes "ool." Oh, oh, let-let me see, Sheep.

BOTH: Hurray! 
NARRATOR: After a fun day of playing together, Sheep and Whale settled down for a good night's rest. Good night, friend. Good night, friend.

Oh, uh, it's not the tub. It's you. Oh, you've grown again, Whale. Oh, well, uh, w-w-we need something bigger to put you in.

(breathing heavily): Oh! Okay, let's build that tank. T-ank. 
KIDS: Tank! Yes! Tank. Last one in is a rotten egg. One. Two. 
BOTH: Three. Whoo-hoo! Ah... (laughs)

(croaks) What's going on, Sheep? Frog, this is Whale. Whale, this is Frog. Pleased to meet you. Well, uh, Frog, no matter what I put Whale in, she just grows right out of it! Um, I'm sorry, Sheep, but Whale is just too big to be put in anything. What we really should do is bring her back to the ocean where there's plenty of room for her to swim. But... What? But Sheep's my best friend. And Whale is mybest friend. It's really the only solution. 
WHALE & SHEEP: Okay.

>>Neil: IT IS A PARENTS' WORST Nightmare, a gunman opening fire on a kindergarten class in connecticut at an elementary school. 27 are dead. 20 are children. Six adults. And the shooter. Welcome, weres I am neil cavuto. Today, newtown, connecticut, is if a state of shock because the unthinkable happened. A mass shooting at sandy hook elementary school. Here is what we know. There are conflicting reports over the exact identity of the shooter. We told the suspect's brother is being questioned. Officials say his mother was found dead in connecticut. The father's body was found in new jersey. There are separate reports up to four weapons possibly involved including a rifle and two automatic weapons. The president visibly shaken by today's attacks. >> The majority of those who died today were children. Beautiful little kids between the ages of five and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them, birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the following were also teachers and men and women who devoted their lives to help our children fulfill their dreams. >>Neil: NOW THE LATEST FROM Newtown, connecticut. Rick? Rick: The governor of connecticut was here a short time ago and called this a 

[00:02:00]


tragedy of unspeakable terms that youanever be fully prepared for. Remember, this happened over six hours ago. There is a lot of evidence still being processed. The crime scene is still very active. Other scenes are now investigated, including the home of shooter's movie where an adult body was found and other residents in new jersey with conflicting reports of the status of the shooter's father and conflicting reports on the shooter himself. What we are told at this hour is that the shooter is 20-year-old adam lanza and his 24-year-old brother was taken into custody and questioned but that ryan at this point is not a suspect. We are told the shooter was adam, he had two weapons including an assault rifle and a 10 millimeter glock and he answered the school where the more was a teacher and began firing. Police got 9-1-1 call. Local police sowed up and called in the state police. Unlike columbine where the officers waited outside the hospital, in this case the officers immediately entered the school, searching if adults and children they could bring out to safety and that is exactly what they d they went in that school, the police say they found two rooms in the school in one area of the school where the victims everyone located. 20 children two of them transported to a local hospital and died in the hospital and 18 children found dead inside the school along with six adults including the shooter and there is another adult they found in another location here in sandy hook. So, a very, very difficult situation. A crime scene that will take days to process and a lost questions remain unanswered. What we are told is the shooter's mother was a kindergarten teacher and the shooter went to the mother's classroom and shot the kids in the classroom as well as five 

[00:04:01]


other adults in the school and kill -- six other adults in the school and killed himself. We are continuing to get information on this and putting it together. >>Neil: THANK YOU. It is 60 miles east of fork city, in fairfax county, one of the richest counties in new york. It looks like something out of reader's digest. A community as immunity would seem to violence as any community in america. But today front and center the latest act of violence in america, the shooting, today, are the second biggest attack on an american educational institution since virginia tech in 2007 when 32 were killed. Former homicide detective, rod, what do you make of this? >> What I can tell you and the viewers is what the police are doing. What we would do if an investigation, horrific investigation like this, trying to figure out what was the motive behind this suspect's actions. Why the children? That is the question. The other question as investigators, where did he get the weapons in we will find that out the next day or two. Where did he get the ammunition? Why did he target this school? This is a very fluid investigation and there are several agencies right new. I got off the phone with the contact in connecticut that tells me that the forensic laboratory has been called in. There are several agencies investigating this case right now and we are trying to f out why this school, why this suspect, and what the correlation is between this guy and the school. We know his mother worked at the 

[00:06:01]


school but what about the other people. Also, whether or not there are more victims. That has not been said whether they may or may not find other victims. So they are interviewing family members of the suspect and they are also beginning out with search warrants right now as i speak into areas which we know this guy has been just to make sure there are no other victims. >>Neil: WHEN THEYO AND TREAT The school as a crime scene, wh are they looking for? >>Guest: WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING For specifically, an excellent question, what type of question does this guy use? What time of ammunition did he use? Did he target any of the children or the adults specifically? A lost times in these situations an individual will start out with one target and he will wine up if he has the appear in addition shooting several people we trying to find out if he targets one. Somebody or something ignited this guy. Either today or yesterday. It seems like someone ignited this guy yesterday because it seemed like it was a mapped shooting but when I talk to my sources he was ready. I am not sure if he had this planned out or was this a respond attendous event? Those are the questions we are trying to find out right now. >> You know, his brother, ryan, who was originally identified as the shooter maybe because adam had something indicating he was ryan on him, but, that brother is now in police custody in new jersey. What are authorities trying to get out of him if he were not an accomplice, what are they trying to learn? >> It is not unusual for family members to be thought as being a person that committed an act when another family member did 

[00:08:02]


it. That happens often. The rope the police are talking to his brother is because those people that are close to the shooter, the closest to the shooter, whether he had a girlfriend, other family members, his brother, cousins, those are the folks that they will get information from and they trying to get as much information as they can as fast as they can. Keep in mind, we still don't know if there are other victims out there so this will we interview everyone and anyone associated with this shooter, we won't have those answers. Over the next hopefully 12 to 24 hours we will have more answers coming forward. >>Neil: IS THAT WHY YOU DON'T Remove bodies from a crime scene? >>Guest: YOU ARE RIGHT. We don't. Now adays, I have been if law enforcent a long-term we used to remove bodies quicker. There is no need to remove quickly if there are no survivors because of forensics, we get better information if we leave the bodies there and let the experts come in. >> What a horrid crime scene. When you step back and lock at this and we will go in more details with psychologists and folks like that, people talk about the pick up if violence whether it is the shopping mall a couple of days ago or at the theater in aurora or columbine before that, and just not in america we have seen shootings, horrible shootings in scandinavia and republic of georgia, in fact, in scandinavia, 50. What I am asking, what the heck is going on? >>Guest: WELL, HERE IS THE Reality. Law enforcement know that the situations appear to be increasing and there are a number of reasons. I will leave that to the viewers decide why they thing they are 

[00:10:03]


increasing. I am here in mnesota today teaching a court just this morning on actions of children in a school system because we realize just today I was speaking when one of the students said there is a shooting going on in connecticut. I am not surprised. We as a nation, we have to come up with a policy that addresses the membership tall ill, not the guns but the mental millness and get to the bottom of it. How long have we been talking about there? For years. We know this is a reality. We have to deal with it. >>Neil: WE HAVE TO STOP Meeting like this but thank you for your expertise. Now a psychologist, doctor, why so much of there and why we are seeing more this or appear to. Are we? >>Guest: IT SURE SEEMS LIKE It. This is as bad as it gets. The children, my office this morning has been overwhelm by calls from parents in los angeles traumaized by this because we all identify with the kids. When you look at the numbers, i have to say it is so many factors. You have the breakdown of values. You have the breakdown of structures that held us together. Morally, spiritually, too many factors to talk about. The officers' point was important, when people are more educated about what to look for in the mentally ill and those who have dark likes where you see the clues which will probably emerge, the more awareness everyone gets, we can all be helped by that. >>Neil: WHY KIDS, D DOCTOR, WHEN These incidents happen? 

[00:12:03]


Most these were kindergarteners. >>Guest: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT That all morning. In some ways it is one of those unanswerables. You can alwayssee a path. There is mental illness that can cause things like this. There is horrible life stories but the reality is not everyone who is mentally ill commits an act like this. Not everyone abused as a child does this. This is a line of the heart or the soul or their spirit that some people go one way and others go the other. The big thing is we do know the great themes of isolation and powerlessness in individuals' likes sow this and we do as past we can in spotting that and trying to end them. If something looks year, call someone. >> Doctor, thank you very much. >> On the day you cannot make sense of stuff, many of the kindergarteners and other young kids who were killed in the tragedy were participating in the school's annual holiday christmas performance and they are all dead. gifts easier. Well, having a ton of locations doesn't hurt. And a santa to boot! [ chuckles ] RIGHT, BABY. Oh, sir. That is a customer. Oh...Sorry about that. [ Male Announcer ] BREAK FROM THE HOLIDAY Stress.

>>Neil: WE ARE GETTING WORD Of a horrendous school shooting and you her the alleged shooter's mother and father were killed. The father could be very much alive. We will keep you posted. We want to let you know in 30 minutes cut account law enforcement officials are going to update the media on the latest. We know at this point of 27 dead in connecticut, 18 children, largely kindergartenersilled. Two additional children were transported to danbury hospital later pronounced dead. Sex adults including the school's principal dead at the scene. The shooter is dead, as well. Separately, an adult dead. That is, the assailant's mother is dead but, again, the reports that the father had been killed in new jersey may not be accurate. Reports are that the father is very much alive. Now stepping back to get a sense from former city mayor giuliani. Mayor, so much to put together. >>Guest: THIS IS HORRENDOUS And something it is hard to keep your emotions in check. All of us who are parents, a nightmare you live through, a quiet community, semi rural community, near the federal prison that I know well, danbury prison. This has to be a total complete traumatic blow to the community. You will not get easy answers, there are in easy answers. Anyone who tries to present easy 18s is ignoring the problem and to examine why it happened, is it happening more frequently, can we reduce it? Everyone has to be on the table, you cannot be an advocate or one social view or political view or the other. 

[00:18:38]


Is life deep in the human personality, the factors that indicate this, science has not figured out yet, we cannot predict this, you cannot see it with any kind of certitude but we have to look at if there are better ways to protect predict it and better ways to school the schools. He walked in at least in one case with a large weapon. How did that happen? Can you secure against this in what do we do about weapons? We should have a nonpolitical humble discussion. >>Neil: I HEAR YOU. >>Guest: EVERYTHING SHOULD BE On the table and everyone should have some humility that they don't have the antis. >>Neil: WHAT ABOUT, REMEMBER After columbine they put metal detectors in a lot of schools. We still had shooting. But it didn't stop virginia tech. >>Guest: HERE IS THE TRUTH. You could have haderfect security for the school and the children would be alive. But another group of children would be dead. A personality like this, it seems to me, will kill. If it 90 the kids in the school, it could be someone else. There are a lot of factors so there is not a simple solution and you cannot say just secure the schools. Then it will happen in a shopping center. You cannot say, it is guns. More people got skilled in scandinavia, the tightest gun laws. It is not just human behavior because we cannot predict human behavior. What I would like to see is for this country to discuss all of this with everyone laying aside their prejudice and what they are committed to the most and having humility. >>Neil: IF METAL DETECTORS IF Someone is going to kill a lot of people and that is their intent they will go through that. >>Guest: THERE ARE BETTER Answers. 

[00:20:38]


There are approaches to this and if all of us realize the enormity of this, the way we did september 11th where everyone put aside their usual political ideas and tried to seek a better answer, maybe we can reduce this. Finally, our hearts have to go out to the parents. These people being dealt a blow no one should have to go to. >>Neil: NOBODY.

Either killed himself or was 

[00:24:45]


killed by authorities. But they trying to find out what they can, not only from ryan lanza mself, what he might know about his brother, or whether there would be anything to incriminate either ryan or his brother at that locale. Trace has the very latest. Trace? >> Let me point you to the picture on the screen. Now we are told that the father reportedly was said to be killed inside the house and now authorities saying, no, the father is alive but there is someone who was shot and killed inside that house but ryan lanza would was thought to be the original shooter is very much alive. Even authorities admitted they were confused but now they have said what happened is, they switched the names. In fact, 20-year-old adam lanza is the shooter. Now, someone was killed in new jersey. We know that. And the mother was shot and killed if her home in newtown, connecticut, a teacher at the school. She was shot and killed and there are reports that the weapons that were used in the school shooting were registered to the mother. Police say that is when the 20-year old adam lanza want to the school, some witnesses say he may or may not be developmentally disabled and went to the school and was buzzed in the front door. The school was on lockdown. He was buzzed in with these weapons and he walked in the office and opened fire going after the principal. And the psychologist. And others in that office. It was during morning announcements so what happened while the announcements were being made the rest of the school, the students and the teachers could hear the violence and shots over the school intercom and the shooter went to a classroom and opened fire targeting the kids. We know the death toll is department children and sex adults. The shooter then turned the gun on himself the they have not said why the students may have been targeted and they do not 

[00:26:46]


know what the exact breakdown is, the numbers are confusing in the early going but we have gotten to the bottom of the shooter being 20-year-old adam lanza. Ryan is being questioned. We do not know the father is involved in this at all but he is alive. Someone is dead in hoboken, new jersey, and now we hear the girlfriend of ryan lanza is missing to add another twist to this. >>Neil: THANK YOU, TRACE. Also, correcting something i said earlier, there were semi automatic weapons found at the scene, not automatic weapons. That was high dad and they wrote it that way and I said automatic but they were semi-automatic weapons so my apologies. What do we make of that? >>Guest: IT IS A VERY COMMON Misnomer because the semi-automatics are so fast we are cutting hairs. We are talking about two assault rifles, bra -- brutal weapons. He was loaded for mass killing. He was very successful. >>Neil: THIS WAS CLEARLY IN Your eyes premeditateed, preexamined, prein the out. >>Guest: WELL-THOUGHT-OUT TO Make certain he had the bullet-proof vest on, on the outside chance as we talked at the homicide in the mall in oregon, that one could be armed that could shoot at him the he wanted to protect himself so he could finish this bizarre twisted mission. That is serious weapons he brought in. >>Neil: IN SOME OF THE SCHOOL Incidents I will take virginia tech out of it, and college 

[00:28:46]


kids, but in these incidents and not even in the united states but it happened abroad where there are very tough gun laws and why want to get if that debate, but, why kids in why target kids? >>Guest: I TALKED TO THE Mayor, the same ing came up and he brought up a great point. There is just, speculation, that such extraordinary suggestibility that is bombarding them every second with the way society has evolved in the last 15 years in temperatures of the medicinia, that maybe it has diminish the or minimized it, the violence, where it is almost like a video game. I theorize that. I am in this business 30 years and my very strong conviction, it is might their stuff. >>Neil: HE WIPED OUT ALMOST AN Entire class at a minimum reportedly these were students of his mother. >>Guest: CORRECT. >>Neil: WHAT DO YOU DO TO Prevent that in the future? When we covered the mall shooting, you said maybe we arm the security guards. What do you do in school? >>Guest: WE BRING SCHOOL Security at five elementary schools, 50 miles from here. A middle school. Also, one high school. We took over this assignment we changed the fans. We put in nypd police captain in charge and all armed ex-nypd here. The interesting thing is the problems are generally at the schools at the elementary school because of custody cases and biological parents and that is where the crowe will door. They had a protocol in place a buzzer, visitor buzzing in system. That doesn't work. >>Neil: BUT IF SOMEONE IS Intent and you just go in there 

[00:30:46]


with guns blazing nothing will have a short lasting effect. >>Guest: I AGREE. The fact is those are gigantic rifles. They came in the building, one guy, with two very large rifles. You can hide the handguns. It could have been stopped by the appropriate security. Forget the metal detector, someone who is armed and trained with the experience to stop them dead in his tracks, let him go to the maker and little the kindergarten kids go to milk and cookies. >>Neil: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. We do know that 20 children are not going to go for milk and cookies. Are not going to eneye christmas. Their families are not, either. For a town that was part of a community as rich as all get out, in a county among the most prized in the nation, it happened. Again. We are waiting to hear from local authorities how it went down.

>>Neil: A TENTATIVE TIMELINE On today's horrific events in connecticut are to be believed it all started with the shooter having a major beef with his mother and killing her. We go to sandy hook, connecticut, where molly has more on that part of the story that triggered the rest of the developments. Mo >>Reporter: YES, WE ARE AT A Secondary crime scene. The school is where most of the activity throughout the day has occurred. This is the area where the mother lived, nancy is believed to be a victim, that diein the horrific slew of activity. This is upper middle-class neighbor a quiet neighborhood, particularly today. They still have the street secured. No one is allowed to get down to the home where the scene is. There is, that is where one of the bodies was found, a body has been found at this location and authorities are not saying who it is, but officials are saying that nancy has passed away throughout the course of the day. >>Neil: MOLLY LINE, THANK YOU Very much. And peggy's daughter, marjorie, survived column bin shooting that electrified the nation, our first large awakening of large-scale violence at a school. Peggy, how are you doing? >>Guest: WELL, THIS IS A REAL Hard day for us, our hearts are broken for these pple. They were just babies. >>Neil: YOUR DAUGHTER SURVIVED The columnbine shooting. >>Guest: SHE STRUGGLES TO THIS Day. It was terrible for our family and a lot of those kids although they were older did not survive well. My own daughter dropped out of high school after that. >>Neil: HOW OLD WAS SHE? 

[00:37:40]


>>Guest: SHE WAS 16. >>Neil: NOW, A LOT OF THE Victims, many of the victims were kindergarteners so that makes them five or six. Some were older, we understand. We do nut have a break down. Different for them? What do you think...Your daughter's experience, what are their family members have to lack out for? >>Guest: WELL, THEY HAVE A Long road ahead of them and they should seek help for their own selves and their children as soon as possible because I know from my own situation, I didn't realize it would be such a long road. The real nightmare is after all the dust settles. My child had nightmares, flashbacks, her best friend killed herself, there was a lot of tragedy after the columbine shooting and when there is a shooting we hear in littleton, it all comes back. >>Neil: HOW IS SHE DOING NOW? >>Guest: SHE IS ABLE TO IT IS In a classroom but it took many years. Many years. She is very affected today by all of this. >>Neil: AMAZING. Thank you very much. You can just imagine all the parents who are going to go through that, parents of much young are children, more impressionable children, children who should not be seeing anything like this at this time of career no less, to former arkansas governor, mike huckabee. I will try to tap the reacher in you the man of god in you who can help us with this. >>Governor Huckabee: THERE Is no human rationale or explanation the I was governor in 1998 on march 31 when the jones bother school shootings happened and it is one those

days I start reliving all over again today. When I hear that mother talk one of the things people will not fully comprehend every television camera in the world will descend upon newtown, connecticut, over the weekend and the next several days and they will all leave and cover something else. All these people will still have the scars, emotionally and many them physically, if years to come. Right now, what is very harmful is so much attention but so little valid information. It was so frustrating to me and other officials because so many people were speculating what happened, who did it, why did they do it, and we don't know those things. I do believe that one of the most important things to do at this point is to take it very, very calmly, and slowly, but the biggest aftermath of something like this, people are going to look for, okay, why did it happen? The answer is inexplicable. What do we do to stop it in you can take certain measures and i think your previous guest had a lot of great ideas which is very important. Ultimately you can take every gun away in america can someone ll use a bomb when someone has an intent to do incredible damage they will find a way. In the case of jonesboro, an 11 and 12-year-old kids who gunned down their classmates and teachers after they had got them in a school yard by setting off a fire alarm where they were trapped in a fenced area and could not get back in. They were sitting ducks. The question, how can an 11 and telephone-year-old do this? No one can understand how that can happen and people will want 

[00:41:43]


to pass new laws but unless you change people's hearts or transition to the pastor side, this is a heart issue. Laws don't change this. >>Neil: PEOPLE ASK AFTER Tragedies like this, how could god let this happen. >>Guest: IT IS AN INTERESTING Thing. We ask why there is violence in our schools but we remove god from our schools. Should we be so surprised schowould become a place of can -- carnage? We make it a place where we do not want to talk about life and what responsibility means, accountability, we will not just be accountable for the police but we stand one day before a holy god in judgment. If we don't believe that, we don't fear that. When people say, why did god let it happen, god wasn't armed. He didn't go to the school. God will be there in the form of a lot people with hugs and therapy and a lot of ways in which he will be involved in the aftermath. Maybe we ought to let him in on the front end and we would not have to call him to show up when all is said and done at the back end. >>Neil: WE ARE STATE WAITING To hear from authorities on the scene, the very latest news on the tragedy that now ranks second to the virginia tech killings back five years ago, 32 were dead then. 27 dead today. ..

GEICO. 15 minutes could save you 15 % or more on car insurance. Someone get me a latte will ya, please? >>Neil: THE POLICE UPDATING US On the latest must bees and details on the tragic shootings. A former detective security expert joining us on the phone, detective, what do you look for at this crime scene? If you went to the school, what would you look for? >> You are looking for everything. You want to be careful not to disturb the crime scene. That will be a crime scene for hours, days, and maybe weeks. You are looking for the point of 

[00:47:08]


entry. Ammunition. Weapons. Whether there were notes or communications at the scene. The barrier. Placement of the bodies. Everything you can find on a crime seen. >>Neil: WHEN WE HAVE A SCENE With so many killed and we know that the shooter was armed for bear with a number of semi-automatic weapond he came with the intent to take out a lot of people, with these weapons it does not take a lot time to do that. >>Guest: IT DOESN'T. The other thing that is clear to me, this was a well-thought-out, planned attack, an ambush, by this kid. He had a bullet roof vest on. He had the ammunition. He had the armor, everything to ambush the poor innocent children and that tells me he had planned this for a long-term, no question. >> I asked this earlier and i wasn't trying to be flippant why in so many school shootings particularly those involved to very young children, in this case kindergarteners, why children? The most innocent among us in essence who is more defenseless than children? I have been if law enforcement investigation if 35 years, plus. There is no group, children just cannot defend themselves. Unfortunately, we have bullies, people like this kid, who go out here and take full advantage of that. >>Neil: THESE INCIDENTS ARE Getting to be too frequent and many will argue it is not just in america but everywhere. Is there something to that? Either we are desensitized 

[00:49:10]


society or those who take it to this level, this bizarre a provide length level, a pattern? >>Guest: THAT IS THE QUESTION. I did an interview on the shooting of the theater, the joker, the give with the red hair, unfortunately, there is someone, and place, planning something similar if not bigger and better. Unfortunately, it is a fact, someone is sitting somewhere right new planning something better and bigger than this. >>Neil: AMAZING, BUT, Actually, I think you are right.

@ >> Neil: All right. We're waiting for authorities in newtown, connecticut, to update us on what they know and what they can possibly tell us. Rick leventhal there with the latest as well. Rick? >> Reporter: Neil, as you said, we're waiting for update from the connecticut state police, regarding any additional information they can give us about the horrific shooting that happened earlier 

[00:53:40]


today at the sandy hook elementary school in sandy hook, which is inewtown, connecticut. Confirmed 26 people were found dead inside that school. Were killed in that shooting. 18 children dead in the school. Two died at the hospital. Six adults found dead inside the school, including the shooter who we are told now by federal law enforcement sources is 20-year-old adam lanza. Initially people identified the shooter as 24-year-old ryan lanza. That is adam's brother. Apparently, adam may have been carrying ryan's i.D. And that's why there was confusion initially. We're told that the shooter was adam. His brother is now being questioned by authorities in hoboken, new jersey. We're told adam's mother was killed and a body was found inside the parent's home in newtown, connecticut. It's unclear who that body is. There were reports that the father had been killed but we can't confirm that. A swat team went to the house to execute a search warrant. They went through the door and then they immediately backed out because of concerns about possible boobbytrap. They sent in a robot and the robot identified a body inside the house. Crime scene ongoing, and investigation is ongoing. They're still continuing to try to recover the fred that home. Still at that school, neil, because the bodies are inside. A lot has to be processed, photographs, diagrams made before they begin removing bodies from the school. >> Neil: If you could hang on, we are getting word from the white house that the president canceled the planned trip wednesday to portland, maine. No doubt in light of the developments. On what authority are looking for? They know the shooter. 

[00:55:41]


They know he is apparently first went after his mother. He kne enough at the school to target presumably her class. I see it's beginning. I see it's beginning. >> I wou like to give you an update, briefing on some additional details. Hopefully you can answer some of the questions that you may have. Again, as I stated before. Is angoing criminal investigation. We are limited as to some of the details we can give out to you for of course reasons. First, let it be stated that i told you the number of deceased in the building at the hospital, secondary crime scene. It's the policy and protocol we have to establish positive identification of those victims. That is a time consuming process and something that will take time. The medical examiner arrived at the scene. Thigh will expedite that and get that done as quickly as possible. The families have been assigned a trooper and officer in communication. That was done to ensure the families they have constant communication with thegoing investigation. And they won't have to sit and watch television news or anything else. They will be the first to know. Any of the progress made as the investigation continues on. Has I sated earlier, the assets utilized when the call came in, newtown police department called for help, with local agencies and the officers and the police off duty and on duty troopers to respond so it can immediately gain asset to that beginning to begin the search process i alluded to before. We had the tactical team, we had trooper 1 in the air. 

[00:57:42]


Probably keep your helicopters away frank. We had every possible asset came out to this scene. The minute this alarm came in, this call came in to protect life and property. The community has been outstanding to support the effort. You have taken over the park. They are showing up an offering condolences. Doing everything they can to support the victims, the families of the horrific tragedies. The f.B.I. Crisis management team offered to respond and is going to respond through tomorrow for assisting in crisis management and assist with the families and the families members but the first responders, the police, fire, ems. Working what I described as a horrific and difficult sce. Local mental health crisis intervention team had been on scene. Had been here all of today working and assisting helping. I want to make it clear, 18 children were pronounced dead at the scene. Two children were transported to area hospital or pronounced dead at the hospital. Six adults pronounced dead at the scene. Also the shooter was also pronounced dead at the scene. I don't have much more detail about the secondary scene b there is a related scene that we discovered as we continue the criminal investigation; specifically, investigating the shooter. You probably saw and someone asked about the bomb squad. Yes, we brought all of our assets in in case they were needed. When we went out to search, we took the assets with to us ensure they were right there immediately so we could refact necessary. That is all I have as far as 

[00:59:44]


the details are concerned. I want to give you one more briefing, probably just before 6:00 try to get back up here for one more briefing. I'll take brief questions but there are certain things we
