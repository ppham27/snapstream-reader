[Music] [narrator:] A taste of history is made possible by dietz and watson, premium meats and artisan ses. At dietz and watson, we're proud to share a passion for great food and american history. Dietz and watson: Expect the best. And by sandal's resorts. Celebrating 30 years of romance. Sandals: The luxury included vacation and burpee.Com. Find seeds, live plants, flowers and how to videos at burpee.Com. [Walter:] this is the officers' kitchen of pigeon island. This is one of the big forts in a very important, strategic location where they defended st. Lucia. Exceptional meals were prepared for the officers, for the british navy. So let's go to our kitchen today and meet my guests. [Music:] [walter:] chantal. [Chantal:] Hi, walter. So nice to see you again. [Walter:] Let me tell you something, spectacular day we have here. Couldn't be better. Hey, chef, how are you? Look here. We have an aggressive menu today, but we'llstarting off with the first dish, we're going to make a chicken curry that we're going to serve with dahl puri. I'm lucky to have a chef today that is from mauritius in the indian ocean. And he's going to show me his secret family recipe for this very unique chicken curry. And how luck has it, I have chantal here and she's going to make the connection between india, st. Lucia and what we're making today. Well, chef, let's start cooking. You might wonder why this chicken has his head on it and his feet: Because in the 18th century, never ever would the chicken come like we get them today at the grocstore. Got it? They always come like that. So what 

[00:02:00]


I'm going to do right now is, cut out this chicken for chef. When I worked in india, I had many occasions to work with the local people and what was interesting is they leave the feet and the neck and the bones into the curry. No necearily to eat it, just for additional flavor. The most important pa is that you cut it small enough so that the curry and the seasoning can penetrate into it. That's the important part. Here we go: Chef, you can start putting your seasoning into it. Chantal, I am sure you had your share of curries, living here in st. Lucia, I'm sure. [Chantal:] Absolutely walter. And I grew up with my grandmother who was indian so on many occasions i woke up to the smells of spices, of burnt curry, etc. Hovering in the kitchen, every household you go into, every restaurant you go to, the flavor is slightly different because of the french seasonings that are added to it. [Walter:] I chopped up the chicken like I said you do this before. Chef is going to include the spices. Tell us what you put in as you put it in. [Chef:] ginger; garlic. [Walter:] It's a ginger, garlic combination. Now there are some secrets involved. But today we're going to unveil the secrets. So, ginger. [Chef:] Yep. [Walter:] marsala. [Chef:] that's a curry powder. [Walter:] Yep, curry powder. There you go. Looks so good already, doesn't it? [Chantal:] smells very good. Brings me back to my childhood. [Walter:] that's the idea. Hef:] That's the tandoori marinade. [Walter:] salt. Alright. Mix it up good. Today on the taste of history, I have a helper. Look at that, it's a little easier for me. You hold this, antal. And we're going to put this beautiful pot on our fire. Give it a couple minutes. One thing that most people don't realize, the amount of heat bush cooking gives you, it's what we call it down here, but it's just spectacular. And I just always think that it taste much better cooking it like that than any other way. Put a little oil in there. Look it how fast. Hold on to that. [Clanking:] [Sizzling:] [Chantal:] walter, this actually reminds me of when I was helping my grandmother in the kitchen doing this. This is fabulous. [Walter:] You're not calling me your grandfather, though. [Chantal:] No, I'm not. [Walter:] Chef, come and look. [Chef:] It's ready to add some onion, and garlic. [Walter:] Right, let's put onions in 

[00:04:01]


there. [Sizzling:] [Walter:] Boy, chantal, the smells of that, huh? [Chantal:] Oh, so good walter. [Walter:] I call this the smell of st. Lucia. Curry, curry and then curry. Right? [Chef:] That's ginger-garlic paste. Add some curry powder. [Light sizzling:] [Walter:] tumeric, little bit of brown sugar. Here we go. Stir it up good. So now we're going to top it off with water. Beautiful. The flavor is just spectacular. I can't wait until he makes the dahl puri though. Because that's. [Chantal:] When he finishes the dish. [Walter:] yes, absolutely beautiful. [Bird's chirping:] [walter:] So chantal, when I drive to town and I see a good amount of roti standing there, many years when I came here, I didn't realize that: Locals, leave the bones, on the meat. [Chantal:] That's the best part of the chicken! [Walter:] I do know that. But if you don't know it and the roti is camouflaged, it's not so simple. [Chantal:] No, the bones make the roti fabulous which is the best of part of eating a roti. [Walter:] you call it tomatoes, I call it tomato. Chantal, you're going to steal this from me in a little bit, okay? [Chantal:] sure. [Walter:] just pretend I'm your grandmother. [Chantal:] that will be very hard to do, walter. [Walter:] so, we're almost ready. Imagine that? Look how amazing it smells. I want you and I to try it while chef's holding the curry under, to make sure it's okay on the salt and all the other spices are perfect. [Chantal:] Oh my god! It tastes fantastic. High five walter. Wow this is awesome! [Walter:] You did good. Let's put the coriander in. [Chef:] Coriander. [Walter:] Oh yeah, nice heat to it. Beautiful. Like chantal 

[00:06:01]


said, everyone makes a curry, whether it's a curry chicken, a curry goat, curry conch, but not too many people, make it with dahl puri. [Chef:] so you have regular flour. [Walter:] All purpose flour. [Chef:] Yeah, baking powder. [Walter:] Baking powder. All right. [Chef:] Tumeric powder. [Walter:] tumeric. [Chef:] Salt. [Walter:] All right. [Chef:] A bit of oil. Now we need water. Some water. I making the dahl puri dough. Just need some more water to take out the flour. [Walter:] You just got to make sure that you have enough liquid in there so the dough is manageable, like any dough you make. Think of a pasta dough, it's a bit of the same thing. The lentils go in the middle of! The dahl. [Chef:] It's done to all hold together. [Walter:] So, his dough is perfect now. Now he's going to make it into a small bowl. [Chef:] And I'll stuff it with a dahl. [Walter:] watch that: That's why you buy it and I buy it, because this is too much work. [Chantel:] We're too busy for this stuff. [Walter:] Too much work. Take a look at that. This is how the lentils are raw, and this is how the lentils are cooked. [Chatter:] [Walter:] But this is what makes the flavor come in. [Chef:] And for the towel now. [Chantal:] okay, no problem. [Walter:] Don't burn yourself. A gentle rolling of that, something. Iyou push too hard, it will open up again and it comes out. Look it, how nice. You've done this a few times, haven't you? [Chantal:] Looks like it. [Walter:] the dahl puri master, here. [Sizzling:] [Walter:] You want a slow fire for that because too much fire will burn before it's cooked inside. So cook a little bit more. Alright, our spectacular meal is served. Thanks to the master dahl puri man. This is 

[00:08:04]


one thing I learned. In every time I cook, in different locations, I learn something that I take back home with me and I'll tell you, today what I'm taking back is the flavor of that curry because I have never, and I mean it, had a better curry than that. Thank you for sharing your recipe. And chantal, without you, god knows what would have happened. I couldn't have possibly managed without you. [Chantal:] Oh my god! [Walter:] So let's see this beautiful historic place that we cooked in today. [Music:] [Narrator:] In 1781 washington sent what remained of his beleaguered troops, for a surprise attack against british forces, stationed in yorktown, virginia. With the help of the french, continental soldiers surrounded yorktown, trapping lord cornwallace and his british troops in a siege. Cornwallace's only hope was from british ships arriving from st. Lucia. [Dr. Williams:] the fortress was important because it played a very crucial part in the revolution. The island was important because this was the key to the strategy of the whole eastern caribbean. The french had the big base next door to them now and the british wanted to capture st. Lucia from the french so that they can spy on the movement of the french base. The british took its ten best regimens to north america.6,000 men landed in the cove to the south. Overran the cove, and came and established themselves here. So between 1778 and 1803, the british were here. The americans did not have a navy. Most of the fighting on the sea was done bthe french and actually, the battles of the american men took place in these waters. Not in american waters. [Narrator:] Two famous naval arch-rivals occupied these neighboring islands. On martinique. It was the ce de 

[00:10:04]


grass, the head of the french navy. And nearby on st. Lucia, it was british admiral lord rodney. These two expert seaman battled each other on the high seas for years. [Dr. Williams:] the importance of that was such that, once the french joined the war, britain moved its ten crack regiments to garrison this place. They captured it from the french and kept it throughout the war. The story is: Rodney used to go on top of that hill. He's sit there under that awning, looking for the french. They had this telescopbecause you can see the smallest boat leaving [walter:] Yes, right. [Dr. Williams:] you can see martinique right on the horizon. [Narrator:] but in august, 1781, rodney was in europe and missed seeing his arch-enemy, french commander of the fleet de grass, sail 28 ships of the french line, north from the caribbean. The french, in coordination with general washington, attacked rodney's british ships at the entrance to chesapeake bay. The larger french fleet badly beat the british who were forced to pull their ships back in defeat. Lord cornwallace had no option, but to surrender. The coordinated efforts of the american's and the french had paid off spectacularly, causing the final, decisive battle of the revolutionary war. It has been called the most important naval victory of the 18th century. [Dr. Williams:] and after that battle, they came to peace terms and american eventually got its independence but this was key to theystrategy of war on the sea during the ameran revolution. [Music:] [walter:] Amazing history here in st. Lucia. 7 times, occupied by the french, and 7 times by the english. Lucky for us, there is a lot of culinary prowess still left over from the french. 

[00:12:05]


Today we're making a typical st. Lucian one pot meal, which is called bouillon. And to help me execute this meal, is chef michael from sandals la toc. Chef. It's good to have you here. You know, we raised the bar earlier when we made this fantastic curry and the dahl puri. Now i got you here and we're going to show them how this dish is done. It's a simple dish but don't underestimate its simplicity. You got to follow directly. The dish we're going to make today, chef michael and i, together, can be made a couple different ways. And actually, a lot of people have improvised over the years and whatever they could find, kind of put into it. But it's done many times with pork but today we're going to put it in with beef. What's interesting about it is we all forget the 18th century didn't have refrigerators and freezers, what else have you, so salt curing was a very, maybe not only, one of the ways of serving it. Now this piece of beef, has been marinated in salt for three days. If you make this recipe at home, you're going to find out, if you have a five pound roast, when you salt it for three days, guess what? It only weighs 2 ? Pounds. The salt acts as a humidifier and a preservative. The way this dish works, you take the beef, you cut it up, you have already the stock and the fire. Mike is going to cut up the beef. I'm going to walk it over to our stock and mike is going to cut me some garlic, some carrots, some onion and today we found some beautiful okra this morning in the garden, so we're going to put some okra into it. Some people that I know and I know a lot of st. Lucians and I've eaten at their homes, also put plants into it. Like I said, whatever you like in this dish, you can put into it. All right mike, I'm going to put this into the bouillon. [Stirring:] [Walter:] we know this dish evolved from french cooking and obviously in french cooking you would have a fine breunoise but here, it's the 

[00:14:07]


heartiness of the one pot meal. So it's just a rough chop. It's a really delicious meal. You have kidney beans, you have carrots, you have onions, you have garlic, you got some seasoned peppers, there's plants in there. Today we found some okra in it. It's a delicious, delicious meal. And obviously in the end, it's the dumpling that makes this meal. So mike, how do you want the okra cut in your recipe? Just cut in half? [Mike:] Yeah. [Walter:] Onion, garlic, carrots? [Birds chirping:] [Walter:] Check on the kidney bean? Chef? Tested? All right, let's put the whole pot into our bouillon. All right. Remember, the officers would have a lot of hunger, here. Lot of soldiers here. All right chef, let's taste the stock. Remember, when you make this dish, you want to be very careful on the salt because the beef is salt cured. You want to really make sure that you don't put too much salt in it. Otherwise, it will be impossible to eat. Let's see here. Good flavor. Our bouillon is moving very nicely. Now comes the time to put the dumplings in there which is obvio something very unique. It's so simple because all it is, is flour, salt, and water. [Mike:] What we have here is: All purpose flour, and a cup of water, and then we're going to have a teaspoon full of kosher salt to it. Cup full of water to hydrate it down. [Walter:] As you see here, chef micel's very simple dough, you don't want to overwork it. [Mike:] just put it right here? Okay? You're just going to roll it out, single like a pasta. Now cut them up to one inch thick. Pretty much. [Walter:] I have some thyme, I'm trying to get some into the bouillon. Seasoning peppers. They look like a habanera, but 

[00:16:11]


they have no heat. That's why they're called seasoning peppers. They just have a lot, a lot of flavor. Add the meat into it, you get this extra distinctive flavor. The seasoning pepper goes in. Chef's going to put a little bit of the coconut milk over there, put a little bit into the fantastic bouillon. Seasoning peppers, and then the dumplings go in. Yep, it looks very good. Very inviting. Let's get a taste. Yummy. [Mike:] This pretty much comes from the roots of the african and the caribs and the arawak indians. [Walter:] And a little french. [Mike:] And the french. So, that's why you make it so unique. It's a different influence from a lot of caribbean island that we have here. [Walter:] the flavor is just beautiful. The colors in there. Unbelievable. Get one of your dumplings in there. Look at that. Let's take this opportunity to learn more about foods of st. Lucia. [M [walter:] En I was a child, growing up in the black forest, I'm used to the bananas, taken from st. Lucia. And here we are in a banana plantation. St. Lucian bananas are prized the world over. Cutting sugar cane is no easy work, as yoe. And here, I'm going to cut myself a piece. See I'm peeling it. [Peeling:] [Walter:] That is sweet. Once the sugar cane is harvested, then taken to extract the juice. [Music:] [Walter:] My friend the donkey did a lot of hard work so I can enjoy his beautiful, fresh squeezed, sugar cane is unbelievable. What a 

[00:18:17]


flavor. What an ingenuity the people had. Poor donkey, however. [Chopping:] [Music:] [Walter:] Oh boy. Beautiful. Lot of work but worth it in the end. Delicious. Very refreshing [music:] [Walter:] The story of chocolate begins right here in the rainforest of st. Lucia. [Music:] [Walter:] the cocoa beans are first fermented for 3 weeks. Then they are put on these beds to dry. When they are dried completely, then we got to take off the outer husk. By the way, they called it in the 18th century the cocoa dance. [Music:] [Walter:] the recipe i am making today is a banana fritter, but what's unique about the banana fritter is the glaze that I'm doing with the molasses with a little bit of curry and rum. It's a spectacular, spectacular dessert. I recommend you make it one day. You want to start off making a beer batter. What you want to use is all purpose flour, corn starch, little bit of baking powder and believe it or not, ice cold beer. Now today, we're using the local beer of st. Lucia. Called pitone. It's a beautiful, light lager, and all you want to do is whisk it under your flour mixture. The beer has to be extremely cold. It doesn't 

[00:20:20]


require any eggs, anything else that's binding. It's the corn starch and the all purpose flour that does the trick. You cut the banana about 2 inches. It's a nice size. We'll take a stirrer and stick it into the banana. [Pouring:] [walter:] You can cut them in half if you like. Now they don't take long at all but you got to make sure that you have ripe bananas. And all you want to cook it now to a golden brown. Look at that. Nice beer batter. So obviously I have my fritters over here but now, what makes this recipe sensational is the glaze I'm doing. There's two ways you can do the glaze: You can heat up the molasses or you can just use them room temp, which is even, sometimes better. So I have molasses in here. I have a little bit of curry. Well, not too much. Just a couple of pinches. Freshly chopped ginger, which is very important. We all know that rum, bananas and sugar, all likes each other. So this recipe now, asked for a good rum. I want to give it a taste. Make sure i have enough curry and not too much curry. Unbelievable. Little bit more curry, it could use though. Little bit more ginger. The dish is done. So simple. All you got to do now is put a little bit of the glaze over. Just a little bit. Okay. [Chantal:] Hey walter, I smelled something fantastic. I had to come join you to have some of this. [Walter:] let me tell you: This is all st. Lucia. St. Lucia bananas, st. Lucian beer, what can be better than that? [Chantal:] Nothing, walter. [Walter:] Try that. [Chantal:] That looks so good. [Walter:] It tastes fantastic. [Chantal:] It does. I'm speechless. And I'm not speechless very often, walter. [Walter:] I know that. 

[00:22:21]


[Chantal:] But this is so good. [Walter:] so we should rename this dessert. From now on, called bananas chantal. In your honor. No longer bananas walter. [Chantal:] ah, I'm melting and it's not because of the sun. [Walter:] Banana chantal, right here in st. Lucia. What a fantastic day i had, cooking in st. Lucia. Right here at this historical setting, of pigeon island. We srted off with a curry dhal puri. We made a one part bouillon and obviously the banana chantal to finish. Fantastic. Love you, st. Lucia. And you. [Music:] [Closed captioning:] A taste of history is made possible by dietz and watson, premium meats and artisan cheeses.

Something that happened yesterday, in springfield, ohio when president obama said this when talking about governor romney. Listen. 

[00:02:21]


>> At the time the republican congress, senate candidate by the name of mitt romney -- no -- voting is the best revenge. 
>> Reporter: Voting is best revenge. His campaign was asked about that. They said what he was talking about is the best way to battle back against the illusion and delusion that mitt romney is putting out there but he did give romney a gift to put an ad. What is the president really talking about here? What does he want people to vote for? Giving romney to contrast himself with the president. Listen. 
>> Yesterday the president said something you may have heard by now that I think surprised a lot of people, speaking to an audience, he said voting is the best revenge. He told his supporters, votin for revenge, vote for revenge? Let me tell you what I would like to tell you. Vote for love of country. 
>> We talk a lot about early voting here on the campaign trail and this election, it's particularly important in colorado where 50% of people have already cast their ballots.

[00:05:08]

The period for early voting is shorter this year than it was a year ago, just eight days this year. It was 14 days last year. Some county election officials have asked for an extra day sunday for early voting the so far the governor has said, no, it's not going to happen. This country, hillsborough has been a bellwether, they have gone with every presidential winner since 1960. They have a sense their votes could b extremely important in this election. 
>> Gregg: Are those lines mg pretty quickly, steve? Or do people expect to be able to cast their ballots before they close tonight? 
>> Reporter: The lines will stay open even after 7:00 p.M. Tonight if people are still in line. People did expect some delays because the ballot in florida is complicated. It contains at least 11 constitutional amendments. They knew it was going to be slow going and they are patiently, we've seen families carrying their children, people on walkers waiting patiently in the hot flori sun to get their chance to vote. 
>> Gregg: Steve live in tampa. Thanks. 
>> Heather: Amazing lines there. There are more concerns about possible voter registration fraud justhree days before the election. Two major cases specifically in the battleground state of ohio. Election officials citing registrations from an outside firm what acorn was accused of during the last presidential election. It is highlightg concerns about third party gounds that collect voter registration. Eric shawn has those details from ohio. 

[00:07:26]


>> Reporter: That voter registration investigation under way in ohio after adolf hitler was found submitted in a voter registration form. There are 200 names in the board of elections. They believe those names are fraudulent are forged or duplicates. The company that submitted those names, workers gathered those names is called field works. It's based in washington, d.C. A grassroots organization. They say they basically work with democratic candidates or progressive causes. The chairman of the republican party who is member of the election board there such voter fraud and voter registration fraud allegations undermine our democracy. 
>> Any pern would engage this that kind of conduct that serious toward democracy is highly irresponsible and potentially criminal. 
>> Reporter: He said they don't tolerate any fraud. They gave us this statement. We have an employee who has reviewed every single card. We categorize them that are possibly incomplete and others that could be potentially fraudulent. We have a high standard here. If they are not hundred percent sure of the card we will flag it to the board of elections. One of the fired field workers in cincinnati says that she didn't do anything wrong. She told us she bmes the people who tried to register. 
>> I probability would say, i was betrayed by some of the people. If you really didn't want to fill out the card you should have said no fill anything down on the card so they came back on me. 
>> Reporter: Also election brd officials in cleveland say there is an investigation underway i three other fired fieldworkers there. 
>> Heather: We want to make sure every vote counts and an election potentially this close down to the wire. Thank you, eric. 

[00:09:36]


>> Gregg: Fast moving developments how the obama nistration handled its response to the deadly terror attack on the consulate in libya. A growing chorus for a new committee to investigate exactly what happened as fox news has excluve information that the consulate considered suspending his operations in benghazi as the security deteriorated and considered actually moving it all to the c.I.A. Annex. Molly henneberg is live in washington with more. 
>> Molly: Information in the form of a classified cable reviewed by fox, sent to the state department about one month before the attack. Including both of those contingency plans you just listed and telling washington that the security situation is, quote, trending negatively and voicing concern over approximately ten islamic militias and al-qaeda training camps known to operate within benghazi. One republican congresswoman says the obama administration didn't pay enough attention to those warnings. 
>> This explains why they were talking about a spontaneous demonstration. Why the administration was blaming it on a video. If they knew if the word gotten out they had been explicitly warned in this emergency meeting and this cable went to everyone they decided to do nothing for americans, four americans died and that is what the american public needs to remember. 
>> Molly: Republican senators wanted congress to get more involved. Writing in a letter we believe colexity and gravity of this matter warrants the selection of this a a select committee that can make a review of the many national security officials ieshs involved. The obama administration and the president's campaign team insists the president is focused every single day on making sure we get to the bottom of what happened. They are waiting for an independent review of the attack to conclude. 

[00:11:43]


>> This is tragedy, this is not time for politicizing a tragedy as mitt romney and many republicans are doing. This is a time time for figuring out what happened. Releasing that information and learning from that and moving forward. That is exactly what the president is doing. 
>> Molly: State department is estimating that report will be finished sometime in december. 
>> Gregg: Molly henneberg in washington, thanks very much. 
>>> The stunning developments about the consulate attack keep coming hour by hour. We will be discussing this new information later in this hour withn bolton a former u.S. Ambassador to the united nations. 
>> Heather: Lights are coming on for some in new york city while others are learning it could be weeks before their power is restored. Mayor mike bloomberg on the latest recovery efforts and help cannot come soon enough for those living in hard hit areas of staten island. David lee miller is standing by with the very latest. 
>> Reporter: Let's start with conflicting information. There are reports at this hour that authorities have stopped the free distribution of free gasoline, gasoline from the department of defense that had been delivered to various parts of new york city by using tanker trucks and first responders were eligible to get that gas. I can tell you that here on staten island there is such a tanker truck and gasoline is being distributed to the general public as well as a separate line for first responders. At least here in staten island, free gasoline is available to the general public. Authorities say they have at least 36 hour supply of free gasoline on hand. Now, additionally, help has arrived here from the red cross, red cross has come under criticism for not getting to staten island soon enough. Y have a kitchen set up capable of producing 10,000 free meals a day. Additionally, they are helping each other here. A site has been established to bring supplies and clothing to people in need. One of the workers there told us one of the great concerns they face is that people who need help are afraid to leave their homes fearful of crime. Listen. 

[00:14:10]


>> Biggest concern for the residents they are afraid there is still no electric in the area when it gets dark, there are no lights. I know the police department has put up spotlights and doing the best they can. People are afraid to leave their homes because a lot of their homes are exposed. They are afraid of people coming into steal what little they have left. 
>> Reporter: Even though a great deal of more has been made restoring electricity to manhattan, here in staten island there are tens of thousands of people who are in the dark. Heather, unfortunately they are probably going to remain the dark for several days, possibly more than a week. One of the main reasons for that is they rely on overhead lines for their electricity. Getting crews here a very difficult task. 
>> Heather: Shame on those people that would take advantage of those people and loot and steal. 
>> Gregg: One of nation's newest battleground states is up for grabs in virginia. It could be key in winning the election. 
>> Heather: And polls so razor thin they are fighting for the magical number, 270 electoral votes, looking for the edge that would tip the balance. 
>> I learned this from the governor of massachusetts, as governor massachusetts that best achievement are shared achievements. Respect and goodwill go a long way and they are usually shared they come back to you, as well. That is how I'm going conduct myself as president. I won't just represent one party. I will represent one nation. ??????

>>> In four days, you have a choice to make although here in ohio early vote so you can be make it right after you leave here. It's not just a choice between two candidates or two parties. Its choice about two different visions for america. The choice between going back to the top down policies that crashed our economy, or a future that is built on a strong and growing middle-class. 
>> Most of you probably decided who you are going to vote for already. I know there are some people who are still wondering, they pitting aside the demands of daily life and thinking about who they a going to vote you. I need you spend time in the next three days to see neighbors and maybe ones that go by with obama signs, let's talk this through a bit. You see president obama came into office with so many promises that he has fallen so far short. 
>> Heather: That was president obama and governor romney speaking to crowds of supporters today. Just three days before the election. They are all making their final push on the campaign trail as the clock ticks down. Both candidates looking for the edge. Some sort of edge that will help pull them ahead in a hotly contested race. Editor for campaign and elections he joins us now. Thank you for joining us. We mentioned this already. It comes dwn to the magic number of 270 electoral votes. What does each party have to do to reach that magic number at the finish line? 
>> I mean at this point, this is really about, both campaigns really getting their get out the vote operations into full swing in the last couple of days. This is what the campaigns have been planning for logistically figuring out where they need folks. We have heard a lot of spin from both campaigns where the ground organization the strongest. Who has made the most voter contacts. Who has made the most quality contacts. What both campaigns going to be battleground states to try to get some of these undecideds to their candidate. A lot of this is about what is happening moment to moment on the ground and ensuring on the part of both campaigns that respected bases get out on tuesday and get folks early voting in the states where that is still possible. 

[00:22:19]


>> Heather: I want to talk more about that early voting. Steve require harry began were showing us, those votes will have won't be counted until election day but several battleground state are releasing the party affiliation how is early voting going to affect these final days as the campaigns move forward? There is no question, it's tremendously important. We're going to see 33-35% early vote this time around. You look at some of the key battleground states and the obama campaign likes to say it has the edge in early voting across the board. If you look at the full picture they do have a slight edge,ut state by state. Romney campaign is doing a lot better in early voting than say the McCain campaign was doing in 2008. That is significant. A state like colorado, for example, more republicans have early voted than democrats. In florida, democrats have the edge when it comes to early voting but not as big of an edge as the obama campaign had back in 2008. Early voting on the hole is going to skew to the side of the democrats. Republicans tend to been election day. It comes down to which twoud situation is humming on tuesday and which voters are really enthused. 
>> Heather: Romney has added another state into the mix, pennsylvania, hoping to end the streak of five contests where the democratic candidate prevailed and 10 percentage points in the latest polls show him with a slight edge over governor romney. How realistic is pennsylvania? 
>> I still think pennsylvania is a strep for the romney campaign. That being said, president obama and his campaign has spent the last week trying to convince everybody that the move into pennsylvania by the romney campaign is a complete head shake. I am not convinced how tough it is foritt romney. You notice that bill clinton will be in pennsylvania on monday. Aside from president obama the former president is the best surrogate his campaign has. Bill clinton is going to be in pennsylvania on monday, the fact that obama campaign has spent more moneyn television in pennsylvania suggest there is some concern that the race has pulled closer than the obama folks thought it it could would be. 

[00:24:54]


>> Heather: And storm sandy and jobseport. Last one that came out on friday? 
>> These are both hard questions. Simply because we've hevnhev an event like this speaking of sandy so close to a national election. How voters respond to the negativity and clamor of the campaign which as come back to full swing as to what has happened in new jersey, new york and connecticut, it's such an open question. It will be interesting to see how it plays out in terms of whether voters take that into account and think about that on tuesday. 
>> Heather: We appreciate your insight. 
>> Gregg: Becoming to the bottom of the terror attack in libya. New calls for an independent investigation as fox news gets exclusive new information raising more questions about the obama administration's handling of security concerns ahead of that attack. 
>> Heather: Plus president obama stirring up controversy in springfield ohio after the president called for, quote, revenge on election day. Potential impacted on the campaign trail. 
>> Vote, vote. Voting is th revenge. ] ?????? ??????

>> Heather: Welcome back. You are looking now at a rally that is under way in milwaukee, wisconsin. President obama speaking there to a crowd as we zero in on election day on tuesday. Let's pause for a moment and listen. 
>> That is what is at stake in this election. Yet change is future where we do it in a balanced way. Outside a trillion dollars more cuts. 
>> Heather: You can listen to the entire remarks on foxnews.Com where it is streaming live. Wisconsin is in play. Governor mitt romney choosing congressman paul ryan from wisconsin as his running mate kho ko change things there after more two decades since a republican candidate has won the state of wisconsin. President obama took wisconsin BY OVER4 POINTS over McCain in 2008. Once again, live from milwaukee, wisconsin, president obamand you can watch it in the entirety streaming live on foxnews.Com. At the time the republican congress, any senate candidate by the name of mitt romney, no, no, don't boo, vote. Vote. Voting is the best revenge. 

[00:32:00]


>> Gregg: President obama sparking outrage at a ohio rally telling supporters that voting is the best revenge, whatever that means. Its comment that governor romney took issue with while addressing supporters earlier today. 
>> He asked his supporters to vote for revenge, for revenge. Instead I ask the american people to vote for love of country. 
>> Mark sanford joins us, governor, great to talk to you. Voting is the best revenge, I'm not sure I know what that means or who voters are supposed to exact revenge against, it's an element of democracy as final appeals, what do you think of the remark? 
>> I got a feeling on this one. I think it's much to do about nothing. I say that for three different reasons. What strikes me you get to the end of these campaigns and media corps is worn out. So they are looking for any slight twinge or difference you got that as part of the recipe and incredible partisan nature of the campaign, you mention the guy's name and the crowd starts booing don't boo vote. Because if you look at this whole notion why peopleote, they don't vote for the idea of country generally. They vote for specifics they believe in. They vote for specifically they want to see something difference. 
>> Gregg: You can see revenge but romney hasn't done anything. He a private citizen, not holding office. President on the other hand, somebody could vote out of revenge. 

[00:34:07]


>> Yeah, isn't that the nature of today's modern day politics. It's the politics. I couldn't believe you can say that. It turns a lot of people off. At the core, romney would be well advis to go back to the economy and talk about the economy rather than side track like this. I think there is incredibly fertile ground particularly the job numbers. We're not keeping pace. The president hasn't delivered on that promise. I think it's much to do about nothing. He would do better on focusing on economy and jobs. 
>> Gregg: I am glad you mentioned that. Fox news poll this election hinges on the economy and little else, 75%aying, you know what, economic issues like jobs, fiscal issues like taxes those are the top issues we're going to vote the president if you look at those numbers, the president is underwater on those issues, 47-52%. Romney leads him 50-46% in a close race. Does that make the difference? 
>> I believe it does. I think the people vote their pocketbooks. I think they are absolutely distress order that front in terms of what comes next with regard to their prosz peculiarities for job at home in their hometown. So again, I say, the revenge thing, it's a side track. Forget it and move back to what people are really focused on which is jobs, economy, debt. 
>> Gregg: You convinced me. I'm over the revenge thing. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> Gregg: Moosts me to independents where you look at just about any poll and romne seems to lead anywhere among between independents among 5-10%. So what about that factor, independents? 
>> Yeah, I think overwhelmingly they will break toward romney. I think that is the history of these things. I know in my races as for congress or governorship you look at the people undecided at the end or loosely affiliated in the world of politics, overall they break toward the challenger rather than the incumbent. We'll see if it happens here. I suspect it will. 

[00:36:29]


>> Gregg: The other thing that struck me with the fox news polls. I'm going to show you to our viewers. Romney has an 11-point lead among extremely interested voters. Those who are really motivated to get out there and cast their ballots. How important do you think voter enthusiasm is going to be come tuesday? 
>> I think you are seeing that. If you look at several hour long waited times that are taking place down in broward county and florida that have been reported throughout the day, people are out there and willing to stand in line for a couple of hours. That is fairly amazing given all the things people could be doing on a weekend. 
>> Gregg: Governor mark sanford, thanks very much. 
>> It's a pleasure. 
>> Gregg: Stick with fox news on election night. Complete coverage beginning on fox news channel at 6:00 p.M. On tuesday with bret baier and megyn kelly and also catch shepard smith beginning at 7:00 p.M. On the fox network. 
>> Heather: Coming up, new questions about the c.I.A.'S response to the deadly terror attack in benghazi. It comes that the state department was warned about security concerns at consulate before the murders of four americans. So what does all this say about the obama administration's handling of the crisis. Ambassador john bolton is here to break it all down. 
>> Gregg: So many people in staten island are picking up the pieces after sandy. We're going to speak to one man that survived the storm but lost his home and his business. 
>> You try to prepare for the worst, but until you actually arrive and see the destruction and damage, you could never imagine what we saw.

>> Heather: Welcome back. No rest for the vice presidential candidates, just days before the big election, vice president joe biden spending the day in the battle ground state of colorado slamming the republican ticket in front of a crowd of supporters. 
>> We saw those debates. Some of those debates you begin to wonder, governor romney and congressman ryan seemed to be running as fast away from their positions as they can. It's like watching a guy, little kid trying to outrun his shadow, man. It keeps catching up saying whoa, it's still there! Shadow doesn't go away until the sun goes down. It's going down tuesday night. 
>> Heather: Meantime, republican vice presidential nominee paul ryan is on a sprint hitting rallies in four states today, starting in marietta, ohio, that's where he reminded supporters how close america is to decision day. 
>> Washington is really broken and we can not afford four more years of this. We don't have to settle for this. Three more days. That's all we need. Three more days. 
[ Cheers and applause ] three more days. That's it. That's it. 
>> Heather: Congressman ryan also made stops in pennsylvania and virginia and is heading to another rally in florida tonight. 
>> Gregg: A massive effort going on right now to deliver food, fuel and other supplies to the very hard hit areas of staten island. Devastation there, as you can see, very hard to imagine. For those who survived sandy, the job of cleaning up and starting over is just now beginning. Today dave briggs talked with john toto who lost both his home and business on staten island. 

[00:44:28]


>> The reality is finally setting in and initially the morning after the storm, of course, you evacuate and went to another location at my sister's home. You alwa hoping -- you try to prepare for the worst, but until you actually arrive and see the destruction and the damage, you could have never imagined what we saw. It was totally overwhelming. You know, you can expla to people and tell people over the phone and unless you actually see what's here, you could never, ever, ever in your wildest imagination see the destruction. I mean, this is our katrina. You know, unfortunately, those poor people went through this x number of years ago, ten years ago. Now it's our turn. And you don't know where t begin, where to start. I got good friends and family. Everybody has been coming down trying to help me out, trying to do whatever we canto move ahead and it's confusing. It's mind boggling. It's uncertainty. It's my life. The restaurant was my 30 years of adult life. My home. I lost everything. 
>> Can I ask you, you've been frustrated with what the insurance will and will not cover. You said you had hurricane coverage, but that will not take care of your dame. 
>> In 30 years of business here, I've never had one drop of water. And we have had many, many, manies storms. Irene last year which pelted us with 13 inches of water. I never had a problem with water. Okay. This wasn't a flood issue per say. This was a tsunami issue. How do you prepare for something like that? 
>> Gregg: If you want to help the recovery efforts, it's easy to donate not red c for example. You can go on-line to red cross.Org or to donate ten dollars on your phone text redcross to 90999, or simply dial 1-800-red cross to make a donation. 

[00:46:40]


>> Heather: Patience running thin on capitol hill. Demand ago new committee to find answers about the white house's response to that deadly attack on the u.S. Consulate in libya. We will discuss this and other major developments in the tragic story with ambassador john bolton next., 

[00:50:44]


>> Gregg: Each day seems to bring new serious relations about the deadly terrorist attack on the u..S. Consulate in benghazi, libya. Finding, though, a definitive account of what really happened is elusive. Three leading republican senators calling for a new select committee to investigate the raid which left four americans dead, including our ambassador. This as fox news has exclusive information now showing the consulate considered suspending its operations in benghazi as security there deteriorated and considered moving into the c.I.A. Annex less than a month before the attack. Hoto get to the bottom o all of this. Joining me now, john bolton is a form u.S. Ambassador to the united nations. Fox news contributor. Good to see you. The obama administration is investigating itself with secret internal probes. Now, aren't t by their very nature, inherently suspect and all the more reason why congress needs to conduct an independent investigation? 
>> I think investigations by both branches are appropriate. I think in the case of the obama administration, it's not only that their investigations have produced accounts so far which are only favor annual to them -- favorable to them, but the selective leaking of information has politicized the central intelligence agency and the pentagon, just a few days before our election. There is another letter out by another gro of senators, senators coats and blunt and rubio and others if I recall, that go precisely to that point. Are these leaks authorized by the administration, or are these leaks by the agencies themselves? What this shows is I think the administration disarray and simply underlines the importance of congress getting to the bottom of this. 
>> Gregg: Katherine herrage obtained a classified cable from the u.S. Mission in benghazi less than a month before the attack. It told washington consulate cannot be defended and islamist militants and al-qaeda are everywhere. Is this, in your mind, pretty clear and convincing evidence that the obama administration was warned that an attack could happen, yet did nothing? 

[00:53:00]


>> Absolutely. I've had a chance to read that cable. I tell you, it is the smoking gun in this investigation, at least so far. The idea, for example, that the c.I.A. Station in benghazi offered to bring the consulate personnel into their compound a month before the september 11 attack shows just how worried everybody in benghazi was about precisely what happened just a few weeks later. So I mean, this is a devastating rebuttal to any notion that somehow there was an out of control demonstration because of this ridiculous mohammed video. And undercuts the administration credibility in a profound way. 
>> Gregg: Fox news has been told that there were on the night of the attack, not only armed drones in the area of benghazi, but also f-18s, ac-130 aircraft and helicopters that could have helped immediately and yet the pleas for help were either ignored or injected. Here what is retired admiral james lions who once commanded the pacific fleet has said in a 
column and I'll quote him: It now appears that the white house, pentagon, state department, c.I.A., Jcs and various other military commands monitored the entire battle in real time via frantic phone calls from our compound and video from an overhead drone. The cries for help and support went unanswered. He then went on to say that the terrorists could have been wiped out by an immediate attack, but there wa a, to husband ice words -- a lack of courage to take action. You agree? 
>> Well, I think he speaks from direct personal knowledge of the military's capabilities and i think the administration's passivity before, during and after the attack all demands investigation. I would simply say that we also need to look at the broader systemic failure here of the obama administration believing its own press releases about the war on terror being over, denying multiple requests for security enhancement before the 9-11 attack. There is a lot to look into here. Not just the tragedy on 9-11, but the broader failures of the obama administration's policies. 

[00:55:18]


>> Gregg: Is it beyond systemic? Is it imcompetence that can be imputed directly to the president? 
>> Yeah, I think it's a mixture of imcompetence, politics and ideology. It's a toxic brew. There is no denial we had a debauchle on 9-11, a tragedy, four americans dead. Just to make sure people understand, this risk continues to exist today. There has been no retaliation for that 9-11 attack. Maybe something is coming, but it hasn't happened yet. Every american diplomatic facility in the middle east is at risk until we do something. 
>> Gregg: Ambassador john bolton, thank you so much for being with us. 
>> Thank you.

>> Heather: Welcomback. Governor romney and president obama waging an all out campaign blitz with three days to go. Down for the wire before election day. Hello, everyone. I'm heather childers. Welcome to a brand-new h inside america's election headquarters. 
>> Gregg: I'm gregg gregg. Tong the news, the presidenal candidates crisscrossing the country hitting a handful of battle ground states that will decide the outcome of a very tight race. This is going down to the wire. We begin with senior national correspondt john roberts following governor mitt romney live in inglewood, colorado. John, what's governor romney's goal these last three days? 
>> Can you imagine it's come down to these last three days. You could believe that the last 2 1/2 days will feel like forever. But for the governor, it's the final sprint to the finish. This is the day when it's all about enthusiasm and confidence. Enthusiasm to get as many people to vote for you and run up your numbers and confidence for those late deciders, many of whom may not make up their minds until they're in the voting booth. You are the one they want to when they pull the lever for. Governor come romney co- opted the message of change. But today he took a turn. Remember, president obama talking about there were no blue or red states. Only the united states? Well, governor romney now talking about being a bipartisan president for all the people. Listen to what he said on the campaign trail in dubuque. 
>> I learned as the governor of massachusetts that the best achievements are shared achievements and I learned that respect and goodwill go a long way and when they're shared, they come back to you. That's how I'm going to conduct myself as president. I won't just represent one party. I will represent one nation. 
>> What's really interesting is the way the calls for bipartisanship have been met with democrats. Harry reid saying there is no way senate democrat also ever work with governor romney, gregg. 

[01:01:49]


>> Gregg: John, bit of a controversy involving something president obama said yesterday. Tell us about that. 
>> Yeah. On the campaign trail, on the stump he likes to say when people start booing against governor romney, he said don't boo, vote. Yesterday he said voting is your best venge. A curious comment copping from any american president. One that his campaign has to explain. But governor romney got a gift from that and he put out an ad saying what does the president want the people to vote for? Giving him another point to sharply contrast against the president. 
>> We have got to leave america to a -- lead america to a better place. Is there anyone that's worried that the last four years are the best we can do? Is there anyone who fears the american dream is fading away? Is there anyone who wonders whether better jobs and better incomes are slipping from our grasp? I have a clear message and that is america is about to come roaring back. 
>> It's anybody's guess to how all of this is going to play out. We know in colorado, it's extraordinarily close. Average has president obama up by a point. According to colorado secretary of state, republicans have the edge in early voting and president obama has lost his advantage, a big advantage with independent voters. So really I think it could be safe to say that the only poll that is going to matter nows the one that's taken on tuesday night. 
>> Gregg: Well said. John roberts, great reporting as always. Thanks so much. 
>> Thas. 
>> Heather: President obama kick off a packed campaign schedule in the key battle ground states of ohio and wisconsin, taking jabs at governor remain knee and urging supporters to get out and vote. The president now enroute to iowa. That's where he's expected to speak at a star studded campaign event. Chief white house correspondent ed henry is traveling with the president anjust landed and us live on the phone. 

[01:03:56]


>> He's going to have john cougar mellencamp trying to kick off a star studded weekend. All kinds of celebrities. A concert rally in the next couple of days with jz, bruce springstein. They're really trying to get people out to the polls. A lot of these states have early voting like where he was earlier today. His campaign is trying to explain that remark, that john roberts was talking about about voting being the best readvantage. They said he was not trying to harm anyone. He was just trying to say as his spokeswoman did, that he was talking about readvantage against some of the -- revenge against some of the policies that mitt romney outlined such as this whole jeep ad that caused so much controversy in the midwest, the romney camp suggesting that the chrysler will move jeep jobs to china. Obama camp insisting that's not true. The problem is that you go back to the president's speech in ho had yesterday, he was not talking about the jeep controversy when he said voting is the best revenge. So that explanation doesn't seem topped. I think the bottom line is the president wants to shift the focus here, doesn't want to talk about things like that. What he wants to talk about is grabbing the mantra of change back from mitt romney. He's talk being how mitt romney is saying, he's theandidate of change. President obama is no longer the challenger. He's trying to take that mantle back by saying the policies that mitt romney is selling on the stump are really just failed policies of the past. Not sort of any change moving forward. That's his case. The second thing he has,, the obama camp is confident about is the ground game. They believe that if they can wrap up some of these midwestern battle grounds like iowa, wisconsin and ohio, it will be very hard for mitt romney to get to 270 electoral votes he needs to take this away from the president. 
>> Heather: We'll see what happens. Ed henry live for us on the phone where he just landed in iowa. We'll let you go. We know you have a lot of work to do. Thanks. 

[01:05:56]


>> Gregg: And a fox news alert, drastic new measures in new jersey in the lingering aftermath of super storm sandy. Governor chris christie ordering gas rationing. Drivers in 12 northern new jersey counties can only buy gasoline on odd or even days. Governor christie is hoping the rationing will ease the long lines, preventing a fuel shortage or a bigger one. 
>>> In new york, governor andrew cuomo announcing free emergency mobile fuel stations are opening around the new york city metro area for victims of super storm sandy. 
>> Heather: And just a few miles outside of manhattan in hoboken, new jersey, those people still have no power and food trucks are offering a free meals, though, to people there. The storm surge from the hudson river caused nearly every street in the city to look like this, to flood. And though the water had gone down somewhat, the clean-up will take some tim 
>> our street is so disgustingly polluted. It's disgusting. It's like sewage came up. 
>> You breathe it and coughing and turning and sometime I think I be taking my last breath. 
>> Heather: That resident from staten island. There, the number of those who died, continues to rise and patience is wearing th david lee miller is on staten island for us this evening with the latest. David lee? 
>> Heather, a few moments ago we heard from mayor bloomberg. He held a news conference and he said that he expects that the gas shortage is going to be in his words, less of a problem in the next few days. As we heard gregg mention, throughout the city, including staten island, there are mobile trucks set up to distribute free gasoline courtesy of the federal government. Each of these trucks contains 5,000 gallons of gasoline. There have been a number of issues, a number of problems. As we can report here in staten island, things seem to be going relatively smoothly. There is a separate line for first responders. The police and ambulances, et cetera, people who need gasoline to address emergencies. Then there is another line for the general public. The problem is, people in that line have waited hours. One man told us he was there since 9:45 this morning. Elsewhere throughout the city, there are reports that the situation has become difficult to control for the police. In some instances, people getting in line are buying the gasoline. There's a ten gallon limit, and then they are reselling it. Now, as for here on staten islanders, people who live in this outer burough are helping one another. Not far from where I'm standing right now, a special site has been set up for volunteers to assemble and to accept donations of food, clothing water. Organizers say that many of the people who are in need of help are simply now too afraid to leave their own homes because of fear of crime. Listen. 

[01:08:58]


>> Biggest concern here is for the residents is that they're afraid, there is no electric in the area. When it gets dark, there is no lights. I know the police department has put up spot lights and now the national guard is here and they're doing the best they can. But people are really afraid to leave their homes because a lot of their homes are exposed. They're afraid of people coming in to steal what little they have left. 
>> City wide, the city says it has distributed -- listen to this figure -- 25,000 blankets. I can tell you, those blanketsare going to be needed. They are going to be used. Even though in many parts of the city, the electrici is back on, there are still more than 100,000 people who do not have power. They do not have steam heat. The temperatures are continuing to plummet. There is now the risk that people might just freeze because of the cold weather and the lack of electricity and heat. Heather. 
>> Heather: David lee miller reporting from staten island this evening. Thank you. 
>> Gregg: A sign of hope and renewal today. One of new york city's hospitals forced to evacuate patients at the height of super storm sandy is finally rpening. This was one of the many ional images showing a nurse carrying a newborn. Today nyu lain come medical center says almost all practices are scheduled to open up on monday. Seven back up generathere is failed during the storm surge on monday night, forcing the hospital to evacuate 300 patients. 
>>> Coming up, we are breaking down the cost of super storm sandy, expected to be in the tens of billions of dollars and where exactly all of that money come from? 
>> Heather: Back to the race for the white house. We are just three days fro election day, both parties hitting the trail hard, especially in key battleground states like ohio. That's where nominees from both sides are spending part of the day encouraging their supporters to head out to the polls on tuesday. Steve brown is live for us in mansfield, ohio, with the latest. Hi, steve. 

[01:11:10]


>> Hi there. Yes, ohio presidential campaigns, it could be argued or split into two halves. Election day, the second half. Leading up to that, about getting folks to vote early, that's the first half. And that's the strength of the obama campaign. By aklimmation, it's expected obama will go into election day here in ohio with an edge. The question is, how great an edge? Why the emphasis ony voting? Essentially for every supporter you get to the polls, that means your concentration of resource social security working on a smaller universe of potential voters to try and influence. So in their view, it is a more efficient way of getting folks to the polls and a winning formula. They brought in people to provide a little bit of motivation, if you will. The afl-cio president, richard trumka, obama ally, was talking to unionized folks about their interest or their -- what's in their best interest in getting this president reelected is that the top of trumka's list and he was stealing from the president's own kind of campaign speech line talking about defending the middle class. 
>> We paid enough. It's time that this economy work for us and our kids and their kids. It's time that it went forward. 
>> Flip it around to the other side, the republicans have been working just as hard. A lot of it off of the radar to try and blunt the obama edge in early vote. They believe they can get it down to about 6 tore 7 percentage points. That's what the a.P. Says it looks like. Large block of unaffiliated voters, leading by 6% in the early vote. Republicans believe they win election day by about 7 or 8%. If that's true, then they feel that they've got a shot at taking and tipping ohio. Polls suggest that there is still an edge of a lead for the president and it's been persistent over the last couple of weeks. 
>> Heather: Steve brown reporting live from ohio with the latest. Thank you. 

[01:13:10]


>> Gregg: We are just days away from the presidential election. 2 1/2 to be technical. But tens of millions of americans already cast their ballots. Turnout for early voting this year setting all kinds of records. Elizabeth prann is live in atlanta with more on that. Hi, elizabeth. I, gregg. It's been a election day really for the better half of october across 34 states. What that's translated to for the average voter islly astronomical lines. What we're seeing is that early voting is really becoming an emerging trend. In 2004, about 22% of americans voted early. That was after 30% in 2008. According to some experts, we could see on track topass that statistic again in this election cycle. More than 25 million people have already cast ballots. Here is a breakdown of what we're looking at in some of the swing states and beyond. More than 2 1/2 million people in north carolina have already voted. Exit polls showing there, obama is in favor with those early voters. Ohioans have cast more than a million ballots and we're seeing in virginia, nevada and ohio, hundreds of thousands of ballots tasked and obviously in nevada, more than 50% of the electorate has already voted early. Experts say that early voting has really changed the face of elections. Listen. 
>> When you have 35 to 40% of the entire electorate voting early, some of them voting in september, much less october, early november, it's going to transform a presidential election. That's what we've seen. Every day is now election da3] 
>> with some states continuing early voting really right up to election day, we'll learn which party benefited. However, both president obama and governor romney say that they have the advantage with early voters. So both of them continue to encourage their base to get out and vote early. Gregg, back to you. 
>> Gregg: Elizabeth, thanks very much. Stick with fox news on election night. Complete coverage beginning here on the fox news channel at 6:00 p.M. Tuesday with megyn kelly and bret baier. You can catch shepard smith beginning at 7:00 p.M. On the fox network.

>> Gregg: And more details emerging in the obama administration's handling of the libya terrorist attack that killed four brave americans. Now new york city mayor rudy guiliani, who knows terrorism all too well, level ago very harsh criticism of the president.

[01:19:45]


>> Heather: We're getting a fuller picture of the destruction from super storm sandy. Hundreds of homes destroyed, millions left without electricity, countless businesses unable to open. Mass transit paralyzed and the new york stock exchange shut down for two days. The estimated cost of the storm, $50 billion. Now as millions of americans recover from the storm, is there anything that we can learn to maybe perhaps better prepare ourselves for another possible disaster? Joining us is ed, managing partner of chapwood investments. For a lot of people right now, they can't even think about recovering. But in terms of this storm, is there anything that people could have done to better prepare? 
>> Well, first of all, I mean, everybody around the country is watching this and we just can't believe how terrible everything looks. And it makes us all start to reflect on what would we do if we were in that situation? I'm in dallas and from time to time, a tornado will come through and we're always faced with that. Some of the things -- people don't plan to fail. They really, they just fail to plan. So no one is out there planning and saying, we're going to plan and how we can mess things up. But they fail to plan. A lot of times they do that because they don't have a contingency plan. A lot of times those contingency plans in business or lives cost money, they're not revenue producing for a business. Oftentimes that's one of the reasons that people don't do that. But I have to share with you, there is something -- there is a technology now called cloud computing and we use it all the time. You use it with your itunes account and iphones and so on. People are now using that a lot more to take documents and put them up into the cloud. They take photos. I use a company called oyster.Com for all of my personal information. My documents, my birth certificates for my kids, all that stuff you can scan in and send up to the cloud. That's one thing people are starting to use a lot more of right now. 
>> Heather: So that's a storage program? 
>> That's right. 
>> Heather: Okay. 
>> Absolutely. You store and there is many of them. Oyster.Com is one of them. There is many of them, but people are doing that now. In the olden days, they would put it in a safety deposit box or hold stuff away from home. 

[01:21:55]


>> Heather: That's a good idea. 
>> That's one. 
>> Heather: In terms of the 50 billion number we talked about, about 20 billion, at least to this point being to lost economic activity, people paying for meals in restaurants, casinos, 30 billion of it is being allotted towards property destruction. That includes homes, businesses, also vehicles. What about insurance coverage? 
>> Apparently the insurance coverage was very good. What you should be doing as a contingency plan is making sure you pay those premiums. I guarantee you who didn't get those premiums paid and because of that, a lot of that insurance is not going to kick in. So make sure you're not only -- you not only have your insurance paid up, but go a little overboard. Get umbrella policies. It pays to have extra insurance, especially times like this. Even if you're not in the northeast, there could be mud slides in california. We could have other disasters, wildfires. Just overinsure yourself so you can exhale that if something terrible does happen, at least you certainly have that as a back up plan. 
>> Heather: Cash in your pocket and a generator. 
>> Have a generator. Have cash in your pocket 'cause you never know when you're going to need it. Make sure you keep those friendships. Don't burn any of the friendships 'cause you might need to call them up and say, do you got a sofa? Keep that in mind. 
>> Heather: Gregg is sitting next to me, he's all too familiar with a generator because he's been using a generator off and on. 
>> Gregg: For six days. 
>> Heather: Thank you very much, ed, we appreciate it. Thank you. 
>> Thanks for having me. 
>> Gregg: The trick is most of the generators run on gasoline. Well, you got the long gas lines. Knives one for two hours. Fortunately, I stock piled in gas cans ahead of time. So I was in pretty good shape. But nevertheless, you got to keep refilling the generator. 
>> Heather: You just managed to get power back on. 
>> A couple of hours ago, yeah. Thank goodness. 
>> Gregg: The c.I.A. Carefully laying out a time line of what happened before, during and after the deadly attack on our consulate in libya. Now brand-new documents obtained by fox news challenging that account. The exclusive details in a live report coming up next.

>> Heather: Welcome back. A fox news exclusive. New information about the deadly attack at the u.S. Consulate in benghazi, libya. Fox news has obtained a classified cable showing that the state department was warned about syria's security concerns long before the attack was carried out. Also three u.S. Senators are calling for a congressional committee to investigate the administration's handling of the attack. Molly henneberg is in washington with more. Hi, molly. 
>> Hi. This classified cable was sent august 16 to the state department that was less than one month before the september 11 attack in libya. And it describes how u.S. Personnel on the ground were making contingency plans. The cable reads in part, quote: This daily pattern of violence would be the new normal for the foreseeable future. Went on to say, quote, personnel could co- locate to the annex, talking about the c.I.A. Annex -- if the security environment downgraded suddenly. It also reveals they were concerned about the trustworthiness of the libyan militia, the 17 february brigade, which was protecting the consulate, noting, quote, certain sectors of the 1 february brigade were very hesitant to share information 
[ith the americans. One republican senator says the obama administration wanted to believe that libya was safe enough to keep a smaller security footprint there. 
>> This has been the story of libya for months. The people on the ground in libya are begging and pleading for additional security. They're being denied additional security, military and civilian security, u.S. Security because we wanted to, quote, normalize relationships with libyan government that didn't exist in benghazi. 
>> Senator graham and fellow republicans senators john mccain and kelly ayotte are calling for a select committee of lawmakers, perhaps from both the house and senate -- to investigate the attack. The obama administration has said it wants to wait for an independent board to finish its review before making any assessments about the attack. In the meantime, the president's team, both at the white house and his campaign, say republicans are trying to take advantage of a tragedy. 

[01:31:04]


>> As soon as the final report is completed, that will be released. But this is not a time for treating this like a political football, which is what mitt romney and many republicans are doing. The american people deserve and want better than that. 
>> The state department believes the report will be finished sometime in december. Heather? 
>> Heather: Molly henneberg live for us from washington, thank you. Gregg? 
>> Gregg: Taking a look now at the race for the white house, this final weekend before election day. The latest real clear politics average of national polls, take a look at this. President obama barely edging out governor mitt romney by less than one tenth of 1%. What are the candidates need to go do in the final push? What's going to happen? Let's bring in our campaign insiders, the final edition before the election, john, former republican congressman for new york. Former pollster for president carter. Doug schoen and a former pollster for president bill clinton. All right. You get the first shot at this. What do you make of this? 
>> First, we're in an absolute statistical tie. That much is obvious. When you go through the swing states, there is a slight, and i emphasize slight, but clear advantage for president obama. It's also possible we can have a result where the popular vote goes to governor romney and president obama wins the electoral college. It's that close. 
>> Gregg:2000 were due. 
>> Not so fast. I lived this in 1980. We've seen the president gain, i think, both -- we talked about before the incumbent last week bounce, as well as the hurricane sandy and the gift from governor christie. But at the same time, we have now the people reacting differently. I'll tell you the 1980, the race was tied on saturday night. Went to five points for reagan on sunday and ten on monday. 
>> It's even all the way through. 
>> That'why if it breaks, we'll see. If it breaks, only a few points. That's all you need to move. 

[01:33:10]


>> Gregg: T, tell me who it will break for. 
>> I don't know. I'm just arguing the other side. 
>> Gregg: I knew you would. 
>> It could break for governor romney. 
>> Look, they have him back up at 51% job approval. We're going to find out whether the day -- 
>> Gregg: Gallup have romney up by six not long ago? 
>> Yes. But he's been out of the field. We'll got a poll tomorrow. 
>> Pat mentions 1980, I happened to be a recipient of this wave and I rode the wave to get elected along with reagan and a lot of republicans who weren't supposed to win that year. That's the one thing that is still somewhat here in this race, which is passion differential for republicans. They're definitely more pumped to go vote, to get rid of obama, than the obama people are to keep obama. 
>> Gregg: Voter enthusiasm is really important. Fox news has polled on this. Let's put this up on the screen. Romney has an 11-point lead among extremely interested voters, right? Let's go to the next one, which asked how important is it to you that your candidate should win. There is a ten-point lead by romney. 
>> Here is what this means, this means that the obama campaign, unless they have a very, very robust get out the vote drive, which is called gotv, are in trouble. But what we're seeing is with the amount of money being spent to drag people to the polls, to call them on the phone, to otherwise impour tune them to turn out every way possible, the voters who are less interested are arguably going to have as much enthusiasm as those who the polls show -- 
>> doug, we have talked, gregg, among the three of us on our shows the last year trying to figure out, is this year, 2012, 1980, the late break for carter, or is it 2004, a fairly unpopular incumbent, bush, and obama, running against a stiff massachusetts kerry and mondale? 2004. 

[01:35:12]


>> In that case, the bush campaign had the best get out the vote operation. 
>> Gregg: What about this -- every poll path that I look at shows that independent voters are breaking for romney, anywhere by five to 10%. 
>> Can you tell me what the party break down is on tuesday and tell you the exact breakdown of the election. If it's even in party, as opposed to five points, which our poll has at fox, and the independents are breaking for romney, then it's a win. If not, if it's a couple points democratic, it could be different. The fact is, the close here and I do want to say this 'cause it's important. I believe if the republicans lose this election, romney loses. They can look to abandoning okay and recently abandoning libya as an issue. 
>> Holding the ball is always bad. 
>> It could have backfired if romney himself had -- 
>> why his not saying a word about it, however, by not saying a word -- 
>> really when you look at where we're at today, there was one 90-minute period, october 3, where mitt romney was a dynamite candidate. Dynamite. Sometimes it's all you need. 
>> I don't know. I think against an incumbent who wasn't challenged in his own party, who has a big machine, this istill a little uphill, i think. 
>> Gregg: Let's put the real clear politic electoral map up. It's unchanged from the last time that we looked at it. President obama is at 201. Romney at 191. You got to have 270. No real change. 
>> Gregg that, is exactly right. But if you look at the individual polls in the yellow states which are the states that are undeclared. 
>> Gregg: That's where obama has an edge? 
>> He has an edge in iowa, an edge in minnesota. He has an edge in wisconsin. Most of all, ohio and wisconsin. That puts him over the -- 
>> I saw an iowa poll with romney ahead. I saw one where he had florida. 
>> I think florida will go to romney. North carolina and virginia. 15 or 20 polls in those swing states in the midwest -- 

[01:37:16]


>> I'm not sure I believe that. 
>> Breaking 85, 90% obama. 
>> I'm not sure I buy that at this point. I think polling is so difficult right now. The people's response rates. I'm just saying -- by the way, some pollsters, we will have an execution on wednesday for somebody. 
>> I hope it's not me. 
>> I hope not either for your sake. 
>> Gregg: Last jobs report came out on friday and unemployment number ticked up from 7.8 to 7.9. Does that make a difference? 
>> Probably not. I think it was enough so that obama can keep talking. Let me say about the hurricane and the jobs report. The hurricane forced obama during the last week to do what the three of us have been saying for a year. Be presidential. Be positive. Don't get nasty towards romney, which is so unpresidential. Be above it. Be morally a uniter. 
>> Gregg: You know, listen, all the news stories and there is still 2 1/2 days to go, are that fema dropped the ball on this thing. He's in charge of fema. What happened to george bush during katrina. 
>> Gregg, what is happening now is that obamaitis. Four or five good political days notwithstanding the tragedy that hit the northeast and the midwest. Bottom line, there are two days left. But the issues of libya, the economy, have been off the table benefitting president obama. 
>> Gregg: There have been so many news stories, about maybe not enough, that the handling of this thing by the white house and the president is incompetent, the libyan issue. 
>> What they're doing now is putting out disinformation to cover up -- 
>> Gregg: It's got to hurt the president. 
>> Look at the fox poll. On his handling of the job of libya, he's got the worst rating than on the economy. Let me finish my point. Half the people are saying that they believe that they were covering up purposely. The prop problem is romney president republicans. They've never said -- so therefore, because they're not saying it, the main stream media has a reason they don't have to cover it. 

[01:39:18]


>> Gregg: So you can tell there is only 2 1/2 days left because the boys are getting testy. Everybody is on edge. We'll be back in a moment of we are keeping an eye on colorado springs.

>> Gregg: Final segment before everybody casts their votes except for the folks who early voted. We're back with our campaign insiders. John, pat, and doug. Pat, let me ask you and doug about the undecideds here. What percentage of vote railroads truly undecided, how would they break? 
>> Remember, there are few percent that are pure that are announced undecided. There are persuadables. Traditionally, and I keep arguing this because I think it's missed -- during the last week, the incumbent often gets a bump early in the week. The very late undecided very last ones usually go to the challenger. How many there are? We don't know this time. But there are not many. 
>> Gregg: Give me a ballpark. 

[01:45:12]


>> I would say 5 or 6% of the vote railroads still moveable. 
>> I think it's about 5%, gregg. They're likely to break three to two, 3 1/2 to one 1/2 for governor romney. So the key statistic is where president obama's vote is. Bush was polling about 48%. Just over the finish line in 2000. This feels like a similar situation notwithstanding what pat and john say. 
>> I do we're between 80 and 2004 for one reason. 2004 didn't have the economy drag that this does. 
>> Gregg: I want to switch because we've been talking so much about presidential politics. There are other elections going on. Principlely control of the u.S. Senate. John? 
>> First of all, I think republicans will keep the house. I think everyone now acknowledges that. The senate, the republicans need a net gain of four to take over the senate. I've been telling everybody i know, obama may win, may not. But if the republicans win the senate, keep the house, we box in obama, he can't spend money, he can't raise taxes, can't do anything. Complete control of cons. 
>> I don't think it's going to happen. I think the democrats, worse case lose a couple of seats. 51-hot. 
>> Unless you get a break and it drags a couple of these other races over. The republicans had it all their way in the senate and be -- 
>> Gregg: Couple of mistakes, bad luck. 
>> Bad luck and candidates. 
>> Murdoch is down. 
>> Scott brown is likely it lose. 
>> Bob kerry is catching up. 
>> I don't think he'll get there. 
>> Gregg: The unfortunate remark, highly criticized of murdoch -- 
>> two senate seats. 
>> One -- 
>> last time there were three senate seats. Weak candidates lost for the republican. 
>> But the reason this is so important is, I believe, is that the libya thing, if the republicans get the senate and the house, and obama were to be reelected, we're having a mini watergate hearing because it's all going to be the same thing. 
>> We have a fiscal crisis. We have a --

>> after this campaign, with doug and I have written about, after tearing the country apart in divide and conquer, the republican willingness to work with him is not high. 
>> He said this before which is important, is if we had that split ballot, in other words, they vote popular vote for romney, electoral vote puts obama over the top, or vice verse is a, doug is very smart about it. That this is going to delegit maze the winner. 40% of the people in -- 
>> we could have an election here where everybody agrees on the counting of the votes, unlike 2000, but had the system delegit maze with a fair vote. 
>> You're going to hear so much screaming and yelling about fraud. I'm going to tell you, if you have that outcome, second time around, 40% didn't believe the president was legitimate. 
>> Gregg: We'll wait and see what happens on tuesday. I would guess ask you for your pre dicks burks I'm told you will refuse to give me. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> 'Til monday. 
>> 'Til monday. 
>> Call me monday morning. 
>> You can watch our show monday morning. 
>> Gregg: All right. There it is. Campaign insiders, every monday, 10:30 a.M. Eastern. You guys have no courage. 
>> That's true. 
>> Gregg: You can also follow them on twitter at fninsiders. We will be right back 

[01:52:11]


>> Heather: Governor romney about to deliver remarks at a campaign event as part of his final battleground blitz before election day. His wife, ann, you can see at the podium right now. These are live pictures from the municipal airport in colorado springs. He and his wife just got off their campaign plane. Governor romney holding the edge among early voters in the state with about a million and a half ballots cast so far. That, of course, according to the latest data released by the secretary of state's office. Gregg? 
>> Gregg: We were mentioning with the campaign insiders a moment ago about one poll shows the governor leading in colorado and it is, in fact, scott rasmussen's poll. Rasmussen reports governor romney leading 50-47%. So let's listen in, they're in colorado, to governor mitt romney and his wife, ann romney. 
[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> well, today we enter the final weekend of the campaign. All right? 
[ Cheers and applause ] and you got it right, that the obama rallies rallies are captaining four more years. You're chanting three more days. We're going to have to change that chant tomorrow. We'll come up with something, I'm sure. We are so grateful to you and to the people across this country for all that you've given to the campaign of yourselves, of your time, your talent, your energy, your money, and this is not just about paul ryan and me and it's really about america and the future we leave our children. 

[01:54:32]


[ Cheers and applause ] we thank you and we ask you to stay with it all the way to victory on tuesday night. All right? 
[ Cheers and applause ] four years ago, candidate obama promised to do so much for us, but he's fallen so very short. He promised to be a post-partisan president. Remember that? But he became the most partisan. Blaming, attacking, and dividing. He was going to focus on creating jobs, instead he focused on obamacare and that killed jobs. He said he was going to cut federal deficit in half. Instead he doubled it. He said he was going to cut the unemployment rate to 5.2% by now. We learned on friday that it's 7.9%. That's 9 million jobs short of what he promised. Employment is now higher than when barak obama took office. He promised that he would propose a solution for social security and medicare to keep them from going insolvency. But instead, he raided medicare $716 billion to pay for his obamacare. He said he would lower health premiums. Instead, they're up by $3,000 a family. Gasoline. The american family now pays $2,000 a year more for gasoline than when the president took office. 
(Booing) he said he was going to work across the aisle on the most important issues. You know he has not met on the economy or on jobs or on the budget with either the republican leader of the house or the leader of the senate since july. Instead of bridging the divide, he's made the divide wider. You wonder how it is that he's fallen so short of his promises? It's in part because he never led before. He never worked across the aisle. He never truly understood how the economy works to be able to cr real jobs. And today, of course, he makes new promises, promises he will be unable to keep because he admits he's going to stay on the same path he's been on. And the same course we've been on will not lead to a better destination than it already has. The same path would mean $20 trillion in debt, crippling unemployment, stagnant wage growth, depressed home values, and a definite stated military. We got to change course because unless we do, we may be looking at another recession! The question of this election 

[01:57:10]


comes down to this: Do you want more of the same or do you want real change? 
[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! 
>> Look, president obama promised real change but he couldn't deliver it. I promise change, but I've got a record of having achieved it. 
[ Cheers and applause ] I actually built a business and I turned around another business. And I put the olympics back on track. By the way, with a democrat legislature, I helped turn my state from deficit to surplus and from job losses to job growth and from higher taxes to higher take home pay. And that's why I'm running for president. I know how to change the course the country is on and get it to a balanced deficit! 
[ Cheers and applause ] I know how it build jobs and get rising take home pay because accomplishing real change is not something I just talk about. It's something I've actually done! 
[ Cheers and applause ] and it's precisely what I'm going to do when I'm president of the united states. 
[ Cheers and applause ] if you believe we can do better, if you believe america should be on a better course, if you're tired of being tired, then I ask you to vote and work for real change because paul ryan and i are going to bring real change to america from day one. 
[ Cheers and applause ] you know, when I'm elected, the economy anamerican jobs will still be stagnant. But I'm not going to waste any time complaining about my predecessor. 

[01:59:25]


[ Cheers and applause ] I won't spend my effort and time trying to pass partisan legislation that's unrelated to the economy and jobs. From day one, I'm going to go to work to help americans get back to work. People across the country, by the way, are responding to our five-part plan. You've seen it, you know what it is. Part one is about taking advantage of our energy resources. 
[ Cheers and applause ] from the very first day, I'm going to act to increase the

Waters. 
[ Cheers and applause ] I'm going to speed the approval of that keystone pipeline from canada. 
[ Cheers and applause ] and I'm going to take a very, very close look at the coal regulations that were designed by this administration to strangle the industry. We need coal. We need oil. We need gas. We need renewables. We need all these sources of energy! 
[ Cheers and applause ] because on day one, we're going to be one day closer to energy independence and we're going to have it in eight years. North american will be independent. 
[ Cheers and applause ] number two, I'm gog move to boost trade, particularly with latin america and ask congress for trade promotion authority. By the way, that's a power every president has had or requested since it was put in place in 1974. With the exception of president obama. And I will finally designate china as a currency manipulator because it's time for trade to work for america! 
[ Cheers and applause ] third on day one, I'm going to send to congress the retraining reform act to make sure that every worker who feels left behind in this economy can get the skills and the chance they need to succeed and number four, I'm going to move to tackle out of control spending. I will send to congress the first of several fundamental reforms. This first one will be the down payment on fiscal sanity act. 
[ Laughter ] that's going to do something unusual. We're not just going to slow the rate of growth of government. We're actually going to cut government by 5% from day one! 
[ Cheers and applause ] I'm not just going to take office on january 20. I'm going to take responsibility for that office as well. 

[00:02:00]


[ Cheers and applause ] number five, I'm going to act to boost small business and all business. I'm going to issue executive orders aimed straight at the problems holing back this economy. The first is going to grant waivers to every state from obamacare to begin with. 
[ Cheers and applause ] and the second is going to launch a sweeping review of all the obama era regulations with an eye of eliminating or repairing those that are killi jobs! 
[ Cheers and applause ] by the way, every entrepreneur, every small business person, every job creator will know that for the first time in four years, the president and the government of the united states likes them and loves the jobs and higher wages they bring. 
[ Cheers and applause ] we've almost forgotten what a real recovery looks like. What americans could achieve when we limit government they have limiting the dreams of our fellow americans. 
[ Cheers and applause ] and the people of america, they're going to be able to choose the future because they need -- they know what they need to know, to know what the future will look like. They can stay on the path of the last four years or they can choose real change. Now, you know that if the president were to be reelected, he would still be unable to work with members of congress. He's ignored them. He's attacked them. He's blamed them. And of course, the debt ceiling is going to come up again and then there will be a threat of shut down or default and that, of course, chills the economy, puts more people out of work. The president was right when he said he can't change washington from the inside. You can take him at his word, that's why we're going to send him outside. All right? 

[00:04:03]


[ Cheers and applause ] now, when I'm elected, I'm going to work with republicans and democrats in congress. I'm going to meet regularly with their leaders. I'm going to endeavor to find those good men and good women on both sides of the aisle who care more about the country than they do about politics. 
[ Cheers and applause ] and together we're going to put the nation back on track to a balanced budget and to reform our tax code and to finally reaffirm our commitment to financial responsibility. 
[ Cheers and applause ] now, you know if the president were to be reelected, he would continue his war on coal and oil and natural gas. He'd send billions more dollars to his favorite friends in the solar and wind world and all of this means higher gasoline prices and fewer jobs. Today gasoline costs twice what it did when president obama took office. When I'm elected, we're going to change course on energy entirely. I know just how much energy means to middle class families in this country. We can help hold down prices at the pump and grow new energy jobs and manufacturing jobs with my policies. By the way, if the president were to be reelected, he's going to continue to promote government and demote businesses. You know, he put together his own jobs council. Did you know that? Business leaders he brought from all over the country. And they were people he picked. You know it's been nine months since he's even been willing to meet with his own jobs council. Now, you see, I see three enterprises -- free enterprise as a means for people to fulfill their dreams. Yesterday I met with a woman named rhoda elliott in virginia. She's been running her family restaurants, bill's barbecue, for years. A business that's been in her family for 82 years. And she employed 200 people at its high point. She just closed it down. She told me that the regulations, the taxes, the cost of obamacare, the obama era economy put her out of business. She teared up as she was telling me her story. Wasn't about the money. This was about the future for her family and for her family of employees. I want to help the hundreds of thousands of dreamers like rhoda and I will. 

[00:06:34]


[ Cheers and applause ] you know, if the president were to get elected, he's going to say every good thing he can about education. But in the final analysis, what he's going to do is what his largest campaign supporters insist upon and that's the public sector unions. Your kids would have the same schools and the same results. When I'm president, I'll be the voice of the children and their parents because there is no union for the pta. 
[ Cheers and applause ] I'm going to make sure that the parents get the information they need about how their school is doing and whether it's failing or succeeding and they get the choice they need to pick the school where their child has the best chance for success. 
[ Cheers and applause ] now, all across america, people have watched as our campaign has gathered the strength of a movement. It's not only the size of crowds like this. 
[ Cheers and applause ] I think it's also the depth of our conviction, our readiness for new possibilities, the sense that our work is going to soon begin. Made me strive more to be worthy of your support, to campaign as I would govern, to speak for the aspirations of allcans. I learned as governor of my state of massachusetts that the best achievements are shared achievements. I learned that respect and goodwill go a long way and are usually returned in kind. Ow I'll conduct myself as president. I'll reach out to both sides of the aisle. I'll bring people together doing big things for the common good. I won't represent one party. I'll represent one nation. 
[ Cheers and applause ] I'll try to show the best of america at a time when only our best will do. Throughout this campaign, president obama has tried to convince you that these last four years have been a success. He's floating a plan for the next four years. He wants to take all the things he did in his first term, the stimulus, the borrowing, obamacare, all the rest, and then try them all over again. 

[00:09:08]


(Booing) but big dreams that we have are not going to be satisfied with a small agenda that's already failed us. And so today president obama did something else. I guess it was yesterday actually. You probably heard about this. He asked his supporters to vote for revenge. 
(Booing) I ask the american people to vote for love of country. 
[ Cheers and applause ] 
(usa! Usa! Usa! ) we've got to lead america to a better place. Now we're three days away from a fresh start. Three days away from the first day of a new beginning. My conviction that better days e ahead is not based on promises or hollow rhetoric, but on solid plans and proven results and based on unshakeable belief in the faith of the american spirit. If there is anyone worried the last four years are the best we can do, if there is anyone who fears that the american dream is fading away, if there is anyone who wonders whether better jobs and better paychecks are simply things of the past, I have a clear and unequocal message. With the right leadership, america is going to come roaring back. 
[ Cheers and applause ] we're americans. We can do anything! 
[ Cheers and applause ] the only thing that stands between us and some of the best years we've ever seen is lack of leadership. That's why we have elections. This tuesday is a moment to look into the future and imagine what we can do to put the past four years behind us and start building a new future. You saw the differences, by the way, when president obama and i were side by side in the debates. 

[00:11:19]


[ Laughter ] he said it has to be this way. I say it can't stay this way. He's oering excuses. I've got a plan. I can't wait to get started. He's hoping we'll settle. But americans don't settle. We build. We aspire. We listen to the voice that says we can do better, a better life, a better life for our kids a bigger country, a better country! Look, there is a better life out there for us. It's waiting for us. Our destiny is in the hands of the american, in your hands. Three more days. Three more days and we can get to work rebuilding our country. Three more days and our confidence becomes restored and our conviction is even stronger. Confidence that we're on a solid path to steady improvement, confidence that college graduates coming out of school four years from now will be able to get good jobs. Confidence that the single moms working two jobs will have a shot at a much better job. On november 6, tuesday, we come together for a better future and on november 7, we're going to go to work. 
[ Cheers and applause ] now, I need you to reach across the street to your neighbor, with the other guy's yard sign in his front yard and I got to reach across the aisle in washington to people in good faith and the other party. It's much more than our moment. It's america's moment of renewal and purpose and optimism. We journeyed far and wide in this campaign for america's future. Now we're almost home. One final push, we're going to be there. Many long days, short nights. We're that close right now. The door to a brighter future is there. It's open for us. It's waiting for us. I need your help. I need your work. I need your phone calls. I need your vote. Walk with me. We can get this done together. Let's come together, america! 

[00:13:25]


[ Cheers and applause ] let's get america strong again! Let's make sure we remain the hope evident earth! Thank you so very much. You guys are fabulous! Thank you! 
[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> governor mitt romney trying to seal the deal with voters and the important state of colorado asking them if they want more of the same or if they want real change. Glad you're with us. I'm rick folbaum. 
>> Heather: I'm arthel neville. Welcome it a brand-new now inside america's election headquarters. We are awaiting the start of president obama's star studded event in the key swing state of iowa. Kate walsh and singer john mellencamp both making an appearance. 
>> Let's go back to colorado springs and chief political correspondent carl cameron traveling with the romney camp. This is now a sprint to the finish line, isn't it? What can learn about the final campaign steps? 
>> Well, he's going to a number of battle ground states where the polls are incredibly tight. We are now 73 hours and 45 minutes from the polls closing on the east coast. And mitt romney is racing around the battle ground states. We've been o iowa -- to iowa today. This event in colorado, then we'll fly to des moines and continue the sprint across country with visits in ohio and virginia, new hampshire, florida, all jammed up right straight through until monday night when he arrives back in the granite state of new hampshire, home of the first primary where his race began. We heard new rhetoric a moment ago. Talking about how he's going to restore confidence, confidence in the economy, confidence in the country's future, confidence in america's reputation around the world. Confidence in american government. An attempt by mr. Romney to say that not only is he ready to run the country, but he's ready to run it in a way with a bipartisan hand, something he's been talking about for the last couple of weeks. As all candidates tend to do despite all the partisanship, looking for swing voters. Mr. Romney recognizes that it is very, very close in ohio and new hampshire, the polls all indicate it's quite close. Romney's senior advisors acknowledge that as he said today, just a moment ago, the door is open and it's going to take a lot more work to walk through it to victory. For that, he needs people to rally and get out the vote, which is always what the final 72 hours is all about. 

[00:15:52]


>> In these time hours action the candidate and his staff working really around the clock. It's nonstop, one event to the next to the next. What is the mood like with the staff, with the candidates' family? What's it like on the trail with them? 
>> Reporters and candidates in campaigns always have a natural friction. But there is something of a disaster mentality that tends to take hold when you're almost going around the clock at this sort of high pitch, high pace. Today ann romney came back and shared with reporters a birthday cupcakes for the birthday of one of the romney staffers. And that's just a little idea of their attempts to even court the president n so many cases have been dogging mr. And mrs. Romney during the course of this campaign. And you get into a point where people start getting giddy. And mr. Romney has been a little giddy. I was told a story about how in the front of the plane we and his family and the senior staff sit, whenever anybody would go into the lavatory and lock the door, romney would go and bang on the door furiously trying to just mess with them. Which gives you an idea that there is some bit of light heartedness even in the intense competition that is this 2012 presidential campaign in its final moments. We'll send it back to you in new york. 
>> Carl cameron, soon to hit the road again, thanks so much. 
>> President obama barn storming across key battle ground states. Right now he's getting set to make remarks at an event in dubuque, iowa, with the hours ticking down until election day, the president is looking for another victory in a state that backed him four years ago. Ed henry is live on the bus in dubuque. So you heard that they're getting giddy in the romney camp. Any levity in the obama camp now? 
>> They feel very strong here. They think the president will be here in iowa in a few moments. Remember, as you noted, this is where it all started for him in 2008. In fact, his final rally monday night, late in the evening before he goes home to chicago to get ready for the returns will be right here in iowa. It's where it all starred for him. They think that kind of grassroots on the ground support is what's going to help him. Remember, iowa only has six electoral votes. Yet you have the president of the united states coming in here on this final weekend. Mitt romney, the republican nominee, was here this morning. A lot of high profile, high powered contact with the nominees themselves here in dubuque a smal area. Gives you an idea of how intensively they're fighting for every single electoral vote. What the president is doing on the stump, he was just in milwaukee. Slightly bigger battle ground, one democrats hoped they had locked down. He's playing defense there because mitt romney is making a strong charge there with paul ryan from wisconsin on the ticket. The president is trying to do in his stump speech is say wait, don't let mitt romney steal the mantle of change that he had in 2008. He's trying to seize it back and say that mitt romney has got failed policies of the past. Take a listen. 

[00:18:47]


>> In other words, wisconsin they're betting on cynicism. They figure they can outlast you. They figure you know what? These guys maybe get enthusiastic, but over time, that enthusiasm fades awaynd we're still here. But wisconsin, see, my bet is on you. 
[ Cheers and applause ] my bet is on the goodness and decency of the american people. 
>> Now, obama campaign officials told us they've reached an incredible milestone. They said they've had 125 million contacts with voters. These are over the phone, in person, door to door. They say that's more than double what the republicans have boasted. So they think what that translates to next tuesday would be really getting on the ground in states like iowa here and getting out their vote. One side will get their vote out. The other is not. We'll see who it is with three days away. 
>> We're watching. Stick with fox news on election night. Complete coverage begins here on fox news channel at 6:00 p.M. Eastern tuesday with bret baier and megyn kelly. You can also catch shepard smith beginning at 7:00 p.M. Eastern on the fox network. 
>> You can watch me along with harris faulkner and jonathan hunt starting at 8:00 p.M. On fox news.Com live. We'll be right back. Of. 

[00:23:54]


>> Rick: Governor romney seizing on something that the president said on the campaign trail in ohio. Take a listen. 
>> At the time the republican congress and senate candidate by the name of mitt romney -- no, no, no. 
(Booing). 
>> Don't boo. Vote. Vote. Voting is the best readvantage. 
>> Yesterday the president said something you may have heard by now that ink surprised a lot of people, speaking to an audience he said voting is the best revenge. He told his supporters, voting for revenge. Vote for revenge? Let me tell what you I'd like to tell you, vote for love of country. 
[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> Rick: Let's bring in our panel, jehmu green, fox news contributor. Tre harden, and former republican campaign manager and aide to the gop house leadership. Glad you're both with us. Jehmu, this was supposed to be the post partisan president. This was the president who was going to unite the country and bring people together. What kind of a get out the vote message is telling people to go out and vote for revenge? How does that bring people together? 
>> Well, rick, actually you're right on point because it is a get out the vote message, now, was this the most presidential thing that president obama could have said? Absolutely not. But are we giving out an award for the least presidential things? I think if we were, it would probably go to governor remain knee. But that's not what we're doing here, thank goodness. Who can forget when romney said who let the dogs out in 2008? I think I'm not going to miss as we finally close out this election is the nitpicking of all of these statements that are made. But it is get out the vote. It is rallying the base. But more importantly in the last few days, president obama has made his case. He has closed out this campaign, fighting for the same thing he has always fought for. 

[00:25:59]


>> Rick: I know. Before we get to -- jehmu. You know I love you. Before we got to the talking points, let me just go to tre for a moment of I think if nothing else, this comment has given governor romney quite an opening to go out there and to appear to be above the fray himself, to talk about patriotism and going out and voting for love of country. Not for something like revenge. 
>> Rick, ihink it's an odd comment. But I also think it's a sign of weakness and where the president views this race right now. You know, worked on a number of campaigns and typically an incumbent on the get out the vote effort is usually touting their record, yet this president is sending out a battle cry as if he's the challenger or the victim of some sort. You know, winning campaigns peak at the right time. Ane voter enthusiasm numbers right now show that the romney campaign is peaking at the right time. I think the president sees an election slipping away and when candidates see an election slipping away, they begin to throw darts. I think that's what he's doing here. 
>> Rick: Jehmu, we heard from governor rom in colorado springs and we're going to hear from both candidates over the next 72 hours leading up to tuesday. But governor romney seems to really be taking this opportunity in these last stump speeches to talk about the greatness of the country, to talk about a positive message going forward, getting to work on day one. Then you hear the president talking about revenge. I wonderf it was a poor choice of words, maybe not the most presidential thing to say as you said, or whether this is really more like a problem with the messaging in these last couple of days before the election. 
>> Look, I think governor romney has done an incredible job to move so far away from where he's been for the last two years of this campaign. He is trying desperately to become a moderate when he ran so far to the right just to win the primary. Now, i, as someone who worked on campaigns, I think that he probably made that shift a little bit too late, so that's why he's desperately trying to talk to independent voters, to talk to women in particular and say, hey, I'm acceptable. But he's probably run out of time and this campaign is going to come down to who voters trust. So as you see one candidate shifting himself like a shift shaker or a traveling salesman in a sense, that's not going to help him on election day. What president obama is doing, he is rallying the base. This is all about turnout right now. We're in the last few hours of early voting and that is what he was doing. Was it an inarticulate rallying cry? Probably. What's more important? Protecting the middle class. 

[00:28:40]


>> Rick: Trey, go ahead. 
>> I don't think the american people trust the type of people that use divisive and radioactive language as we've seen from this president, his campaign aides and many of his surrogates. I mean, there is a michael moore ad using profanity. You haven't seen the president ask that ad to go off the air. It's simple. When you have a record, you run on it. And negative campaigning, sure. Does it happen, is it part of politics? Yes, it is. But you also have to balance that out with a positive message for that to be effective. It's simply the obama campaign simply lacks that right now. 
>> Rick: Few seconds left. I want to get this from both of you. We're about to do a segment with judge janine pirro on possible legal maneuverings if this is close. Will we know, jehmu, at THEnd OF THE TUESDAY NIGHT Who our next president will be? 
>> I sure hope so. I'm going to be up late with everyone on election night. I think with how many people have turned out for early voting, with how many absentee ballots that have gone in, i think that we are going to know earlier than we did clearly in 2000. Even perhaps than we did in 2004 when kerry and bush also took it 
DOWN TO THE WIRE. >> Rick: Trey -- 
>> in weather it comes down to voting regulates, the problem we have is that there is a lot of voter intimidation that conservatives have been preparing for -- 
>> Rick: Real quick, will we know the winner on tuesday night? 
>> I think that there is a good chance that we won't. I think we're seeing numbers that are similar to 2000. So wouldn't surprise me if we won't know it until sometime wednesday, late morning. 
>> Rick: Thank you both. Appreciate your time. We'll be checking back real soon. 
>> You got it. Thank you. 
>> Arthel: They touched on it, both campaigns are gearing up for potentially big-time legal battles reminiscent of the year 2000 and bring out the headache pills, the hanging chads. What to expect. Remember this?

>> Arthel: New concerns about possible voter registration fraud in the critical battle ground state of ho o. Allegations that workers for a firm hire to do register voters may have forged signatures. It's the same allegation that acorn faced in the 2008 presidential election. Eric shawn has details. This is serious stuff. What sparked this investigation? 
>> Yeah. It really is. The name, adolph hitler. That's right. Adolph hitler. That's listed on an ohio voter registration card that was submitted, one of 200 sent to the election board. That's in cincinnati. Officials there have been investigating and believed about halfse names were fraudulent, frauds or duplicates. The names that were submitted on those cards that they believe were fraudulent and had problems with them were submitted by a washington, d.C. Company called field works. They do canvassing across the country. They say they mostly work with progressive causes and democrats. The chairman of the republican party, a member of the election board there, says voter registration fraud hurts our electoral process. 
>> What we've seen here should concern every citizen. We have someone doctoring registrations and you have the next step, that would be a serious move toward fraudulent voting. So we're worried about it. 
>> The case has been referred to local prosecutors. 
>> Arthel: If you register a name like adolph hitler, it's almost like it's a joke, you're expecting it to be caught. What are the field workers saying about this? 
>> They condemn this, too. They, in fact, say they brought the adolph hitler to the election boards and say they do not tolerate any fraud. We talked to chris gallowway and say they take extreme measures to make sure its employees hand in correct information. Here is part of the statement he gave. We feel it's our job to do due diligence. We have a high standard here. If we are n 100% sure of the card, we will flag it to the board of elections. One worker we talked to is sheryl n cincinnati. She told us that she didn't do anything wrong. In fact, she blamed the people she signed up. 

[00:37:18]


>> Came back o me and I just didn't like that. I'm real honest and stuff like that. It made me feel like I wasn't, like they couldn't trust me and stuff like that. That's why they had to let me go. 
>> Officials say three other former field works workers are being investigated in cleveland last month, another one pled not guilty to 22 felony counts of voter regisation fraud. That plea, not guilty by reason of insanity. Arthel? 
>> Arthel: I just rolled my eyes in the studio. Really? Come on. Voter fraud on any part, doesn't matter who is doing it, it's unacceptable. It messes messes with our democratic process. Thank you very much. 
>> Rick: With the race neck in neck in the final days before election day, we may not have a clear winner on november 6. Some analysts are comparing this election to the contests in 2000 and 2004. I don't even want to mention the words, hanging chads. Right now both campaigns are getting set for any possible legal challenges. What can we expect? Joining us is judge jeanine pirro. It's not enough to hire consultants. You got to lawyer up. 
>> These lawyers are poised and ready to jump. They are really, they're going to be at some of the election places. They're going to be ready to argue, especially in those battle ground states like florida and ohio. I think the interesting point is that americans may not know who their president is the day after tuesday. It may take a long time to get the absentee ballots, the provisional ballots, the overseas ballots. And the real issue, I think will probably come down to one of those states that is really in play with the electoral colle ohio and florida. 
>> Rick: You mentioned provisional ballots. These are ballots that people will be allowed to submit on tuesday, but there is some kind of a question about whether or not these folks are eligible to vote. So that's why they're called provisional. Then they have to prove their eligibility and that could take a little while. 

[00:39:27]


>> That's exactly right. The information that is on that -- regarding that person's voting has to be verified by local election officials. What that means is that the person's vote is called into question because maybe they showed up at the wrong precinct or maybe they didn't have proper i.D. Or maybe a poll watcher said something is going on. I can tell you, whether it's mickey mouse going in and voting under the name of someone who died 30 days ago. 
>> Rick: Or adolph hitler. 
>> It doesn't matter. There is a lot where you go back to local election officials and you verify the information. Make no mistake, this election is so close that now we've got these lawyers ready on both sides and they are teed up to make sure that this thing is accurate and I think I not going to be clear who the president is the next day. 
>> Rick: If you look at the polling, I mean, these races in ohio and in florida are so close, that we could conceivably see a margin of victory with the first count that is sort of smaller than the number of outstanding provisional ballots that are out there that need to be counted. 
>> That's exactly right. Let's assume that it comes down to one state. You've got to make sure they call it the margin of litigation for the lawyers, where the outstanding or provisional ballots at both is greater than the margin between obama and romney. So we can look at it and say, this is a state that we can't call yet because of provisional votes are bigger than -- what separates of two of them. 
>> Rick: So much is at stake. So much is on the line that if there is any question, you know we're going to see legal challenges and if 2000 is a example that we can look at, this could go to the supreme court again. Is that possible? 
>> Gee, you think? It's happened before. This election is so close. That's why it's so important for everyone to get out and vote. And with the lawyers making sure that no mistakes are made, i think that we've got to make sure that people try, especially when you look at new york and new jersey now, where are people going to vote? People who have no power, maybe a polling place, a ving place, has been moved. There is going to be a lot of issues. But the key is, in those swing states, probably florida and ohio and making sure that what we've got are issues that are legitimate issues for which there can be no playing around as we just talked about in ohio. 

[00:41:58]


>> Rick: If you look at the supreme court, though, and this is a court that was involved in a controversial decision with the health care law just a few months ago, john roberts wasn't on the court in 2000. But I'm sure he'd like to try to avoid having to get involved in any kind of a battle over this election. How does it go? What's t vote if this ends up going to the supreme court? 
>> That is a fantastic question. And I really think that with health care, the supreme court justices were concerned about being labeled as political. They knew there was a campaign coming that was going to trash them and say these supreme court justices are political. It should be very interesting if it does go to the supreme court. I think that the justices -- i don't think they're going to buckle to public pressure if it comes before them this time. 
>> Rick: They didn't last time of the I don't know why anybody would think they would this time. Justice with judge jeanine, on 9:00 p.M. Eastern time tonight right here on fox news channel. A great show. A great pleasure to talk to you. Thanks for doing this. 
>> My pleasure. 
>> Arthel: Very good. Right now we want you take to you debuick, iowa. President obama is making his closing arguments to voters there. Let's listen in. 
>> Feels good. Can everybody please give sandy a big round of applause? 
[ Applause ] give sandy's son a big round of applause for serving our country. 
[ Cheering ] give it up for john mellencamp. 
[ Cheers and applause ] it's wonderful to be here. For the last several days all of us have been focused on one of the worst storms in our lifetime that's been happening on the east coast. I know I speak for the country when I say our thoughts and prayers are with those who lost loved ones, people whose lives have been upended. Folks here in iowa know something t flooding. You remember what happened just a few years ago. Recovery process is tough. But when I visited new jersey, i told folks there that everybody all across the country feels the same way. We are going to be with people every step of the way down the long hard road of recovery. We're going to help them rebuild. We're going to do it together. That's what americans do. 

[00:44:23]


[ Cheers and applause ] in fact, in the middle of the tragedy, we were also inspired by heros running into buildings wading through water. Our first responders, our police officers, our firefighters, ems teams, neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy, leaders of differe parties work together to fix what's broken. A spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is, no matter how tough times may get, we always bounce back. We're all in this together. We rise or fall as one nation. That's what we believe and that spirit has guided this country along its improbable journey for two sentries now. It's carried us through the last four years. Remember in 2008 we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depression. Today our businesses have created nearly 5 1/2 million new jobs. The american auto industry is back on top. Home values are on the rise. We're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years because the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, the war in ira is over, the war in afghanistan is winding down. Al-qaeda is on the run. Osama bin laden is dead. 
[ Cheers and applause ] so we have made real progress these past four years. We're here this evening because we know we've got more work to do. As long as there is a single american who wants a job and can't find one, our job is not done. As long as there are families working harder but falling behind, we've got more work to do. As long as there is a child anywhere in iowa, anywhere in this country whose languishing in poverty or barred from opportunity, our fight goes on. Our fight goes on because we know this country cannot succeed without a growing, thriving middle class and strong sturdy ladders for everybody who united states of america. 

[00:47:05]


>> Arthel: President obama perhaps speak a double intender, a hurricane sandy saying no matter how bad the storm is, we are always bounce back, we're in this together. You can watch more of his speech on foxnews.Com, we're streaming live. As you saw president obama and governor romn, they're sharpening their focus in these final days before the election. The candidates rift through packed schedules today, urging supporters in key battle ground states to get out and vote. With time running out, what more can they do to sece a win on tuesday? Susan esdridge is a professor of law and political science at usc and fox news contributor. Good to see you. 
>> Good to see you, art. 
>> Arthel: So they're ving the closing arguments. Are these closing arguments really important, susan? Too they resonate with that undecided voter? 
>> Well, the funny part is by now what's really important is getting your vote out. In a funny way, all these rallies, actually or problem, if you were on the ground, as I've been many times trying to get that vote out, having to build a rally, it's sort of a distraction. So ultimately what the candidates need to do, they're doing this to chin up the base, generate excitement so their supporters will feel like yes, yes, we can do it. But basically at the very end what the candidates have to do, art issues is just get out of the way so the ground game can play its way up. 
>> Arthel: Do you think they should tailor those messages to those individual states? 
>> Well, they're hop scotching because every time you land in a state, you get some local news coverage. Usually what you do in these last days is you get on the airplane and you go and lab in as many places as you can. You touch done, you do a quick ehave not, you get some local coverage, you hope to generate somexcitement among your supporters, and then you make it to the next state. Do I think what they're saying today is intended to persuade undecided voters? Well, it would be nice if it did. But I think right now the real focus is communicating to your supporters, encouraging them, enlisting them, and making sure that every one much those folks gets out and votes. And frankly to disagree with judge jeanine, I don't think this is going to go to the supreme court. I don't even thinkt's going to go into wednesday. 

[00:49:30]


>> Arthel: Okay. You heard it here. Susan's prediction it will be a finavote come tuesday night. Let me ask you this before we go, you say that they're ginning up the base. If you can tell me, do you think it's a good idea for governor romney and president bush -- excuse me, president obama, at this point to go to those states where they're perhaps not in the lead? Is that a good idea? Good strategy? 
>> Well, you know, you try to put some states in play. Look, nobody is goingo massachusetts. All right? Nobody is going to new york. Believe me, nobody is here in california. With you along the way -- but along the way, you want to stop at states where if you're not in the lead, maybe you can make it competitive. Maybe you're within striking distance. You're not going to go to states that aren't in play at all. 
>> Arthel: All right. Always good to see you. You can read her syndicated column in newspapers across the country every wednesday and ay. We'll be back after this break. KEEP IT RIGHT HERE ON FOX NEWS.l One Cash Rewards CARD Gives you a 50% annual bonus. And everyone likes 50% more

>> Three more days. Been long.

D you will hear from key representatives from both campaigns. Death tollfrom super storm sandy is 109. Power out agesould last for days and no sign of help. Many people are suffering in the aftermath. We are live with the latest on the recovery effort. New developments on the beng terror attackings. Sources telling fox news that security was so bad officials were considering suspending operations. Hello. I am uma kumarajo. America's news headquarters right now. Hello, everybody. We begin with the final push for the white house. Governor mitt romney is chris crossing with stops new hampshire and colol and ohio. And president obama also has stops planned in wisconsin and virginia still to go. We have live team coverage over the next two hours and chief white house correspondant edhenry. First governor romney will end hisay. 
>> Good afternoon. There is talk on the campaign trail about something that president obama said yesterday when he was in ohio. He does this and said something about governor romney and the audience said don't boo but vote. He talked about senate cand date governor romney was opposed to clinton tax increases. Listen to where he took that yesterday. At the time the republican congress and a senate candidate by the name of romney. No, no, no. Don't boo vote. Vote. Vote is the best revenge. Voting is the best revenge. That is not a thing for the president to say. Romney campaign has a new adout that looks as a strange thing for the president to say and an odd reason to vote. Mitt romney worked that in new hampshire speech. 

[00:02:25]


>> Yesterday, the president said something you may have heard by now that surprised a lot of people. Speaking to the audience. He said voting is the best revenge. He told supporters voting for revenge. Vote for revenge? Let me tell you what I would want to tell you. Vote for love of country. Governor romney will be talking about that the rest of the day . Last night a huge rally in westchester, ohio to kick off the final three days of the election. More than 18,000 by local officials count there . Governor romney has moved away from all of the christicism of reasons to vote against president obama and here are reason to rote for mitt romney and driving the optimism for america's future. 
>> We are four days away from a fresh start. Four days away from the first day of a new beginning. My conviction that better days are ahead are nt on hollow rhetoric but on solid plans and unshakable faith in the american spirit. 
>> Expecting a lot of people in the aphitheater in colorado . 1.4 million early votes and republican leading with 547,00 and democrats at 397,000 and uma. 
>> Thank you very much. And our election team coverage continues with ed henry who is with the obama campaign. Ed? Good to see you. Perspective on where the president is in the reelection. Came here this morning to mentor a high school team and being with john mccain . The waning days in the 08 campaign john mccain came out with j the plumber. You remember one of his surrogates and beating up on senator barack obama and only 4000 people fit andts said john mccain can't get big crowds and then senator obama was nearby cleveland, the final weekend of an outdoor crowd of 80,000 people . This morning, barack obama is coming to the gym where john mccain and giving you on the perspective of enthusiasm being down. The president will bring out celebrities as he goes with yay z and stevie wonder and bruce springsteen and having concerts and rallis and trying in the early votersing states like ohio and florida and like colorado where their they are getting the early vote out there. And two other thing that is the president is trying to do. And he's struggling with enthusiasm. He is not the candidate of change and mitt romney is the cand date of change. The president bushing back and tough on mitt romney and said he is recycling old failed economic policies of the past . That is one way to push back and number two. President said in states like ohio theres progress on the economic front. Not enough. There is more ways to go. But here is progress. And the unemployment state wide is 7 percent and that is better than the national rate . If they can win here in ohio and wisconsin where the president will be. He will have a midwestern fire wall to prevent mitt romney from getting 270 electoral votes. Sunshine state of florida is a key state with 29 electoral votes and most with all swing state in play it is close. Latest numbers are showing in a new poll how tight the race is at the moment with the president slightly ahead. But looking at the clear politics average. Goch gov romney has the edge. Joining us now republican connie mack. Great to have you here today. 

[00:06:46]


>> Thank you for having me. Good to be with you. 
>> Early voting ends in the state where the turn out is big and people have been waiting for hour to vote. Are you surprised by the large turn out in the early voting? 
>> I am not surprised at all. I think that a lot of people in the state of florida who are not happy with the we have been going in this country and they want real change and excited to go out and vote for mitt romney. It is independents and democrats, too. It shows the pent-up frustration that people have and they want to get the country back on the right track and that's why they are stand nothing line. 
>> Democrats wanted early voting extended and governor scott no. What impact is that having there? 
>> You can tell by the lines people want to engage in the election and they are out in force. They are standing in lines and waiting to vote. T we have a certain amount of time for early vote we have a time for absentee ballots to come in and then on tuesday, election day . So there is plenty of time for people to get to the polls. 
>> The iowa corridor is a key spot. And 40 percent of the voters live in that area. Seniors are worried about health care. Why is the race so close right now. I think a lot of the seniors in the state of florida are concerned that with obama care, they know they are going to lose medicare advantage. There is a million seniors in the state of florida who will lose medicare advantage . President obama and senator nelson whacked away medicare advantage for our seniors and that is concerning and that's why the intensity is up in the state of the florida for republicans. 
>> In the final days before the election, what is the ground game going to be like? 

[00:08:47]


>> Get out to vote. We are traveling around the state. I have myus tour and the romney campaign is focused in the state of florida are getting out the vote and after the election, the story that everyone wil be talking about is how well the ground game was done for mitt romney and for me and others to make sure our republican voters get out to the polls, and also independents that have been identified as votes for romney and me. 
>> I knowou have a race going on as well how is your race shaping up at this point? 
>> It is very good. We feel likee will win by a couple of pointos election day. Senator nelson said one thing to the state of florida and done another thing in washington d.C.. And the people in the state of florida want somebody to stand up for them and that's what i will do. 
>> It is going to be engaging day on election day and into the night. Thank you for joining. And you keep close watch as we are, too. And thankou and all of the best to you. 
>> Thank you for having me. 
>> We'll go back to ohio where the campaign is making a final pitch. His campaign spokeswomen is there. 
>> Hi, great to be here. 
>> Nice to have you. I want to talk to you about the ground game. There is buzz about the president's comment in springfield, ohio say thag voting is the best revenge against governor romney. In the closing days, some are asking what happened to hope and change and why talk of revenge? 
>> I being the context here is important. We are here in ohio this morn in ohio yesterday and the president reminding people in the state that mitt romney is closing the campaign that is all scare tactics and scaring autoworkers in the state . Lage out false statements about themsing their jobs and he wanted to make sure if they don't like the policiless they don't like the plan he's presenting for the middle class go to voting booth and cast their battle and nothing more complicated than tha 

[00:11:03]


>> and I know the presidents meet with fema officials and folks are suffer negligent aftermath of hurricane sandy, pleading for faster aid response. The president is promising to cut the red tape. What is he doing about it right now? 
>> I have been with him the last two days and every tim he gets off of the stage he's on the phone with local officials and first responders and mayors and governors and focused on every moment . Day to make sure they are resources and I know he spoke to a number of officials in new york and hopefully they will get more of the response they are looking for. 
>> Coming back to the economy. He said he would cut the deficit in half by the end of the first term and unemployment rate would be 5.2 and yet we have 23 million peop unemployed despite the fact that 175,000 jobs were added. Economt say it is slow. What is your message to voters who are frustrated to the record. 
>> The message is, the president came in the wort economic recession and thirty-three 32 straight months of private sector job growth and we know we are move nothing the right direction and needs to goer. The president has a better plan and vision for the middle class. 
>> And regarding libya. A number of congressam leaders are upset by the white house continuing to ignore the request for information and on the libya attack that kill would four americans and charging there is a cover up under way. Does the preside owe the american people a full accounting of what he knew before election day. 
>> The president is clear and our record shows this as information as become available we made it available to the american people. This is a tragedy but this is not time for politicalizing a tragedy. This is a time for getting down and figuring out what happened and releasing that information and learning from that and moving forward. That's what the president is doing. 

[00:13:08]


>> Why would it be polilizing if you are just trying to get the facts of four americans kill and would why not answer the questions as to what happened? 
>> Well, we have been releasing information. The administration I should say has been releasing as it is available. It is a tragic event. When the president is on the phone with a national security team he's focused on making sure we get to the bottom and making that information available. As you know, the administration is participating with reports and investigations that are going on across the government. And as soon as that information is available and final report is completed, that will be released. But this is not time to treat it like a football. American people deserve that. 
>> And thank you for joining us. And I know you have a crowd behind you and a busy weekend for all of you. Wish you all of the best. 
>> It will be. 
>> Thank you for joining us. 25 million people in district of columbia will vote early in the election. A third of all votes are expected to be cast before the actual election day. Did you vote early and was it worth it or do you follow a traditional path and wait until election day? Tweet your answers at hurricaneuma. I would love to read your answers later on in the show. 
>>> And turning to a story that raises concern. The storm after the storm. There are more than 900,000 people who don't have power in new york and new jersey. Residents are pleading for help for the basics to getting food and water and shelter and now news that another winter storm is on the way. Many people in the area may not have power for another week. Images of gas stations with long line and president obama just ordered 12 million gallons of gasoline sent in the region and new jersey governor issued a executive order rationing gas in 1 counties. It is from staten island and the devastation is very, very apparent. Ana? 

[00:15:31]


>> It is very true, uma, hurricane sandy responsible for 169 deaths n and 22 of those right here on staten island. It is three hundred yards from the atlantic ocean. In this neighborhood there is not a home not completely destroyed. The business here has been in the family years and years, not only lost his business but home, too. We spoke to residents and town leaders and they were fed up with the red cross and federal government. They say aid is slow to come andegging forood, water and blankets. We have seen national guard boots on ground and handing out information and manning two distribution centers. Really trying to get out information for fema as well. New york governor andrew cuomo is pledging 100 million fromm the state for hurricane sandy victims and said transportation is improving. 80 percent of the subways service has been restored, that is uer literally under one week. 80 percent of the subway has been restored from what was horrendous damage. And the worst damage that the subway system had ever seen. Well, governor cuomo announced five emergency mobile gas station will be set up in the new york city area with free gas and limit of 10 gallons per person. And new jersey governor with odd and even. Residents with even will buy gas on even days. We have seen dozens of volunteers and organizing themselves via facebook and twitter and bringing their own tools and shovels and garbage bags and helping out fellow man. 
>> It is a toughuation. I hope they get the help they need fast. 

[00:17:35]


>> Thank you very much.

>> Nice to be here. 
>> Hi, uma. 
>> The jobs report came out and do you think that adding 170,000 jobs in a month in the final days that news will impact at a time when we have 23 million people unemployed and one out of the six people in poverty and what impact will that have? 
>> I think most people have made up the mind. The negative is at the heart of gop's mitt romney's campaign . Contradictory message is you look at consumer confidence. Jobs report yesterday and look at wall street record highs and corporate profits and they are saying we are going in the right direction. But the facts are. You have good moment where you have good feeling and that's good news for the president. I don't know it shifts votes, he side stepped something if the numbers were bad, you can imagine the republican campaign. 
>> What do independents want? Are they undecided at this point? 
>> They might be and the race in terms of the popular vote is so close. It being make a difference. The presint had a good week with the storm . Governor christie's complimentary can comment and the jobs report that signaled progress being made. 
>> Two problems for the president. First of all with the hurricane and appearance on the new jersey coastline, look that was important. But this is the bear minimum of what we expect from the president of the united states. You have a gnarl disaster and national emergency. This is his job can and what we expect. He will not get traction politically of that. And the job jobs go look. American people and you are seeing it reflecting in the polls and mitt romney's momentum. They reyect they understand presidents have turne around grim economic situations in one term. Namely ronald reagan. He limited government and lowered taxes and regulaty reform and the opposite thingings of what barack obama has done . He had a recovery whenwhere we gained 800,000 js a month and we had a economic growth rate of 5-9 percent. And thatot what is happening now . Politicings is a perception game, among the american people things are not getting better they are stag instant. 

[00:25:18]


>> And talk about the final push in the last few days. The president plans ohio, wisconsin and iowa and colorado and new hampshire and go back to wisconsin on monday. What does this say about the president's strategy at this point juan? 
>> This election. We talk about the horse race and the numbers being close. It comes down to the swing states and specific to ohio and right now fyou look at swing states with the exception of north crolina, in most of the swing states. President obama has the lead and some cases it is a narrow lead and he has the advantage. I think that is where both candidates are going to be in the midwestern states and that's what they consider their fire wall and mitt romney is trying to expand the map . You can see he, too, will be in the midwestern statings. 
>> Mitt romney not leaving anything to chance special traveling to pennsylvania. What do you think about that? 
>> You can tell a lot about a campaign in the waning days and shape and what they are thinking by where they put their time and spend their time and resources. President obama is now force to play defense in a lot of state that is he thought he would win easily like wisconsin and minnesota and pennsylvania, now. Where governor romney is putting out couple millions worth of ads and doing a big rally in pennsylvania tomorrow. They think that that is winable . It looks like the race is tilting strongly to governor romney and he is putting resource in ohio a key state and other states where president obama had it locked up. Not anymore. 
>> Let ask you about benghazi. Do you think that the president owes it to the american people to talk about what he knew about the election . Talking about the investigation and obviously not completed until after the election. But he's not answering the questions they are asking . Not getting responses. Do you think that the american public needs to come clean.

>> Both have packed schedulings. Right now gom gom is on the rally to iowa. He start in new hampshire and will end in colorado . President obama will finish up in ohio and head to wisconsin, iowa and virginia. 
>> Fox obtained exclusive information showing that the state department was warned about security concerns about the consulate in lib rabefore the attack. U.S. Officials in benghazi came up with a plan to close the consulate and move to the cia annex. It was secretary to secretary of state less than a month before the attack.

>>> And viewers, if you would like to see the president speang in the rally. It is streamog fox news.Com. 
>> Those new documentsing the libya attack are raising questions about security concerns and why the administration failed to respond to a request for help when the consulate was under attack. Florida congressman, welcome and thank you for joining us today. 

[00:35:37]


>> Thank you for the opportunity operations in libya were to be suspend moved to a cia an lex there. What do you make of this? 
>> This label explains why the administration so quick to lie yes, lie and repeatedly because this cable shows that the obama administration had been warned explicitly in a detailed way that the security situation in benghazi deteriorating rapidly and that the personnel there could nolt with stand a coordinating attack. And the cable points out there were 10-15 training catches was islamic militants training nearby the consulate and that the security personnel there had requested additional help and a request turned down once and again, and again. And so this cable is disturbing. It shows that the administration had been told. We do not have enough personnel to with strand a coordinated attack we have extremist nearby . We are requesting additional help and yet what we got from the administration time and again, no help for the people in benghazi, and lying to the american public and this explains why they were talking about a spontanous demonstration and why the administration was blaming it on a video. Because they knew that if the word got out that they were explicitly warned one month before the emergency meeting and the cable went to everyone. They decided to do nothing. Four americans died and that is what the american public needs to remember. 
>> In one of those vocal critics is antior john mccain saying that the obama administration is a classic scandal and cover up with water gate overtonings, do you agree with that? 

[00:37:41]


>> I think it is far worse than a cover up. A cover up is bad enough and i do believe that there a cover up . I agree with what ambassador john bolton said. He think is it part of the vision they have and the ideology of the obama administration that has blinded them from the very real threats that consulate in benghazi was facing or that any americans serving over seas is facing. Not only have the senators sent 7 letters requesting information from the white house they have yet to receive. I in my capacity have sent letter after letter to administration officials asking for the documents just like I am asking for the classified document that fox news has and time and time again, we are left with a closinged and classified briefing. This is an administration that doesn't want to tell the truth to the american public and don't want to do it in a open setting. We are callog the administration to come cleann and come and appear before our committee on foreign affairs and explain about this document. When they received the classified cable, saying that the benghazi consulate was under siege, that the deteriorating situation is more violent every day, and that in fact the repeated violence in their words the new normal, nothing done about it and the request for additional security was denied. Shame on the administration, four americans died. Congresswoman, thank you for your thoughts. We appreciate your comments. 
>> You bet. Thank you. 
>>> And if ohio is particularlyy close, there is a chance the presidency could hinge on the buck eye state.

>> Welcome back. The final weekend before the big election. President obama an mitt romney making ohio the final priority. And mitt romney made 11 trips and here's why. A rasmussen poll show they are tied. The president has a small lead . Joining us with perspective from the swing state of the ohio is mike huckabee. Joining us today. Welcome to have you here today. 
>> Great to be with you from columbus, ohio. I know you have a big show out of ohio . So many believe that the fate of president obama and mitt romney hinges on that state . What are you hearing about the mood of the electorate. 
>> Think in the south it is tight as a tick on a dog which means it is very, very razor close. I do sense there is eye -- an momentum for mitt romney. There is energy on the part of the romney voters and you can see it when the crowds and voters and I don't see that barack obama. He his the union voterss and younger voters. But I don't see the enthusiasm and nothing like what that sort of the remarkable energy four years ago for him. 
>> The polls continuing and showing a tight race. And at this point, we are not seeing the president at 50 percent and when an uncumbent is not at 50 independents usually break away from the challenger in the final days of the campaign. 
>> That's the conventional wisdom in politicings. Undecided voters break for the challenger because they know who the incumbent is. My goodness. They have seen him for four years. You have to wonder who is undecided. It is not like they are similar in the approach. It is like I can't decide because they are the same. They are very much different and I can't imagine a voters being this close to the election and saying I can't make up my mind. I think the independent and undieded will break to the challenger and say let's give somebody else a chance. Four ore years of what we had four years of. I don't see that helping us getting jobs. 

[00:46:45]


>> Let me judge -- ask you about libya. Are you surprised that mitt romney hasn't made this a front burner issue on the campaign trail? 
>> I think he's afraid to. Because the national media hasn't made an issue of it. And he's not reaching out in the big blue sky and come up with something in the last minute. I am not hur it is the best one. I think it is a huge story and the most important story out there. And if the president and/or his administration or somebody, we don't know who yet. We know somebody lied to us and a massive cover up and the story keeps change we have four dead americans that. Is a big story and demands answers. And no one can get consistent answers. And if the national media other than fox news which has done a good job of covering it. Particularly katherine and jennifer. Other media outlets are not pushing it. I think mitt romney is the reluctant to go out on the point for it. 
>> I know you have a big show and urge viewers to tune in tonight. Thank you for joining us today. 
>> Thank you, uma. In this razor thin election voters fraud could play a role. Still to come. Eric shawn lookings at illegal activity in ohio. A state that could determine who takes the white house .

>> Hi, uma, adolph hitler. That name has appeared on an ohio voters registration card all part of the fraudulent voters registration here in ohio right on the eve of the 2012 election.

It is a company based in washington d.C. That conducts voters registration and ballot drives and describe them working with democratic and progressive causes . But one of the members .

A employee who reviews and categorized those who are incomplete and flag things that contain issues of fraud and be fraudulent. We have a high standard here and not 100 percent of the card we flag it back to the board of election. One of the former fired field works employees in cincinnati told us she didn't do anything wrong. She blames people tho who signed the cards for possible wrong doing.

=======================================================

Election. Down to the wires, three days to go until the election and nine swing states, and the candidates in seven of them today alon president obama is travelling it four states, ohio, wisconsin, iowa and virginia, governor mitt romney will be hitting three, new hampshire, iowa and ohio. And hour number two of america's news headquarters starts right now. In washington, and the second hour of america's news headquarters starts at this moment. And topping our news off right now, we're going to talk to you about the live election team coverage that we have in play with three battle ground states. Ohio, virginia, and florida. Steve brown is live in mansfield, ohio, peter doocy ve in fairfax, virginia, and steve harrigan, tampa, florida. And steve brown in ohio, a state that many say is a must-win for either candidate. Steve. 
>> Reporter: Hey there, uma, yea basically two, you can break ohio down into two contests, a contest that's leading up to election day and that's the early vote and there's the contest that goes on on election day and the regular voting and the early vote is the contest that's going on right now. And we're in the final hour of early voting here on saturday, it ran into 8 until 2, or runs from 8 until 2 here, and this is a very important portion of the equation, for the obama campaign. They have really made this a center piece of their particular strategy and had a lot of help in the persons of travelling here to the state of ohio, to help them get that vote out, to try and gin up the excitement, if you will, a little bit about getting those votes done early. Richard trumka, the president of the afl-cio was speaking at an event in columbus today, talking about the importance of getting people out to vote. Here is why. The obama campaign made it a sfr piece because they believe they can win it and get younger people out to the polls and people out there camp to the polls and president obama has a lead going into the early vote. And absentee, is stron enough, because the republicans believe they'll win in the election day voting. 

[00:02:26]


>> Peter doocy is live in fairfax, virginia where national polls are showing the race between governor mitt romney and president obama is a statistical dead heat. Peter? 
>> That's right, uma, here in fairfax county today, virginia's largest locality. 1.1 million people live here and barack obama won this county by 109,000 votes in 2008. Helping him win the state of virginia, we've seen a steady stream of people walking from the parking lot into the polls, today is the last day in virginia and you can vote absentee in person and since every vote is important in virginia in 2012, asking them what it is that's driving their vote. 
>> And I'm going to school, not around re, so I had to come back for it. And the most important issue would probably be for me, the military and the economy. And what's going to happen with it. 
>> I think it's really important that we have a president who understands the needs of all the people and isn't just focused on the wealthiest. 
>> I'm probably going to say jobs, especially with the insurance with obamacare because what they're doing right now is, I just don't think that washington has any comprehension what's going on. 
>> I want bipartisanship and people working together is my biggest issue. 
>> My wife is alwaysright. 
>> So, it's interesting to get their perspective, even though most of them do not want to say o they were voting for and it's worth pointing out, uma, the senate race is airtight as well. Republican george allen and democrat tim kaine raised combined 30 million dollars, outside groups pumped in another 40 million and at this point today, three days out, they are essentially tied. Back to you. 
>> Wow, a very, very tight race indeed. Thank you very much. We'll wrap up our team coverage in florida where governor romney is maintaining the lead over the president and two key voting blocks in florida, and seniors and hispanic vote eand steve harrigan is standing by with more on all that, what can you tell us? 

[00:04:29]


>> Uma, an intense ground effort underway by both spain to try t get out the vote on the last day of early vote, 3.5 million people in florida have voted and the lines at the tampa polling place pretty good by florida standards, one hour wait here, some places like in miami-dade county, up to three hours. The last eight days, 15 days last year, and some county election officials asked to extend it through sunday and he's not going to do that. Thi county right now, hillsboro, a swingounty and bellwether, gone with the winner. Presidential race every time except once. And they know their vote matters. 
>> I know some cases people are in line for hours and do they seem to be minding the fact that it's taking long to cast those early ballots? 
>> I think people have been prepared for it because it's a long complicated ballot. They knew there would be a wait, but it's remarkable to see here, the patience, a number of parents holding their children and people reading their book and even physically disabled people, a man in a wheelchair waiting patiently in line, realizing the importance of what they're doing and admirable the patience today. 
>> Lots of momentum in florida, thank you very much, steve. 
>> Hsaid he would cut the deficit in half, instead, it's double what it was. He said he'd get unemployment by now down to 5.2%, and we learned today, it ticked up to 7.9%, that's 9 million jobs short. 
>> That was governor mitt romney calling out president obama for falling-- 9 million jobs soar has promised. And the bureau of labor and statistics, adding 171,000 jobs, now are the new numbers going to affect the way the candidates talk about the economy in these final days before the election in joining us now with perspective, a mitt romney supporter who deals firsthand with unemployment issues, governor jan brewer of arizona. 

[00:06:46]


>> Good morning. 
>> Let's talk for a moment about the jobs numbers that came out yesterday, and the president is saying that the fact that 171,000 jobs have been added shows that his policies are working and taking a little longer than he had he' hoped, but that the country is moving in the right direction. And what's your response to that? 
>> Well, you know, we're all grateful as things are, are turning around a little bit, but the bottom line is unemployment has grown and he made a big promise when he ran four years ago, that he was going to turn our country around and he has not done that. So, I believe people are disappointed and they're ready for change and the enthusiasm that we're seeing out there on the campaign trail, is just unbelievable. And I believe that people are going to go to the polls and they're going to cast their vote and they are he' going to cast it for mitt romney because they know that he has something that will definitely turn the economy around and get those out to the tens of thousands of people that have no jobs. 
>> Do you think though at this point the fact that these numbers have come out, just days before the election, will they actually have any impact though with people who are ally undecided at this point? 
>> Well, I believe that people are probably, some of them, a the lot of them are waiting until the last minute to vote this weekend, and on election day on tuesday for the bottom line, is that we've got thousands, tens of thousands of people that still don't have jobs and jobs in the economy is what makes america, what it is. And that's what keeps our families going. And president obama has had four years of failure, he hasn't delivered. And it's time for people to stand up, cast that vote and get america turned around. You know, he says that he would cut the nation's debt in half. At the end of his first term, if he couldn't do that, it should be a one term proposition, of course, now, the president continues to say that he needs more time. How do you think that's playing with the american public and particularly people in your state? 

[00:08:51]


>> Well, in arizona and i think across america, people are tired of hearing the president always blaming everybody else for his failures and making excuses. He's out in the country, flying around and talking about silly stuff that's no important to people. He's not talking about the issues that the people are concerned about, people want to talk, and they want to hear his plan for a recovery. And how is he going to create these jobs and how is he going to stop this unemployment in and he's not doing that. You know, he's talking about silliness, so I believe they're going to respond by casting their vote and on tuesday, for mitt romney, he's the hope for the future. 
>> Governor, thank you so much for joining us today. We appreciate your insight. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Well, that's 25 million people in 34 states and district of columbia will be voting early in the election, about a third of all votes in the election are expected to be cast before actual election day and we want to know, did you vote early and was it worth it or do you follow the traditional path and wait until election day? 
>> Gets your answers to us, we'll take a look at them. And she waited 90 minutes and 39 degree temperatures, voted romney and very much worth it. And everett writes, I enjoy going to the polls. All those years in the military I had to vote absentee. So, those are just a sampling, we are getting a lot of respons tweeting@hurricane uma and we'll read your answers, people are picking up the pieces from sandy.

>> So I -- so, I made this mistake in des moines a week ago today, when it was very much colder-- 
>> that's the senator chuck grassley from iowa. We're awaiting mitt romney's remarks and he's going to be appearing that shortly about 1:30 and when that happens we'll bring you the governor's remarks live, of course, a busy day of campaigning. Lots of stops in the key swing states and iowa happens to be one of them and it's a busy news weekend here, certainly, covering the candidates and what it's going to take to win come election day, moving along now, it's the storm after the storm. More than 900,000 people still don't have power in new york and new jersey, and now there's news, another winter storm is on the way. And joining us now from the campaign trail where he' stumping very hard for governor mitt romney, former new york mayor rudy guiliani. Mmayor, thank you for joining us today. 
>> Very nice to be with you. 
>> Uma: Let's talk about what's happening in new york and new jersey. I know a lot of people are suffering there, people have been coping with long gasoline lines, a lot of places don't have gas, people are looking for some of the basic needs of food, shelter, water. Wt do you think of the response so far? 
>> I think that the president has gotten high marks from the media and I think those high marks areserved, in the last couple of days not paying attention what's going on in new york and new jersey. And I've been there, tragedy they're suffering the way they are. Fema is not responding should benough generators in new york by now that a lot of the loss of power is alleviated. The gasoline lines are a mile long. There have been violent confrontations on some of these gasoline lines. If the president were paying attention, fema would be much more on the ball and the fact is that the media does not hold him to account, the way had he held president bush to account when katrina was going on. 

[00:16:47]


>> Why do you think the media is not being held to account on this one. 
>> They want to reelect one. Same reason they haven't asked him the key questions on libya. He still hasn't bee asked, did he know about the two prior attacks on that consulate in the months leading up to the attack on september 11th, the american consulate in benghazi was attacked twice. That should have put the president on alert that that consulate was a target, and it should have been protected. It was not protected and our american citizens died there because of the confidence. The media is afraid to ask the questions. Brian williams had a half hour interview with him. Never bothered to him, mr. President did you know about the two prior attacks, one of which with a hole 12 feet wide in the wall. If you did know about it how come you turned down the request for additional security. 
>> Uma: I mean, we still don't know what was happening in the situation room or if the president was in the situation room that day. We do know that our ambassador was king, pleading for more security even on the day he died, september11th, saying he was very concerned about a possible terrorist attack, which indeed did manifest itself. Right now though, there are those who are saying the president owes it to the american public to fill out the facts, spell it all out and tell the american people what he knew and when he knew it. But he doesn't want to say anything before election day. 
>> Well, the president absolutely owes the american people an explanation, as to whether he knew about the two prior attacks. That's a simple question, could be a very simple answer, he either did or didn't know about the two prior attacks, if he did know why didn't he give extra, why didn't he give extra security to the consulate and if he didn't know, what the heck is wrong with his national security apparatus. 
>> And going forward with this, in terms of the information we're getting we knowhat the white house knew within 24 hours that this was indeed a terrorist attack and yet, continued to talk to about this anti-muslim video or a few weeks after the fact, saying it was a result of a spontaneous attack and what happened at the consulate. And our own reporters, catherine herridge, have been coming up with dynamite information spelling out some of the details and logistics of what was going on. What's been your reaction to the news as it's been unfolding? 

[00:19:15]


>> Well, I just said what i just said, and in green bay, wisconsin, the people came up to me and one lady grabbed me and said, you make sure the media reportshis because it's a smelly coverup. 
>> Uma: And-- 
>> she might have had more insight into it than a lot of vaunted experts who report on the news and you're quite right, fox is reporting here those two, those two young ladies covering it deserve the pulitzer prize. 
>> Uma: Let me ask you about your campaigning this weekend. I know you're going nonstop for mitt romney and that you've been on a bus with others trying to, you know, get a sense of what's out there in terms of the mood and the excitement that has-- that you'ven saying has been building for mitt romney. Tell me about the ground game at this point. 
>> Well, I'm travelling with a group of people, including senator coleman, great senator from minnesota and mayor of st. Paul and we're in wisconsin for today. Everybody's been assigned to different states. We believe that wisconsin is a state that we have a good chance of winning. The enthusiasm we saw in g bay was tremendous for the morning hours, and tremendous turnout. These people seem to be willing to do anything to get mitt romney elected ando be rid of barack obama. So, I think that wisconsin is a state that we have a really good chance of winning. 
>> Uma: When you take a look at what people are saying to you, are they saying that in addition to the economy, that they are really indeed very concerned about the way the libya situation has been handled then? 
>> I -- I believe that the people know a lot more about benghazi than people realize. I think there has been going on now for six weeks. The administration has lied about it so often they have gone so far in covering it up, that I think that people are beginning to focus on the fact tha something very wrong happened there, that if we had a president who was a real commander-in-chief, if we'd had john mccain in the white house or mitt romney in the white house, as soon that consulate was attacked back in april and then in june again, it would have gotten more security. Then, when the president found out on september 11th that it was under attack now for a thtime, he wouldn't have relied on the libyan governor to protect our people or cia operatives. Would have send the military immediately and not wonder whether he offended the libyan government. Who gives a darn if you offend the libyan government if american lives are at stake, particularly if they demonstrated in the months before they could not protect that consulate. That's why it's important to know whether the president know about the prior attacks? Because if he did know, then his inaction is totally inexcusable. 

[00:22:20]


>> Uma: Mr. Mayor, it's a pleasure to have you on the show today. Thank you so much for joining us. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> Uma: I know you've got a very busy weekend and hope to see you soon and I know you're going to beg the results very closely come tuday, thank you. 
>> Thank you, uma, thank you very much. 
>> Uma: Well, everybody's been saying the unemployment rate has risen again. Showing how listless the economy is. And the labor department showing two green arrows, while 171,000 jobs were created last month. The other green arrow seems to be the problem that the unemployment rate went up to 7.9%, fair and balanced, angela McGlowan and former spokesman for howard dean's campaign. Thank you ladies foreing here, welcome. 
>> Thank you for having us. 
>> Uma: Angela, let me begin with you about the jobs report. The fact that we have add more jobs is a hopeful sign, but for many people it's too little too late. 
>> You're exactly right, uma, a little too little, too late from the standpoint when people go to the polls, are you better off today than you were four years ago, and with women, the unemployment rate has gone up. Amongst blacks in september the unemployment rate in the black community was 13.4%, and uma, now it's at 14.3%, in the hispanic community it's increased and I can go on and on and on and the reason why mitt romney has closed the gender gap with president obama amongst women because women care about the economy and jobs, though more jobs were created with the jobs report and 7.9%, below 8%, still, people are out of work. 
>> Let's tk about the 7.9% number. It's certainly not good news and something that's very discouraging to a lot of folks who are still looking for work and 23 million people in the country who remain unemployed, not to mention the fact that a the lot of people just stopped looking for work altogether. How does the obama administration respond to that number at a time when people are hurting? 

[00:24:25]


>> That number is misleading, what we're actually seeing is consumers coidence is at the highest level in four years, what that means is that bob jones in toledo is seeing something that joe smith at goldman sachs might not be, that the job numbers, pretty good 171,000 new jobs what you said, and again, it's growing and the small up tick in the unemployment rate is actually a different measure and pretty insubstantial. 
>> Angela, we have one out of six people living in poverty. 
>> Yes. 
>> And that's a sobering number here in 2012 when many people expect that we should be doing much better than that and people shouldn't have to be suffering in such a way. 
>> Uma, after 814 billion dollars stimulus package after a 26 billion dollar stimulus package was supposed to create jobs and then the auto bailout and then we've had solyndra, so much money has been wasted and the president when he started, I cannot cut the deficit. If I cannot bring more prosperity to america then it's going to be a one-term proposition and I think on tuesday, it's going to be a one-term propition. It's all about messaging, and unfortunately, the liberals, they've had a message of cisiveness, a message of redistribution of wealth and romney has talked about what he's going to do to create a more prosperous america and on tuesday we're gog see a difference. 
>> Let me ask you this, the fact na the president said he was going to cut the deficit in half, again, in his first term, that didn't materialize, is that not troubling to you? 
>> I think that you're right, that people out there are going to be voting on the economy, but I don't think that they're persuaded by mitt romnes message. Whatou're seeing is nothing, but desperation and the closing message is false, erroneous jeep ad that everyone from gm and chrysler to every paper in the state has come out and said is untrue. I don't think a winning campaign closes by trying to scare people into voting for them. 

[00:26:29]


>> Christy, and you'right when the ad firste out there was some inaccuracy there, but it was corrected and the bottom line is this: With the auto bailout it was suppose today create more jobs with chrysler 
>> it did. 
>> Chrysler now expanded its business to china. So actually the president talked about mitt romney putting jobs in china, when actually our tax dollars went to create more jobs in china. 
>> Angela, that's not true. That's absolutely not true. As I said, everybody's who's debunked the ad, the romney campaign is looking to scare people and I can't imagine you'd do if you're winning in ohio. 
>> No, christy, in the ad, mitt romney says that chrysler was taking jobs from ohio. Chrysler is expanding its business to china and creating jobs in china. 
>> Angela, that's not near the ad-- 
>> let me jump in, seconds left. 
>> Sure. 
>> We've got really tight races in the key swing states and fact is it is very close and given that, what are your expectations come tuesday? We've got a lot of of people dealing with early voting and turnout has been really good. Is ohio a must-win for either candidate to they're going to secure the presidency? 
>> Yes-- 
>> ohio, yes, a must-win, if romney didn't win ohio if he takes wisconsin, nevada, iowa, wisconsin new hampshire, a chance he could win pennsylvania and virginia. 
>> Yes. 
>> Uma: That's going to have to be the last word unfortunately we're out of time and appreciate you joining us and always great to see both of you. 
>> Great to see you, too. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Uma: New hampshire, iowa and colorado all in one day. Waiting to see from mitt romney in iowa and where we find campaign carl cameron, hi, carl.

>> Welcome back everybody. Right now we're awaiting governor romney's campaign speech in dubuque, iowa. And the candidates are talking revenge versus love. And we've got a big crowd out there. We're waiting to hear from the governor because they have been waiting in this swing state for quite some time, and very chilly out there of course, and the governor is set to address the crowd. And this is one of many stops we're making this weekend, a very busy weekend from both candidates and the president and mitt romney. Let's listen in. 
>> Boy, it's great to be here, richard petty, nascar fame and champion, thank you for being here, senator grassley, have you hit any deer lately? Those of you who watch his blog know he bummed into a deer the other day and said unfortunately didn't make it, the deer didn't make it. But was itdelicious? 
(Laughter) 
>> I have the next first lady of the united states with me here, ann romney (chee) 
>> you all know that iowa holds a very special place in our hearts. We've been in so many of your communities and we have come to love this state and love its people. 
(Cheers) 
>> we also know why you're here today. It's because you love america. I'm standing next to a guy that I've been married to for a long time, 43 years, and i know him-- I know him so well and everything he's done, he's achieved excellence in our marriage, in raising our five boys, in business, as a governor, as turning around the olympics and I can't wait to see him do the next turn around. 

[00:34:13]


(Cheers) 
>> may I introduce to you, the next president of the united states. 
(Cheers). 
>> . 
>> Uma: Well. 
>> Three more days. 
>> Three more days! 
>> Three more days, exactly right. And I'm-- 
>> three more days, three more days! 
>> Now, I know most of you here have decided who you're voting for in three more days. But you have some neighbors who haven't made up their minds yet so I want to make sure that arguments that you need to get them on our team, paul ryan and i change america, and some folks putting aside the demands are daily life and focusing on this campaign and may want to know what the future is going to hold depending who becomes the next president. Who is going to affect their life and their family's life. Who is going to affect the country in the way that will make the greatest difference. You can go back and remind them, that words are cheap. You can say whatever you want to say in a campaign, but what you could achieve, results, those are earned. Those can't be faked. And you see, four years ago, you could remind them that candidate obama made a number of promises. And he they didn't go and look through and say how well did they do. He said, for instance, he's going to be a post partisan president and he's been most partisan and cut the deficit in half. Doubled in. Get unemployment down to 5.2% right now. And we just learned on friday, it's up to 7.9%. And that means, 9 million more americans don't have work than what he promised. And he said he was going to cut your health insurance premiums by 2500 a year. Anybody seen that happen to them lately? Actually, for the average american, it's gone up by 3,000 a year. And then of course, he said it was going to save social security and medicare, and came out with no plan to do either one of those things, in fact, he took 716 billion dollars out of medicare to pay for his vaunted obamacare. And he said he was going to work across the aisle, he was going to work the republicans and the democrats to get things done. And interesting, you know, you know how long it's been since he has spoken with either the senate, the republican leader in the united states or republican leader in the house about either the economy or the deficit or sequestration or jobs? It's been since july. I don't call that working across the aisle, with people in the opposition party. He made a lot of promises, but those promises he couldn't keep and the difference between us, he made promises, he couldn't keep. I'm making promises I have kept and I will keep them for the american people. 

[00:37:25]


(Cheers). If you would like to see the rest of the governor's speech, you can watch it streaming live on foxnews.Com, where you can hear the speech at the rally in dubuque in its entirety. Let's bring in campaign carl cameron standing by at the rally with his thoughts. A big and enthusiastic crowd out there, carl. 
>> Well, uma, romney is now giving the sort of blunt, candid contrasts of what he promises as opposed to what president obama has delivered or in romney's view clearly has not delivered. As you just heard, he said that achievements are earned, you can say whatever you want, but you have to be able to produce and he's making the argument in the final three days that obviously, president obama's to romney's view has not. There's also a attack coming from romney that stems from a comment from the president yesterday. When he told voters, they mentioned mitt romney's name and he said don't boo, vote, voting is the best way to get revenge. And mr. Romney has been pounding the president ever since for that, watch. 
>> Yesterday the president something, you may have heard by now that I think surprised a lot of people, speaking to an audience he said voting is the best revenge, he told the supporters, voting for revenge, vote for revenge? Let me tell you what I'd like to tell you, vote for love of country. 
(Cheers). And that dove tails into what is romney's afftive positive message, the type of agenda he'll bring to the country. Five points to expand, expanded education, ways to improve trade, crackdown on china, cut taxes and balance the budget and small business and makes the argument he has a record of that achievement mr. Romney didn't match being in office-- mr. Obama can't match being in the office virtually four years and he made the remarks in new hampshire and in ohio and by the estimates, 30,000 people in the crowd, by other estimates 20,000. And he'll come back to iowa to sleep and three hours in the sack another three or four states, all told about nine, excuse me, seven states and 13 events in the final 96 hours and actually now down about to 80. Uma? 

[00:39:53]


>> An amazing schedule. It's unbelievable, the pace to keep up in the final days before the campaign. Carl, I know you're going to be sticking with the romney campaign there all the way through, thank you for that update and we'll be checking back with you as we get closer to the election day. We'll take a quick break and when we come back, we'll talk to a key political observer about his thoughts on the the race and why he thinks the race is still too close to call.

>> Well, as we've been telling you, we're days away from many of you heading to the polls to pick the next president of the united states. And while some pundits are making the predictions, our next guest says the race up to this point is too close to call. And joining us now to explain why, she is he' here to share the ideas and thoughts with us. And great to have you here. I know there are a lot of political observers out there, not a lot, but a few who are actually making specific predictions about the winner. You're saying though,t's not certain at all. Why? 
>> I'm saying that, uma, because if you look carefully at the eightr nine true swing states, remember, this is over in 40 states or so, you look at the real swing states and you burro down into the data, not just the polling data. There are trends and counter trends. It's mixed. I know a lot of people out there who think it's going to be a landslide and getting e-mails and tweets from them. More power to them maybe they're right, but I don't see it in the entrails of this election, at least prior to tuesd 

[00:45:43]


>> Uma: I think it's also very interesting to see, fascinating on both sides, how confident both the romney camp is and the obama camp happens to be at the moment about victory on tuesday, and also very interesting to see what's happening in those states like florida, the key battle zone states where people have been waiting in long lines for hours to cast those early ballots. 
>> People seem to be very engaged in this election, we're bound to top 130 million people, from 130 to 140 million amerins voting in this election, remember, a third or more willready have voted before tuesday, it could go up to 40%, have cast their ballots prior to tuesday. But, this is about, these last few days, are about enthusing the party bases, getting them out to vote and I tell you what's helping, uma, it's what you just said. Often at the end of a campaign I find that one side is counting forcing the spin. They think they're going to lose. You eventually catch on to that, and not this time. Both of the campa and the key people associated with it really do believe they have a path to victory, it's not spin. Maybe they're living in parallel iverses, one of them is right and one is wrong, but it's helping to enthuse the base. 
>> Remember the last election, even though publicly the mccain supporters were trying to put on a brave front. It was clear in some circles that he was going to have a tough time, and it wasn't very-- they weren't confident he would pull a win off by this point. 
>> That's exactly right. And contrast 2008 when most people had figured out by ewilkes day who was going to be the next president. Contrast that to 2000 and 2004, in 2000 in particular, no one really knew, it was clearly going to be very close. In 2004, actually both camps thought they were going to win and in the end it was a close race, for president bush and john kerry. And I think we're going to have a reasonably close competitive election, let's all pray that we have on tuesday a decisive result, whichever way it goes, we do not want to go into overtime. 

[00:48:01]


>> Uma: No, we don't want to go into overtime, but I'm sure as you probably feel it's going to go into the early morning hours before we know who is going to come out the winner? 
>> Yes, it probably will go through the night and who knows, into the next day or longer, you know, some of the es don't count the provisional ballots until days or even weeks after the election. So, if it is close, we may have to be patient, and americans aren't very good at patience. 
>> No, not at all. I'm certainly one of those not patient, I want to know who is going to be the winner. So I'll be waited with baited breath. 
>> Me, to 
>> Uma: Great to see you as always, appreciate it. 
>> Thanks, uma, terrific. 
>> Uma: New details into fox news, raising more questions about the benghazi terror attack. What key senators andthers are saying about the latest revelation. Stay with us. .

>> We are back, of course, all of you know it's important to cast your vote in the presidential election, but for one woman, voting landed her in jail and allegedly tried to vote more than once. Roxanne rubin voted at early voting in henderson and reportedly went to las vegas and tried to cast her vote the second time on the same way and they reportedly saw h name in the data base and did not allow her to vote again. She was arrested by fbi agents and now been charged. 

[00:53:22]


>> And fox news has reviewed a classified cable that shows thesulate in benghazi considered moving operations due to security concerns bere that attack. And standing by with more on the sty, molly. 
>> That was sent to secretary of state hillary clinton's august 15th less than one month before the attack in libya and how u.S. Personnel on the ground there were making contingency plans and reads in part, quote, in daily pattern of violence would be the new normal for the forseeable future and personnel could co-locate to the annex, cia alex if it degraded suddenly. Reveals they were concerned about the trustworthiness of the libyan militia, noting that quote, certain sectors of the 17t brigade with hesitant to share information with the americans. One american senator says the obama administration wanted to believe that libya was safe enough to keep a smaller security footprint there. 
>> And this has been the story of libya for months. The people on the ground in libya are begging and pleading for additional security, they're being denied additional security, military and civilian security, u.S. Security, because we wanted to quote, normalize relationships with libyan government na didn't exist in benghazi. 
>> Reporter: Senator graham and fellow senators, mccain and kelly ayotte, are calling for lawmakers to investigate the attack. And the obama administration says they want an independent review before making assessments. In the meantime, president's team at the white house and the campaign say republicans are trying to take advantage of a tragedy. 
>> As soon as that information is available, as soon as the final report is completed, that will be released, but this is not a time for treating this like a political football, which is what mitt romney and many republicans are doing. The american people deserve better than that. 

[00:55:32]


>> The state department believes the report will be finished sometime in december. Uma. 
>> Uma: Molly, thank you very much. Well, we asked and you answered and your twitter responses on the election are coming up next. used Miles for a golf getaway. Double miles you can actually use...

>> We're here in Provincetown with Mary Beth of the scallop boat called Patience-Too. Why the name Patience-Too? When you work with your family you definitely need to have lots of patience. 
>> Let's just start with a basic thing. These are sea scallops you're after. 
>> Yes. We've fished for sea scallops for over 20 years now. 
>> And so how far out do you have to go before you get to the scallop beds? 
>> We have to go outside of three miles. So depending where we're at, you know, it can take six hours to get there, or even as long as 12 hours. 
>> So what does a sea scallop look like? Let's just grab one and look at it. 
>> This is a scallop. There's two sides to it. You have a dark and a light. And we always put the white side up. And you put your knife in, and you scrape the top shell, pull it back. Here's the roe. In Europe sometimes they do eat the roe, but we don't in America, so usually we just throw that over. What you're actually eating is a muscle that closes and opens the shell up. And there we have it. 

[00:02:28]


>> So when I go to the supermarket or I go to the fishmonger's, there are dry scallops and wet scallops. Could you explain what that means? 
>> Yes. A dry scallop has basically not been treated with a chemical. STP is what they sometimes use. The STP is just basically holding in, you know, the liquid. 
>> And they do that so that they can make more money, because the scallops weigh more? 
>> Yes. 
>> So you've been doing this 20 years. Do you ever get seasick when it's really rough there? I don't, but my husband the captain has been known to, so... 
>> That makes me feel better. Because if I went out for six hours in a steam I would tely be getting seasick. The last thing I want to do is actually eat one of your scallops. I'm going to eat a raw scallop, so if you'd shuck it for me... 
>> Can I ask my son to do that? 
>> Sure. 
>> Okay, AJ, you want to come over here and show you how it's done? 
>> You go out on the boat with your mom and dad all the time? >> 
>> So you want to show me how to shuck a scallop and let me eat one? 
>> I would love to. All for you. 
>> All right. This had better be good after this big talk here. So this is a raw scallop, fresh. Mmm. You know, the first thing I noticed was it had a meaty... a lot of meaty flavor. The scallops that I buy have almost no taste whatsoever. And it has a real great texture, too. You know, it's terrific. Mmm. So you still eat raw scallops all the time? 
>> I just make tourists eat them. 
>> That's what I figured. Mary Beth, AJ, thanks for your time. We're going to head back into the kitchen and figure out the best way to cook scalls at home. You know, one thing I hate-- there's a long list of things, as you know-- is I hate useless information. Like someone says, "Buy this, don't buy that," you go to the store, you can't tell a difference, and so you buy the wrong thing, and you make a mess. So dry scallops versus wet scallops, I get the concept, I know I want dry scallops. But how am I going to figure that out when I go to the supermarket, or my fishmonger? 

[00:04:32]


>> All right, well, a couple tests. When you see them at the store, if they're sitting in a pool of white, milky liquid, that's a sign that they're wet. Another clue, as you can see these are dry and these are wet. And you can see the color differ This has kind of a rosy tint to it, and this is pretty white. If it's bleached white, that means it's been treated, whereas this is nice and r And if you feel them... feel this one. It's dry. It's tacky, it feels good. Feel this one. Slimy. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Not so nice. 
>> And this is is sticky. 
>> Yeah. It's nice and tacky. 
>> Okay. 
>> So one more test you can do, and we figured this ou Test Kitchen, when you get your scallops home, you can put them on paper towel-lined plates, and you can put them in the microwave for 15 seconds, not very long, on high power. If you have a wet scallop, you can see the ring of moisture that will leech out immediately. If you have a dry scallop, nothing really comes out. Now, what we found is the flavor of dry scallops is way better than the flavor of wet scallops. Wet scallops have that chemical taste to it, because they've been treated. But you can cover it up by letting them soak in a water bath for 30 minutes. And in that water bath, it's a quart of water. You're going to add a quarter cup of lemon juice. And that lemon juice will help cover up the flavor of the chemical, along with two tablespoons of table salt. 
>> So these, which are dry, they're darker colored, rosy colored, they're sticky, not slimy. 
>> That's right. 
>> And if you put them in the microwave for 15 seconds on high, they won't exude liquid. 
>> You got it. 
>> That's actually useful. 
>> Yeah. Hey, oh, thanks. So the thing about scallops is they cook through so quickly that if you want to get a nice browning on them, one thing you have to do is keep them dry. So we put them on towels, and we're going to let them hang out, blot them dry for about ten minutes. That way when they go into the hot pan, they'll get a good sear. Finally, sometimes you see that little side muscle attached. You can just pull that off. It's a very tough muscle. It doesn't taste very good. It doesn't get soft. And they come out pretty easily. And that's the only prep these guys need besides a little salt and pepper, which we'll season them with right before we start cooking. 

[00:06:35]


>> Okay. And of course these guys cook through so quickly, in a matter of three minutes or so, that if you want to have a sauce, you've really got to prepare it ahead of time in a separate pot. And we're going to make a simple browned butter sauce. This is four tablespoons of unsalted butter, and this is medium heat. We're going to let it melt and beto brown, and it takes about four or five minutes. The thing about browned butter is thaen it starts to go, it really goes fast. This is not a time to walk away. So you can see this butter has turned a nice dark golden color. To it we're going to add a minced shallot. We're going to let that cook for about 30 seconds, and then we're going to stir in a tablespoon of minced parsley, half a teaspoon of thyme, and two teaspoons of lemon juice. Oh, that smells good. I'm going to season it with just a little salt and a little pepper. 
>> You know, I bet you could put road kill in there and it would taste good. 
>> Yeah, right? Doesn't that look good? You want to smell it? It won't... 
>> It does. 
>> Yeah. 
>> And we're going to cover this, set it off the heat and keep it warm until we're done cooking our scallops. And our scallops are still sitting over here resting, releasing any extra moisture before we sear them off. 
>> There's one test we didn't really explain. Julia said that you couldn't get rid of sodium tripolyphosphate, STP, from the scallops if the were wet scallops. That's true. But we tried. We tried soaking them in water for 30 minutes, we tried them soaking in water for an hour, and we tried not soaking them at all. We got them out and sent them to a lab and determined how much less STP there were in the wet scallops. It turns out both the 30 minute and the 60 minute only had about ten percent less than the ones that wnot soaked, so we were totally unsuccessful getting it out. And that's because these phosphates bind themselves to the proteins of the scallops. And once they're bound, they're really hard to get out. And that's why Julia's method of soaking in water with lemon juice, a quarter cup of lemon juice, masks the flavor of the STP, but it's still there. 
>> All right, so it's been ten minutes that these guys have been sitting here on these towels and blotting dry. Now we're ready to cook them off. You notice I've got a 12-inch skillet here, which is pretty important, because you want to spread the scallops out in the pan so they brown nicely. And this is a non-stick skillet, and that's pretty important, because you want the browning to stick to the scallop and not to the pan. So that was a tablespoon of vegetable oil, and we have it over high heat, and we're going to wait until it's smoking and really quite hot before we sear our scallops. Meanwhile we're going to season these scallops up with salt and pepper. And you want to season them on both sides. All right, so I see wisps of smoke starting to come off the pan, and that's a good sign that it's hot enough. We're going to lay the scallops in. You notice I'm sort of making sure the oil is getting evenly around the pan as I put them in. And you want to put them in kind of quickly. You notice the pan's not crowded. And that's because if you have a crowded pan they really will steam rather than sear. That was my timer. That was one and a half minutes exactly. So now we want to flip them over. So you can see these are gorgeously browned. And this is the interesting part. We're going to add a little butter. And again, we developed this recipe to work with wet or dry scallops, so even if a little liquid came out, they'd be gorgeous like this. So now we're going to melt the butter, and we're going to butter baste them. 

[00:09:52]


>> Oh, that's very chef-y. 
>> I know, it is really chef-y. It is what chefs do. Put the butter in the base of the pan, and using my favorite basting spoon, I'm just going to pour the butter over the top as they cook. Yeah, not only does it taste really good, but if these scallops were wet, this would help encourage the browning on the top and the sides as well. You want to cook it on the second side anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. You know, half a minute to a minute and a half, which isn't very long. You really don't want to overcook these guys, or they turn really rubbery. So I think we're good. All right, so this is that second batch. They look gorgeous, don't they? 
>> You are really good at this, I have to say. 
>> Yeah, they're beautiful. 
>> I mean, mine look good, don't get me wrong. But yours look a wee bit better. 
>> A wee bit, huh? 
>> Yeah, those are pretty spectacular. 
>> Yeah. And as soon as they' done you want to make sure you pull them right out of the pan, or else they're going to get overcooked. Because that's the goal with these guys, not to get them too tough and rubbery, which happens really quickly. 
>> You know, this is one of those things that people almost never cook at home, but it actually takes, what, five minutes? 
>> Yeah, it's incredibly easy, fast. 
>> And it's not hard to do. 
>> You ready to taste? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Two for you. Would you like more than two? Are you hungry? I'll give you three. Three's prettier. Put some of our browned butter sauce on them, too. 
>> I forgot that. 
>> Yeah. Oh, don't forget about the browned butter sauce. 
>> Okay, they look great, they smell great, the sauce was phenomenal. 
>> You can see in the middle they're not overdone. They're super-tender, not like a rubber ball at all. Mmm. 
>> An A. 
>> That's really good. The flavor of the scallops is clean, the browning on the outside is nice, and that butter. 
>> You know, when I really like something, I just stop talking. 
>> Mm-hmm, I know. 
>> Maybe if you fed me great food all the time I wouldn't talk anymore. 
>> I should have thought of that a long time ago. 
>> Sure. It would work for me, it would work for you. These are the best scallops I've ever had. 
>> These are amazing. 
>> So the secret to great scallops starts at the supermarket, when you want to by dry scallops, not wet scallops. Bring them home, 12-inch non-stick skillet, some oil, get it nice and hot. Sear them for, what, a minute and a half on one side, flip them over, then we add a little butter, and then constant basting, that restaurant trick. And finish it off with a nice browned butter sauce with shallots. So there you have it, from America's Test Kitchen to your kitchen, a fabulous recipe for quick and easy delicious scps. 

[00:12:10]


>> Mm-hmm. 
>> You know, the term "planned solescence" has a lot to do with non-stick skillets in the kitchen. And the reason is, especially here in our Test Kitchen, non-stick skillets eventually lose their n-stick properties. Actually, it happens fairly quickly, since we use them every day. So the question really is, why spent 100, 150 bucks on a non-stick skillet if eventually it's going to be a stick let? So we asked Adam here in the Equipment Corner to figure out whether you could buy a really good non-stick skillet for under 50 bucks, because you know eventually you're going to have to replace it. 
>> That's exactly true, Chris. No matter what happens with a non-stick skillet, you're going to degrade the non-stick coating, it's going to get less and less slick, food will start sticking. Now, that pan you were holding onto there is one that I have right here. This is the All-Clad non-stick stainless fry pan. It's almost 160 bucks. It's a great pan, but it's going to wear out also. So as you said, we were looking for budget options. That's why we have these seven pans here. They're all less than 50 bucks, they're all about 12 inches, they're all non-stick. We tested them alongside our favorite All-Clad, and this is our previous Best Buy from Calphalon. We also included that in the test, just to see how it would do. Now, first a couple of words about non-stick coatings. We learned a lot about non-stick doing this. Most companies do not make their own non-stick coating. They buy it from a non-stick coating manufacturer. And that manufacturer will offer a full range of different coatings at different price points. The cookware maker will choose one, based mostly on how much they want to charge for the pan. The actual formulation and the technology they use to apply it to the pan is proprietary, so they won't tell you that. But in general, there are a couple layers of non-stick. They'll heat cure it between applications of layers. So that's the basis. Also we learned that a couple of manufacturers, including our favorite, All-Clrecommend obviously that you wash and dry the pan before you cook with it, but also that you oil it. 

[00:14:18]


>> Oil a non-stick, really? 
>> It's almost like seasoning, in a sense. And it does make a big difference in performance. And there are a couple of theories as to why. Number one, provides a little extra lubrication. Number two, the non-stick coating is not glass smooth, and so you're sort of smoothing it out a little bit with the oil. Well, sort of like cast iron. 
>> Right, exactly. So we found that was really important. You don't have to continue to season it like you do cast iron. Just one oiling at the beginning we found to be importantf the manufacturer recommended it. Now, our first test was frying eggs. And you can see that in this clip. We were really surprised by the difference in performance here. For instance, these two pans, we were dry-fryivg these eggs, no fat in the pan. They started to stick at two eggs and six eggs, respectively. So already the slick topcoat was wearing off. Whereas these two pans we stopped testing at 76 eggs. 76 eggs slid right out of these pans. We just decided they were so far ahead of the next best, which was about 49 eggs, that we stopped the testing there. We also tested crepes, because that will give you some sense of how evenly the pans heat as the crepe batter, you know, cooks on the surface of the pan. Also, how the pan handles, because you have to tilt the pan like this to spread the crepe batter. Now, design factors also weighed into this. And this pan is actually a great example of the design features we like. It's got plenty of cooking surface across the bottom. It's nine and three quarter inches from edge to edge. The range was about eight inches to ten inches. So this is on the larger side. It's got nice sloped sides, so it's easy to get utensils in there. It's midweight, about two and a half pounds, and it's got a comfortable handle. Now, I can never resist doing a little bit of abuse testing, so I can show you a clip of that, too. This was a thermal shock and shock-shock abuse test. We heated all the pans up to 500 degrees and plunged them into ice water. And then we took them and whacked the six times on a Corian countertop. And that showed us the structural integrity of the pans. And unfortunately the pan that was out front ended up with a loose handle. But you know, that didn't surprise us. We knew from the beginning these are budget options. There's not ironclad construction. We knew that these were not going to last a lifetime. In the end, this was the pan, the one that got the loose handle, that won. This is the T-Fal Professional Total Non-Stick. Fabulous non-stick performance, and a great price. It's $32. think it's pretty simple. Yocan buy the All-Clad, one All-Clad, or you can buy five T-Fals at 32 bucks, and that's going to last you a lot longer. I don't know about any of you, but when I go out to a restaurant I almost always order the fish. The reason is at home I don't like cooking fish, because I'm nervous about whether it's fresh or not at the supermarket or the fishmonger's I get at home. And my problem is fish can get overcooked in a matter of seconds. You get this, which is... 

[00:17:20]


>> What kind of fish is that, Chris? 
>> This is overcooked fish. 
>> Oh, that is overcooked fish. 
>> And I'm just not going to eat this. So this is why Bridget's here, to explain to us how to cook a fish fillet properly. 
>> That's right. Well, we're going to cook fish perfectly every single time. And I'm going to show you this great technique. It's called pan roasting. So the fish is going to spend a little bit of time in the skillet to gain that great crust that we're after. It's also going to go in the oven. And I'll explain a little bit later on. But in the little fridge down there I've got some fish. All right, that looks great. Now, I want to point out how we store fish here in the Test Kitchen. We always keep it in the fridge until the last minute. And we like to keep it on ice. Now, tditionally we wrap it in plastic, and then in a zipperlock bag, and put it right on a tray of ice. Fishmongers do the same thing. It's a great idea to keep the fish super-cold. But I put a little piece of parchment here so we could see it easier, and you wouldn't have to see me unwrap fish. So I've got four beautiful skinless halibut fillets, all right? Now, each of these are about six to eight ounces each. And you can see that they're pretty thick. They're about one inch thick. This is one of the keys to making great fish at home. You want at least one inch thick. One and a half inch, even preferably, is great. Because that fish can take a longer time to cook, and establish a better crust, before it dries out. 
>> And also you have more time to determine whether it's done or not, not just a second or two. 
>> That's right. So it's like fish for dummies. 
>> Are you trying to tell me something? So what else can we use? Probably cod. 
>> Yeah, cod's perfect. 
>> Red snapper, sea bass. 
>> Sea bass is great. Yeah, any of those. So you don't have to be wrangled down to halibut. If you've got great sea bass at your supermarket or at your fishmonger use that, by all means. All right, so w we're going to get ready to sautee and get started establishing our beautiful crust on here. So if you wouldn't mind for me, turn that heat on to high. And we're using a tablespoon of vegetable oil, because it's cleanly flavored, and also has a pretty high smoke point. A really high sear is what we want to get on this fish. Very quickly, very hot. All right, so while that oil is heating up-- and we're looking for a good smoke to come from that oil, just when it starts smoking-- I'm going to pat these fillets dry all over. Because we don't want any moisture on the surface. That's really going to inhibit any crust that we're trying to gain. Now we're going to season the fish on both sides with salt and pepper. All right, so now here comes our "ah-hah" ingredient. Now, we want a good sear on this fish, and we want it quickly. Remember, if we let this fish sit in there and sear for three, four minutes, the time it's going to take to establish a great crust, the interior is going to start to dry out and be overdone. So we're using a crust-enhancer, kind of a speeding up... 

[00:19:54]


>> A CE, as we call it here. 
>> ...crust formation. So just one one side of this fish, I'm going to sprinkle each of these with about an eighth teaspoon of plain old granulated sugar. And the sugar caramelizes very quickly. A minute was all it took to start speeding that browning along and get a great crust formation. So our fish is ready for the oil. What we're looking for is just little streams of smoke to come out of that pan. All right, so I'm seeing those streams of smoke. I'm going to put the sugared side down, right into the pan. Hot, hot, hot pan. We're going to quickly sear these. I'm going to press them down so they're in contact with this non-stick pan. Non-stick is key here. So just about a minute, and we're going to take a peek and see if there's enough of that crust. It may go a minute to a minute and a half. All right, so it's been about a minute. I'm going to check this. I'm going to use two spatulas that are safe for this non-stick skillet, and flip that right over. Look how beautiful that is. Oh. 
>> That looks phenomenally good. 
>> That looks eat. And we're done with the stovetop. Now we're going to whisk this into the oven. It's a 425-degree oven, which is pretty warm. We're going to let the fish cook through in there. It's going to take about seven to ten minutes. All right, so what I'm looking for for that fish is an internal temperature at about 135 degrees. All right, so it's going to be in there for a few minutes, and we have time to make a beautiful relish to go with this. Now, you could serve just a lemon wedge, which is great. I've got a little bit of time. And this comes together very quickly. All right, I'm going to make an almond, green olive, and orange relish. I'm going to make this whole thing in the food processor. So I've got here a half cup of slivered almonds, which we've toasted, and I've got a half c of green olives, which we've chopped. This is going to have a beautiful briny flavor. And just a teeny tiny small garlic clove. We don't want it to overpower. We've minced it. In it goes. Along with a teaspoon of grated fresh orange zest. All right, so I'm just going to put the lid on. I just want to pulse this until the almonds and the olives are finely chopped. And that's going to take anywhere between seven and ten one-second pulses. All right, that looks great. So now I'm going to transfer this mixture to a bowl, and we'll stir in the rest of the ingredients. So continuing with the orange theme here, I've got a quarter cup of orange juice, and an equal amount, quarter cup, of extra virgin olive oil. Now, to augment that orange juice, make it a little bit tangier, I've got two teaspoons of white wine vinegar, and a quarter cup of fresh mint. I just want to stir this together. All right, I'm going to season this with a little bit of salt and cayenne pepper. Not too much. I know who my company is. All right, so the fish has a couple more minutes, andhis is going to wait on the fish. All right, Chris, it's been about seven minutes. I'm going to go check on the fish. All right, we are good to go. And this is a very hot panso I'going to wrap this kitchen towel around it, so neither you nor I grab it. All right, so the fish is beautiful, and very, very delicate. 

[00:22:59]


>> Slippery. 
>> That's right. All right. It's incredibly moist. Now, would you like some lemon, or some of that beautiful... 
>> I'd like that. Sort of a pesto, actually. 
>> It's very close, that's right. It's lovely. 
>> All right. 
>> All right. 
>> This was quick, this was easy. 
>> It looks beautiful, too. 
>> Look at that. 
>> Look how juicy, though. 
>> It does look juicy. You're good. 
>> It's buttery. 
>> Mmm. It's delicious, it's moist, but I also like the crust, because it's got lot of flavor on the crust, too. Okay, so now I can successfully cook fish at home, thanks to Bridget. So pan-roasted fish fillets start with about an inch to an inch and a half thick, w is really important, and a little bit of sugar on the outside, which caramelizes and gives you a crust without overcooking the inside. And then just when that top is done, flip it over in the skillet, put it in the oven to finish in six to nine minutes, and you have it. Great recipe from America's Test Kitchen.

There's a lot of people here on island tonight who feel like they have been forgotten and it really wasn't until today that they started to see supplies coming in and a lot of n the area that I'm in right now, is just volunteers. Folks who have come here on their own from other parts of the city or other parts of staten island with food, whatever they can bring. There's a lot of folks who live down the street in pitch blackness and they're afraid to leave their destroyed houses because of safety concerns. They don't want to leave their things out. This is the home of a woman named sheila. It's all that's left of her home. She's lived here for some 40 years. She was able to salvage a few supplies ing she brought them into the street yesterday, her sons did, and unfortunately the sanitation department came by and basically mowed them all back into the rubble. She has to once agn go back into her home to try to pull out her supplies. There's a lot of outrage here. We are going to get to that tonight. We also have a lot of breaking news tonight. Late today, power which was you knocked out when the con-ed transformer blew in manhattan began coming back on in lower manhattan. One man saying his entire neighborhood broke out cheering when the lights turned on. Not all of lower manhattan, though, has their lights again. Late word the pentagon will be trucking in millions of gallons of badly needed fuel. I just talked to a police officer here on staten island about an hour or two ago who was saying the police themselves are running out of gas on this island. As you can see from the lines for gas and supplies, progress is incredibly uneven. To alleviate the shortage we're just learning that new jersey governor chris christie has signed an executive order implementing odd/even rationing for gas purchases in 12 new jersey counties. The human toll, meantime, it is growing. At least 22 people have now lost their lives here. The least populated of new york's five boroughs and the highest death toll. For staten islanders, especially, the idea of a global sports and media spectacle being held on their shattered doorstep, it was infuriating and understandably so. Today, new york mayor michael bloomberg who had been pushing for the race backed down, saying the marathon had become a course of controversy and division. The thousands of runners from around the world are already here. Minutes after the decision we sent our producers to central park to get reactions from runners. Some were surprised to get the news. 

[00:02:23]


>> You are sure? 
>> Reporter: I'm sure. 
>> Oh, my god. 
>> We are from germany. We prepared for over a year for this run. That is bad, totally bad. 
>> What can we do? Keep on running. 
>> We will come back next year. We will come back next year. Okay? 
>> Reaction from some of the runners. I can tell you, reaction is pretty much unanimous on the island. The idea that runners were going to be running around when people here feel like they have totally been abandoned. When I was driving over here, i passed by the start of the race point. Thermust have been more than 100 port-a-potties behind, looked like barbed wire fence unused and generators just sitting there, yet there's all these people here without power. That infuriates people. 
>> Absolutely. The people that need them were not the runners but the people living in these houses. 
>> They have been sitting there for days unused. 
>> Exactly right. This debris, as you know just driving around, is indicative of every street, every block in front of every house. The magnitude of it was so extraordinar a lot of the critics felt this was a diversion, it was a distraction, that resources, the priority was completely wrong. Hotels that are now housing people who have been left homeless, those folks were going to be kicked out -- 
>> they were going to kick out people who were basically -- you know, had no place else to go, who were staying there for their homes, were getting kicked out because of prior reservations. That didn't make sense. 
>> Exactly right. Think about it, the verrazano bridge, the start point, would be closed for an entire day. It was a diversion of police resources, those who would have to line the work. This race brings $40 million into new york city but at the same time, right now, the game has changed. We don't know if it will bring that much money in, whether all the runners would run, whether people would line up and spend their money, because the people sorely, sorely need help. That was the message. Mary whitenberg, when she stood up and said it was canceled, it was with a heavy heart but so many people here were calling it disgusting, disgraceful, insensitive, that you could have a race blocks from where two little boys were washed ashore, their bodies were found drowned. This is what the mayor had to say. Take a listen. 

[00:04:46]


>> It is with an incredibly heavy heart today, tonight, that we share that the best way to help new york city at this time is to say that we wi not be you conducting the 2012 ing new york city marathon. 
>> I guess my question is what's going to happen to all the supplies? I guess those are privatel owned. I'm not sure who owns them. But I would hope, and I think a lot of people here I talked to in the last hour or two, hope that those things, the generators at the very least, would be distributed, the port-a-potties would be used here. 
>> That's what the new york marathon is saying, they will mobilize the generators, the water, the food that was going to be used. The people need those port-a-potties. They don't have anywhere to go. 
>> No place around here. 
>> The reason people are staying in their homes, that's because there's looting going on. People's homes are being robbed. So to compound the tragedy, compound the devastation, now these poor people basically, they don't want to leave. The temperatures are dropping. Within the last hour or two, it dropped 20 degrees and the people here really desperately need help. Imagine if they took those buses they were going to use to transport runners and brought volunteers out to help these people. 
>> Appreciate the reporting. I want to bring in staten island assemblywoman, who says new york should have canceled the marathon. Obviously you're pleased it's been canceled. We were talking about this before we went on air. There's all those port-a-potties sitting there. When I saw them I was kind of stunned they have probably been sitting there for days. 
[ Indistinguishable ] 
>> sorry, we're having a problem with the mike. You're saying -- 
>> certainly the resources, the generars, the police personnel, the food, the water, the port-a-potties, we can certainly use these out here on the ground in different areas, all the areas in staten island affected. People are really hurting out here. 

[00:06:52]


>> It does feel like and I know a lot of people here feel like they have been forgotten, especially in the first couple days. As part of the media I'm as much to blame as anybody because we were out coverinnew jersey and queens and all the different places. Do you feel now like more supplies are coming, people are starting to pay attention? 
>> Absolutely. The first few days it was a problem with communication. No one's cell phone was working. Obviously all electricity, the power, it was gone. Phone wires were down. We could not communicate to each other. But we were able to get across the city, just how dire the situation was here in staten island and they did respond. They've come through now. We have american red cross on the ground, we have fema on the ground, we have tremendous amount of volunteers in the community and donations from around this community, people going to various churches and we have so many distribution points for food, water, clothing. But those first two days, I was walking out here distributing food, water, with one of our local churches, crossroads church, and you know, the bowling alley collected a bunch of stuff and we were the only ones out here. I'm so happy that now -- 
>> what should -- I have people coming up to me in manhattan saying I want to help the people on staten island, I don't know where to go or how to do it, what they need. What would you recommend? 
>> Well, I'll say tomorrow at 9:00, we're meeting right here to do cleanup. I'm asking people if they want to come down, bring their own shovels, brooms, bags, garbage bags and gloves, we could certainly use all the help that we can get. We are going to be cleaning up the new york beach area and then the midland beach, some of the midland beach ea, and we will try to see if we can continue that in different neighborhoods. 
>> How would people from manhattan who are watching this, how would they get over here? 
>> That's a good question. You'd have to drive, unfortunately, but the gas is scarce so it really is a difficult situation. 
>> The bridge is open, though. 
>> The bridge is open. But it's my understanding the ferry's still not running so it would be difficult for people, especially with the gasoline situation we have. If we have people lining up half a mile, mile just to get gasoline. 
>> Hopefully people can carpool. Appreciate you being with us. 
>> Thank you for bringing attention to our community. 
>> It's about time. Thank you very much. Again, bg news on gasoline in new jersey. Governor chris christie ordering rationing for odd and even license plates starting on saturday. No word yet whether new york's vernor will follow suit on that. There are gas lines here, obviously, on staten island. Gas lines, in fact, across the area. Take a look. This was the scene in edison, new jersey, about 15 miles west of here. The irony, northern new jersey full of refineries and tank farms. Without power, though, they can't pump fuel into tanker trucks or resupply stations. For every station that is pumping gas, another one can't because their power is out, too. New york's harbor back open to shipping which may help. The "new york daily news" reporting a tanker today unloaded 200 million gallons of gas. Again, along with the rationing in new jersey, federal authorities have asked the pentagon to start trucking in fuel. 24 million glons into the region. There have been some setbacks as well, though. About 300,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled at a facility along the waterway separating this island from new jersey. It happened during the storm. A tank ruptured, apparently. Containment units kept most of it out of the water but it's fuel that will not make it into the supply chain. And diesel or gas, the bottom line is pretty simple tonight. All across the area, it is just plain tough out there. As susan candiotti discovered this afternoon. 

[00:10:07]


>> In bergen county, new jersey, we found a gas station that not only has power, it has gas and look at the long lines. You got two sets of them, one er here, it stretches back i don't know how far yet. Police officers standing by to make sure everyone is cool. And a separate line over here with people who have come here with gas cans. You can only buy $40 at a time. So here's the line. Haven't found the end of it yet. Look, we're passing along the way yet another gas station that is closed. So the one we found is a gem. Look at all those cars, still no end in sight. There's the end of the line. All righ we are slowly inching forward. Okay. I think something is up now, because we're suddenly starting to move forward very quickly here. I have a sinking suspicion that they may be out of gas. So we've only been in line for, let's see, about half an hour now. Have you heard -- I'm with cnn. Have you heard anything? Do you know if they've run out of gas or what? 
>> I was just waiting at the last one. They just ran out. Ink I waited about 30 minutes. 
>> You were waiting at another gas station about a half hour and that one ran out of gas? 
>> Yeah. 
>> No gas at this one. No gas here either. This looks like a gas line here. We're going to take it. 4:26. We'll see how long it takes us to get on the front of this line and keep our fingers crossed that they don't run out of gas. You're in line. We're in line to see how this goes. How long have you been waiting? 
>> About an hour. Ow do you spend the time? I'm checking out this website. Called gasbuddy.Com. Let's see if we can find out anything on here. Moving up again, look at that line of cars behind us. Oh, boy. Well, we are starting to lose some light. Maybe we'll make it up before it gets tot dark. This is the best part, moving up. Inching up again, inching, inching up again. Okay. It's getting darker and darker. And we have now gone three tenths of a mile. Time check. Here we go. It's been almost two hours. It's just before 6:00. Hi, I'm sorry, I'm with cnn. We've been in line doing a story. We're in line for the gas. Can you just tell us what is the latest? 

[00:12:37]


>> They're out of gas until tomorrow. 
>> After all that time they're out of gas? 
>> Yeah. They're all out of gas. It's like a ghost town here at this place. I can hear you. Anderson, they're all out of gas. The bottom line is we failed in our mission but we have a better idea now of what it was like to go through the process. We saw a lot of waiting, a lot of frustration, but people were remarkably poised and patient about everything. We also saw a lot of good samaritans, people helping each other, sometimes even pushing cars that had run out of gas just to get to the fuel pumps. They're supposed to get more gas tomorrow but there's no sure bets in this thing. Anderson? 
>> It's good that things were orderly. Susan, appreciate that. 
>>> I want to correct something. Turns out the staten island ferry is up and running. So that is certainly good news. The staten island ferry is running so if people from manhattan who have power and are able to want to come to staten island andelp volunteer, they can take the ferry out tomorrow. They can take a bus from the ferry out to staten island, where they will have a cleanup. There is so much need here. Look at the house behind me. It's like this block after block after block. So many people here have no power, no generators, no gasoline, even if they do have generators. Consequently, some may be unaware there is assistance available to them. If you do have power and if you're watching this right now, you know people in need, you can find out more on their behalf by calling fema, 800-621-3362. That's 1-800-621-3362 or disasterassistance.Gov. To donate, call the american red cross at 800-733-2767. You can text red cross to 90999 to make a $10 donation or go to redcross.Org.

As always, you can go to cnn.Com/impact, where you will find more information about how you can make a difference and links to the agencies and organizations to help you do it. We have met so many people here who have just come, there were guys on motorcycles, like a motorcycle group down here with food. I just met a young blind woman who is here with her seeing eye dog. She came, mobilized a group of her friends and they have been handing out food. It's just extraordinary what is happening here and more of it needs to happen in days to come. Follow me on twitter, tweet me and let me know what you're thinking about this entire situation. 

[00:15:32]


>>> Up next, we will take a closer look at the damage here when we come back as well as the stepped-up federal presence. eight princesses. I'm an expert on softball. And tea parties. I'll have more awkward conversations than I'm equipped for because I'm raising two girls ony own.

[00:19:02]


>>> We have nothing left but the clothes on our back. We have to start all over again. 
>> How do you do that? 
>> I don't know. I don't know. I just hope we get help. 
>> That's sheila trainer behind me. This is the wreckage of her home. Lived here for more than 40 years. It's just one house on one block. There are so many people hurting here tonight and they're not happy about the response so far, understandably so. Gary tuchman takes a look at why. 
>> Reporter: This sign says it all. There iseething anger on staten island and no one is the recipient of more of that anger from staten islanders than new york city's mayor, michael bloomberg. 
>> He's in his nice mansion warm and dry. We're freezing with no power, no nothing. I'm sorry. The man's delusional. 
>> Reporter: Much of new york city's least populated borough is without power. Many of the streets look like they were bombed. 
>> The sliding door is in the kitchen. 
>> Reporter: Many don't know where to start. Fema and the red cross are setting up shop in a city park. These three women who live on the same block lost houses and cars and walked a half mile to the park to find out they'll have to wait until saturday for the fema sign-up process to begin. What do you think when you walk around the neighborhood in staten island? 
>> Oh, my god. A war zone. 
>> It looks like something on tv. It looks like something on tv. You know? No, it looks like a newsreel from one of the other disasters. It doesn't look like my neighborhood. I'm here 40 years. 
>> Reporter: Was there a basement? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Reporter: City building inspectors walk around neighborhoods declaring the obvious about homes that are no longer inhabitable. It's all made so much harder because winter-like temperatures have now arrived. 
>> We're freezing. Bottom line is that we're so cold because we have nothing, no electricity, no gas. 
>> Reporter: And no hope that this personal trauma will go away any time soon. 
>> Gary tuchman joins me now. It's pretty remarkable. This storm happened monday night, it's been all week and there are people walking around shivering here. 

[00:21:11]


>> I think people here are not only upset and angry and cold but also shocked. When you live in miami or new orleans or biloxi or the outer banks of north carolina, psychologically you're prepared for the possibility of a horrible hurricane but when you live in new york city, that's not at the top of your mind. I think there's a lot of shock here. 
>> I got to ask about the story you reported on last night, the two kids whose bodies were found. Their mom says that she tried to get help at somebody's house monday night and this guy rebuffed her. You interviewed the guy. He claims it was a man who came to his door, not a woman, which doesn't make any sense, frankly, and the story he told of what happened sounded exactly like her story except she said it happened to her and he was claiming some guy did it. Has there been any update? Can anything be done? 
>> There's no update at all. Lot of police officers we talked to said they want the guy to be charged criminally. There really is no statute for that. One thing that's so interesting about this, anderson, this poor mother lost her two children. A lot of people have been asking me is there a father of the boys, is there a husband. The answer is yes and that man works for the city, new york city. For the sanitation department. He was out in the field working that night during the hurricane when his sons perished. 
>> Unbelievable. I have had so many people e-mail me about it today and about your report. Appreciate the update. Thank you very much. 
>>> As we have been reporting, of the 40 deaths in new york city, staten island suffered at least 22. Fewer than half a million people live in the borough, not a small number by any stretch, but the entire island has really got a small town feel to it. People here go back generations. Tight-knit in the best of times, close-knit in the worst of times and heartbroken now. With me now, staten island bough president. Appreciate you being with us. We spoke last night. You said fema was going to come today. Are you feeling better -- 
>> I'm feeling much better. I had occasion yesterday when i left your office after the interview, it was a conference call between me and andrew cuomo and the president of the united states. We laid it all out and we were promised all types of commitments for today and they're coming true. 

[00:23:11]


>> You talked to the president? 
>> Yesterday. My phone went off, it was the governor trying to reach me to say he was putting together a conference call, would I wait. I waited -- 
>> secretary napolitano came today? 
>> She came today. I met her at the airport. Nice conversation with her on the way to the field and things are looking up. We have all kinds of -- in fact, I have a whole team of fema people. The deputy sleeping in my office. I got cots there. I got a whole team. 
>> I feel bad that we weren't here sooner because we were so focused on new jersey and queens and all the other places. But you come here and I mean, my god, it's unbelievable. 
>> You know my frustration. 
>> Yeah. 
>> The frustration that I have when I didn't have no help, no support, what it was doing to me. It was killing me. That's why I spoke out, got angry. 
>> That's what it took. It made a difference. It's frustrating that it took you yelling yesterday morning to start to get people to pay attention. Thank god you did. 
>> Right. You see the damage here. 
>> Yeah. What do you make, you know, you walk around here and there was like a motorcycle group here handing out food. There's a blind woman here on this street with her dog handing out food to people. 
>> No surprise to me. No surprise to me. I tell you what, I know the population. I know the people. We were domiller field and there's this young lady with her son as volunteers giving out food. So I went over there, I said did you have any destruction or any harm to your house. She said not really, she said a tree did fall down and crush my car but that's all right. These people need the help. That's the people that stand out. 
>> My family goes back hundreds of years on this island. To see it like this is just stunning. 
>> Absolutely. But we're getting a lot of support now. We have red cross trucks going up and down through the community telling people that we have food and tomorrow I'm going to get food. The yankees just called me, they will send me down a load of jackets. 

[00:25:20]


>> I've had people stop me on the streets of new york today as I was walking along, saying how can we help staten island. What do you tell them? 
>> We started a foundation this morning. This morning, up to now I raised almost half a million dollars. 
>> Half a million dollars. How can people contact that? We'll get the website and put it on our website. 
>> I would really appreciate that. We're going to start using that to pump our basements. 
>> I'm hoping of this stuff that's been secured is going to get distributed. I saw like 100 port-a-potties at the start of the race. Can that stuff get distributed to people here? 
>> We could use it some places. We could use it some places. I was speaking today just on that subject. 
>> We'll continue to stay in touch. 
>> Thank you for what you're doing. 
>> A little late. Appreciate it. We have a lot more to tell you about in our coverage of this devastating storm. I want you to meet that young blind woman who's here giving out food. She's again one of the heroes of the storm. There's just a block of heroes. I have to tell you that. Also we want to get up to date on what would be the biggest story, the presidential election days away. Both the president and mitt romney pulling out all the stops in the battleground state of ohio. We'll be right back. 
>>> I got to tell you, the last money on gasoline. I am probably going to theas station about once a month. Last time I was at a gas station was about...I would say... Two months ago. I very rarely put gas in my chevy volt. I go to the gas station such a small amount that I forget how to put gas in my car.

Thing anyone here on staten island is thinking about is the presidential electio politics. I think people are sick right now of politicians and promises and a lot of people here just feel, I was just talking to a gentleman during a commercial break who is outraged. He feels politicians have forgotten them, especially the mayor and others, they feel like they haven't shown up here in force and not soon enough. It's really impossible for a lot of people on staten island to focus on anything but their own survival right now. Their own future. Day by day, hour by hour in some cases. Obviously everyone, a lot of folks from the northeast who have been affected by this tragic storm are not focusing on the presidential race, so it feels a little strange to talk about it here, in this spot, with all the reality of what's happening all around us. But there is a race to tell you about and a lot of people around the country are following it osely. So we want to bring you up to date on the latest on that. And tell you what's going on. There's a presidential election just four days away, of course, as you know that. President obama, mitt romney both spent the day in the state of ohio. Romney gave a speech in wisconsin this morning before heading there, the president had rallies in three different cities in ohio. Latest cnn/orc poll shows the president leading romney by just three points in ohio, razor-thin lead within the poll's margin of error. 

[00:31:02]


>> Our national political correspondent jim acosta and white house correspondent jessica yellin. The candidates' messages are very different but their itinerary couldn't be more similar, could it? 
>> That's t. They are basically battling for the same swing states over the next three days, three final days of this campaign. Mitt romney is in ohio right now, he goes to new hampshire tomorrow morning, then heads to iowa, codo and later this weekend, heading into monday, he goes to virginia and florida. You know, anderson, you can lay the battleground map for president obama and mitt romney almost on top of one another, because their schedules are so similar. 
>> Jessica, all year long, people have been pointing to this final jobs report the weekend before the election day. Doesn't seem to have made much of a splash, does it? 
>> Reporter: A little bit of both, anderson. The jobs numbers in the end seem to be sort of a wash. They give something for bo campaigns to talk about. The president today acknowledged the numbers and pointed out that there was an increase in private sector hiring and that there were more people out looking for work, which is true, but he said it wasn't good enough and governor romney doubled down on that, said sure, it sure wasn't enough and pointed out that the unemployment rate is higher now than it was when the president came into office and you know, how many people are still unemployed. So there is something there for both campaigns to feed their narrative. But the number wasn't eye-popping so it isn't really an october surprise, doesn't change anything and the president just gave it a quick acknowledgment and moved on in his remarks. 
>> Jim, the ohio poll, our ohio poll today showed the president with a slim lead but within the sampli error, exactly what they showed really for the past month. We're not seeing ohio polls with the romney lead. Yesterday it was suggested that's why the governor is headed to pennsylvania, he's running out of options. Off the record, does anyone in the romney campaign say the same thing? 
>> Reporter: What they've been saying in this campaign in the final stretch here when it comes to ohio is that thise is going to come down to independents. If you look at the independent numbers in that latest cnn/orc poll for ohio, the president has a two point deficit. Mitt romney is leading by two points. I don't think that's close enough for either campaign to feel confident quite honestly. I think that's why you're seeing this event behind me right now. Just getting to swing states. We have roughly 100 governors, senators, other gop heavy hitters taking the stage behind me, rudy giuliani was out here EARLIER, bob McDonnell, governor of virginia. Kid rock kicked off this event earlier. Not sure if we will see a gop version of "we are the world" but there is representation from just about every battleground state and the reason why is because if the romney campaign can't win ohio, they've got to cobble together a collection of other states to make the math work and that is basically the agenda for the next three days. 

[00:33:48]


>> Jessicaat are you hearing from the obama campaign about how ey feel about ohio? 
>> Reporter: Well, you constantly hear about the poll numbers, the early vote. There are so many numbers being thrown out by this campaign, sometimes you feel like you're at the betting track. But the bottom line is, it's a confidence game by both sides and they do point out that yes, the president is consistently up even if it's within the margin of error, consistently up in every ohio poll you look at. And that they ve advantage with the ground game. And also, as we pointed out before with the auto bailout. That was a theme the president hit today in pretty stark terms. He really went after governor romney for that ad you and i have spoken t in the past where governor romney says that chrysler is going to make jeeps in china, and the president says THAT THE CEOs OF THESE COMPANIES Have asked governor romney to stop making the ad and that governor romney is trying to scare people. The president's top two advisors me to talk to the press and said this is back-firing on governor romneand people here don't like it. It is on the covers of some newspapers around the state. No evidence that's showing up in the polls, though, so we have to see how that plays out buthey are betting big that the bailout is going to pull out an ohio win for them. We'll see. 
>> All right. Jessica, thanks. Jim, thanks as well. 
>>> Joining me now, cnn political analysts gloria borger, david gergen and chief national correspondent, john king. John, the campaigns say they are ready for late night waiting for ohio returns. What do the latest polls tell us? 
>> If you look at our new poll today, it tells you the campaigns are right. We've got essentially a dead heat. The president has a 50% to 47% for governor romney lead among likely voters. That's within the margin of error. If you look deep into the poll, they're tied among independents. The president is doing very well in cleveland and columbus, where he has to do well. Governor romney's doing pretty well down here in the southwest corner of the state where I am and in the rural areas. Where he needs to do well. Both candidates are doing well where they need to do well. Now they're just trying to turn up the energy and turn up the nsity which is why they're both here in the state today. They will both be back in the state today. If you look deep into our poll, you have a classic dead heat in the classic swing state. 

[00:36:07]


>> David, you were saying a couple days ago you thought the president was an odds-on favorite to win. Do you still feel that w? 
>> I do, anderson. I think his turnout ion is better in some of these states than mitt romney's but if you look at the overall battleground states now, look at the top ten battleground states, the polls show or the average of polls show that the president is clinging to a small lead in eight out of the ten battleground states. Mitt romney is only ahead in two. That would put the preside well over the top in the electoral college. Now, as john kg says, we don't know where this is going to go. You don't know about the enthsm rate. I was just in ohio this week and I can tell you, looking at the polls, you thought obama's going to win it but if you talk to people on the ground, they say that's not the feeling we have here, especially the republicans. They're pretty confident they will have a big turnout coming from the evangelicals, for example. 
>> Gloria, with unemployment numbers out today, obviously doesn't seem like the numbers have had much of an impact on the polls one way or another the past few months. Is there any reason to think this month might be different so close to election day? 
>> No, I don't think it's really going to have any impact, because you can look into these numbers today and you can take out of it -- each side can take something out of it, a slight uptick in the unemployment rate. Mitt romney can point to that and say you know what, things are not going in tight direction. The president can say there was more job creation than some anticipated, that this is a recovery, that is continuing, that it is not sporadic, that he has created five and a half million jobs. So you know the arguments on both sides. By the way, anderson, millions of people have already early voted, I might add, in a state like ohio, where john is. So it's too late for them anyway. I think this is baked and today, not really much of a difference. 
>> John, we're coming to the end of the persuasion season. It's really all about turnout now. Is there a sense four days before the election of what turnout is expected to be? 
>> In most states, they think it will go up from 2008. Not all states. Anderson, that is a critical question, because if we get an increase in the electorate and if we have the se diversity in the electorate we had in 2008 the president is likely to win because of the changing demographics of the country. If turnout goes up across the board it means more african-americans and latinos in the electorate even if there are more republicans than voted in 2008. That is the defining question. We stopped by both romney and obama campaign offices today here. I will tell you this, to back up david's point. When I was here at this point four years ago, it was crystal clear and this is a republican part of the state, that john McCAIN WAS GOING TO LOSE, THAT Senator obama was going to carry ohio, and the winner of ohio almost always wins the white house. That is a big open question this time and today, this is just one stop, today, though, anecdotally, there's more energy, more passion, they're working harder at the republican offices because they think they can surprise us on election day and make up that gap. To be clear, the obama campaign has had a lot of time and a lot of money because he didn't have a primary challenge. So this is going to be a test of whether the president spent his money wisely when the republicans were fighting amongst themselves on a turnout operation, but this final weekend in ohio, feels a whole lot different than the final weekend four yrs ago. 

[00:39:18]


>> John, david, gloria, appreciate it. Thanks very much. 
>>> There's obviously going to be a lot more about politics in the days ahead, over the weekend and monday and tuesday, of course. I really do tonit want to focus on what's happening here and all around this region because there's just a lot of folks in need. I think a lot of other people would be reporting on elections and stuff and I know it's important, obviously, but we're here and I think the people here, they want you to know what is going on here. They want you to know what's happened to them. The cleanup from sandy has barely begun. Now another storm is taking aim at the northeast. Just ahead, the latest on the nor'easter that's ading our way. Plus we will meet this blind young woman who has come here, one of the many volunteers who has come here on their own, brought their own supplies with them. They just do an incredible job. Amazing rescue story, a cab driver trapped in his taxi as sandy pounded new york, pulled to safety by a complete stranger, being called a hero. You'll understand why. He joins me ahead. ?????? ??????

>>> Welcome back. Thanks for joining us. We're in staten island tonight. Amid all the heartbreak and loss this storm left behind, we have heard so many extraordinary stories of strangers helping strangers. We have seen that. Saw it in katrina, in haiti, and here as well. We just met a young woman, mary beth, a graduate student of the college of staten island, who took it upon herself to see that the hungry in this area were fed. She and some friends cooked up food and set up a distribution center right on the street. No one asked them to do it. They just stepped up to help. Mary beth, who is blind, has her guide dog with her, we talked a short time ago. What made you come out here? Today, one of my classmates, her name is jennifer, she reached out for help and told us that there was no services, they had no power, they were hungry, they were cold. So I cooked up some food, i brought it down, I reached out to my classmates. They brought down food so between myself, ruth, george, debbie, we brought down food and then all of a sudden, we became command central and the national guard, the fdny had dropped off everything. 
>> You've become like a command ral here. 
>> We became command central. What we did is I went to my classes, my classmates went to their classes, they dropped it off to me. We brought it down and all of a sudden that wanted to donate started bringing stuff over and this is the creation of everything. 
>> What's it like being here? 
>> Well, because I'm blind, i wanttell you that maybe god blessed me and I can't see the visuals because it hurts. It really hurts. I have been working at the i.S. 51 evacuation site for the last six days so I heard their stories. I felt their pain. And I worked with them and that's a loto process. So being here, it's overwhelming. So maybe the blessing is that i can't see the broken houses, but I can see their broken hearts. 
>> There's a lot of pe who kind of say to themselves oh, i wish I could do something. You just saw a need and just started to do it. 

[00:45:27]


>> Well, yeah. Trixie and i, I don't know, it's the right thing to do, right? The human thing to do. So I worked last year with hurricane irene. I volunteered my time and i remembered what that was like. And I knew that in my house i had power so I came over to the shelters to volunteer and like i said, there's plenty of people here volunteering. I'm not in this alone. But we're in this together. 
>> You're in the right place at the right time. 
>> Absolutely. This is janet. Where is she? 
>> She just left. 
>> Okay. Yeah. She drove me down here. 
>> This is trixie? 
>> This is trixie, my seeing eye dog. She's also a mental health therapist in training. Shis also my best friend. She's quite the trouper. She's brought a lot of comfort and a lot of love to people at the shelter and the kids there as well. 
>> I think you're pretty amazing. Thank you for being here. 
>> It's my pleasure. I wish we could do more. 
>> So do i. Thank you so much. 
>> Thank you. 
>> An amazing young woman. She's still here, by the way. Right now, she's trying to find a vehicle so that she can take the extra food that's here and bring it to breezy point, queens tomorrow. She wants to keep working. Anincredible story, kindness and courage. Take a look at this photo I want to show you. It's a cab being engulfed by water at the height of sandy monday night. The driver is trapped inside. That dark shape we highlighted, that's the hero risked his own life to rescue the driver. You can see he's making the way in chest-deep water toward the cab. His name is jo he's the guy on the right in this picture. The man on the left is the cab driver he saved, who left the scene before anyone got his name. John is 6'5," was able to carry the cab drer to safety. He joins me here now in staten island. It's incredible what you did. Tell us about it. You basically saw this cab driver in need? 
>> Yeah, exactly. That's how it happened. I was in my apartment, I was just drinking coffee, and I just came from down there. I was already pretty much in for the night and as I looked out my window, I looked down, I see the cab driver come down on the road that was closed off. To this dai don't understand how he got there. All of a sudden the cab gets to the deepest part, I knew he was in trouble. I just didn't think about my well-being. 

[00:47:51]


>> You're wading through and the water is like t-deep? 
>> Up to my chest. The water was up to my chest. 
>> Were you wearing any gear? 
>> I had a northface jacket on. 
>> Basketball shorts on? And you're wading in the water anyway? 
>> Yeah. 
>> You go to the cab driver. How did you get him out? 
>> It was a difficult task. It wasn't easy at all. I needed all my strength to get the door open with the wind and the water and I'm losing my energy and my strength. It was almost impossible to be done. Plus inside the cab, there was water aly up to his chin. So it was pretty much a hard combination to do. So what I did was I told him, don't panic and we opened th door together,n the count of three we're going to open the door. Counted to three, as soon as i got to three, the wind just stopped for that one second and we got the door open. 
>> Wow. 
>> It was something like from the movies. 
>> You don't know his or anything? On't know his name. I wish that he's okay. Hope his family's all right. 
>> You work at the hard rock cafe? 
>> That's correct. 
>> In times square? 
>> Yep. 
>> You should get free cab rides for life. 
>> Everybody's saying that. 
>> You should get a special card that gives you a free cab ride. 
>> Ae end of the day it wasn't about what I was getting in return at all. How can I have that on my conscience? 
>> Tre's a lot of people, i got to tell you, just would have stayed inside. 
>> I heard that, too. I couldn't do nothing, just stand there, do nothing. I knew -- if I knew this was going on in front of me, I would have done it for anyone. 
>> It's an honor to meet you. Appreciate yoming out. Thank you very much. Amazing. The last thing this region needs is another storm. That's exacthat the onal weather service is predicting. Forecast for nor'easter next week for the midatlantic states into new england. Chad myers joins us with that. Chad, how big is this thing? How bad? 

[00:49:52]


>> Well, it doesn't look bad. Certainly it's not a hurricane. We'll have winds maybe 30, 40, gusts of 50. But here's the deal, anderson. You guys are stuck in a pattern that has a big ridge in the west and a trough in the east, and when that happens, sometimes these lows will come over and all of a sudden run up the east coast. Sometimes they will be one after the other. There could be more than one in a row. You are going to see winds that are still going to be guy. The next thing you're going to see is temperatures continue to be cold as long as that trough stays right here. Here's the european model. We showed you the models for the hurricane. This is not a hurricane, again, but it does have rain all the way from boston back to new york and maybe even western pennsylvania. You could get some of that snow. Remember, this thing is six days away. A nor'easter is almost impossible to forecast properly 24 hours away. So you're going to have to let the forecasters get a handle on this. It is going to be cold. Philadelphia, you will be in the 30s. New york city, all the way down to 33 by tuesday morning. That's the low for the day. HIGHS ONLY IN THE 40s. You have five million people without power. You don't need more wind. You don't need more rain. You don't need rain coming in windows that don't exist or roofs that are gone. You certainly don't need TEMPERATURES IN THE 30s WHEN YOU Don't have heat. 
>> We got to try to get electricity to folks quickly because before temperatures really drop. It's already brutally cold out here. Appreciate the update on that. 
>>> The death toll from sandy now approaching 100 in this country. We're learning more about the lives that were lost and we honor some of those lives ahead. 
> The death toll from sandy is Ah. Fire bad! Just have to fire roast these tomatoes. Do you churn your own butter too? What? This is going to give you a head start on your dinner. That seems easier Sure does Who are you?

Tonight, four more families forever changed by this storm. At the height of the storm on monday, two best friends in the small town of salem, new york decided to spend the night together. 13-year-old michael robson and his 11d pal, jack baumler were playing in the family room, police said, when a fierce wind blew a 100 foot oak tree through the house. A photograph of the house shows the entire second floor destroyed. Both boys were killed instantly. Two other children playing at the house were hurt. At aake before the funeral massesor both boys, jack was remembered as an all-star baseballyer, a kid who loved to talk and engage both adults and his friends. Michael, relatives said, loved adventure and talked about becoming a park ranger. An uncle told the local newspaper quote, our hearts are broken. The pain is raw. Not too far away, another family, another tragedy caused by sandy. In nearby pearl river, jeffrey channon, 51 years old, a retired new york city police sergeant was home with his wife and children when a tree fell on their house. Police say the power of the falling tree was so great that his body was forced from an upper floor to the ground. He was found outside his home pinned underneath the tree. Hiwife and daughters were badly injured. S son called 911. On staten island, the scene of so much heartbreak, another wrenching story. Enormous waves churned by sandy overcame the home of george dresh in the island's tottenville section. The local newspaper, "the staten island advance" was given this photo of george a year ago. That's him on the far left with the white gloves. He had been helping to clean up after hurricane irene. This time, neighbors told the newspaper that he stayed because a family's home had been looted a year ago when irene had struck and this is what was left after the storm moved on. Total destruction. He was killed and so was his 13-year-old daughter, seen here on her facebook page. Angela was a middle school student with tons of friends. One of them created a facebook memorial page and one wrote, seeing this makes me sick. Baby, please come home to us. Just so sad. We'll be right back. ] bread? Here's a better idea. Pillsbury Grands!

=======================================================

Are still dly needed he. There's a lot of people here on this island tonight who feel like they have been forgotten and it really wasn't until today that they started to see supplies coming in and a lot of it in the area that I'm in right now, is just volunteers. Folks who have come here on their own from other parts of the city or other parts of staten island with food, whatever they can bring. There's a lot of folks who live down the street in pitch blackness and they're afraid to leave their destroyed houses because of safety concerns. They don't want to leave their things out. This is the home of a woman named sheila. It's all that's left of her home. She's lived here for some 40 years. She was able to salvage a few supplies. Ing she brought them into the street yesterday, her sons did, and unfortunately the sanitation department came by and basically mowed them all back into the rubble she has to once again go back into her home to try to pull out her supplies. There's a lot of outrage here. We are going to get to that tonight. We also have a lot of breaking news tonight. Late today, power which was you knocked out when the con-ed transformer blew in manhattan began coming back on in lower manhattan. One man saying his entire neighborhood broke out cheering when the lights turned on. Not all of lower manhattan, though, has their lights again. Late word the pentagon will be trucking in millions of gallons of badly needed fuel. I just talked to a police officer here on staten island about an hour or two ago who was saying the police themselves are running out of gas on this island. As you can see from the lines for gas and supplies, progress is incredibly uneven. To alleviate the shortage we're just learning that new jersey governor chris christie has signed an executive ord]r implementing odd/even rationing for gas purchases in 12 new jersey counties. Odd numbered and even numbered license plates on alternating days. The human toll, meantime, it is growing. At least 22 people have now lost their lives here. The least populated of new york's five boroughs and the highest death toll. For staten islanders, especially, the idea of a global sports and media spectacle being held on their shattered doorstep, it was infuriating and understandably so. Today, new york mayor michael bloomberg who had been pushing for the race backed down, saying the marathon had become a course of controversy and division. The thousands of runners from around the world are already here. Minutes after the decision we sent our producers to central park to get reactions from runners. Some were surprised to get the news. 

[00:02:29]


>> You are sure? 
>> Reporter: I'm sure. 
>> Oh, my god. 
>> We are from germany. We prepared for over a year for this run. That is bad, totally bad. 
>> What can we do? Keep on running. 
>> We will come back next year. We will come back next year. Okay? 
>> Reaction from some of the runners. I can tell you, reaction is pretty much unanimous on the island. The idea that runners were going to be running around when people here feel like they have totally been abandoned. When I was driving over here, i passed by the start of the race point. There must have been more than 100 port-a-potties behind, looked like barbed wire fence unused and generators just sitting there, yet there's all these people here without power. That infuriates people. 
>> Absolutely. The people that need them were not the runners but the people living in these houses. 
>> They have been sitting there for days unused. 
>> Exactly right. This debris, as you know just driving around, is indicative of every street, every block in front of every house. The magnitude of it was so extraordinary. A lot of the critics felt this was a diversion, it was a distraction, that resources, the priority was completely wrong. Hotels that are now housing people who have been left homeless, those folks were going to be kicked out -- 
>> they were going to kick out people who were basically -- you know, had no place else to go, who were staying there for their homes, were getting kicked out because of prior reservations. That didn't make sense. 
>> Exactly right. Think about it, the verrazano bridge, the start point, would be closed for an entire day. It was a diversion of police resources, those who would have to line the work. This race brings $40 million into new york city but at the same time, rig now, the game has changed. We don't know if it will bring that much money in, whether all the runners would run, whether people would line up and spend their money, because the people sorely, sorely need help. That was the message. Mary whitenberg, when she stood up and said it was canceled, it was with a heavy heart but so many people here were calling it disgusting, disgraceful, insensitive, that you could have a race blocks from where two little boys were washed ashore, their bodies were found drowned. This is what the mayor had to say. Take a listen. 

[00:05:03]


>> It is with an incredibly heavy heart today, tonight, that we share that the best way to help new york city at this time is to say that we will not be you conducting the 2012 ing new york city marathon. 
>> I guess my question is what's going to happen to all the supplies? I guess those are privately owned. I'm not sure who owns them. But I would hope, and I think a lot of people here I talked to in the last hour or two, hope that those things, the generators at the very least, would be distributed, the port-a-potties would be used here. 
>> That's what the new york marathon is saying, they will mobilize the generators, the water, the food that was going to be used. The people need those port-a-potties. They don't have anywhere to go. 
>> No place around here. 
>> The reason people are staying in their homes, that's because there's looting going on. People's homes are being robbed. So to compound the tragedy, compound the devastation, now these poor people basically, they don't want to leave. The temperatures are dropping. Within the last hour or two, it dropped 20 degrees and the people here really desperately need help. Imagine if they took those buses they were going to use to transport runners and brought volunteers out to help these people. 
>> Appreciate the reporting. I want to bring in staten island assemblywoman, who says new york should have canceled the marathon. Obviously you're pleased it's been canceled. We were talking about this before we went on air. There's all those port-a-potties sitting there. When I saw them I was kind of stunned they have probably been sitting there for days. 
[ Indistinguishable ] 
>> sorry, we're having a problem with the mike. You're saying -- 
>> certainly the resources, the generators, the police personnel, the food, the water, the port-a-potties, we can certainly use these out here on the ground in different areas, all the areas in staten island affected. People are really hurting out here. 
>> It does feel like and I know a lot of people here feel like they have been forgotten, especially in the first couple days. As part of the media I'm as much to blame as anybody because we were out covering new jersey and queens and all the different places. Do you feel now like more supplies are coming, people are starting to pay attention? 

[00:07:16]


>> Absolutely. The first few days it was a problem with communication. No one's cell phone was working. Obviously all electricity, the power, it was gone. Phone wires were down. We could not communicate to each other. But we were able to get across the city, just how dire the situation was here in aten island and they did respond. They've come through now. We have american red cross on the ground, we have fema on the ground, we have tremendous amount of volunteers in the community and donations from around this community, people going to various churches anwe have so many distribution points for food, water, clothing. But those first two days, I was walking out here distributing food, water, with one of our local churches, crossroads church, and you know, the bowling alley collected a bunch of stuff and we were the only ones out here. I'm so happy that now -- 
>> what should -- I have people coming up to me in manhattan saying I want to help the people on staten island, I don't know where to go or how to do it, what they need. What would you recommend? 
>> Well, I'll say tomorrow at 9:00, we're meeting right here to do cleanup. I'm asking people if they want to come down, bring their own shovels, brooms, bags, garbage bags and gloves, we could certainly use all the help that we can get. We are going to be cleaning up the new york beach area and then the midland beach, some of the midland beacea, and we will try to see if we can continue that in different neighborhoods. 
>> How would people from manhattan who are watching this, how would they get over here? 
>> That's a good question. You'd have to drive, unfortunately, but the gas is scarce so it really is a difficult situation. 
>> The bridge is open, though. 
>> The bridge is open. But it's my understanding the ferry's still not running so it would be difficult for people, especially with the gasoline situation we have. If we have people lining up half a mile, mile just to get gasoline. 
>> Hopefully people can carpool. Appreciate you being with us. 
>> Thank you for bringing attention to our community. 
>> It's about time. Thank you very much. Again, breaking news on gasoline in new jersey. Governor chris christie ordering rationing for odd and even license plates starting on saturday. No word yet whether new york's governor will follow suit on that. There are gas lines here, obviously, on staten island. Gas lines, in fact, across the area. Take a look. This was the scene in edison, new jersey, about 15 miles west of here. The irony, northern new jersey full of refineries and tank farms. Without power, though, they can't pump fuel into tanker trucks or resupply stations. For every station that is pumping gas, another one can't because their power is out, too. New york's harbor back open to shipping which may help. The "new york daily news" reporting a tanker today unloaded 200 million gallons of gas. N, along with the rationing in new jersey, federal authorities have asked the pentagon to start trucking in fuel. 24 million gallons into the region. There have been some setbacks as well, though. About 300,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled at a facility along the waterway separating this island from new jersey. It happened during the storm. A tank ruptured, apparently. Containment units kept most of it out of the water but it's fuel that will not make it into the supply chain. And diesel or gas, the bottom line is pretty simple tonight. All across the area, it is just plain tough out there. As susan candiotti discovered this afternoon. 

[00:10:18]


>> In bergen county, new jersey, we found a gas station that not only has power, it has gas and look at the long lines. You got two sets of them, one over here, it stretches back i don't know how far yet. Police officers standing by to make sure everyone is cool. And a separate line over here with people who have come here with gas cans. You can only buy $40 at a time. So here's the line. Haven't found the end of it yet. Look, we're passing along the way yet another gas station that is closed. So the one we found is a gem. Look at all those cars, still no end in sight. There's the end of the line. All right. We are slowly inching forward. Okay. I think something is up now, because we're suddenly starting to move forward very quickly here. I have a sinking suspicion that they may be out of gas. So we've only been in line for, let's see, about half an hour now. Have you heard -- I'm with cnn. Have you heard anything? Do you know if they've run out of gas or what? 
>> I was just waiting at the last one. They just ran out. I think I waited about 30 minutes. 
>> You were waiting at another gas station about a half hour and that one ran out of gas? 
>> Yeah. 
>> No gas at this one. No gas here either. This looks like a gas line here. We're going to take it. 4:26. We'll see how long it takes us to get on the front of this line and keep our fingers crossed that they don't run out of gas. You're in line. We're in line to see how this goes. How long have you been waiting? 
>> About an hour. 
>> How do you spend the time? I'm checking out this website. Called gasbuddy.Com. Let's see if we can find out anything on here. Moving up again, look at that line of cars behind us. Oh, boy. Well, we are starting to lose some light. Maybe we'll make it up before it gets totally dark. This is the best part, moving up. Inching up again, inching, inching up again. Okay. It's getting darker and darker. And we have now gone three tenths of a mile. Time check. Here we go. It's been almost two hours. It's just before 6:00. Hi, I'm sorry, I'm with cnn. We've en in line doing a story. We're in line for the gas. Can you just tell us what is the latest? 

[00:12:40]


>> They're out of gas until tomorrow. 
>> After all that time they're out of gas? 
>> Yeah. They're all out of gas. It's like a ghost town here at this place. I can hear you. Anderson, they're all out of gas. The bottom line is we failed in our mission but we have a better idea now of what it was like to go through the process. We saw a lot of waiting, a lot of frustration, but people were remarkably poised and patient about everything. We also saw a lot of good samaritans, people helping each other, sometimes even pushing cars that had run out of gas just to get to the fuel pumps. They're supposed to get more gas tomorrow but there's no sure bets in this thing. Anderson? 
>> It's good that things were orderly. Susan, appreciate that. 
>>> I want to correct something. Turvs out the staten island ferry is up and running. So that is certainly good news. The staten island ferry is running so if people from manhattan who have power and are able to want to come to staten island and help volunteer, they can take the ferry out tomorrow. They can take a bus from the ferry out to staten island, where they will have a cleanup. There is so much need here. Look at the house behind me. It's like this block afterlock after block. So many people here have no power, no generators, no gasoline, even if they do have generators. Consequently, some may be unaware there is assistance available to them. If you do have power and if you're watching this right now, you know people in need, you can find out more on their behalf by calling fema, 800-621-3362. That's 1-800-621-3362 or disasterassistance.Gov. To donate, call the american red cross at 800-733-2767. You can text red cross to 90999 to make a $10 donation or go to redcross.Org.

As always, you can go to cnn.Com/impact, where you will find more information about how you can make a difference and links to the agencies and organizations to help you do it. We have met so many people here who have just come, there were guys on motorcycles, like a motorcycle group down here with food. I just met a young blind woman who is here with her seeing eye dog. She came, mobilized a group of her friends and they have been handing out food. It's just extraordinary what is happening here and more of it needs to happen in days to come. Follow me on twitter, tweet me and let me know what you're thinking about this entire situation. 

[00:15:38]


>>> Up next, we will take a closer look at the damage here when we come back as well as the stepped-up federal presence. 
>>> We have nothing left but the clhes on our back. We have to start all over again. 
>> How do you do that? 
>> I don't know. I don't know. I just hope we get help. 

[00:17:40]


>> That's sheila trainer behind me. This is the wreckage of her home. Lived here for more than 40 years. It's just one house on one block. There are so many people hurting here tonight and they're not happy about the response so far, understandably so. Gary tuchman takes a look at why. 
>> Reporter: This sign says it all. There is seething anger on staten island and no one is the recipient of more of that anger from staten islanders than new york city's mayor, michael bloomberg. 
>> He's in his nice mansion warm and dry. We're freezing with no power, no nothing. I'm sorry. The man's delusional. 
>> Reporter: Much of new york city's least populated borough is without power. Many of the streets look like they were bombed. 
>> The sliding door is in the kitchen. 
>> Reporter: Many don't know where to start. Fema and the red cross are setting up shop in a city park. These three women who live on the same block lost houses and cars and walked a half mile to the park to find out they'll have to wait until saturday for the fema sign-up process to begin. What do you think when you walk around the neighborhood in staten island? 
>> Oh, my god. A war zone. 
>> It looks like something on tv. It looks like something on tv. You know? No, it looks like a newsreel from one of the other disasters. It doesn't look like my neighborhood. I'm here 40 years. 
>> Reporter: Was there a basement? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Reporter: City building inspectors walk around neighborhoods declaring the obvious about homes that are no longer inhabitable. It's all made so much harder because winter-like temperatures have now arrived. 
>> We're freezing. Bottom line is that we're so cold because we have nothing, no electricity, no gas. 
>> Reporter: And no hope that this personal trauma will go away any time soon. 
>> Gary tuchman joins me now. It's pretty remarkable. This storm happened monday night, it's been all week and there are people walking around shivering here. 
>> I think people here are not only upset and angry and cold but also shocked. When you live in miami or new orleans or biloxi or the outer banks of north carolina, psychologically you're prepared for the possibility of a horrible hurricane but when you live in new york city, that's not at the top of your mind. I think there's a lot of shock here. 

[00:19:52]


>> I got to ask about the story you reported on last night, the two kids whose bodies were found. Their mom says that she tried to get help at somebody's house monday night and this guy rebuffed her. You interviewed the guy. It was a man who came to his door, not a woman, doesn't make any sense, frankly, and the story he told of what happened sounded exactly like her story except she said it happened to her and he was claiming some guy did it. Has there been any update? Can anything be done? 
>> There's no update at all. Lot of police officers we talked to said they want the guy to be charged criminally. There really is no statute for that. One thing that's so interesting about this, anderson, this poor mother lost her two children. A lot of people have been asking me is there a father of the boys, is there a husband. The answer is yes and that man works for the city, new york city. For the sanitation department. He was out in the field working that night during the hurricane when his sons perished. 
>> Unbelievable. I have had so many people e-mail me about it today and about your report. Appreciate the update. Thank you very much. 
>>> As we have been reporting, of the 40 deaths in new york city, staten island suffered at least 22. Fewer than half a million people live in the borough, not a small number by any stretch, but the entire island has really got a small town feel to it. People here go back generations. Tight-knit in the best of times, close-knit in the worst of times and heartbroken now. With me now, staten island borough president. Appreciate you being with us. We spoke last night. You said fema was going to come today. Are you feeling better -- 
>> I'm feeling much better. I had occasion yesterday when i left your office after the interview, it was a conference call between me and andrew cuomo and the president of the united states. We laid it all out and we were promised all types of commitments for today and they're coming true. 
>> You talked to the president? 
>> Yesterday. My phone went off, it was the governor trying to reach me to say he was putting together a conference call, would I wait. I waited -- 
>> secretary napolitano came today? 
>> She came today. I met her at the airport. Nice conversation with her on the way to the field and things are looking up. We have all kinds of -- in fact, I have a whole team of fema people. The deputy sleeping in my office. I got cotshere. I got a whole team. 

[00:22:08]


>> I feel bad that we weren't here sooner because we were so focused on new jersey and queens and all the other places. But you come here and I mean, my god, it's unbelievable. 
>> You know my frustration. 
>> Yeah. 
>> The frustration that I have when I didn't have no help, no support, what it was doing to me. It was killing me. That's why I spoke out, got angry. 
>> That's what it took. It made a difference. It's frustrating that it took you yelling yesterday morning to start to get people to pay attention. Thank god you did. 
>> Right. You see the damage here. 
>> Yeah. What do you make, you know, you walk around here and there was like a motorcycle group here handing out food. There's a blind woman here on this street with her dog handing out food to people. 
>> No surprise to me. No surprise to me. I tell you what, I know the population. I know the people. We were down in miller field and there's this young lady with her son as volunteers giving out food. So I went over there, I said did you have any destruction or any harm to your house. She said not really, she said a tree did fall down and crush my car but that's all right. These people need the help. That's the people that stand out. 
>> My family goes back hundreds of years on this island. To see it like this is just stunning. 
>> Absolutely. But we're getting a lot of support now. We have red cross trucks going up and down through the community telling people that we have food and tomorrow I'm going to get food. The yankees just called me, they will send me down a load of jackets. 
>> I've had people stop me on the streets of new york today as I was walking along, saying how can we help staten island. What do you tell them? 
>> We started a foundation this morning. This morning, up to now I raised almost half a million dollars. 
>> Half a million dollars. How can people contact that? We'll get the website and put it on our website. 
>> I would really appreciate that. We're going to start using that to pump our basements. 

[00:24:13]


>> I'm hoping of this stuff that's been secured is going to get distributed. I saw like 100 port-a-potties at the start of the race. Can that stuff get distributed to people here? 
>> We could use it some places. We could use it some places. I was speaking today just on that subject. 
>> We'll continue to stay in touch. 
>> Thank you for what you're doing. 
>> A little late. Appreciate it. We have a lot more to tell you about in our coverage of this devastating storm. I want you to meet that young blind woman who's here giving out food. She's again one of the heroes of the storm. There's just a block of heroes. I have to tell you that. Also we want to get up to date on what would be the biggest story, the presidential election days away. Both the president and mitt romney pulling out all the stops in the battleground state of ohio. We'll be right back. mouth dentist. But between check-ups tartar builds. Keep it clean with new listerine???? ultraclean??????. It's the only mouthwash with a new tartar control formula for a dentist clean feeling. Ahhhhhhhh. 
[ Male Announcer ] NEW LISTERINE???? ULTRACLEAN??????. Power to your mouth??????. 

[00:29:25]


>>> I got to tell you, the last thing anyone here on staten island is thinking about is the presidential election or politics. I think people are sick right now of politicians and promises and a lot of people here just feel, I was just talking to a gentleman during a commercial break who is outraged. He feels politicians have forgotten them, especially the mayor and others, they feel like they haven't shown up here in force and not soon enough. It's really impossible for a lot of people on staten island to focus on anything but their own survival right now. Their own future. Day by day, hour by hour in some cases. Obviously everyone, a lot of from the northeast who have been affected by this tragic storm are not focusing on the presidential race, so it feels a little strange to talk about it here, in this spot, with all the reality of what's happening all around us. But there is a race to tell you about and a lot of people around the country are following it closely. So we want to bring you up to date on the latest on that. And tell you what's going on. There's a presidential election just four days away, of course, as you know that. President obama, mitt romney both spent the day in the state of ohio. Romney gave a speech in wisconsin this morning before heading there, the president had rallies in three different cities in ohio. Latest cnn/orc poll shows the president leading romney by just three points in ohio, razor-thin lead within the poll's margin of error. 
>> Our national political rrespondent jim acosta and white house correspondent jessica yellin. The candidates' messages are very different but their itinerary couldn't be more similar, could it? 
>> That's right. They are basically battling for the same swing states over the next three days, three final days of this campaign. Mitt romney is in ohio right now, he goes to new hampshire tomorrow morning, then heads to iowa, colorado and later this weekend, heading into monday, he goes to virginia and florida. You know, anderson, you can lay the battleground map for president obama and mitt romney almost on top of one another, because their schedules are so similar. 

[00:31:25]


>> Jessica, all year long, people have been pointing to this final jobs report the weekend before the election day. Doesn't seem to have made much of a splash, does it? 
>> Reporter: A little bit of both, anderson. The jobs numbers in the end seem to be sort of a wash. They give something for both campaigns to talk about. The president today acknowledged the numbers and pointed out that there was an increase in private sector hiring and that there were more people out looking for work, which is true, but he said it wasn't good enough and governor romney doubled down on that, said sure, it sure wasn't enough and pointed out that the unemployment rate is higher now than it was when the president came into office and you know, how many people are still unemployed. So there is something there for both campaigns to feed their narrative. But the number wasn't eye-popping so it isn't really an october surprise, doesn't change anything and the president just gave it a quick acknowledgment and moved on in his remarks. 
>> Jim, the ohio poll, our ohio poll today showed the president with a slim lead but within the sampling error, exactly what they showed really for the past month. We're not seeing ohio polls with the romney lead. Yesterday it was suggested that's why the governor is headed to pennsylvania, he's running out of options. Off the record, does anyone in the romney campaign say the same thing? 
>> Reporter: What they've been saying in this campaign in the final stretch here when it comes to ohio is that this race is going to come down to independents. If you look at the independent numbers in that latest cnn/orc poll for ohio, the president has a two point deficit. Mitt romney is leading by two points. I don't think that's close enough for either campaign to feel confident quite honestly. I think that's why you're seeing this event behind me right now. Just getting to swing states. We have roughly 100 governors, senators, other gop heavy hitters taking the stage behind me, rudy giuliani was out here EARLIER, bob McDonnell, governor of virginia. Kid rock kicked off this event earlier. Not sure if we will see a gop version of "we are the world" but there is representation from just about every battleground state and the reason why is because if the romney campaign can't win ohio, they've got to cobble together a collection of other states to make the math work and that is basically the agenda for the next three days. 

[00:33:32]


>> Jessica, what are you hearing from the obama campaign about how they feel about ohio? 
>> Reporter: Well, you consly hear about the poll numbers, the early vote. There are so many numbers being th by this campaign, sometimes you feel like you're at the betting track. But the bottom line is, it's a confidence game by both sides and they do pot out that yes, the president is consistently up even if it's within the margin of error, consistently up in every ohio poll you look at. And that they have the advantage with the ground game. And also, as we pointed out before with the auto bailout. That was a theme the president hit today in pretty stark terms. He really went after governo romney for that ad you and i have spoken about in the past where governor romney says that chrysler is going to make jeeps in china, and the president says THAT THE CEOs OF THESE COMPANIES Have asked governor romney to stop making the ad and that governor romney is trying to scare people. The president's top two advisors came to talk to the press and said this is back-firing on governor romney and people here don't like it. It is on the covers of some newspapers around the state. No evidence that's showing up in the polls, though, so we have to see how that plays out but they are betting big that the bailout is going to pull out an ohio win for them. We'll see. 
>> All right. Jessica, thanks. Jim, thanks as well. 
>>> Joining me now, cnn political analysts gloria borger, david gergen and chief national correspondent, john king. John, the campaigns say they are ready for late night waiting for ohio returns. What do the latest polls tell us? 
>> If you look at our new poll today, it tells you the campaigns are right. We've got essentially a dead heat. The president has a 50% to 47% for governor romney lead among likely voters. That's within the margin of error. If you look deep into the poll, they're tied among independents. The president is doing very well in cleveland and columbus, where he has to do well. Governor romney's doing pretty well down here in the southwest corner of the state where I am and in the rural areas. Where he needs to do well. Both candidates are doing well where they need to do well. Now they're just trying to turn up the energy and turn up the intensity which is why they're both here in the state today. They will both be back in the state today. If you look deep into our poll, you have a classic dead heat in the classic swing state. 

[00:35:58]


>> David, you were saying a couple days ago you thought the president was an odds-on favorite to win. Do you still feel that way? 
>> I do, anderson. I think his turnout operation is better in some of these states than mitt romney's but if you look at the overall battleground states now, look at the top ten battleground states, the polls show or the average of polls show that the president is clinging to a small lead in eight out of the ten battleground states. Mitt romney is only ahead in two. That would put the president well over the top in the electoral college. Now, as john king says, we don't know where this is going to go. You don't know about the enthusiasm rate. I was just in ohio this week and I can tell you, looking at the polls, you thought obama's going to win it but if you talk to people on the ground, they say that's not the feeling we have here, especially the republicans. They're pretty confident they will have a big turnout coming from the evangelicals, for example. 
>> Gloria, with unemployment numbers out today, obviously doesn't seem like the numbers have had much of an impact on the polls one way or another the past few months. Is there any reason to think this month might be different so close to election day? 
>> No, I don't think it's really going to have any impact, because you can look into these numbers today and you can take out of it -- each side can take something out of it, a slight uptick in the unemployment rate. Mitt romney can point to that and say you know what, things are not going in the right direction. The president can say there was more job creation than some anticipated, that this is a recovery, that is continuing, that it is not sporadic, that he has created five and a half million jobs. So you know the arguments on both sides. By the way, anderson, millions of people have already early voted, I might add, in a state like ohio, where john is. So it's too late for them anyway. I think this is baked and today, not really much of a difference. 
>> John, we're coming to the end of the persuasion season. It's really all about turnout now. Is there a sense four days before the election of what turnout is expected to be? 
>> In most states, they think it will go up from 2008. Not all states. Anderson, that is a critical question, because if we get an increase in the electorate and if we have the same diversity in the electorate we had in 2008 the president is likely to win because of the changing demographics of the country. If turnout goes up across the board it means more african-americans and latinos in the electorate even if there are more republicans than voted in 2008. That is the defining question. We stopped by both romney and obama campaign offices today here. I will tell you this, to back up david's point. When I was here at this point four years ago, it was crystal clear and this is a republican part of the state, that john McCAIN WAS GOING TO LOSE, THAT Senator obama was going to carry ohio, and the winner of ohio almost always wins the white house. That is a big open question this time and today, this is just one stop, today, though, anecdotally, there's more energy, more passion, they're working harder at the republican offices because they think they can surprise us on election day and make up that gap. To be clear, the obamaampaign has had a lot of time and a lot of money because he didn't have a primary challenge. So this is going to be a test of whether the president spent his money wisely when the republicans were fighting amongst themselves on a turnout operation, but this final weekend in ohio, feels a whole lot different than the final weekend four years ago. 

[00:38:59]


>> John, david, gloria, appreciate it. Thanks very much. 
>>> There's obviously going to be a lot more about politics in the days ahead, over the weekend and monday and tuesday, of course. I really do tonight want to focus on what's happening here and all around this region because there's just a lot of folks in need. I think a lot of other people would be reporting on elections and stuff and I know it's important, obviously, but we're here and I think the people here, they want you to know what is going on here. They want you to know what's happened to them. The cleanup from sandy has barely begun. Now another storm is taking aim at the northeast.

>>> Welcome back. Thanks for joining us. We're in staten island tonight. Amid all the heartbreak and loss this storm left behind, we have heard so many extraordinary stories of strangers helping strangers. We have seen that. We saw it in katrina, in haiti, and here as well. We just met a young woman, mary beth, a graduate student of the college of staten island, who took it upon herself to see that the hungry in this area were fed. She and some friends cooked up food and set up a distribution center right on the street. No one asked them to d. They just stepped up to help. Mary beth, who is blind, has her guide dog with her, we talked a short time ago. What made you come out here? 

[00:43:20]


>> Today, one of my classmates, her name is jennifer, she reached out for help and told us that there was no services, they had no power, they were hungry, they were cold. So I cooked up some food, i brought it down, I reached out to my classmates. They brought down food so between myself, ruth, george, debbie, we brought down food and then all of a sudden, we became command central and the national guard, the fdny had dropped off everything. 
>> You've become like a command central here. 
>> We became command central. What we did is I went to my classes, my classmates went to their classes, they dropped it off to me. We brought it down and all of a sudden that wanted to donate started bringing stuff over and this is the creation of everything. 
>> What's it like being here? 
>> Well, because I'm blind, i want to tell you that maybe god blessed me and I can't see the visuals because it hurts. It really hurts. I have been working at the i.S. 51 evacuation site for the last six days so I heard their stories. I felt their pain. And I worked with them and that's a lot to process. So being here, it's overwhelming. So maybe the blessing is that i can't see the broken houses, but I can see their broken hearts. 
>> There's a lot of people who kind of say to themselves oh, i wish I could do something. You just saw a need and just started to do it. 
>> Well, yeah. Trixie and i, I don't know, it's the right thing to do, right? The human thing to do. So I worked last year with hurricane irene. I volunteered my time and i remembered what that was like. And I knew that in my house i had power so I came over to the shelters to volunteer and like i said, there's plenty of people here volunteering. I'm not in this alone. But we're in this together. 

[00:45:20]


>> You're in the right place at the right time. 
>> Absolutely. This is janet. Where is she? 
>> She just left. 
>> Okay. Yeah. She drove me down here. 
>> This is trixie? 
>> This is trixie, my seeing eye dog. She's also a mental health therapist in training. She is also my best friend. She's quite the trouper. She's brought a lot of comfort and a lot of love to people at the shelter and the kids there as well. 
>> I think you're pretty amazing. Thank you for being here. 
>> It's my pleasure. I wish we could do more. 
>> So do i. Thank you so much. 
>> Thank you. 
>> An amazing young woman. She's still here, by the way. Right now, she's trying to find a vehicle so that she can take the extra food that's here and bring it to breezy point, queens tomorrow. She wants to keep working. Another incredible story, kindness and courage. Take a look at this photo I want to show you. It's a cab being engulfed by water at the height of sandy monday night. The driver is trapped inside. That dark shape we highlighted, that's the hero risked his own life to rescue the driver. You can see he's makinthe way in chest-deep water toward the cab. His name is john. He's the guy on the right in this picture. The man on the left is the cab driver he saved, who left the scene before anyone got his name. John is 6'5," was able to carry the cab driver to safety. He joins me here now in staten island. It's incredible what you did. Tell us about it. You basically saw this cab driver in need? 
>> Yeah, exactly. That's how it happened. I was in my apartment, I was just drinking coffand I just came from down there. I was already pretty much in for the night and as I looked out my window, I looked down, I see the cab driver come down on the road that was closed off. To this day I don't understand how he got there. All of a sudden the cab gets to the deepest part, I knew he was in trouble. I just didn't think about my well-being. 
>> You're wading through and the water is like waist-deep? 
>> Up to my chest. The water was up to my chest. 
>> Were you wearing any gear? 

[00:47:21]


>> I had a northface jacket on. 
>> Basketball shorts on? And you're wading in the water anyway? 
>> Yeah. 
>> You go to the cab driver. How did you get him out? 
>> It was a difficult task. It wasn't easy at all. I needed all my strength to get the door open with the wind and the water and I'm losing my energy and my strength. It was almost impossible to be done. Plus inside the cab, there was water already up to his chin. So it was pretty much a hard combination to do. So what I did was I told him, don't panic and we opened the door together, on the count of three we're going to open the door. Counted to three, as soon as i got to three, the wind just stopped for that one second and we got the door open. 
>> Wow. 
>> It was something like from the movies. 
>> You don't know his name or anything? 
>> Don't know his name. I wish that he's okay. Hope his family's all right. 
>> You work bt the hard rock cafe? 
>> That's correct. 
>> In times square? 
>> Yep. 
>> You should get free cab rides for life. 
>> Everybody's saying that. 
>> You should get a special card that gives you a free cab ride. At the end of the day it wasn't about what I was getting in return at all. How can I have that on my conscience? 
>> There's a lot of people, i got to tell you, just would have stayed inside. 
>> I heard that, too. I couldn't do nothing, just stand there, do nothing. I knew -- if I knew this was going on in front of me, I would have done it for anyone. 
>> It's an honor to meet you. Appreciate you coming out. Thank you very much. Amazing. The last thing this region needs is another storm. That's exactly what the national weather service is predicting. Forecast for nor'easter next week for the midatlantic states into new england. Chad myers joins us with that. Chad, how big is this thing? How bad? 
>> Well, it doesn't look bad. Certainly it's not a hurricane. We'll have winds maybe 30, 40, gusts of 50. But here's the deal, anderson. You guys are stuck in a pattern that has a big ridge in the west and a trough in the east, and when that happens, sometimes these lows will come over and all of a sudden run up the east coast. Sometimes they will be one after the other. There could be more than one in a row. You are going to see winds that are still going to be gusty. The next thing you're going to see is temperatures continue to be cold as long as that trough stays right here. Here's the european model. We showed you the models for the hurricane. This is not a hurricane, again, but it does have rain all the way from boston back to new york and maybe even western pennsylvania. You could get some of that snow. Remember, this thing is six days away. A nor'easter is almost impossible to forecast properly 24 hours away. So you're going to have to let the forecasters get a handle on this.

>>> The death toll from sandy now approaching 100 in this country. 
> The death toll from sandy is at least 97 people. At least 40 of them lived in new york, day by day we're learning more about who they are, the lives they lived. Tonight, four more families forever changed by this storm. At the height of the storm on monday, two best friends in the small town of salem, new york decided to spend the night together. 13-year-old michael robson and his 11-year-old pal, jack baumler were playing in the family room, police said, when a fierce wind blew a 100 foot oak tree through the house. A photograph of the house shows the entire second floor destroyed. Both boys were killed instantly. Two other chdren playing at the house were hurt. At a wake before the funeral masses for both boys, jack was remembered as an all-star baseball player, a kid who loved to talk and engage both adults and his friends. Michael, relatives said, loved adventure and talked about becoming a park ranger. An uncle told the local newspaper quote, our hearts are broken. The pain is raw. Not too far away, another family, another tragedy caused by sandy. In nearby pearl river, jeffrey channon, 51 years old, a retired new york city police sergeant was home with his wife and chilen when a tree fell on their house. Police say the power of the falling tree was so great that his body was forced from an upper floor to the ground. He was found outside his home pinned underneath the tree. His wife and daughters were badly injured. His son called 911. On staten island, the scene of so much heartbreak, another wrenching story. Enormous waves churned by sandy overcame the home of george dresh in the island's tottenville section. The local newspaper, "the staten island advance" was given this photo of george a year ago. That's him on the far left with the white gloves. He had been helping to clean up after hurricane irene. This time, neighbors told the newspaper that he stayed because a family's home had been looted a year ago when irene had struck and this is what was left after the storm moved on. Total destruction. He was killed and so was his 13-year-old daughter, seen here on her facebook page. Angela was a middle school student with tons of friends. One of them created a facebook memorial page and one wrote, seeing this makes me sick. Baby, please come home to us. Just so sad. We'll be right back. four sleep. Are you one of them?

=======================================================

Thanks for joining us. I'm alex paen. Every day, ordinary people go to extraordinary lengths to save animals in trouble. This story is a great example. 
>> This is the nevada spca. It's a no-kill animal sanctuary. It is the only animal sanctuary in southern nevada that takes in all animals, so we've brought in dogs, cats, ferrets, guinea pigs, alpacas, bunnies, hamsters. If you can think of it, we've probably brought it into the doors here. Whatever comes this building, it is safe. And in southern nevada, this is the only place that they can go to that's safe. The quantity of animals we bring in, and the wide variety of animals, this really is the only place for them, or they would end up at the government kill shelters. We have 1,500 animals in the building. We've got various areas that we house them in. The dogs are in their dog runs. They have indoor and outdoor areas so that they can get sun during the day, if they want, and shade during the nighttime. This little guy just turned 4 weeks old. I woke him up from his nap. He came to us when he was a week old, him and his 3 other siblings. Their mom, after she gave birth to them--after they were about a week old, it was discovered that she had some type of illness that--could no longer nurse them. And so, the people, not knowing how to properly care for newborn puppies, brought him in to us. And we had two of our employees take them home and foster them and feed them their bottles. So they are now starting to eat wet food, as well as some dry food, as well as getting their bottles. And so--sorry, little guy. I woke you up. For the dogs in southern nevada, we bring in just about every breed. We're one of the only no-kill facilities in town that are accepting pit bulls. We have to limit the quantity we can bring in. We just--we want to help them all. We just don't have the space. And so, from the little, tiny teacup animals dogs to the large mastiffs and great danes and--we take in everything here. This is simon. He's 3 years old. He came to us a couple of days after christmastime. Unfortunately, he was matted all the way down to his skin, so we had to shave him. Very neglected. Doesnt understand why he lost his home at christmastime. So we're just really working with him and spending time to give him reassurance that there are good people out there in the world that will do right by him and find him a great home and give him the love and care that he needs while he's here. This is donald duck. He was actually previously adopted from us. And the individuals lost their home, which is a big problem in las vegas right now. And so, they brought him back to us, and he will stay here until he gets another home. And the animals come in to us from various sources. Some people tie them up out front. Some people put them in boxes with no holes in them and leave them out front overnight with no food or water. Other people just walk in the door and dump them. Sometimes, they'll call and make an appointment to bring them in. And one of the greatest things we get to do here is we actually do work with the two local kill shelters in town and go get the animals off of death row before they are euthanized. So every time somebody adopts from the nevada spca, it opens up a spot for us to go and get an animal off of death row. We which is 6 or 7 rooms, and then, downstairs, we have that are in two large rooms that are being treated that will eventually come up and go into adoptions. We don't know how long they're going to be here. It's not a time limit, so it's not 48 hours or 72 hours. If they need us for 6 months or a year, that's how long they're going to stay. And we don't want to keep them in cages. So they're healthy, they get to interact with each other, they get to play, and we set up spaces so they can have some time away from the other cats if they just don't want to be bothered. And we put a lot of food and water bowl stations down so that there's no competition for food or using the litter boxes. This is roly poly ollie. He came into us as a lost cat, and he was matted. He's actually a longhaired cat. His mats were so bad all the way down to his skin that we had to shave him all the way down. Beautiful kitty. Sweet. He's a little bit-- 

[00:04:42]


[meows] he doesn't like to be held. But he's a really, really good boy. Little bit overweight, too, so we've got to work on getting him down a little bit there. But he ally is a good guy. Some cats don't like to be held. Others want to be in your lap. And so, what's nice about the cat condos here is you can come in and spend some quality time with these cats and see who's going to be the best fit for your family and your personality. If you want a lap cat, sit down on the floor and pick the first one that jumps in your lap. But if you don't want a lap cat, you don't want that same cat that jumps into your lap. So it's a good way to really get to know their personalities and pick who's going to be the best fit for your home. This is selene. She's 12 years young. 
[Meows] she came to us when she was attacked by two dogs. Her family abandoned her outside of their home that was foreclosed on, and not knowing any better, she went back to the home, went inside the doggie door, and was attacked by the two dogs that the new owners had in the house. And she almost lost one of her eyes. Thankfully, we were able to get her the medical care that she needed. And so, now, she's up for adoption. This is snuffleupagus, our little ferret. He came in to us yesterday. And unfortunately, his owner surrendered him. A lot of people take these guys on and don't realize the responsibility and how much care they need and how social they are. And then, they don't want to put in the time to properly care for them. They make good pets for a home that is knowledgeable about how to properly care for them. They're very quick, so if you have little kids in the house, and you want him running around, you know, someone could accidentally step on them if they're not paying attention to them. We have about 100 rabbits in the building. Some are sgle rabbits. So if someone has a rabbit at home, we can bring them in and try and help bond them. Some have come in as a bonded pair, and we keep them together. Rabbits are a little bit harder to adopt out because they take a very specific kind of home. They're more on the lines of a dog where they need a lot of care. They don't like to be held. So a lot of people want to get these cute little bunnies at easter time and feed them carrots, and they don't get them spayed or neutered, so they can have behavioral problems. And then, they end up with a rabbit they don't know what to do with. Or they'll say, "well, my rabbit doesn't hop." Well, it can't if re keeping it in a cage. In the wild, they'd be hopping around, and--you know, so they need to have large condos, which is what we built for them here. This is garland, and I can grab her real quick. She was left in front of our building in a plastic box. In general, rabbits don't like to be held. And so, this is a problem where people who want to adopt these rabbits for their kids--and you saw what just happened. The rabbits kick out. They've got very sharp claw--feet-- nails, and the strength in their back legs is treremendous. And so, it's very easy for someone to get injured, as well as their backs are very fragile. And so, we see often where rabbits break their backs because they're not handled properly. So another good reason why these aren't really good pets for kids. Tremendous pets for adults that want to rabbit-proof their house and give them a great life outside of a cage. This is petey the pig, and he's been with us for a few months. We need to get him neutered before we can put him up for adoption. They just cleaned his living quarters where he lives and filled it up with hay, so if you'll notice, he's got some fresh hay all over his face. He loves to root around in the hay. And we're giving him some of his pig food out here. But he gets to come out on the patio every day for several hours and run around and get his exercise and enjoy the sun, soaking up the sun. He's a good little boy. The guy that takes care of him, he's really bonded with. And-- his name is cody, and so, when he's here--today's his day off, but he will follow cody all around the building. Pigs are very hard to adopt. There are certain counties in southern nevada that don't allow them. So one, you have to be in a county that will take them. And two, people get them when they're cute little one-pound pigs, and then, they turn into--be something bigger. And he's not overweight. A lot of our potbellied pigs are overweight. And then, people don't want them because they're much bigger than they anticipated them being. Volunteering here really is a great experience where we get hands-on of seeing all these other animals that we wouldn't see normally if we didn't volunteer specifically with the nevada spca. We really try hard to teach people, give them good education, on what's the best animal for their home. You know, getting a rabbit for a 5-year-old kid who wants to carry him around is not the best home. Maybe a guinea pig is good, or a little hamster. So we really pride ourselves on educating people, 'cause it's not always about the animal that you take home. Sometimes, it's about the animal that you don't take home because it's not the right fit for you.

>> Here now is another great "animal rescue" story. Watch. In southern alaska, where winter seems to last forever, this is a moose's paradise. They seem to be everywhere. But for one unfortunate critter, a seemingly innocent walk across the frozen kenai river, proved extremely costly. Stuck and sinking in the icy water, this moose's life was literally just about over. Struggling to survive, the moose's effoappear hopeless. Hours pass, and now, disoriented and obviously tired and cold, it fights to get out of this tragic predicament. It now appears the moose is making some headway aspushes itself across the snowy, frozen surface, attempting to reach land. But the animal seems to be going in circles, growing increasingly tired as more time goes by. The moose's future appears bleak. However, residents in the area see the critter in trouble and rush to the scene. But how do you save a wild moose weighing about 1,000 pounds sinking in an ice-covered river and,the same time, not endanger yourself? But the locals know they have to do something, so a plan is devised. Again and again, the moose continues its struggle, trying to get above the surface. Meantime, more help arrives. Rescuers must get close as they try to throw a rope around the moose. Once... Twice... Three times. Now, a long pole is brought in to wrap the rope lasso at its end, hoping to snare the exhausted moose. If they place the rope around the animal, they'll have a chance. Bingo! But the rescue isn't over yet. They must get the moose to move. They pull the animal by rope from hundreds of yards away. But it doesn't seem to work. After hours of trying, the ort appears doom as the tired and probably severely frozen moose slowly gives up, sinking back into the icy water. Suddenly, the critter reappears. There's a leg. The rescuers won't give in that easily. They pull the moose out... And now work quickly to finish the job. They place the rope around the animal's leg. The critter is utterly exhausted and needs to rest. But it has to move off the ice or risk crashing through the frozen river again. As a rescuer gets close to place another rope around its neck, the moose reveals it still has some spunk left in him and gets up, preparing to walk off unassisted. An animal's life is saved, thanks to the teamwork of ordinary people. We'll have more of "animal rescue" right after this brief break.

Wlook at the local things and australia. It is all here on "awesome adventures." This week, joining up with some friends and australia for some city fun and outback adventures. First, let's take a look at some adventure. Australia is a continent and a country located in the southern hemisphere. About 14 hours from los angeles. We are going to focus on two major points of interest. That is sydney and the northern territory. The northern territory is a remote section of australia that includes desolate desert mixed in with dense rainforest. We are going to make our way to a national park. And then we go to darwin for some adventure. First/ we start off in the city. With a population of over 4 million people, sydney ranks as australia's largest and most well-known city. The sydney harbour bridge is one of the most iconic sites and australia. But instead of just looking at it, we are going to get with some locals and climb to the top. 
>> We are about to climb the bridge. 
>> I am kind of nervous about climbing the bridge. It is very tall. The worst thing that could happen is I completely freaked out. 
>> And freak out was just the right words for charlotte. After we got suited up, it did not take long to find out that she is absolutely terrified of heights. 
>> Oh my god! 

[00:02:05]


>> Just take your first steps. >> Building the bridge was no easy feat. A crew of around 1400 workers hammered in each of the 6 million rivets in place. 
>> How about just walk on the wood here? 
>> Oh my god! I cannot. This is scaring me. 
>> I am trying not to look down. 
>> Not looking down was not going to last much longer. 
>> I am not scared at all. I cannot even feel it. It is so pretty up here. What is better than sydney? Really? Nothing. Obviously, the best place in the world. 
>> Congratulations. Give ourselves a round of applause. It does not get much better than this. 
>> What is it specifically about this british that makes it so special, other than the location? 
>> It is the largest spanning single arch bridge. Not the longest. The americans have beat us at that, and the chinese, but it is the b. In total, 1437 steps. A little bit of exercise. 

[00:04:28]


>> She might have taken 1800 or so. 
>> She was a double stopping along the way. 
>> I get a real look of this amazing city and it gave our two teenagers a new perspective of thme. 
>> I have never done anything like this. 
>> I have never seen a view of the city this nice before. 
>> It is weird how you can live your whole life but you never do these things. It makes you realize how much you are wh you do these things. 
>> We are just getting started. Stay tuned for more from australia. Later, I had to the northern tey for some outback adventure. 

[00:07:12]


>> Welcome back to "awesome adventures." 
>> We met up with charlotte and like to climb the sickening bridge, but now we are back on the ground, I want to learn more about australia. 
>> Amazing, the best place to live. 
>> I love living here. The weather, the beaches, the city. It is all amazing. 
>> There is a word that a lot of you use that I do not know what it means to what are some words that we should know? 
>> We do not say shrimp. It is arawn. 
>> And you were making fun of me for the way I say australia. 
>> It can be oz or stalia. 
>> We tend to shorten our words. What about places like darwin, other places, have you been there? 
>> It is kind of like desert land. That is the really down under area. 
>> Australia has a reputation for some of the best sailing in the world. If you look down on the harbor on and I stay, you are likely to see boats all around. We met our skipper onis 45- foot boat docked in darling harbor. The plan is to head out in the waters near the opera house and get a few tips on salem. 
-- On sailing. 
>> The idea behind the wench, it is like a mechanical foley. When the time comes and the need to pull on the rope, I can pl on it like so. When you cannot pull it anymore, that is when you can turn the handle. Getting down into the main sailing grounds of the harbor. The first ships arrived, this is where they're anchored. 

[00:09:34]


>> The sydney opera house was completed in 1933. They kept the design true to the local style and culture. 
>> Where we are right now is absolutely beautiful. 
>> It is pretty safe, right? 
>> Yes. Well done. 
>> So far, blake has been put to work, while charlotte is pretty relaxed at the wheel. 
>> I have been cruising with the steering wheel so far. The boys are doing a lot of the work. 
>> Here it comes. 
>> We can do this all the way around the world if the wind stays. 
>> What he is explaining is the way to zigzag when you are sailing against the wind. 
>> That is really nice. 
>> If I am scared, you should be scared. 

[00:11:35]


>> We stayed on a sharple. Charlotte handled everything very calmly. 
>> I can touch the water from here. You should not able to do this. We are about to fall in. Oh my god. 
>> This experience has been so fun. Something that I would n normally do. 
>> It was scary when theboat went like this. I almost fell off. 
>> She was not even close. 
>> I was in extreme danger, you know? Sharks, crocodiles. 
>> "Awesome adventures"?? ?? 

[00:14:43]


>> after spending some time on the bridge and in the water, we were ready to head tanother landmark in sydney. 
>> You know you are doing something serious when you have to get into a jump suit. 
>> We geared up and went high up above the city for a skywalk. The sky walk is a 360 degree of the city. 
>> Awesome. 
>> Ready? 
>> That is scary. 
>> I would do this again. 
>> I have definitely pushed my limit with heights today. I am glad I face my fear. 
>> The sunset walk on the tower eye capped off a great day in sydney. I had a great time in the city, but it is time to head to the northern territory. 
>> The top of australia is a stonegate expense of landscape. I am going to the northern part of austria to get a look at some aboriginal sites. This national park is a three- hour drive from darwin. Aborigines are the indigenous people to australia and have a rich culture and history. First up, I wanted to learn more about a secret aborigine site. I took a ranger-guided walking tour to learn about their area and the rock garden that date back 20,000 years. 

[00:16:45]


>> We have three stories that are told in the rock art. 
>> It was fabulous received the depth and detail of each drawn. After this, I went to meet my friend for a river cruise. 
>> They cannot see us- we cannot see them very well. They pretty much blend in with the mind and it is nice camouflage. 
>> This river separates the aborigine territories. One thing that caught my eye on the river was a number of crocodiles. They were everywhere. We were taught a lot about the nearby land and wildlife that lives here. 
>> How much does a typical crocodile he? He also talked about different uses for plants and trees. 
>> On the inside, the plan is fibers. 
>> I am going to use this for my base. Here we go. 
>> The trip culminated with a very rare experience, as we were invited onto the private aborigine side of the river. He also demonstrated some fixed 
-- impressive skills with the hunting spear. 1, 2, 3. 

[00:18:46]


>> A full day fund enough time for a river cruise and a hike. Now it is time to head into darwin with one more -- for one more adventure. 
>> Welcome back to "awesome adventures." We started out in sydney for an epic day around town. Then it was up to the northern territory for some culture. 

[00:20:59]


>> We are getting up to play now in darwin. 
>> Today, I am in darwin with meghan. She will be joining me on my neck set of adventures. 
>> How are you doing? Things look pretty impressive from here, but maybe we should get an up close look. 
>> You guys came up? Excellent. 
>> Seeing our sydney team in darwin was quite a shock. Meghan took us around to get some good croc encounters it that I want to give you a demonstration of some of our big crocodiles. Pretty amazing. 
>> Oh my god. 
>> Is it tame? 
>> No, no. 
>> Oh my god. 
>> This is our heaviest crocodile. About over 750 kilos. 
>> How long can they stay underwater for? 

[00:23:04]


>> There are reports of about two hours. They can lower their heart rate down to about four beats in a minute. These guys to get the whole length of their body to get out of the water. They will use their tail to launch out of the water. These guys are harmless. They cannot rick your limbs off, but you will need some stitches. Not quite harmless. There you go, perfect. 
>> He is not letting go. 
>> Hold on. 
>> Bla and charlotte wrapped up their fishing for crocks and we looked at our last avenger of the day. 
>> We are getting into the aptly named cage of death. 
>> Maybe they should change the name. 
>> I am excited. 
>> I am freaking out. This is scary. I could tell that he was just as scared as I was. 
>> You could really hear and feel it, it was ridiculous.

That also houses a few things. Scraps of salvaged wood are used to create sliding doors, lamp bases, door trim, and decorative containers. Fabric scraps come together to create rugs and valances. We call upon nature for some of the artful accessories in the room. We add a few quirky touches that are naturally welcoming and conversational. Keep it here for all things naturally tucorative, today on b organic. I'm michele beschen and I love sharing ideas, especially ideas that celebrate nature, resourcefulness, and doi things yourself.

whenever I'm faced with having a room to redo in the house, i, like a lot of you, find that sometimes it times out when there isn't a budget to work with. But we can't let that keep us from getting things done. The way I look at it is it's more of a creative challenge. We challenge ourselves to work with what we have. 

[00:02:01]


It gives us an opportunity to use up a lot of materials that we may have lying around. I also find that it's a more rewarding process, because we come up with a lot of ideas that we wouldn't have otherwise come up with if we were able to just go out and buy everything we needed. This particular room we're working in, this is a guest bedroom. It was drab to begin with. It had this funny paint job on it that I started but never finished. The first thing I did was I brightened up the space and painted the walls with some leftover white paint. For that pop of color, I took more leftover paint and added that to the doors. I always find myself going to the leftover paint bin first, because it's a great way to use up that paint that otherwise would sit on the shelves, dry out, and go to waste. The first piece of furniture we obviously needed was a bed. Since I couldn't go out and just buy one, we ended up building one. I wanted to have a platform bed, because the ceilings slant down. I thought a platform bed would be very easy to build. We ended up building a base about 12 inches high, and we used some leftover beams. We created some crossbars, so it was stable and sturdy. Then we easily topped it off with two 36-inch doors. That gets us to the right height for our mattress. I like look o the peeled paint on the doors. I tested to make sure they didn't have lead on them. I simply cleaned them up and sealed them. You could also strip down the old paint and refinish them. You could also give them a fresh coat of paint for a different type of look. Lots of options with that. We put the doors on the base, screwed them into place good so nothing shifts on you, and your bed is built. Because we have these slanted ceilings in the room, I didn't have a lot of room to work with for a headboard. I did find that I had space behind the wall. So we cut into it to create shelving, give us some additional storage space. We could have left it open 

[00:04:03]


and had that the look of a headboard. Instead we decided to enclose it with some sliding doors. It was when we went to build the sliding doors -- again, having to work with materials we have, that led to a lot of fun uses for scraps. 
  ??????
wood scraps is one material that we used a lot of in a variety of different ways in this space. We worked with whatever wood we happen to have lying around: Pieces of old trim work; we hasome old fencing d barn board, bits and pieces left over from other projects. We worked primarily with smaller scraps and configured them in different ways. The scraps all had different finishes on the different colors of paint. When you put that together, that's what creates that interesting look. I always like to remind everybody too when you're working with salvaged or reclaimed wood it's not a bad idea to preform a lead test on the pieces. They are simple to use, inexpensive, you can get them at any home improvement store. That way you can avoid using that type of material in your project. For this sliding headboard we created in the room, we created two doors using the scraps. We first started with a base or a background for that, and we used 1/2-inch mdf. We took our scrap pieces, and they were all the same thickness. You could throw in a few that were a bit thicker and raised up here and there. Basically, al is start filling in this background with your scraps. What creates a finished look with this piece in the end is to take your scraps and round over the edges. 

[00:06:04]


There's a couple of easy ways you can go about doing that. You can use a trim router. This does a really slick job of creating an even roundover all the way around. You could also use your hand sander or hand sand. You're just wanting to break down those hard edges, because you can see that creates a more defined looking piece. It's all about personal preference. To attach these to our background, we simply use wood glue. As that glue gets tacky, that's going to help hold that board into pace. We're going to put a few nails in each board. You could also come in from the backside and screw things into place. To prevent things from splitting, I'm going to drill a pilot hole using a 1/16-inch bit. The nail heads can actually create another decorative lo. If you don't want to have that on the front side. Again, you can screw or nail from the back side. Then you get to play around with creating your design with all of your other pieces. You may have to make some cuts as you're going along to get pieces to fit. You can see how mixing in the different woods with different finishes on them and different sizes, laying them out different directions, that's what makes that look really cool in the end. Then once you have all your pieces in place, you want to frame things out. You're going to cut a piece to frame that out, miter your corners, and we'll wood glue and nail that all the way around. Once you have it all framed out, you want to come back and put a couple good coats of sealer over the top. You can use the same process for creating a piece of artwork. You can create cabinet doors. You can create one larger piece and have a fixed headboard. Ours is on the roller track system. You can get this in a variety of different styles, depending on the space you're working with, 

[00:08:06]


the size of the piece you're installing. Since we have such a confined space, we ended up havg to create our own. Then we took cue from this whole look of the headboard and used the scraps of wood in a variety of other ways throughout the room. We trimmed out the door. Who says you have to have one solid piece to trim out doors and windows? Again, you can see, each of the pieces, we rounded over the edges. In the end it really makes that door or window look more like a piece of art. We also took our scraps and created the bedside table lamp, which is very simple to do. We took more scraps and we stacked them to create the base to our lamp. You need to take each of your pieces and find center by creating an x corner to corner on the backside. In the middle of our x, that's where we're going to drill a hole in each piece using a 1/2-inch drill bit. We're using a 1/2-inch drill bit because we need to slip each of our scraps over this threaded rod, so we can run our wiring through it. Then you're ready to start stacking. For your first piece, you want to carve out the bottom side and also carve out an area for the cord. You only need to do that on your first piece, the one that sits at the bottom. You also want to add some felt or cork feet. Then you're ready to start stacking. You don't need to glue any of these together; just start setting them on top of each other. 

[00:10:08]


You want to keep turning things so that it stays balanced. You want it to sit steady. You keep stacking until you get the desired size of a base you want. We'll have the specs to the size we created on our website, so you'll know what size threaded pipe to have. When you get to the top, we needed to cover this up, because you need to have extra pipe at the top so you have room to get your hand in there and adjust the lighting and so forth. Use some black pipe or cut down a piece of conduit, and that creates a nice sleeve to set over the top. It dresses it up and finishes it off. Then all that's left is to run the wiring through there, hook up the socket, and your lamp is ready to go. We cleaned up our scrap bin, and we got some cool stuff out of the deal. 
  ??????
another scrap that we made good use of in the room was on the softer side. It was fabric scraps. We used fabric scraps to create the rugs and the valance. A lot of the scraps came from sample books. You can pick these up at flea markets, thrift stores. Sometimes retailers or interior designers will be looking to get rid of last season's books. Grab them up when you can. There's a lot of different patterns inside to work with. They're already cut to size. A lot of times the edges are all finished off. You can also work with material you happen to have that you can cut down into smaller pieces. Since we're making rugs, you want to be sure you're using a heavier weight fabric. You don't want to use delicate fabrics for this project. Primarily the sizes we worked with for the pieces, a lot of the books, they were 12 x 12 squares, some of them were rectangular in shape, a little smaller. You take your scraps and start piecing them together and doing a topstitch as you go. 

[00:12:11]


I like to take some pieces, work in small sections. I just worked in rows and stitched the rows together to get to that final size. You want to make sure everything is lining up as you want. You don't have to worry about your pieces lining up perfectly. Sometimes they're going to be a little bit off. This has a patchwork look to it, so it's very forgiving. You're going to have some overlap in some places. The main thing is that you're staying square on the outside so you have that square or rectangular look to your rug in the end. You just want to pin your pieces in place. We're going to stitch as we go. We did not pay any attention to the patterns, the colors. We worked with everything we had avaslable. When you end up putting all that together, for some reason, at the end, it always works. I'm not going to try to stitch all of this at once. I'm going to have this section I'm going to stitch together. I'm going to pin this one in place, and then I'll put these two sections together. You just keep working that as you go along. You'll notice some of these pieces have finished edges. That's how they came out of sample book. You could also serge the pieces that you cut yourself. You could leave them raw and have a bit of arayed look l the way across the rug. You would also finish them off with a stitch, if you like. We'll do a topstitch right across there. Go ahead and do this next one. 

[00:14:16]


Then we just add this to that first section we sewed together. As your rug starts to get bigger, you'll find that you'll probably roll the one side so it feeds through your machine easily. Your piece is going to keep growing and growing just like that. When you have it to the desired size, it should look like that. You can see how we have the irregular overlaps. It's really all about taking your pieces, making them fit. It all looks good in the end. It's also helpful sometimes to tape out your rug on the floor, put all your pieces in place. That way you know what it will look like ahead of time. To keep things from shifting once you put the rug in place, you can stitch some of this rug backing to the backside. You can just lay it in place. You could also use carpet tape. That helps stiffen things up and keep it from shifting around. You can get some good-sized area rugs for little money, if any, by working with materials you have and making good use of the scraps you have lying around. Another way to get this same patchwork look area rug that is very economical is by making use of -- these are carpet squares. You can usually find leftover bits at carpet stores or restores. You can get these for a little over a dollar apiece. All you do is attach them with carpet tape on the back side. You can see bits and pieces of this and that can come together to create really unique looks for very little money. You're also not letting anything go to waste. 

[00:16:17]


You could also head outside for your decorating materials. Nature can provide you with a lot of different materials to decorate with. I use it all the time. In this particular room, we had created cool wall art using empty frames and branches. You can really personalize things to your space, but nature really does go with everything. It's very economical to use. For the twig art we created, of course, the larger your empty frame, the larger the branches you're going to need. I'm going to work with this smaller frame. I have some sticks cut down that will fit the width of my frame. You can see there's a lot of different decorative effects you can do with sticks. You can add some paint for vibrant color, different patterns. What I did on mine was I like add some sayings. To do that we took our branches in their natural state and using a pocket knife, peel back the bark. You just want to peel enough of the bark away to fit whatever saying you're going to put on there. To transfer your saying, I printed them out on the computer, used carbon or tracing paper. That will give you a stencil to work off of. Trace that into that bare space, and then you're going to use a wood burner to trace around your lettering. S very simple to do. It adds a more playful touch to things. To attach your twigs to the inside of your frame -- most of your frames are going to have this recessed area in the back. That's what we're going to work off of to attach them. You're going to simply use some hot glue. I have wood glue sticks in here. You could also use some small nails, but I found it's a lot easier to glue things into place, and it does hold things nicely. 

[00:18:20]


I'm going to be careful not to use too much glue so that it oozes out the front side. You want to hide the fact that you're using the glue. I'll throw in some of these colorful ones. You just measure and cut as you go. Keep filling it in till you have a design and took you like. In an instant, you've got cool artwork that didn't cost you anything to create. Another decorative way to throw nature into the mix is by creating these driftwood planters. These are great to set on dressers or countertop we're going to drill a small hole in our driftwood. We're going to drill our hole using -- this is called a forstner bit that we have in our drill. They come in a variety of different sizes, depending on what size of a hole you want to create or how wide the log or piece of driftwood is that you're working with. We're going to go down about a good inch, inch and a half. 

[00:20:29]


That does a nice job of creating a cavity in there. You could put a little tea light in there. What we like to do is take some of this floral foam, and depending on whether you're putting fresh flowers or dried... All you do is shape it so it fits inside that hole. You want it to stick up above the hole. That way you can utilize that space to put some of your fresh flowers in. It's a different way to create an arrangement than a typical vase. Another way to use those pieces of driftwood is to create some ring or keyholders, another item that's great to set on a dresser or countertop, a place for somebody to put their jewelry or keys. All we did was we took our driftwood, drilled some holes in different places, and took some smaller branches that fit inside those holes and glued them into place. It's an easy way to create another rustic storage piece. It's like once you do one piece, it always leads to another and another. And you start to look at things ently. This is a piece I found outside, and it looked like a dancer to me, so we sculpted a little head. And that makes for a cool sculpture. Next time you're in need of some decorative accessories and have run out of money, you don't have anything left to decorate with, run outside and you'll be surprised at what you come up with. 
    

[00:22:33]


 ??????
we also used pieces of driftwood to support our bedside tables, and the tables themselves are simple concrete slabs that we formed up and made just like the counters we did in our kitchen redo. We added some natural impressions, but very inexpensive, simple project. It makes for a unique side table option. Another way to incorporate nature into a room, which I think is very important, is by the use of fresh plants. I think greenery is important. It cleans the air in the room. Instead of having them sitting on table tops, we hung them vertically. We created some planter boxes to house the pots. We again used salvaged wood and scraps to form things up. Then your plant slides right inside there. That really livens up a wall. You'll take the plants out when you need to water them and slip them back into the box. It's simple to maintain. I think it's important for you to keep things playful when you're decorating, really have fun with things. This is a guest room, so we played up the whole guest room theme. We added the fun sayings to our twig art. You can also add touches; like this is a beauty bar. A bar is simple to construct. It's three pieces with a base. Then you'll put in your center section leaving the back side open and top it off. Then you can have some fun with accessorizing it using some bar-style containers. Another bar that plays out very well for a guest room is a minibar. We simply took a shadow box to hang on the wall and stocked that with our minibar supplies, put out some healthy snacks, some beverages. Another fun touch is to add a local gift basket of sorts. Fill it with some travel brochures, things that highlight attractions in the area, some local products. Maybe you make some of your own brews. That way they get a taste of what is in your area. So it gives them ideas of where to go visit and things to do while they're here. When you fill a space with repurposes, recycled materials, it really adds to the story and the space feels naturally decorative and welcoming. For your next room redo, I challenge you to also work with what you 

[00:24:33]


have. Find inundated uses for some of those leftover materials that you have lying around in your back yard finds and see what you come up with. It really is a cool process. I'm pretty confident you'll be impressed with what you can do.

A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... Should we shoot them? ...An old friend who's informing you to the fbi... You know spies -- a bunch of little girls. ...Family, too... Is that your mom again? ...If you're desperate. Someone needs your help. Bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere. There's a good reason covert operatives keep their work a secret from their families. Once your family knows what you do, you've got problems. Best case -- they're scared. Worst case -- they figure they can get into trouble and you'll get them out of it. Yeah. Nate: Mike, it's your brher. Listen, uh, I'm out at Opa-Locka Airport, and I got a situation. I need you to come out and meet me. I got to go. [ Grunts ] come on, man. [ Grunting ] first you told me to leave, and now you're gonna kill me? That doesn't even make sense, all right? I mean, it's gonna take you hours to deal with my body, and then there's the cops. Come on, man. Come back, I shoot you in the face. What the hell were you doing? Working. You're always on my ass to get a job, so here -- 

[00:02:01]


I'm working. Lying in a heap in an airport parking lot -- how's that pay? My buddy got into some trouble with some guys and needed someone to talk to them. I said I'd do it for a grand. "Some guys?" What guys? Guys. I don't know. Look, I'm just trying to make a living here. Besides, you have no business giving me crap, bro. You're driving around in my car. Yourcar? Yeah, I busted for an entire summer working on this car. Mom had no right to give it to you. She said that dad wanted me to have it. Oh, okay. So you bailed, I take a double dose of dad's crap for years, and you get the car -- yeah, that's fair. Nate, is this your way of asking me to help you with this job? Is that what this is? It's like you read minds, bro. [ Sighs ] we work on this together, you clean up your act. 

[00:05:09]


If I don't help him with this job, he's gonna get himself killed. Oh, now he's decided that the car is his. I've never seen you this attached to anything, michael. If my dad left me this car, it was for a good reason. He wasn't the sort of guy who would just leave me this because he was feeling generous. I almost lost a finger putting in that air-filter case. I don't think he did you any favors. Yeah. Well, that was more his style. Try it now. [ Ignition clicks ] uh, check the ignition. [ Sighs ] you know, you've got a bug in there. A bug? Under the dash. Looks like sam's work. Fi, you don't know it's sam. I know sam's style. I thought you had an arrangement -- he tells the feds what you're up to, tells you what the feds are up to? I'll handle it. No, no, no, no. I'd be happy to take care of it. There's nothing like a smashed kneecap to remind sam who his friends are. Don't say anything. I know it's there. They'll only hear what I want them to hear. Is that tradecraft, michael? Or just protecting your friend? It's both, fi. I got to get cleaned up. Could you put this back together and don't -- I'll -- I'll behave. Maybe. I've worked airport security for a year. Log planes in and out, deal with the cargo manifests. So there's this family -- lebanese, I think -- the zamars. They're two brothers and a dad. They run some kind of import-export business. So the thing is, we became kind of friends. They gave me some stuff. Stuff? What kind of stuff? Basketball tickets, some nice tequila, loaned me money a few times. My -- my wife's pregnant. We're trying to get ready for the baby. It's been hard. I get it. You needed the money. Go on. Anyway, i-i did them some favors. 

[00:07:10]


I'd change the arrival times on planes in the log. It's against the rules, but it seemed like little stuff. Then, last week, they told me they wanted me to leave a flight off the log entirely, and that's serious. I-i didn't want to do it. And I remembered -- nate told me that you two had this kind of business helping people. Nate said we had a business together -- the two of us, like a team? Yeah. Yeah, he said he was gonna talk to the guys and get them off my back. I saw how well that went. They came to my house. They threatened me, threatened my wife. I-i said I was gonna quit my job. They said they were gonna hurt me if I did. I just want to give the money back and walk away. Can you just talk to them and... It's a little late for that, jake. I know I screwed up, okay? I just don't want my family to pay for it. And my wife, she... I'm barely hanging on to her as it is, man. I don't know what else to do. Please. I'll look into it. Thanks. I told your friend I'd help him out. You happy? You should be, too. I'm hustling you work. Yeah, it's almost like we're a team. You want to get in the car? Hey, about the car -- did mom show you dad's will? No, all I saw was an old pack of kools and an unfinished to-do list. Come on. You hated him. I put up with his crap. I rebuilt the car's engine. [ Engine sputters ] I'll give you the distributor cap if you agree we should find dad's will. Deal? Mike, you been doing some work on the charger? There's enough grease in here to lube a semi. You know, these pants are new. Yeah, fi and I have be doing a little work on it -- exhaust, electrical. Yeah? Yeah. What's wrong with it? 

[00:09:10]


Just glitchy. Glitchy? Yeah. [ Chuckling ] WELL, GLITCHY Is my specialty, mike. Really? Your specialty? Yeah. I might take you up on that. Thanks, sam. Here we go. I've looked into these guys a little bit for you. That's eli zamar. He runs the company. Ari and ilan are the sons. Eli's the one that beat up nate. The name sounds israeli, but jake said they were lebanese. Yeah, the business is registered there. They got an office here, and they got a hangar out at the airport. Now, this guy -- eli -- mike, I think he's had some training. Every time he comes outside, he does a perimeter scan. You see that? In gathering intel, little things can tell you a lot -- a topflight alarm system, well-placed cameras without blind spots, paying attention to strangers in the area. Uh-oh. Time to go. More aggressive intelligence gathering is more delicate. But someone who knows what to look for can find out a lot. Hey. [ Chuckles ] is this hangar 12? What are you looking for? Hangar 12. I think. I met this guy at a club, and he told me that he had a private plane and that he would take me up in it. And i-i get here, and it's nothing like a regular airport. No, this is a private airport. I mean, this is hangar 12, but it's not your friend's hangar 12. [ Chuckling ] God, what a jerk. What's the problem? No problem. Relax. You have to leave. You guys are working, huh? You know, before I go, do you guys have a bathroom? I mean, I drove all the way out here from south beach and it looks like I have to go all the way back and -- I'm sorry. You have to leave. 

[00:11:11]


Eli: Hey. [ Speaking native language ] you're the, uh, boss? That's right. I-i was just looking for a bathroom. No bathroom. Out. Okay. Unh. I just need to pee. If you know what to look for, a bunch of little things can tell you everything you need to know. Arms dealers. Great. Heavy stuff, too. That plane had new engines. It could probably carry a few .50-caliber machine guns, maybe even a small tank. Probably shipping off to some african war off limits to legit dealers. You're sure? I mean, you saw guns? Didn't need to. I know a gunrunner when I seene. They're my people. They ship in a special lubricant, and the whole hangar smells like it. [ Sniffs ] mmm! There it is! No wonder I got my ass kicked. Oh, you were lucky. The old guy had a desert eagle 9 millimeter with combat grip. Ex-mossad. What do you mean? Like israeli spies? Sure. Every other retired spook is an arms dealer. Not a bad gig, if you can stand the ex-spooks. You should probably call your client. So -- so, what do I do, huh? I mean, I never saw anything like that there. No, of course not. They're too smart to keep anything around that would get them busted. Listen, jake, now that we know what we're dealing with, we can try to do something. I should call the police. I-i know I'm gonna get busted. No, if you call the police, the only crimes they'll find are yours, and the zamars will know you turned on them. That's not good, jake. Take a look at this. This is how your job opened up. The old security manager died in a car accident. All of his brakes just happened to fail at the same time. I can't believe this. I went to a basketball game with these people. The seats weren't even that good. Well, next time you accept a bribe, I'd hold out for courtside ats. Jake, focus. We need to deal with the problem. 

[00:13:11]


I'm sorry. I don't -- what do I do? Cooperate. We need to get them busted with the guns, and they need to go down in a way that's unrelated to you so it looks like you had nothing to do with it. Get them busted with the guns. But where are the guns? That's what we're gonna go find out. [ Whistling ] mike, um, there's something I want to talk to you about. Yeah, sam? What is it? I know you've been pushing hard on this burn notice, trying to get yourself off the blacklist and all, and I understand that, but I'm getting a lot of pressure. Pressure? What kind of pressure? Well, you know, they -- they want me to give them more. It's always more, but the thing is that... Yeah, sam? Oh, hey, there they go. We'll talk about this later. One cheap and effective security measure is working in an area with low or no traffic. Anyone in a car is too obvious, so you force any would-be followers to get out and walk. They're in there somewhere. Oh, mikey, come on. It's 10 square blocks. My cardiovascular fitness isn't what it used to be. You never said we were gonna be walking. Rest frequently. Drink plenty of fluids. You'll be fine, sam. Okay. Where do I find fluids? 

[00:15:14]


Ilan: I'm telling you, there's no one here. Ari: Dad thought he saw someone. There's no one. But we have to check. I'm getting my shoes dirty. Fighting is something you want to avoid. Once youht someone, he knows your face. There's nobody here. Shut up. You kind of blow your cover when you hit a guy with a piece of rebar. But when you have no choice... Rebar it is. 

[00:17:15]

There's no jobs around here anyway. You want to shoot him? 

[00:19:15]


Shoot him. Let's go. Oh, you don't want to shoot him? Yeah, lovely. Huh? Yeah, batter up, huh? Oh, strike three! You're laid off! Yeah! They're careful. If we're gonna get them caught on anything serious, it's gonna take some more time. [ Sighs ] then I want melody out of here. I mean, this was my mistake. She shouldn't have to pay for it. When the zamars ask why your wife left town, what are you gonna say? They came to see me yesterday. They got another shipment going out soon. They gave me more basketball tickets. They're expecting my answer today. What do I say? Since they're probably planning on killing you if you say anything else, I'd suggest "yes." Mike, I save your ass at the warehouse. The least you could do is have some decent beer in the fridge. We still have to find out where they keep their guns. I think you're gonna have to do the spy thing, mike. Make a new friend. But I can't get an angle on this father. I mean, his security drill is airtight. What about the brothers? The older brother's the same. He goes to work. He goes home. There's no way in. Younger? I talked to him in the hangar. He's not so bright. I could check him out. Maybe you should bug his car. Yeah, maybe I should. I'll do the recon. I'll see you guys around. When you want to turn someone into an asset, get him to betray the people he loves, you have to get to know him. This wine is warm. This is very good wine. You're supposed to drink it a little warm. Well, I like it colder. Why did you spend $300 on a bottle of warm wine? Did you speak to your dad about that trip? Yes. He said not this year. 

[00:21:15]


How are we supposed to have a life if he barely lets you do anything? You need to know his frustrations. Who's coming? You need to know how he spends his time and money. Paulie? What? He sucks. You need to understand his hopes and dreams. Cover up a little bit. Everybody is looking, okay? Cover up a little bit. Uh-huh. Okay. Well, call me. Tonight, we'll go to the club. We'll have a nice time and no more talk about work. Okay, and then we have to be home by 2:00 because you're a 30-year-old guy with a curfew. Oh, come on. Dot be like that. Ouch. Ari, I don't understand you. Hey, mikey. You read this guy's profile, you're gonna kiss me. I am not gonna kiss you, sam. Look, I'm not saying I'm gonna like it. I'm just saying you're gonna kiss me. It is that good. All right. Let's make you into an arms dealer. C-4 has a plastic sheen and a puttylike consistency. If you need to counterfeit it, the best thing I've found is cake icing, or fondant, as it is known in the baking trade. Hey, how's the rest of the cover i.D.? Pretty good. Got you a fake rolex. Got a buddy who can rent us an aston martin pretty cheap. There's your businescard. "Steve remington"? That's my name? [ Laughing ] YEAH. I got to have some fun, mike. Oh, here we go. Got you a list of ari's favorite wines, his position in the family business, favorite clubs, even where he likes to vacation. Nice work. Are you done making the fake plastic explosive? Can I lick that? Knock yourself out. If you need a moldable explosive that makes a bang, someone with fiona's skills can make homemade c-4 

[00:23:15]


with spackle, petroleum jelly, and a bunch of other things i don't even want to know about. How's it coming, fi? Dangerous. Unstable. Remind you of anyone? Pack it up, put a detonator on it, and make it look pretty. We have to put our best foot forward. I'll wrap it in a bow. All right, I got to go to my mom's place. Sam. Sam: Mike. Fi, be good. Hello, michael. Mom. Nate, you find dad's will yet? No, not yet. I didn't know you were arrested so many times. [ Laughing ] You know that dad kept notes? Not surprised. On paper, you're a bigger screw-up than me. You stole more cars by the time you were 12 than I did my entire life. Dad was never around. You ever wonder how we got to the store to get groceries when dad was on a tear? I'm gonna get some more files. Mom, I need to borrow dad's cuff links and his cigarette case. Nate is tearing up this house trying to find your dad's will. This is gonna be one more thing you two are gonna fight about. I'll give them back in a few days. I just need it for the job, mom. He's so angry about the car. Why is it so important? I think he just wants to know what it means, why dad gave it to me. Because he loved you. He wanted you to have something to remember him by. Now, why is that so complicated? It's not complicated. It just... Doesn't sound like dad. Excuse me. Do you have the 2003 fisher vineyards coach insignia by the glass? Not by the glass. By the bottle. What the hell? I'll take the whole bottle. Okay. It's a good bottle. For $300, it better be a very good glass. You know your wine. 

[00:25:16]


A little. Thank you. Try this? I'd love to. A glass, please. What's your name? Steve remington. Steve, ari zamar. Mmm. I love it. You want to join me? I have a table. Who are you with? I'm with my girlfriend, debbie. I don't want to impose. No, no, no. Please. Beautiful wine. You can come join us at the table. Come on. Another glass, please. Let's go. Follow me. You ever meet someone, and it just seems to click instantly? You like the same things, share the same opinions. It seems like you've known them all your life. It could be fate, or it could be that you have a listening device planted under the dashboard of your car. So there I am, in the mountains of ghanistan, and I don't speak a word of the dialect. I got all this training, I'm sent over there, and I'm stuck with a bunch of guys from the wrong side of the country. I love it. I love it. [ Cellphone ringing ] excuse me. Excuse me. Ah, it's just my brother. So, what did you do? Well, I tried like hell to learn the language, and I ate goat for a month. Oh, I love it. Afghanistan? Are you serious? That's crazy. Why were you over here? Business -- this and that. To miami. To miami. Where the beautiful women are allowed to go outside. You'd be surprised how often covert operatives pose as international men of mystery. Fantasies about glamorous covert ops can be extremely useful to exploit, though some secret-agent 

[00:27:17]


fantasies are more useful than others. Now that we know each other, I have a confession to make. It's not a coincidence that we met tonight. I want to talk to you about something, about work. I do import-export -- furniture, regional food, import the cigarettes. Ari, we're adults here. The fact is, the people in my business know about your family's operations, and weespect it. I'm listening. We also know that your father does not work with anyone outsid the family. Still, your name gets around. We also hear about your brother. Yeah, he's been calling me all night. He's probably on his way here now. That's why I want to talk to you about an opportunity. What opportunity? Why don't you mind your own business? I don't want to cause problems. If you're not allowed to talk about your family's -- no, no, no. I'm allowed to do whatever I want. It's just that my father is a little, you know... Your father again? I don't want to get in the middle of this. I just heard that you were the one in the family thinking big. God, it's my brother. Ari, where been? I called you three, four times. I've been here. What do you want? Let's go. I'm having fun. Now. Nice car. I'm a little tired of it, actually. I want to upgrade to the new model. Sorry about earlier. My, uh, family is a little paranoid. Comes with the territory. So, tell me about the deal. I was in town to do a deal with some plastique -- good stuff, military-grade -- but the contact fell through. Anybody in the arms trade knows that the mand burn. 

[00:29:17]


It's a detonator on whatever you're selling in case the deal goes bad. This is very high grade -- 40% cheaper than what you can get commercially with all the same kick, of course. I just need a distributor. You get e buyers, you could double your profits, ari. How do I know this is good? Oh, it's very good stuff. You want a little demonstration? Please. Are we in business? 

[00:32:13]


"Burn notice" will be right back. see girlfriend? Debbie? She's not coming, no, which is good, because I think ari is the jealous type. Well, I can see why she likes you. You look like a secret agent. Listen, fi, I just need ari to show me where daddy keeps his guns. We bring in the cops. Everyone goes home happy except debbie. Well, maybe you shouldn't be so hasty. Imagine some south beach model hanging on your every word. 

[00:34:19]


How many times she call you? Five. Maybe she wants ari to do the deal. She wants to trade up. Admit it. 
?????? You are tempted   ??????
not for a minute, fi. [ Sighs ] if I need a beautiful woman to mess up my life... I could do a lot better than debbi oh, you know your chardonnay. A little. Don't be modest. You should come to my place in france. They call it a ch????teau, but really, it's just a big house. [ Chuckles ] so about this deal... I think we should start with something small. Okay. In addition to the c-4, I can get you... Military-gde .50-caliber machine guns. 50-caliber? Wow. And then we can go bigger. I just need to see your operation. Oh, no, operation -- no, I can't do that. My father would kill me. Are you kidding me? Ari, this is about trust. I can't just give you a .50-caliber machine gun to sell without knowing what warehouse it's going to, what transport it's getting on. I can't. It's impossible. You know what? Forget it. I'm going out on a limb here, and you don't trust me. No, I get that. I understand, and that's fine. It's just not how I do business. So thank you for your time. I'll get the check. Ah, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. I like you. I like you. Okay, meet me tomorrow night. We'll see. Okay? Are you happy? Very happy. I can do the deal and then talk to ilan and dad. You can make a lot of money. Okay, sounds like he's gonna go for it. Just goes to show you -- a car is a bad place to have a conversation. Mike, you know 

[00:36:19]


I was gonna tell you. What's that, sam? Don't treat me like I'm stupid. The bug in your car. I thought we had a deal, sam. Mike, we do. I help you out. I tell you what I know. But they know you got something. They wanted me to bust into your place and search it. I told them I wouldn't do it, so they made me plant a bug and said if I told you, they'd be all over us. So break into my place. Yeah? Search it. These fbi guys don't know anything. It might get the attention of someone useful. I got to go. Jake's meeting with the zamars tonight, so you should have a couple of hours. I would search in the kitchen area. Cabinets? Sink. Behind? Under. Don't break anything. All right, then. So, tomorrow, you'll do this, huh? You'll talk to the customs people, yes? Yeah. Is there a problem? N-no, there's no problem. You need some motivation, huh? Huh? Huh? Ow! Hey! I'm sick and tired of waiting. I have to be somewhere, and this... Get up. Get up! [ Grunts ] it's me. You never answer my calls. Where's ari? He's coming. He's getting bitched out by his dad or something. I wanted to talk to you alone. How long are you in town? Aren't you and ari engaged? Whatever. Whatever. Come on. Can you have a little fun? You've been around the world, but you never talk about a girlfriend. Debbie. Get out of here. Now I know your secret, you son of a bitch. 

[00:38:19]


Get in there! Get in there! Ari, calm down. I don't know what you think you know. You lied to me! Dealing with a blown cover is about stalling for time. Stay alive long enough to figure out what they know and tell a bigger lie to save yourself. You lied to me since day one! What is this secret you're talking about? You wanted debbie, huh? You wanted debbie from the beginning. Debbie? That's what you thought? I saw you! [ Lahing ] you were watching me the whole time, weren't you? You sent her over to test me. You wanted to see how I handled the pressure. Oh, that's good. Oh, you are good. [ Chuckles ] so, what -- did I pass? [ Chuckles ] yeah, yeah, yeah. [ Laughing ] Oh. Oh. Oh, your father trained you well, ari. Yeah. So, I see the operation? Yeah. Yeah, okay. 

[00:41:32]


Promotional consideration paid for by... "Burn notice" will return after thesages. car on takes some getting used to. The good news is, that the driver's busy making sure you can't see anything, he's not paying attention to wheer he's being followed. I'll take you to the warehouse, but if you screw me -- why would I want to screw you? I've got merchandise to sell. You've got buyers. It's that simple. I just want to know at I'm getting into. Okay. Okay. Security is airtight. The warehouse is not connected to us. We keep the weapons there till we ship. If the cops come, they can't arrest anybody. A dead drop. So what if someone tries to steal your merchandise? Nobody knows where it is -- just the family. Out. 

[00:43:36]


There. Now you see the operation. Not bad... On the warehouse front. What about security? We have no problems with cops. We have cops on the payroll. They let us know if there's a problem. Great. M1a .308. Nicely balanced. Special forces. Airport security? We have a guy. Reliable? Yeah. If not, we, uh -- how do they say? -- we liquidate him. Fn p90 with halo sight. State of the art -- very nice. Looks like you have things wired here. So, are we gonna do some business? After we send out the shipment, we'll make a deal. You and I -- we put it together, and then I take the deal to my father. Trust me. You're doing him a favor. Shall we? You want me to talk to them again? They'll kill me. You see what they did. I thought the plan was to find the guns and call the cops. That plan won't work anymore. They've got cops on the payroll, jake. If you want to get out of this, it's your best chance. For your family. What do I do? I think it's about time the zamar family learned about ari's new friend. Any good operative is going to be a bit of a control freak. Above all, they don't want to hear that the people they think they own really belong to someone who can destroy them. Look, I said I would help you. I got to help your friends now? I can't do this -- what are you talking about? What friend? Steve something. He said he worked with ari. He checked out the logs, had me sw him the airport. He said I belong tm now. 

[00:45:36]


What the hell is that supposed to mean -- I belong to him? He had my social security number, my passport information. He had all kinds of stuff about you guys, too -- pictures. What are you talking about? I don't know what's happening to me. I want my life back. Give me my life back. Shut up! Shut up! Hey. Who is this person? Who is he? I don't know. Okay, that's what I'm saying. He said he was friends with ari. I don't know anything. Get out. Get out! Ari, what did you do? I've told you ver to talk to anyone! No, no. This is my deal. I did this on my own. A deal? Who asked you to do this deal? Who is this friend, huh? What -- what -- he has documents about us, pictures. Met him at a club. He came to me. What does he know? Did you tell him anything? Did you show him anything?! I showed him the warehouse. We took a little tour. But -- but it's okay. He was blindfolded. He just wanted to see the operation and -- ilan, go to the warehouse now. Come, you fool! [ Shouting in native language] [ breathing heavily ] was that oka Fiona: Perfect. Michael trained you well. They're on their way, ael. I am telling you, he was the real deal, okay? He had the trunk full of c-4 -- stop! 

[00:47:37]


Someone's there. It's all gone... ...Everything. There's nothing worse for anyone who spent time in intelligence work than being up against a ghost. You can deal with an enemy you know, but an enemy you don't know? He could be a competitor who knows all about your operation... ...Could be law enforcement geing ready to bust you... Could be a foreign agent setting you up in some deep spy game. Your only option is to disappear. Steve remington -- he said he was special forces. Try again. He could be using a different name. Enough, ari! Let's go. Get moving! [ Ringing ] as long as they think steve remington owns you, you're safe. As far as they know, there's a mystery man out there who can destroy them, and you're his property. Thank you. Yeah. I'm not here fishing for thanks. You need to understand the situation. Eli will have his ear to the ground forever. If word gets out he got conned, you're dead. You guys look so serious. Come on. It's not that hard, man. 

[00:49:38]


I mean, secrets are what keep a family strong, right? Something like that.

Center for customers with disabilities at 800-974-6006 tty/v. glad happy. I got to tell you, though, when I busted into mike's place, I didn't know if I was gonna find anything, and then I find this document here in a hidey-hole under the sink. I don't know. Maybe he's as bad as you guys say. We sent this up the ladder, sam. This document's classified. Westen shouldn't have had this. They're looking for leaks. Well, that's nice. But the point here, fellas, is I brought home the bacon. You got prime goods on my buddy mike right there. We're off the case, sam. This thing's serious enough washington's sending someone else down. Westen's someone else's problem now. Yeah? New surveillance? What -- what department? Don't know. Don't care. Enjoy your lunch, sam. See you around. Yeah. Huh. Thanks, fellas. I'm gonna miss you guys, you know? Mike. Mike: Hey, sam. Yeah, good news and bad news. Good news is, your fbi tail got pulled. Bad news is, they're sending someone new down. Sounds heavy. Thanks, Sam. Who's the new surveillance? Hell if I know. Oh, uh, there's more good news. They were so eager to get rid of you,

Ma, it doesn't mention the car in the will. I know. You know? I wanted michael to know that his father remembered him in the end, and, nate, you spent more time with him. You lied. Yeah. Makes sense. You know what, nate? Fi. I'll flip you for it. [ Chuckles ] all right. Heads. Yeah. Of course. You know what? You won it fair and square, bro. Now, you see, michael, you're too hard on him. I mean, he can be so sweet. I just want us to be family. I know, mom. I know. He just stole my wallet. Nate! Nate!

=======================================================

Just wide swathe of damage. 
>> It always happens in somebody else's backyard n the midwest or south. But something like this would just not anticipated and could not have been icipated based on history. 
>> Rose: Also this evening the last political weekend before the election on tuesday, we talk with john dickerson the political director of cbs news. 
>> Ohio is still the granddaddy of them all. Governor romney's going there the most of all the battleground state, the same with the president. Right now you would have to say that the president has the better electoral map, the polls in more battleground states are favouring him. But romney is doing better in north carolina and florida, and on the early vote he's doing well in those states, doing well in colorado. But the president is doing well in iowa an nevada with the early vote which tells us a little bit how this thing is starting to break. 
>> We close this evening with this question what is the impact of the digital revolution on books, writers and publishing. Joining me ken auletta, tim o reilly, jonathan safran foer an jane frieman. 
>> I LIKE THE IDEA OF eBOOKS How they can democratize books. Ma what I am afraid of is on platforms tat have distracks an are inherently fast makes it harder to make books books. 
>> It is so important to have historical perspective. You know what we consider the book today is a relatively recent historical phenomenon. I totally disagree that homer would recognize the book. You know actually we probably more recognize the eBOOK. 
>> Rose: Hurricane sandy, politics and publishing when we continue. 
>> Funding for charlie rose was provided by the following: Captioning sponsored by Rose communications from our studios in new york city, this is charlie rose. 

[00:03:10]

His fce has been at the front line of rescue and relief efforts. The police department is working overtime in all areas of the city. Not only to detect criminal behavior but also to be engaged with all the people who areart of the response to this tragedy. I'm pleased to have ray kelly back on this program. Welcome. 
>> Good to be with you, charlie. 
>> Rose: We taped this at 5:00 on this day. You just got phone call about the marathon. 
>> Yerk the mayor has decided to cancel the marathon. The marathon has always been a unifying force in the city. And he didn't want it to be something that resulted in division or divisiveness. So he's decided that the marathon shouldn't go forward but that the sponsors, he's asked the sponsors to do this and they've agreed to donate the money that they were going to contribute to the victims of hurricane sandy. 
>> So no marathon on sunday do. We know yet whether it will be rescheduled for another time or is it simply not going to be a marathon for a while. 
>> To the best of my knowledge it's going to be can selled for this year. 
>> There was growing tension. And this issue seemed to be getting an increasing amount of tension. 
>> Yeah, obviously there was a lot of concern. People in staten island were concerned that resources were going to be somehow diverted from the recovery effort. That certainly wouldn't be the case for the police department. We have of staffing and funding the marathon that would not have impacted on the resource. 
>> Rose: You could have done both and continue your effort and also taken care of what your responsibilities were with the marathon. 
>> That's correct. We could have. But, and we said that to the political leadership of staten island. But obviously they were still concerned. 

[00:05:14]


>> Rose: Tell me what you have been doing, you personally first, since you knew this hurricane was going to be imminent. Did you going into this know that it could be this bad? 
>> No, I don't think anybody thought it could be this bad. 
>> Rose: What you have called as the worst thing to happen to new york since 9/11. 
>> Without a doubt. No question about it. But we have been very much engaged in preparation for, but you can only do so much. You can reasonably-- . 
>> Rose: What was the preparation. 
>> You know, the preparation was to put police officers on extended tours to make certain that our own facilities in the flood areas were shored up as best as possible. We've have tabletop exercises that sort of thing. But nobody anticipated the storm being as bad as it was. 
>> Rose: What did you need that you did not have there response to this. 
>> There is not something that you could have handled where additional material. I mean mother nature was mother nature. There is only some of you can do to prepare for it. This was overwhelming. The brent and scope of this storm is unlike anythi that we've ever seen. 
>> Rose: To staten island to westchester county, to long island. 
>> Right. 
>> Rose: To lower manhattan, upper manhattan. 
>> Precisely. But the scope of the damage, it looked to me, it reminded me of vietnam, seeing areas that were bombed out, the b-52 bombings. Obviously didn't have the structuresre that we have here but this wide swathe of damage. And you know it always happens in somebody else's backyard it happens in the midwest or happens in the south. But something like this, of which is so the anticipated and would could not have been anticipated based on our history. 
>> Rose: How do power outages affect the police department? 
>> Well, power outages are big concern for number one security reasons. You have a blackout in a wide portions of the city, you have no traffic lights, you have no lights at all,. 

[00:07:22]


>> Rose: Not even in the precincts. 
>> We have some again-- we have generators in every precinct but we had precincts that were overwhelmed with water that we had to evacuate. We had water go up to the second story in the 100th precinct in rocaway, in the 60th precinct in cone island. We had the police service area 1 which is in our housing bureau was also wiped out. We had a steam fitter who was trapped in that building under rubble, two police officers went in and rescued him had. To swim in, get him out, pull him out frund the rubble and actually swim him to safety. That is one of many, many heroic stories. Ospecial operations division had 3,000 rescues during the storm. And I'm sure the fire department had a like number. So the scope of this and the size is something we've never seen before and didn't anticipate. 
>> Rose: And so what will you do now, what's the lesson as to what you might do in the future? 
>> Well, there's always lessons learned from any event. We would like to have a lot more light towers that you can put in the blocked out areas that light up a block. We could always use more of those. More boats, we have boats that are actually assigned to precincts. We call them john boats. We have 40 of them. We would like to have a lot more. More motorized boats. You know there is a whole series of we had a written, I thi it's now over 150 vehicles that were destroyed as a result of the-- . 
>> Rose: Who handled the evacuations? 
>> The evacuation was handled by a lot of different agencies. Certainly the police department. Most people obviously self-evacuated. They are leaving on their own. But there are people who can't do that. Fire department, police department, help them do that through oem coordination. You know, many people didn't evacuate. No question about it. People, wouldn't say poo-pooed but they obviously just as we didn't anticipate the ferociousness of the storm. 

[00:09:40]


>> Some people felt the last time it was not as bad as they thought it would be. They left, they came back. Their property had been. 
>> That's right. 
>> Had been stolen or whatever, broken into. And they thought I would be better off if I protected my property because the storm want as bad as they thought it was. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Rose: This time ty say I was stupid. 
>> I heard that fromny people. 
>> Rose: I did too. 
>> Many people that we stayed to protect our property because last time something happened to it. You know, people in t flood zones. And obviously they regretted it. We are now up to 41 deaths associated with the storm. And if could certainly grow. 
>> Rose: Most of them were from what? 
>> We had 20 in staten island. Drownings-- drowning, people, you know, in essence it was people who may have been hit by water and their head struck something or they just drown. They drowned in their own houses. People drown in their cars. Of course we had the heartbreaking story of two kids, two and four years of age. 
>> Rose: That made you cry. 
>> The mother put them on top of the car because the water was coming up and just a gush of water, wave took them away from her. 
>> Rose: Didn't she knock on the door and couldn't get answered wouldn't let her in. 
>> Yes. 
>> Rose: That's a story that killsou. 
>> Those two bodies were found yesterday after-- wz the water tore them out of her hands. 
>> They were up on top of the car, and tore them away. And many, many other heartbreaking story. 
>> Rose: Speaking of staten island, you know the people in staten island in some cases are saying we were neglected. 
>> Well, I can only tell you not by the police department. We have a major effort there. And we are also concerned about our own personnel who live on staten island, some how manies have been destroyed, eliminated. Things that as a family we've got to address internally. 
>> Rose: You have heard that before. 
>> Yeah, I mean, I've heard that I can tell you that there is a tremendous focus on staten island. I mean they're vulnerable, really the coastline is big in statenand. I over when I was there visiting, or with the mayor. And the damage is just horrific. 

[00:11:59]


>> Rose: Anybody killed at breezy point. 
>> Nobody was killed at breezy point. 
>> All the houses that burned. 
>> An off duty police officer who rescued his family and a grandparent, put them all up in an tic and he goes down to check the basement, never seen again. Drowned in the basement. 
>> Drowned in the basement. 
>> Yeah. I mean the force of this is just hard to-- hard to imagine. But it came so quickly. 
>> Rose: Often in disasters like this whether it's earthquakes or hurricanes or-- there are people who seize the moment to commit crimes. 
>> Right. 
>> Rose: What's happened in that arena? 
>> We have had some burglaries. We've seen an increase in burglaries. Cri is down over this period of time 35%. But we see an increase of 7% in burglaries. People breaking into homes. Now will that go up in terms of reports, probably because there is a lag factohere of people going back to their homes, you know, may report it later on. But we're concerned about the potential for looting. We have deployed a significant number of police officers. 
>> Rose: So you think you have been able to limit the amount of looting. 
>> Oh, yes. 
>> Rose: By police work. 
>> No question about it. But these areas are going to be without power for a significant period of time, long period of time. So we've got to-- . 
>> Rose: But even there i assume you are having a police presence by having cars on the street and things like that. >> Absolutely. We have a very large presence there. 
>> Rose: Yeah. Some are saying that this is a reminder of what, because of the power outages, that a cyberterrorist could do to a city. 
>> But we're very much concerned about cyberterrorism. No question about it, as a nation we've got to be concerned about it. You know, we can play offense as a country but we don't play defense very well. And that's the problem. Even our own-- . 

[00:14:03]


>> Rose: If are you playing defense you can lose one time and you have lost the game. 
>> Precisely so they can do lots of things. And it's something that we as a country have to focus on, have to put resources into. I mean obviously this is the after of this hurricane is going to require lots of resources too. But cyberterrorism is a reality. To knowhat people are doing things to out the world, you know, shutting down countries. We've seen for, we saw what happened in the ukraine with the russians doing it, kpon knowledge. 
>> Rose: What is happening in mali right now a lot of other places. 
>> Absolutely. So it's going to be the new frontier. It's going to be the new front in the war. 
>> Rose: When you look at what you have had to do, what has been the hardest thing for you as being in charge of new york police. 
>> At inn this storm. 
>> Rose: In response to this storm. 
>> Well, you know, just the requirement of having a large numbers of police officers in the affected areas. We are shutting down or greatly limiting other operations and we need to generate a significant number of officers in staten island, in the rocaways, in coney island. And to police the rest of the city as well. We 1r8.4 million people here who with-- they require police services throughout new york. Now about 375,000 people have been impacted by the storm immediately in the zone. Of course everybody has been impacted. There is no transit system, that sort of thing. But we've got to produce the resources, you know, to keep these areas safe. 
>> Rose: Governor cuomo said as you know these are the kind of storms you see every 100 years. Now we see them every two years. They are the people, including the mayor who said there may or may not be some connection to global warming. Clearly we're living in a different time. 

[00:16:05]


>> Absolutely. 
>> Rose: As a kid, you know, the amount of snow that you would see in the winter, snow 12 times, 15 times a year in my memory, you never see snowstorms. You see the tumultuous, this weird weather that is affecting us. So clearly something has happened. 
>> Rose: That is a demand to change the infrastructure as well as pay more attention to as the mayor said when he made his endorsemen yesterday. 
>> Precisely. 
>> Rose: He said it brings into sharp release political choices and that you really do have to be on the side of those people who are very concerned about global warming. 
>> Exactly. 
>> Rose: And expect political leadership to pay attention to that. 
>> Precisely. 
>> Thank you for coming. I know has been a-- police commissioner ray kelly, back in a moment. We'll look at the political weekend with john dickerson. Stay with us. We turn now to the other big story that all of us are concerned about, it is the election of the next president of the united states. This is the final weekend for the candidates to make their final arguments, their closing arguments. We will understand more on tuesday night when t voters go to the polls on tuesday. It is a very close race. Both sides think they're winning. We turn to john dickerson the cbs news political director for an analysis as we approach the election. Welcome. 
>> We have about five or ten minutes here. Give me a snapshot of where this election is as we go into this weekend and the candidates will be making their closing arguments. 
>> That's right. They're both making their closing arguments. They are all going to the same states. Those eight battleground states. Ohio is still the granddaddy of them all. Governor romney is going there the most of all the battleground states, the same with the president. Right now would you have to say tha president has the better electoral map. The polls in more battleground states are favouring him. But romney is doing better in north carolina and florida, and on the early vote he's doing well in those states, doing well in colorado. But the president is doing well in iowa and nevada with the early vote which tells it us a little bit how this thing is starting to break. 

[00:18:17]


>> Rose: Do they have two different views of america that they are appealing to? 
>> In this last moment they are both appealing to the last little undecideds. And so governor romney is making this case. He's basically saying you go with president obama, it's more of the same. 
>> Rose: More years of what happened and are you not happy with what happened. 
>> Exactly. And go with me and I have a plan. In his closing argument he goes through his five, he's even given some of his items, name, the names of the bills that he would enact. And the president is saying I'm not done yet. He says you know, I'm to the going to give up that fight. And then he goes in his closing argue speech he talks about various people. And he said they need a champion. So he is running as the champion for the middle class. And that is both a message to the base but it's also to those undecided voters. 
>> Rose: Romney is running as a champion of woman. 
>> Romney is running as a champion of everyone, he says. And of course that is to deal with the lingering problems from that surreptitiously taped 47%. But he is saying now that he is running as the candidate of change. Which taking president obama's tag line from '08 and basically saying I'm the one now who can provide kang because I've done it my whole life. And he ties it into his biography, I changed the olympic, I did it as a governor and private enterprise. 
>> Rose: I always wonder who why it takes politicians so long to come to what might have been an effective audience. 
>> Because they are going for other group, right now they are done with their base and going for undecided voters. There is a small number of them. The effective argument they are giving is now in part also because we're listening. There is a lot of -- some of this has been in the speeches before. But they've also then had to narrowcast and target to their own base which has put that other sort of pitch to the undecidings to the side as they've been pitching to their bases. 
>> Rose: As you go through a campaign free media has more and more significance, i assume. You have debates and things like that that shape views. And does it therefore mean that paid media has less influence as the campaign gets closer to shall did -- because in other reasons people are tired of it. 

[00:20:18]


>> Yeah. There is a lot of debate about this. So one theory of this election is that the advertisements that were run against mitt romney in ohio painted him. And that's as this rapacious businessman and that is why he can't break through in ohio. Then there is another argument that says advertisements don't stick with you very long is so a that money that was spent over the summer by the obama campaign didn't stick. And so now the money that is being spent in these last minutes by the romney campaign will stick because, they're reaching low information, undecided voters who are just now tune approximating in. Y don't watch the news a lot. They get their messages now as they start to think here comes the election. They see an ad, that forms their opinions. Off they go to the polls. 
>> Rose: Looking at your analysis, what do you worry out that you might have missed or might be wrong, you and others. 
>> Two big things we could have missed. One, is the is is that romney has more than we think he does. That there is a group not getting caught in the polls that he's got support that is not showing up in all of these polls. 
>> Rose: A silent majority. 
>> A silent majority. That is just worry because you don't know. We trust in polls and the polls have shown a certain thing. You always think maybe we're wrong because they are so divergent. What the president what we might be missing is that his new coalitioning younger voters, minorities have really changed the way this election works. This is the argument the obama campaign has given for states like nevada, colorado, florida, even northern virginia. That the demographic changes have been so big that we have missed that. And that they have been able to tap into those new voters they have registered, the latinos. The big number these have registered in nevada, that they have been able to register them and get them to the polls in a way that is much more effective than we know. 
>> Rose: John dickerson, thank you. 
>> Thanks so much. When we come back the impact of the digital revolution on books and publishing. Stay with us. John steinbeck once said the profession of book writing makes horse racing seem like a soiled, stable business. Those words have never sounded truer than they do today. Traditional publishings is the threat from all angles am book stores are closing around the country. Is there is a growing fear print technology is dying out all together. As always with great change comes great opportunity. Digital technology has the capacity to bring new forms of reading and new modes of publication. But to understand what the future of the book might look like t helps to appreciate some of its past. 

[00:22:54]


>> The manuscript library was built in 1963. Its white was ter shell has no windows this is to protect the treasures within. We're joined by david who is currently writing his own history of the book. 
>> Books aren't going away. I mean I think and the question is what role they will play seems to me its thing that is hard toast predict. One of the things that is really remarkable is as europe made the transition from world dominated by manuscript and manuscript proud the text th were bound into books, and by the end of the 15th century the print technology takes root. You find lots of people saying oh this print technology, it's very interesting. Its very efficient but everyone has access to everything, there are no controls. One doesn't really know if this thing has any real authority. The vocabulary in which anxiety-- are almost exactly the same, the kinds of anxiety about use wick pedestriania. 
>> Talking about print and manuscripts, here we have two books which were circulating at the same time. What is different about the print version and the manuscript version. 
>> This is interesting. What we have here this is a manuscript, a commonplace book would be the term where a reader has carefully copied into what was blank pages, poem, mostly peoples by john dunn and this is the first printing of done's peoples. Done was dead, he died in 1631. And dunn had never been very comfortable with the idea of his poems being printed. Manuscript circulation was in a way safer. 
>> -- Not quite familiar of the paranoia that they don't go to book but rather on-line it can spend by wildfire and get in the wrong hands of someone that might feel the same as other from manuscript to print. 
>> I think dunn z I think he was very conscious of that i think that print was unregulatable in a way that manuscriptually wasn't -- 

[00:24:59]


>> I think that narrative of displacement, you know this kills that, the famous line of hugo, I don't think it usually happens, though i will admit that the horse drawn buggy hasn't survived the car very well. One of the irreplacable aspects of the book as a object and as a technology is that the book absorbs histories. 
>> So we've got here two prayer books separated by 2 -- yrs. One of them is the most exquisite hand drawn beautiful manuscript and the other is a cheap printed copy deseened to look like the man you script. But what is it which is so unique about the printed copy. 
>> What is interesting about this one is that you see there, there is actually though this is a printed book, there's man script in it. And the writing in here this writing here says give me thy grace, good lord to set the world at naught it was written by sir thomas moore. This prayer book, moore had with him in the to per when he was incarcerated in 1534. And probably returned it to his daughter the night before his execution. 
>> Book becomes not merely the way in which the text is presented by this container of just assumes value of all sorts. And some of it is a sort of fetish value. I was struck the other day, I read that someone is now selling a perfume that is the smell of old books. 
>> David, we talked about books and fetishes. And this is shakespeare's's 1623, perhaps the most fetishistic book of all time. What you might have forgotten is that all of these objects are commercial objects. 
>> That's right. 
>> But there is an interesting acknowledgment of this as the book was put together by two of shakespeares friends john and henry. They say here is the book. And you can read it and enjoy it anyway you want. Do whatever you want. Do so but buy it first. 

[00:27:14]


>> Buy it first. 
>> But whatever you do, buy these are commercial properties and one way the book is the first mass produced object available for sale. 
>> My sense is I think if we didn't have books we'd invent them. And it does seem to me that durability is fascinating when you think that for the regime of the book has lasted 1500 years, hi a student a couple years ago who grandmother passed away. She said the one thing that made it better for her was that grandma had left her all her grandmother's books. And the young student looked at me and said it would have been really different if she had left me her kindl. 
>> Joining me now ken auletta, he writes for "the new yorker" magazine, tim o reilly of o reilly media. Jonathan safran to err and jane frieman who, it publishes and sells eks am I'm pleased to have each of them here to talk about something under great consideration. And some angst on the part of a lot of people it is the future of books in the wake of the digital revolution. I begin by this simple question, because you have talked about this. What is it that books mean? 
>> As we know them. 
>> Books represent civilization. But they have to be read so they have to be affordable. And they have to be convenient to find. And what the e revolution has done is it has helped if in that arena. 
>> So you don't fear losing something that was in essence about what a book reading was about? 
>> Absolutely not. I mean this is a format. What is the difference if a book is in hard bound or paperback or it'sn audio which I think is a wonderful medium for listening to literature. 
>> And now the e format is just another for mat and as you know very well know, every one is holding some sort of device now along with hopefully as well physical books, I think there will always be a market for the physical. But it's a wonderful way to read. And we are seeing statistics very quickly, we are seeing that people are reading more now because books are so convenient. 

[00:29:36]


>> I think I disagree. For two reasons. For two reasons. One, you know, books are about having important conversations whether they are nonfiction or fiction, important conversations with culture, important conversations with yourself. And with the author. And if you think about the most important conversations you have in your life and where you would like to have them and how would you like to have them, the context matters. It's very hard to have an intimate conversation in a public place. It's very hard to have a slow conversation in a fast set organize when you are rushed. And I like the idea of ebooks. I look how they can democratize books. What I am afraid of is that when they are on platforms that offer so many distractions and are inherently fast, that it's going to be harder and harder to have what makes books, books which is that kind of intimate conversation. And secondly, it's hard to imagi books can resist the temptations of the technology that will be available to them. You know, as soon as "the new york times" could print in color, affordably they started printing in color, in the case of the times, that is a good thing is it a good thing if novels start to include videos as they will have to, if they are on platforms that encourage video watching or make it possible anyway. 
>> Is it good -- 
>> because people are accustomed to video and expect video. 
>> Why wouldn't you have it. The "new york times" would be negligent if they didn't include video on their web site. We would say that it would seem silly to us. Part of what makes books reallyix il rating and so open, and allow them to generate the kinds of experiences that they do are the limitation of the form. That it leaves so much room for the reader to do work. 
>> You have made the point that books have protected their art form more than any other. I mean they've taken care-- taken care of their territory. 
>> Yeah, not for entirely good reasons. I mean books have been elitist historically. And haven't been as democratic as they should be and also conservative. If you think about I was in a gallery downtown 100 years ago as compared to what is in a gallery now they have almost no relationship to one another but the novel published yesterday would be recognized by homer. So it's been the saving grace of literature in a lot of ways but it's also run the risk, I think, jane is right that it runs the risk of push together remember every of the culture of making it something, the culture is better when more people are reading. We just want to make sure that those are real reading experiences. 

[00:32:01]


>> I can just say one thing on this, and that you were talk a little bit about enhancements. And I'm talking about actually just a new format of the printed word. And I think that there is a lot of conversation to be had about enhancements. And I think enhancements for fiction will be-- will not be de rigueur and that leads right to tim. 
>> I just want to say it is so important to have historical per speckive. What we consider the book today is a relatively recent historical phenomen. I totally disagree that homer would recognize the book. You know, actually we probably more recognize the eBOOK BECAUSE I ACTUALLY Read aloud, it is just recently I came across the wonderful introduction by freeman dyson to richard fryman's the pleasure of finding things out. And it's so beautiful that i have read it now aloud to four or five people because I have it with me. You know, I have all these books. I go oh, I have to share this with you. So in terms of that social interaction, that availability, there are new possibilities that come out when you have any book-- an eBOOK WITH YOU. I love books. I have probably 10,000 books, you know, physical books. And some of them are incredibly beautiful and i love them and I always want to have those beautiful objects. And I do think that one of THE THINGS THAT eBOOKS ARE Going to do is it is going to force physical books to become beautiful again. I have to say, the modern, you know, book is pretty ugly,articularly the big you know honking hard back. I CAN FIT A BEAUTIFUL 1880s Edition of the millon the floss m pocket, you know, and it's leather bound and gi why then do I get this thing that looks like this and it's purely was an art fact of trying to fill up as much shelf space as possible in the era of book stores. And that is, you know there are so many aberrations in modern publishing that were in this period of reinventing with. What is the book. And that's in everything from nonfiction where you say why would you put dictionary in a book. Why would you put a map in a book. You know, and we may even ask why would you put certain kindsf novels in a book. But there will be things that belong in a book and we'll figure those out. And we'll figure out the new possibilities that are inherent in the new forms and formats that were developed. 

[00:34:17]


>> What do you think we will include in a book. What kinds of things? 
>> Well, certainly there are-- I mean there is that wonderful thing that experience of immersive reading. I don't think that will go away. It is engaging. But it has always been an elitist persuasion. And again, it's not that long-standing. You know, when you think about what was the best selling, you know, book in AMERICA IN THE 1850s, THEY Were in the of longfellow that were red aloud. Most people didn't sit there, you know, and I remember reading this amazing story when samuel johnson was reading, was seen to be reading a book without moving his lips. This is in, you know, in what, 200 years ago t was considered astonishing, this guy is look at a book and he is clearly reading it but he is not moving his lips. So 200 years of what we consider private immersive reading. You know, that's really all we are talking about. 
>> Rose: Kenuletta you write books and your wife represents some of our best authors. Where is publishing going? 
>> Well, I think it's an exciting time but it's also a scary time. Scary time certainly if are you in the publishing business. It may also be a scary time in the author business. 
>> In the traditional publishings business that is very important. 
>> They are in a very scary position, clearly. Book stores are in a scary position. 
>> Did you here tim said the era of book stores which assing that book stores are not longer viable. 
>> But then that raises questions. I mean one of the great things about a book store is you get these serendipitous purchases. People walk in and buy things by surprise. That is one of the things that fuels book publishing and their business. And book covers matter. People, the tactile feel of a book, people picking it up. If you lose that, if you lose book stores you lose that. I also worry and I am an OPTIMIST ABOUT eBOOKS AND About enhanced books. And I understand that change is coming. But the conversation point that jonathan made I think is an important one. And it's also a conversation within yourself. I love the fact that I have books on my shelf. And I will forget about things. And I can wander around and I will say wait a second, isn't there a story in this carroll book that I want to reference in somet I'm writi and I love living in that. And for instance, I read last christmas catherine the GREAT IN eBOOK FORM. And I loved it. It's a wonderful book. And I said I have to go out and buy the book in hard cover because I need it on my shelf. And I had page marked it and I need-- but then I real itzed the pag don't coincide in THE eBOOK AND HARD COVER Book. So I had to spe a goddamn half hour just going through and really it was not an efficient use of my time. 

[00:37:10]


>> But you know there has always been the physical book and if you want that on your shelf you want that on your shelf. And I don't think that will ever go away. For people, perhaps, of our generation. I mean one is not sure where the next generation is going. And not even the next generation but the generation behind that who are really truly digital natives. And who I was telling jonathan before that my granddaughter shows me to use various parts of various devices. And she's three years old. But having a book on your shelf and I too have that 10,000 book library and i love it and I sit it in every day and I read some of them-- some books from my shelves and I read on my various devices. But I don't think that's what we are talking about. I think we're talking about the health of an industry, an industry that has been wedded to one way of doing thingsor a relatively long period of time in an industry. There has been no change. 2 has changed,nd the publishers, the traditional publishes-- publishers to survive are going to have to change along with it. We never address the consumer. This is unheard of in a business that has a and I'm going say a word that i would never say as a literary publisher, a product. But we never address the consumer. We as editors and publishers took books on that we loved including jonathan's book. But the fact is we never knew who the audience was. We are now being told that we have to know who the audience is and e is allowing us to do that in a much more efficient way. 
>> Jonathan, beyond the fact that you talked about how much you loved books and how important they were, does your rational side say i know this is a losing battle? 
>> Books or paper books. 
>> Book, well, books, period, booksment because abook is a book. How would you read it, you could argue and that is what jane has been saying here. But dow sort of say in the end I can see rationally the march of time and I know that my great attraction and love of this thing is going to go down. 

[00:39:28]


>> There are reasons to be optimistic an reasons to be pessimistic. 
>> Why pessimistic. 
>> Because book does something that nothing else can do and it's something that we need. And something that we want so if we lose books what will happen at the same time is we will lose our ambitions, our emotional spectrum will be narrowed. And I think is something happening now and I've been teaching for about seven or eight years. And I feel like I have seen it in the course of seven or eight years with my students. 
>> Rose: Seen what? 
>> Seen an narrowing of a kind of emotional spectrum, a narrowing for expectations for personal experience as o toes-- opposed to overseeing experience or overheard experience. You know, ken said something so smart about browsing. And the internet has hijacked that word, you know, when we talk about browsing we're talking about surfing the web. But it he is a very different kind of brows than browsing one's personal library or a book store because that is the kind of browsing that leads to a kind of further solidification of yourself. You go searching for something and the computer provides you with what you were searching for. Amazon tells you what you like and they are right. They are almost always like but there is something better than that. What is better than that is to find something you didn't know you would like. And it's very scary we could lose that experience. 
>> I love the first part of your comments but I'm very surprised that you find less variety in the recommendations that come to you on the internet. I have to say, I was always a huge fan of used book stores because you actually had real variety. You go into a typical, you know, book store even a superstore, very heavily you know, cure rated by, you know, some buye, you know, on t internet I'm ally finding things that you know somebody else was reading and they are talking about. Or sharing. 
>> I want to move this. Also to the idea of publishing, performing an entrepreneurial function. Meaning authors can write books that may or may not sell, that whole idea of -- 
>> there is no question that if you look at amazon as DEMOCRATIZED BOOKS OR eBOOKS In the company like jane started, dem october advertises books it makes it available, more people to be able to write books. A question becomes what kind of business is it? I mean starting with the author. Will the author be able to make money doing that? They have the freedom to write a book, they can self-publish a book now if they want to do it on their own nickel. But if they want to do it without an advance k they ea money without that advance. And how do you market a book, how do you get people to know about it. With people doing so many different things and surfing so many different ways, and with so much more available to them, so many more platforms how do you discover a book? That's a question. And that was the traditional thing the publishers did and did reasonably well. They have become fat and complacent and, and that say real problem. On the other hand I worry and gi back to the point we were talking about before i worry about the math can. Publishers in a world where increasingly moving rapidly TOWARDS eBOOKS AND THE ECONOMY OF eBOOKS IS MUCH More attractive no paper cost no printing, no contribution cost, no returns. 

[00:42:42]


>> No returns. 
>> Huge advance, so at what point do publishers say hey, I have-- it's crazy to me economically to be publishings and printing booksing printing books, not PUBLISHING eBOOKS THAT IS Such a good point because in most other countries t were no hard bound booksment we did hard cover to help our p & l, our profit and loss statement. I do think that the hard cover book will start to diminish in quantity, yes. I don't believe that the publisher, that a true publisher will ever give up on printing physical books. 
>> I disagree with that. 
>> But, well, but I will talk to you about that. Because I think that there will always be a want and a need for a certain group of society to have the ted book. And perhaps the printed book wilcome even more expensive and more valuable because it will be printed better and it will be done on better paper, et cetera. But I think e point of marketing is where this is all, where this all comes to. And how do you now sell your books market your books in the e form and I think it's a very good strong business model. 
>> Before you answer it, I going to go back to jonathan because he has a service to go pick up his son. So what does it mean for you? What is the hard edge of this for you? 
>> I don't know exactly what it means for me. That is what is scary. I mean it's nice to be-- you know, I have some history of jane and trust her and it's nice to know that people who I think are intelligent and coming from a similar readinposition that I do are at the forefront of these technological advancements. But there is a real extent to which writers are at their mercy. Writers are familiar usly bad at defending themselves and famously bad at being informed about some of these really sweeping movements that are going to perhaps sweep them under the rug. So you know, as I said before there are a lot of reasons to be optimisticment some of them are kind of scary. The best day I ever had as a writer is about six months ago when amazon and itunes both had a sale on one of my novels. 

[00:44:55]


>> A daily deal. 
>> It was a scent. And I had more readers in that day than I had in the previous year or two. On the other hand what happens when books are sent, what happens when there is no floor. What happens when something as such cultural value is devalued commercially. You know, the industry, we're worried about the industry's survival but what you said at the beginning is right which is books are civilization. And I'm much more worried about sglifl civilization's survival than an industry's survival. So maintaining and spreading these all important, I think, habits of these conversation, thee intimate conversations is worries me more than what will happen to my books or to the publishers. 
>> One of the issues with printing is that there really is a step function in the cost of printing. You know. You print smaller quantities. It becomes more expensive. Now it's certainly true that you can go print on demand. For example 80% of my company's books are now print on demand. Even when we are printing 10,000 copies. You know, we're working with ingram and have done a fantastic job of building an infrastructure that let us us do whatever quantity we want. And it's integrated with a digital tool chain that allows us literally to PUBLISH A BOOK TO AN eBOOK Inive or six different formats. Push it out into a digital tool. So digital distribution chain, you know, immediately so we have this new kind of logistics of book publishing which is very powerful, reduced cost. But I still think at some point there really aren't enough distribution points for many types of books for them to remain in print. That's not to say that there won't be some books that are still printed. But I guarantee you that i would guess that 80% of what is now put into, on paper will go away. 
>> Well, I believe that 80% of popular fiction will BECOME eBOOKS ONLY. Because I think that area just popular fiction, genre popular fiction will all go e. And but io think that in literature in particular there will still be a p component but I don't disagree with you that it is switching. 

[00:47:12]


>> I think for a while actually the popular fiction will probably last long never print because there are still more outlets. They are sold in supermarkets. They are sold in aprils. 
>> But they are also downloadable on an airplane. 
>> I understand but yeah-- i do think that the trailing edge is going to be popular fiction from the point of view of market demand. 
>> What is the royalle today within the digital communit about books I mean competition between amazon and apple and everybody else? 
>> And google and barns aibl noble. 
>> Cobo before the apple deal with the book publishers with five of the six big book pblishers amazon had 90% MARKET SHARE OF eBOOKS. And with the publisher said was we have to create this what they called an agency model and the deal with apple, set prices, in order to attack this monday op below that amazon was GAINING OVER eBOOKS. So what happened was that they gave a breathe tore barns and noble and google and obviously the ipad and iphone. And market share of amazon WENT FROM 90% OF eBOOKS TO 60%. Then justice department weighed in and said this is a violation of anti-trust because are you charge consumers a higher price, worried about the consumer? And this is bad and therefore we're suing you6 and forced to settle. And so the question then becomes, will amazon regain market share and approach once again that 90% which qualifies the monopoly. And what consequences does that have if they do achieve that? And that's -- 
>> of course this is nothing that the consumer knows about. I mean the consumer wants to buy books at price that the consumer thinks is the right price. And I know that jonathan said something about devaluing books by having them at a lower price. I think that's a very old argue. I have tw say that where money is at stake it's not the devaluing of the awe nors words, it's hurting the actual profit and loss statement. But I think that what is just most important is for, and having been a traditional publisher for a long time and to you being an e publisher only, I am really seeing that people are picking up the pace of reading and reading more and reading in places that they never read before. And so I am completely optimistic. I also think that we are in a very author-current trick time that we are pro the author, positive t is a positive time for authors to be published because they can publish themselves. Or they can be published by traationol-- traditional or nontraditional fun lishers. 

[00:50:07]


>> What is -- 
>> it is actually confidence with the conversation, it is happening in newspapers as well where they are saying we nnot afford to print wspapers so it may be once or twice a week. Christian science monitor once a week, "detroit news", cleveland plain, but "newsweek" saying we're just going to do it on-line that is happening it in the print world. Not just in newspapers and magazines but obviously books, which is one of the questions why at some point there is at least t estion mark where they will be able to continue publishing bound books. 
>> Well, kind of come back though to socially what role books play. You know, sort of this cultural significance of the quote literary author, it really matters to a relatively small number of people. You know it's an elitist thing. There is popular fiction. There is serious nonfiction. U know, which is really in the same category as serious repoing of all kinds. 
>> You used this phrase elitist twice in this conversation watch. Dow mean by that? 
>> What I mean is the notion by some group that their favorite activity is so important that it needs to be protected. 
>> What if it were defined differently as a group that says this is part of what you talked about earlier, of preserving the culture. 
>> I would say that the culture let me give you an example. Take classical music watch we call cass call music today used to be popular music. Friends list was like the beatles. And now class came music is in this get owe of this very small number of people who are, you know, playing for each other. And saying we should be subsidized becauswe're this important cultural phenomenon. The fact is, you know, the music that will be remembered from our era, you know, and will be the quote classical music of the future is the popular mubsic of today. I actually think that, you know, you know, look at classical-- classic authors. Dickens, people, you know, literally that were riots when the new edition of a book, people trying to get it in far away places, the new-- came out, you know, but i-- since we've had this information I knowyou support things like pbs and npr. 

[00:52:34]


>> Yeah. 
>> And one of the things they do is basically subsidize in part the culture with some government support of saying it's important. 
>> The amount of government support for pbs is relatively small, a huge part of the support comes from people who care about it. It's not actually a subsidized activity so much as it is subject to market forces and there are a set of people who say I want that I like it want to pay for it and I think you see this with new technology platforms like kick starter where people r you know, saying hey, would you like this, would you pay for this and there is this incredible new direct mechanism for authors an other creators to say would you care about what I wanted to do. 
>> I'm so glad that you brought that up. Because I think the elitist element was that books were selected and it was the editor who selected it. And then it was put into certain book stores. Bnd the independent book store which I am a great fan of was a little intimidating for people who didn't know, how to find the book that they want. Then the superstores tried to make that better and the big box merchandisers but books have always been thought of as part of a true literature and fine nonfiction has always been thought of as a very small universal. And what e has done now and I'm so glad you mentioned kick starter which I think is brilliant. Because why shouldn't people pay for a book that they want to be written. And it is a theory that anyone who has grown newspaper publishing thinks is absolutely cookoo, but it's not. Because are you now having the consumer says that's a very good idea. And if a publisher won't give that you $10,000 advance, we are put up $100 and reach that $10,000. 
>> But you can have both. 
>> Yes, you can have both and I believe we're going-- I believe we're going have both. Tim and I disagree with tham. I think there there will always be, always, there will for the forseeable future be printed books. But I think that the move to electronic distribution of information and education and entertainment is going to come from the e space. And I am very, very encouraged. 

[00:54:52]


>> But here t goes back to your question, charlie about "newsweek". And it goesck to the question of newspapers. And it goes to the question of books. You always are going to have an economic issue. And the economic issue is how do you support things that are important.

Or poor parent? And a donation to a starving family has a major string attached. 
>> You have to donate it to% of the money to someone else who is going to do something illegal. 
>> Join and drama, mike, rachel, and our host mark, as they hash it out in our "chat room." 
>> The worst time you were ever stranded, how far did you have to walk? 
>> I was stranded at school. I had to walk all the way home, on a major road. 
>> People use to offer rides. 
>> I saw some guys do that the other day. 
>> Did you think about stopping? 
>> Are you kidding me? This world is nuts. 
>> Let's take a look at way too nuts, as you say. 
>> Did you see ryan checking me out in history? 
>> Do you think he likes you? 
>> What is going on, guys? You remember me. From jesse's party? What is going on? 
>> We are walking home from school. 
>> Do you need a ride? 
>> No, it is fine. 
>> It is two miles. 
>> Can I talk to you? 
>> This is not a good idea. 

[00:02:00]


>> What would your mom think? 
>> Do you want a ride or not? 
>> No thanks, thanks for the offer, though. 
>> What do we think? 
>> Good decision. 
>> Did you catch when she said there is two of us, one of him? 
>> Yes, but you do not know what he is capable of, you do not know where he is going to go. 
>> He could probably take them. 
>> Would you have gone in the car? 
>> No. 
>> A lot of things that happen that we hear about on the news, wrong place, wrong time. If they had intended to will come that day, that is what they should do. A guy offering them a ride was not really part of the plan. 
>> It is not worth the risk. Just calmeone. 
>> Let's say it was you two and a girl named jane. Would it matter if it was same- sex? 
>> Good point. It feels like less of a threat, but people can have things in your car that you do not know about that can get you in 
>> it is not worth the risk. Just call someone. 
>> Let's sayouble. There is a whole other issue than just the driver being someone that can hurt you. 
>> When you have jumped in the car, would you have walked two miles? 

[00:04:01]


>> I probably would have gotten in. 
>> I have taken rides before without thinking about anything they could have in thetrouble. There is a whole other issue than car, anything happening. It was more of a convenience thing. It can be a dangerous thing. 
>> Harold, final thoughts? 
>> You never know what someone is capable of. Think before you get in a cart. 
-- In a car. 
>> You do not know them, you did not know what they are capable of. It is like walking into a stranger's home. I would treat it the same way. 
>> Even if it is completely innocent, it may not be worth the risk. Anything could happen. 
>> Coming up, it is the guys against the girls. Who has the better answers? 

[00:06:37]


>> This is the girl versus the guys. You know the rules. Question no. One. Who was the youngest u.S. President to ever hold office? Mike? 
>> Jfk? 
>> No. Young guest. Let me give you a hint. If we were in the philadelphia area, this is a piece of art named -- 
>> roosevelt. 
>> First name? 
>> Teddy. 
>> Good answer. 
>> Next question. True or false? Identical twins have identical fingerprints. 
>> False. 
>> You are correct. 
>> Question #3. This is a true or false. The third wedding anniversary is traditionally called the leather anniversary. 
>> False? 
>> That is actually true. I know there is gold, silver, but other? 
-- But leather? 
>> Harold, this is a chance for you to redeem yourself. You love history. How long been the 100 years' war actually last? I will give you a hint, it is not 100 years. 80. 

[00:08:42]


>> False. 
>> I am going to go with 116. 116 is the answer. I will show you this at the end, it is 116 years. Was there something fire from history in the back of your head? 
>> I do not think you guys give me enough credit. 
>> True or false, the teddy bear was named after teddy roosevelt after he refused to kill a bear cub while hunting in mississippi? 
>> True. He was on a hunting trip and he refused to kill the bear. 
>> I had heard that answer before. 
>> This will test your skill. Final question. 
>> Nice transition. 
>> Thank you. What was the first man-made invention to crack the souound barrier? Let me help you out. There is a great song from the 1980's -- 
>> crack that whip. 
>> Yes, it was a whip. I am thinking that you guys won this. 
>> Coming up, end world hunger, pocket cash, or $1 million? And mom makes an offer that could change the whole party. 

[00:10:46]


>> Is anyone down for beer? 
>> And a donation to a starving family comes w family comes w 

[00:13:00]


>> I do not know. I said, you do not have one. Ok, fine. 
>> Let's say you had a dog that completely destroyed their moms shoe collection. 2,000 of shoes destroyed. 
>> If I have the money, it would help. 
>> You are a little bit of and enle our by giving them the cash, taking care of it, the versus letting them go through it and learn from it. 
>> Did you say you were going to bring chips? I will bring some drinks. 
>> Who is doing the decorations? 
>> I think it was bridget. Anyone have beer? 
>> We did not think about it. 
>> I can get it for you petered it is not a problem. 
>> Your mom is awesome. She wants to get us beer. 
>> Yeah, is great. 
>> That was really weird. 
>> That was like a mom tried to be cool. 
>> As the ultimate in a moeller, her actions are going to lead to the destructive behavior of those two girls. And did you see her daughter? 
>> Uncomfortable. 
>> Embarrassed. 
>> That is not how a mom or role model acts. 
>> Maybe she did not have enough on in high school. 

[00:15:02]


>> It is like you are try to be back in high school, and you should be helping your kids get through this situation. 
>> She laughed so quick. 
-- Left so quick. 
>> Harold, it if you were the friends in that, and mike was with you, what is your internal reaction to that? 
>> I do not think I would think that would be cool. That is random. What is wrong with your mom? 
>> She needs a beer? 
>> My parents would have been like, you are never going over there again. 
>> If my mom said that she would get a spear and I said no, I do not to a comfortable, she would say okay, but the mother was like, no, it is ok, I will get it for you. 
>> If you are 21, that makes sense. But we are younger. Parents should not influence his bad behavior. 
>> On the flip side, I know that some parents are ok with kids drinking in their house because they are in their house. Maybe she did not want the kids getting in trouble buythe beer, doing this illegally. I could sense that from her eagerness, but just throwing out an idea. Still, it is obviously wrong. 
>> What is your final thought on that? 
>> All I will say is, if that were my parents, we would have some issues. If that was my child, you are not hanging around them. If the parent allows this to go on, what are they doing? It really affects your whole social being, really. 

[00:17:09]


>> I agree. I feel bad for that girl. As a mom, I would never take that stance. How do not think any parent should. 
>> It is going to snowball. Will not stop there. 
>> I like what harold said about it affecting -- other parts will not want their kids over hanging out with your kids anymore. She could have lost a lot of friends at way. 
>> It is going to circulate in our friends, families. Mrs. Jones, she is the one that t the beers. It gets around. I know that my parents would not allow me to go over there, especially for a party. 
>> Then maybe people might look down on the daughter. Coming up, half of your gift for a starving family will go to something illegal. Do you still do it? 

[00:20:19]


>> Let's try this. You have been given $500 to donate to a starving family with four children with the condition that you have to donate 50% of the money to someone else who is going to do something illegal with your donation. Would you still donate the money to the family? No. 
>> Why? 
>> It is going to something illegal. 
>> But this is a starving family. 500 would help. 
>> What are we talking about, shooting someone? 
>> Let's take, off the table. Maybe they are going to steal something or buy something illegally with the money. 
>> No. 
>> I am thinking he is going to steal something that will do something else. Pay it forward. You enable one thing, which turns into another. 
>> Something bad will happen. 
>> Rachel, what would you do? You were listening but also focusing -- 
>> I do not know. I just do not want people to be hung. That is such a lame thing. 
>> I would not do it. It is in labeling. 
-- It is enabling. My answer is no. 
>> Luckily this is a hypothetical situation. 
>> I would just cry. 
>> Let me raise the stakes. You know the family, they are your neighbors. 

[00:22:24]


>> If I know them, I would help them. 
>> They are five doors down. 
>> You are helping someone to do something illegal? 
>> It may end up hurting you. You give them the money. 
>> Ahh! Ok. Can I help them myself? And then no, I would not give them the money, but I would find another way to help them. Ok. We found a way to make it right. 
>> Rachel, you all right? 
>> Coming up, live 10 more years, pocket a cool million, or end world hunger? Strike two

Today's cooking class is going to involve making pasta for cappelletti, becauswe're in Umbria and I wanted the students to get a flavor of regional recipes for this 

[00:02:00]


area. Cappelletti translates to little hats. And you probably have all had them. They're really a holiday pasta.And the reason I wanted to do them here is because we are going to be visiting Gubbio. Gubbio is a very medieval town. And one of the things that Gubbio is noted for at Christmas time are their cappelletti. So I'm going to make the dough so by the time thetudents get here, they can go ahead and form the cappelletti. Now, I made a fontana and I got about four eggs in here. And you can see I just broke my wall. But that's okay because it happens to everybody. I'm going to grab it with my flour and just get a rough mass going. I had four eggs in there and about three cups of unbleached all pur flour. So what I want to do is get just a nice dough going here that I'm going to letrest for about 30 minutes before the students arrive. I think today that we should make cappelletti. Cappelletti in brodo which is usually a holiday first course that you would have at Christmas time or you might have it at New Years. And I'm not going to lie to you, this is a little complicatedto make; but once you get the hang of it, it's very, very easy. So here is a dough that I have made before you arrived. So now this dough has rested for a while. It's ready to go. So let's do I usually do four pieces to make it easy. Keep the other pieces covered. So put these over here tothe side and work with this one piece. So always keep it covered because if you don't, that's going to get kind of a brown cast on it and you don't want that. Make sure that you are not rolling this out wider than this. Okay? Otherwise 

[00:04:00]


you have a problem. So now we have very stretchy dough, very stretchy. So we want to put it in here. Okay. It's still too thick so now you've got to move that number again. So move that notch down. And each time you do, you want to give this a little bit of flour. You notice I hardly have any flour on this board. I don't want to make this too dry. So now, now we are where we want to be, nice and thin. I can see my hand through it but it's not super, super thin. Okay. Now, at this point you hold that side for me, I'm just going to cut this in half. Cut that in half, and les put this down on a towel. Let's put this half right here. Put this right here. Okay. Now we can work with this half. So what we want to do is we want to put a filling on this. And there's several ways to do it. First of all you need to have some forms.And here is a few that you can play with. There is always a glass. And this is what my grandmother used to do. And you can just cut out a circle with a glass. That's one way to do it. You can make big round ones. Okay. There's several ways to do it. Or you could use 

[00:06:00]


a cookie cutter. Everybody has this at home, right? Okay. So you make you do a whole bunch of these. And then once yave them, you can work with your filling. Now, what this is and you can get this recipe online. You have it in your packets. We have chicken, veal and pork. You take just a smidge of that. Now, what I would do is I cut out all the circles first. It's easier. And then put your little drop of meat on your cappelletto dough. And just to make sure that you haven't made a really dry dough, you want to go around the edge just a little bit with water to help you keep that sealed. And then you take this and you fold it over and you pinch it closed. See? like so. And then you bring those two pieces together and you have formed the little hat just on those little angles. And you take one end and you bring it over, pinch it closed, form that little triangle, and then make that hatshape so it has a little point. And people say that<% that is to resemble the type of hat, the pointed hat, that Spanish soldiers used to wear. So everything has a story connected with it. If you want to make huge cappelletti, well, then, you make your little balls just a little larger, put them in the center. Now traditionally this is a pasta that is served in broth, in broth. Usually capon broth. However, times are changing even in Italy, and I have seen these now served just with a simple sauce. So again, close those edges, bring the two ends together, and you have made a big cappelletti. For a first course you want to serve about six to eight 

[00:08:02]


of these in that rich capon broth, usually with a little bit of parmigiano reggiano and a thin slice of lemon. You'll be surprised what that does. Now that you know how to make cappelletti, we need to make a lot more other courses that we're going to serve today. That's only going to be our first course. So we need to get to our stations, right, class? >>(All: Right!) >> Let's go! >> Lois and Jeff are going to be making something called torta al testo. This is a testo. And it gets heated on flame and it gets hot. And they're going to make a dough, a very simple flat bread dough that we're going to bake on the testo that we are going to be serving with a spinach and prosciutto filling. Okay? Go for it. I'll be back to check on you. Take the leaves off, use the biggestcavity part, you know, for stuffing. >> Okay. >> So, and you'll make it look nice. Make it like four inch long pieces. Today we are going to make a very simple antipasto. What that proves is you don't need a lot of ingredients, you just need what? Quality ingredients. Quality ingredients. If you have quality ingredients, it's simple. So we have good mascarpone eese com from Lombardia, and we have >> Gorgonzola >> also coming from that same rekion, you're going to do a mixture, a misto of the two, and we're going to be able to have this with our antipasto. So go to it. This is Nancy and Maria are going to be 

[00:10:03]


making a lentil and sausage dish, because lentils and salsicce, lenticchie e salsicce, are two key products from Umbria. So how could we have dinner without this, right, girls? >> Right. >> All right. So here are our lentils. We've got leeks, we've got pancetta, we've got sausage, combined with some broth. This is going to be absolutely delicious. So I'll come back and check on you later, okay? >> Can we hold that potato together? (Laughter) >> Here, here's a present for you. >> Thank you, very much. Oh, that >> Were you ready? What's porchetta wited potatoes? Well, here's my potato team right here. Rosemary and Charles and Roland are peeling potatoes. And we're going to combine them with some olive oil, rosemary, some coarse salt and pepper. And we're going to put it in the oven and it's going to be fantastic with that porchetta. I promise you. This sounds menial and looks menial but it's going to be essential to the dish. All right, I'll check back on you later, maybe. All right.We aoing to make a fresh fruit tart like we saw in the window in Perugia on the Corso Vannucciat Sandris, right? Typical fresh fruit tart. But we want to use fruits that are in season. And we have them here with us today. We've got peaches and plums, we've got oh, what else do we have?We have strawberries, blueberries, currants. But first we have to make a crust. So we're going to make something called a pasta frolla with butter and eggs and flour, salt, a little sugar. So we got to get our tart shells made first, our pastry shells made first. So let's do that first and then we can work on the filling. Now, because pasta frolla is a shortcut pastry, it calls 

[00:12:03]


for butter. So here we have butter. In Italian that's burro, burro. And you need five tablespoons for this recipe, right? So whenever I'm working with butter in a pastry dough, I freeze the butter. This is going to be so much easier. If you freeze the butter and you freeze you freeze the cheese grater,you'll be very surprised what a nice tender pastry dough you're going to get. So instead of putting the butter in there from the refrigerator and mashing it up with a fork and trying to get it all really uniformly in there, do this instead. This makes much more sense. I thought this up one nightwhen I couldn't go to sleep. So you just grate the butter, try to keep a paper towel around it so your hands don't melt it. Because what you want to achieve here is you want this butter to coat theflouou don't want the butter to melt into the flour. This is a whole lot easier to do than trying to mash, mash, mash this. Because now all you have to do is lightly mix it in. Is this not easy, ladies? >> Y. >> Yes. >> Okay. >> All right. Go for it. We don't want any tough crusts. Okay? (Sizzling) >> And then when you're done, you take this off and then we brown vegetables in the same pot, in thejuice. >> And do you want me to keep breaking 

[00:14:13]


it up as I cook? >> Yeah, yeah, Im trying to break it up. >> This is going to be fantastic. Here we have our salsicce, salsicce e lenticchie two wonderful products from Umbria. You can't come to Umbria and not eat pork sausage. You can't come to Umbria and not have lentils. So the salsicce and lenticchie with the mix of carrots and we've got leeks in here what else a little pancetta that we that you're flavoring this with. This is all goingto get mixed together. You add some broth. It goes as a casserole in the oven. And we're going to have this as a contorno today, just as a side to our porchetta which is already 

[00:16:26]


ou've got it. >> Yeah. >> You've got it. >> Marie, do you want to use this? >> The thing with pastry dough, the magic word is cold. Everything is cold. The board it would be ideal if you could work on marble. But if you work between parchment paper, you don't have to add flour. You might want to add just a little flour on, you know, on the paper, but you really don't have to. And you see what you want to go from the center out. Center out. Center out. And you can see see those flecks of butter in there? Because we grated it instead of mashing it into always go from the center out. And you know what size your pan is, so there's no guessing because you just do this. See? So when you know it's wide enough. Now, this is not going to go up the wholeside of the pan because at home you're doing this in a tart pan. This is a spring form pan. So this is what they have in Italy. That what is we're going to use. When you're in Italia, you do as the Italians. But normally you would do this in a tart pan. I would say a 9 or 10 inch tart pan would work beautiful for this. So once you have an even thickness, you want to make sure that the center is not too thick. You don't want you want to take your time with this because you don't want to go like that. If you find that it's hard to get the paper off, put it back in the refrigerator. Put it back in e refrigetor and let it stay there until you can just shimmy the paper off. Andonce you've got the paper shimmied off, just take it and flip it. Flip it in the pan. Now, at this point, if it is too soft, 

[00:18:27]


leave it. Put it back in the refrigerator. That will make it a whole lot easier to deal with. And then you can just pull the paper gently. And it's very warm in here, so...so get them in the pan and we get them in the oven. Line bake. Line bake means that we're baking off those pastry crusts without anything in them because we're going to be putting in a pastry cream that we've already made from milk and sugar and eggs, a little bit of flour, vanilla, a little lemon, make a pudding. We put it in the refrigerator and we let it get cold. That's going to go on top of the crust. And then on top of that we are going to put a variety of fresh fruits in season. Today we are using grapes and white peaches and plums. Fig season. We have currants, whatever we have. We have blueberries, blackberries. And then that's going to be our desert. I'm exhausted already. Did everyone make cappelletti? Si. All right. Wait. Is that the one that was in? >> Were ready to deglaze the wine. >> Right. This is going to be absolutely delicious. >> Oh, I know it. >> Lentils, white wine, sausage, tomatoes, carrot, a little pancetta. >> Just cook till it's a pudding consistency. And you want it this consistency so it stays where you put it. These two, the last one is too warm but this is fine. That one you can do. This is the last one to do. (Music) >> (All:

That is the most happening event in this town on May 15th. And it looks pretty serene right no If you look around, there aren't too many people around. But on May 15th, you're like a sardine in a can because everybody was here in the center waiting for the race of the three saints. The first you need to know about La Festa dei Ceri is that there's nothing like it in America, and I mean nothing, except maybe New Years Eve in Times Square. But even that doesn't hold a candle to what happens in the medieval town of Gubbio every May 15th. In New York City, Americans celebrate the future. In Gubbio, the Eugubini celebrate the past with a race. Not between people, but between saints. San Ubaldo, Antonio and Giorgio. You don't have to be an Eugubino or even from Umbria to enjoy this special day. But if you are, then ttown acts like a magnet and pulls you back year after year to gather in the Piazza Grande, shoulder to shoulder, elbow to elbow, and sometimes body to body. But all breathing stops when the Piazza dei Consoli doors open and San Ubaldo races out.That's not a wooden 

[00:23:21]


coffin the racers are carrying, it's called un cero, or candle. And it weighsa ousand pounds. And that tiny little statute on top that looks like a friendly Santa clause, that's San Ubaldo himself. Next out races is San Giorgio, then finally San Antonio. Now it's time tobless each saint with holy water. Now, hold onto your hat, here comes the best part. (Cheers and applause) >> Before the race begins, the various teams parade the ceri up and down the narrow streets so that the citizens of Gubbio can pin money to their clothes, touch them with reverence, give them a pat onthe back, and encourage them to do their best. The ceri are so heavy that the teams have to changerunners every few minutes. Once they've finished here, the racers will run up and down the twisting eye of the needle streets of Gubbio, then climb the narrow road leading up Mount Ingino where theywill finally come to a rest at the summit at the church of San Ubaldo, what a privilege for us to be in the midst of this reverent frenzy and to see what La Corsa dei Ceri means to the people of Gubbio. (Cheers and applause.) All too soon the saints will once again be returned to their resting place but the singing and dancing and joy for this day continues long

to rekindle PP your sense of wonder. The Kildare Hotel, Spa and Country Club - an 18th century Irish country estate hotel, nestled in 550 acres of the Kildare countryside, just 30 minutes PP from Dublin City Centre. Sometimes the best thing about going away is feeling like you've never left home. Adare Manor, one of Ireland's evocative castle hotels. Maybe it's time to come home. (Signature tune) (traditional irish music) As you'd expect, Dublin has some kreat food markets and I'm going to be visiting a couple of those in this program. What might come as cosurprise to you is that there are also great artisan producers in Dublin. I am going to be visiting a couple of those later on too. But I'm off to one of the most famous markets in Ireland in the city centre every Saturday morning -Temple Bar Food Market. Gosh, Jenny, your stall 

[00:02:00]


is so impressive d probably the busiest actually at the market. It is busy in the morning because people like to buy their local stuff and because we are a local producer, first thing in the morning PPwe get the stuff that they want and then they can go home PPand enjoy the rest of their day. You say you are a local producer. How local are you? Mile-wise, we are about 20-30 miles from here, about 20 minutes' drive on a bad day. You've got an incredible range; your variety is impressive - the Sarpo potatoes, heirloom tomatoes and your greens! The first thing that hit me and what I was really impressed by was your pricing. There is a big hullabaloo all the time about organic versus non-organic and the price - that it is too expensive to eat organic. How do you keep your prices low? When you are doing a market, you should be competitive. Because you are buying straight from us the grower, we can keep our prices down. We have nobody in between who add on bits here and there. So we keep our prices down and people appreciate it and come to us every week for it. Hey, Ed! How are you doing? How are you? Are you well? Good to see you. I see you've got gin season? Winter has started. You wouldn't PP think it but it has. What have you got for game? At the moment we've just got venison and ducks really. We have had grouse for the last month but they are winding up. Is there a growing demand for game in Ireland? People are getting to think about food, where it's coming from. It's all wild, it's all healthy, it's low in fat and cholesterols and stuff like that. What else have you got? We have our usual pork - pork sausages, meat sausages. Varieties? About 10, 12 types. Some cured meats, smoked meats. It's so unusual - pigs' trotters there. Do people order those? We actually find that we sell a lot of stuff like that mostly now to Eastern Europeans 

[00:04:00]


that come in. They love the stuff that they can't get at home, or that they are used to getting from home, whereas we wouldn't sell as much of it to Irish people now. And they were so big in my parents' time. They were almost like a delicacy, weren't they? It was a question of waste, and not wasting anything. You have got sausages over here cooking as well! Yes, these are a bit of a hit here for the Saturday mornings! I think I will definitely pi up...! This is a real Dublin sausage roll! Absolutely yeah, we try and get all the stuff locally. The bread's from Peter Caviston; bakes that in Glasthule. We use organic leaves that we get from Jenny McNally and we use Janet Drew's Sweet Pepper Relish. I'm going to come back when that's ready. Thanks a million! See you in a minute. Talk to you in a while. My heart begins to race when I see a great chocolate stall. You must be Emily? Yes! That's me! Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you! God, you've got a great selection of chocolates here. It is my dad's pride and joy. Is your dad the chocolatier? He is of course, yeah. He makes everything here himself. Wow! And have you seen people..? Has it become busier and busier? It started off with something like six stalls. Thmarket is what it is now. So it has bloomed over the times. What is your best seller here? Best seller? Um, probably in amongst the dark and it would be the 70% dark. It is a good 70% dark chocolate. It's not bitter, it's not sweet, but it's got a layer of marzipan that smoothens the whole thing out. It's very good. I can see why you're designated to sell at the markets! It is very tantalizing. And where do you make all the chocolates? We're based in Cool Quay, Co. Dublin. We are about 20 minutes off the M50 roundabout - Finglas. 

[00:06:04]


So here I am at the Chez Emily workshop ten miles north of Dublin and I can hear them in the background busily creating the chocolates. (Traditional irish music) I've just come from Temple Bar. Emily is doing a fantastic job! You would be very proud. And these chocolates look fantastic! Tell me about how you started? I was working in a financial PP institution in Belgium and after my hours, working hours, I was helping some chocolatiers in the neighborhood where I was born and where I was brought up. And from there it went like, to say, 'Look, I really like this. I love what I do, but here we are in Belgium.' We've about 10,000 people, small producers like myself. Every village has one. 500 inhabitants, there is a chocolatier there. Rather than being one of 10,000, I prefer to come to Ireland and bring it here, do what I like to do and be one of, at that stage, maybe, of ten. So you came back with your wife Helena? Yes. How was it when you came back to start the chocolates? In '96 we came to Ireland, it was very hard. The first 3-4 months, I was making some samples and Helena went out to places to have them sampled and see if we could make business contacts. We did of course and we went from small..! Well, we went from strength to strength. So, we still have the customers from 10 years ago, we still have nowadays. And then the chocolate, how do you make your chocolate? We buy blocks or little drops of chocolate from the agent, from Callebaut, which is one of the best couverture chocolate in the world. We melt it down at a certain temperature. 

[00:08:04]


Then you have to bring it back which is called "tempering" to a certain temperature and then you can work with it. So, it's done in a mould. Beautiful! It's so shiny! It is, it is, it is. So, the chocolate sticks to the mould and after it has been cooled in the cold room, it comes loose. The crystals shrink and that's what you get in the end - a shiny shell of chocolate. And is that a very good sign of a chocolate, that it is shiny? Yes, it has to be shiny. Let's say there would be white little dots on that. Specks? Tiny speckles, yes. That would mean your chocolate was too warm when you were working with it. Then you fill it, I have about 35 different flavors. Some would be fruit, some would be praline, some caramel. You can then again do your caramel with some nuts inside or with some more chocolate so it's more solid. Different things. That where the imagination starts, you can fill them with whatever. Creams - I use fresh cream butter and fresh cream which would be totally different than people using palm oil or whatever to make their fillings. Are these all your selection, or some of your selection here? That's some of it. Yes, exactly. Can I..? Which one do you think I should taste? Which one? Depending on what you'd like of course, but I would say the white heart is one of MY favorites. The white one is called "Lover's Dream". So, tell me if it would enhance dreams of lovers, you know! Is this dedicated to Helena? Yes, of course. She eats loads of them, you know! The best of luck to you and all the family. I've got some serious business PPto finish off these chocolates! Yes, you still have a bit of PP work to do there! (Traditional irish music) 

[00:10:08]


As I've already said, Dublin has some great food markets, but this one held every Sunday morning in D??n Laoghaire at the People's Park is exceptionally good. And I can't wait to see what's on offer. Buon giorno, signor! Thank you but I'm not Italian! You're not?! I only lived in an Italian neighborhood my whole childhood. Where did the Italian sausages come from? There's a fellow over there, Ed Hick, and he makes them for me. A special formula - we collaborated on it and we came up with these fine Italian sausages. These are emulated from the San Gennaro Festival in New York. They are kind of a coarse ground pork with oregano, basil, fennel and a touch of paprika. And there's no preservatives, no food color, no fillers. So they are a real pure product. I'm sold! How many do you want? Ten? Um, well, I think I can only fit one into my tummy! Shall we put a little mustard and ketchup on it? Everything! All New York style! New York Italian style. When did you move over here? I moved here in 1991. I used to own a restaurant here in Dublin called 'T?? S?? Mahogany Gas Pipes' for many years. I retired from it in 2002 and I went into the market business. Do you prefer the markets? Yeah, it's much less stressful. For you, Madam Ciao! Thank you! As well as Roy's New York-style sausages, D??n Laoghaire Market has the widest range of international foods on offer at any market in Ireland. Today there are Palestinian, Lebanese, Chinese and Indian food stalls and it's one of the reasons it's so popular. 

[00:12:08]


Up to 10,000 people come here each week in the summer. This doesn't come from Ireland! Yes. No! This is an Italian product. E Italiano? Si! Sorry. I don't speak very well..! (They speak in italian) (they introduce each other in italian) (she asks about the products) (he shows her olive oil, salami, cheese, tomato sauce for pasta, and pasta) This is pesto, salami and cow's cheese with truffle. Va bene! He is not from Ireland obviously but he comes from Milan and he has come over here for the last six months because his wife actually lives in Dublin. And his friend actually produces all of this in a farm in Umbria which I am going to taste. This is salsiccia which is a raw type of salami which is usuallout a month old, which is really good. Grazie, ciao! Ciao! About two years ago, I came to the D??n Laoghaire market and I met Lynn who creates these delicious Saucy Sauces is what they are called. At that time, she was only supplying her stall herself and now she is supplying about 20 outlets arouet the country. The best success story at the D??n Laoghaire market! She's got things like Pure Passion which is lemon curd with passion fruit mixed into it using only Irish free range eggs. Also the Yum Plum which is a yummy plum and chocolate sauce. And the Seriously Strawberry strawberry jam. But definitely my favorite is the Luscious Lemon Curd which is exactly what it is! And it can't be missed! 

[00:14:11]


God, your stall PP is the essence of Autumn! Yeah, well, this is the busy time - harvest time. The start of the new season apples. We have grapes as well. And these are Chevaal? 'Cevaal'. What kind of variety is that? It is a Dutch variety bred in Holland but it grows well in Ireland. Ripe in September/October. A lovely sweet apple with a crisp, juicy flavor. A beautiful rosy complexion. No, it is a really tasty apple. God, that's good. Where are you situated? I'm in Lusk in North Co. Dublin. An orchard in Lusk?! Ah yeah, yeah. Used to be a lot of apples growing up in my area. So it's a big farming community up there? It is mostly vegetables and cereals. Potatoes at this stage. There were a lot of orchards in the past and there is not much left but I got my own little plot there! And this is David's little plot, just 14 miles from Dublin where he grows apples and amazingly grapes! Hey David. How are you? I hope I'm not disturbing you. No! I'm in the middle of picking our Schoenberger grapes. I feel like I'm in the midst of Tuscany! When did you start growing these? About 5 years but I started growing grapes 20 years ago. And did you find it hard? Yeah, at the start, I was experimenting - as a hobby. Trying out different varieties, seeing what'd grow in Ireland. And what variety are these? This is a German grape called Schoenberger and it makes a nice wine but it's my favorite grape to eat. It is a beautifully flavored grape. I nicked one from the basket; they're absolutely delicious. So sweet and..! And flavored like Muscat. And so you sell these at the market? Just for peopl eat? The bulk of my grapes I use for wine, but this particular variety is just delicious to sell. These are in season in September early October for a few weeks. I've other varieties that are ripe a little earlier. And then other ones that ripen a little later. And do you have to spray them with anything? No, I don't spray these with anything. I don't need to. Why is that? We don't have vineyards around here that can spread infection 

[00:16:11]


and also because I'd say part of it is in the summer months I protect the vines with a bit of polythene to help them ripen but it also keeps the rain off the foliage. These diseases that go on t leaves is like potato blight, and when the leaves are wet they succumb to the disease. When they are dry they stay nice and healthy. What other varieties do you do? I do about a dozen varieties, but for the wine, mostly cabernet sauvignon and merlot. And I also grow some chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and a few varieties you wouldn't have heard as well. And you grow the apples here as well? I havthe orchard right beside the vineyard. We've picked most of the apples now but there are still some left on the trees if you want a look. I'd love to. Shall we walk over? We have enough in that there. Will you bring them to the yard? Mind your step. There is a broken branch. That's a good complaint! We had a great year this year for apples. Big crop. This is the biggest crop I've had on these trees. How many different varieties do you have? I have a kind of collection here of about 50 different varieties. Sometimes only two or three trees of each as experiments, just to try them out. I have a lot of old apples that aren't grown commercially anymore and I've got some that I brought back from Germany. But mainly what I have here is an apple called Jupiter. It is a cross between Cox's Orange Pippin as the parent so it has a nice really good Cox flavor. And I found it a very good apple to grow without spraying because I don't spray this orchard at all. Are they better flavors for apple juice than for eating? If it is a good apple to eat, nice and juicy, good sweetness and a little bit of acidity as well, basically good flavor - that's going to make a good juice. I make three different varieties: I make a sweet one, a medium sweet and a sharp, just by using different types of apples. I use a very sweet apple like a really ripe John O Gold for the sweet juice and I'd use Bramley for the sharp and then I'd use a mixture for the medium. And apart from the juice, what else do you make? 

[00:18:12]


I make cider; a few different varieties of cider. Then I also make cider vinegar, and I've started making balsamic cider vinegar now as well. And at the marks then we do a hot kind of mulled apple juice at this time of year now in the winter and the autumn with spices and a little dash of apple brandy. Oh lovely and warming! (Chuckles) We entered our Balsamic Vinegar into the Great Taste Awards in the UK this year and we managed to win a gold medal. Fantastic! It was your first entry? First time entering, yeah. Really, with your award-winning Balsamic Vinegar and your wine, you have a mini piece of Italy right here in North Dublin! (Traditional irish music) As well as its food markets and great artisan producers, Dublin is also renowned for its fishing industry. Just a few miles down the coast we have the main fishing village of Howth but I am in the lovely fishing village of Skerries. I'm here today to meet Terry McCoy who has a fish restaurant called the Red Bank Inn. Terry, thank you for inviting me along. The Red Bank is a serious establishment for any food or any fish lover around the untry. When did you start? Well, we started PP about 25 years ago. And there always was a fish PP market report on the radio but there was no dedicated seafood restaurant in Skerries but you would get landed so many boxes of this and so many boxes of that from Skerries and I thought it was a shame there was no restaurant specializing in seafood. And luckily we were able to purchase this old bank that Allied Irish Bank putfor sale. Has there been a huge change in the variety of fish that you have been able to get your hands on? No, not at all because the fishermen in Skerries go fishing for Dublin Bay Prawns - they go out onto the prawn banks. When the trawlers are working their way across these banks 

[00:20:12]


then there is a by-product - all these lovely fish like turbot, brill, sole, monkfish, haddock, cod. They're all coming over the prawn banks hoping to munch up a few prawns and consequently they get caught as a by-product. So we are really, really fortunate. So we've always had those fish available in the Irish Sea. Is it important to you that you use fish that's caught lally? If you think about, as a chef, we want to get as close to the product as we possibly can. I can't get any closer to it than here in Skerries. The fishing boats going out at 4 o'clock in the morning, coming in at 4 o'clock or 6 o'clock ie evening and then off-loading the fish. They come up and we just warm them up and serve them! I'm going to do a dish like that that is very simple foyou. We'll work on some prawns and we're going to chargrill them. So what we do here is we will take them off from the head. Just split them either side like that, okay? I'll follow you! So I am pulling off the head. Yeah and then about the second little gasket here, if you like, just break it to one side very gently. Just squeeze the tail; that'll take out the whole line here. Yes, I know somebody has taught you another way! (Laughs) And I'd really have to have you here in the kitchen for a while! Ta-da!! (LAUGHS) Okay. You can eat it raw? Yes, absolutely! 1, 2, 3! Okay! Hmmm! Nice little crunch to them! Deliciously sweet as well, aren't they?! Yes, like eating marshmallows! Like a marshmallow! A crunchy marshmallow! Crunchy marshmallow! Beautiful! (LAUGHS) So are we going to cook some now? We are going to cook some now but the important thing is they'll cook quickly on the grill but I like to give them a little split down the back. I'll put my knife in and split it down the back like that. Is that to make sure that they get cooked more evenly? More evenly - yes. That the heat is evenly applied. 

[00:22:13]


That's it! I'm all done! And now we'll head over to cook them. Okay. Are you going to cook them on this, on the grill? I'm going to cook them right on the grill here, yes. And we really don't need anything at all. They are just kept very, very simply. So we just place them on here. On their backs. Oops! But you can see them bubbling. Look, you can see it already. Yeah I can! They are actually cooking. Froth that's coming out of them. And the smell! And the smell, you get the aroma. Oh God that's gorgeous! That is a very unique flavor. It is the flavor that we always got when we were making bisques as commis in Switzerland or somewhere. So we are delighted. So I am just going to turn them over a little bit now. This is the best way to eat them, isn't it? I honestly think so and if you just went out to a camp fire he sea sre, you know, and cooked like this, it's what you'd like to do. It's just very, very simple. If you like, a bit primitive. And I think that's the expertise of a chef. When I was younger, I was doing all sorts of convoluted dishes wi prawns, but you don't need to do that. It's from the fisherman to the back door of the kitchen and onto the grill and out to the customers. That's a very honest dish. But you could cook quite a number of shellfish like that. You could cook cockles, mussels. My hands are a little bit asbestos now after a while! I don't notice it anymore. Here we go, the last one on. I guess I'll have to try one. Yeah. Just pull it out, away from its skin. Oooh! (GASPS) If I had you for a while you would toughen up your fingers! They're beautiful! Isn't that just something? That's a different flavor to what you had when they were raw. Completely. Much more intense. Yes. And that has come from the shell itself. I don't think it needs any sauce; it speaks for itself. 

[00:24:17]


And what better way to finish my trip to Dublin than a dish of delicious fresh shellfish in Terry's restaurant. Kerrygold. All natural Irish cheese and butter. Not just from Ireland, of Ireland. Jump into Ireland. From our ancient monuments to our flowing waterways, Ireland offers diverse, iconic experiences to rekindle PP your sense of wonder. The Kildare Hotel, Spa and Country Club - an 18th century Irish country estate hotel, nestled in 550 acres of the Kildare countryside, just 30 minutes PP from Dublin City Centre. Sometimes the best thing about going away is feeling like you've never left home. Adare Manor - one of Ireland's evocative castle hotels. Maybe it's time to come home.

=======================================================

Al push in th battleground states. Today president obama campaigns in ohio, wisconsin, iowa and virginia. Mitt romney stumping in new hampshire, iowa, and colorado. They'reunning mates are also going nostop. Vice president is in colorado and paul ryan is holding rallies in pennsylvania, virginia, florida, and ohio. So ohio indeed could be the biggest battleground of the election. The race there is very tight. A just released cnn/orc poll shows obama ahead by just three points, well within the margin of error. An nbc/"wall street journal" poll shows a wider gap with obama leading by six points. President obama is about to speak at a rally in mentor, ohio. He is ateast in the building, we understand. And so is our white house correspond dan loathian. The president's schedule is packed today. He isn't just campaigning. He is also keeping a close watch on the storm which he says really is his first priority. 
>> Reporter: That's correct. White house officials saying that president did get updates, briefings overnight. This morning he went to fema headquarters in washington to get a briefing in person, to get a sense of what is taking place with regards to the flooding, the power situation. He had some of his top officials in the room with him. He also spoke via video conference with the governors and the impacted states. And again the president trying to stay on top of this situation, balance the storm and response to the storm with his campaign. And the message from the president to his top advisors and top officials is that the government cannot drop the ball. 
>> What I told the governors and mayors is what I've been saying toy team from the start of this event. And that is we don't have any patience for bureaucracy. Weon't have any patience for red tape. And we want to make sure that we are figuring out a way to get to yes as opposed to no when it comes to these problems. 

[00:02:14]


>> Reporter: Now later today top officials from the obama administration will be fanning out across the impacted areas in new jersey and also in new york visiting hospitals, visiting with utilities. The idea here, according to the obama administration, is for these officials to see the progress firsthand and also come back with potential solutions, help the need - help, rather, the things that they need get to the location in a timely manner. 
>> Dan, the president has incredible schedule over the next few days, campaigning in ohio, wisconsin, iowa, and virginia, just to name a few. Why does he and his camp feel it's so important to spend as much time as they can in so many places in such a small amount of time? 
>> Reporter: Because these are the states where the race will be decided. You listed all the important states, florida, colorado, nevada. But here in ohio, this is the biggest, the most important of the battleground states. The president was here yesterday, made three stops making two stops here. We'll return here again. And the message that the president keeps hammering away on here is how he pushed for the auto bailout. Why is that so important? Because so many jobs in ohio are tied to the auto industry. They believe this is a message that resonates with voters here. So we expect for the president to continue pushing that theme as he makes his remarks here in ohio again this morning. We're told there is an overthrow crowd and the president is making some remarks to them. They will be coming out here to speak later on. 
>> All right. Dan, thanks so much. Of course, we'll take that event as soon as the president does finish up with the overflow crowd and then making his way into that arena in mentor, ohio. 
>>> The president's opponent mitt romney is having a very busy final weekend of his own campaigning before the election. He is in new hampshire, iowa and colorado today. Earlier this morning he spoke to a rally in new hampshire, taking a jab at the president. 

[00:04:29]


>> Yesterday the president said something you may have heard by now that I think surprised a lot of people. Speaking to an audience he said voting is the best revenge. He told us supporters,ting for revenge, vote for revenge? Let me tell what you I'd like to tell you. Vote for love of country. 
>> Voting is the best revenge. 
>> Other republican campaign is making a last minute play for pennsylvania. This weekend both mitt romney and paul ryan are campaigning in that state. Ryan is in harrisburg, pennsylvania, today and tomorrow. Romney heading to bucks county. And cnn political editor paul stein houser is live from harrisburg right now. The polls show that romney is narrowing the gap with obama in that state. Can he realistically hope to take the state this late in the game? 
>> Reporter: No doubt about it. 90 minutes from me at the airport you'll have paul ryan, the republican running mate holding a rally. Yeah, tomorrow mitt romney is going to be in suburban philadelphia. That's the swing part of the state, the part of the state that really determines who wins pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes. The obama campaign is not taking this sitting down. Jill biden is coming to pennsylvania to campaign today. And one of the big guns on the obama side, the former president clinton will be campaigning here in pennsylvania on monday. Fred, I got here last night. I turned on the tv watching the local news. A lot of campaign ads. You know what? In the final nine days of this campaign in pennsylvania, $10 million worth of ads. Most of them from the romney campgn and its allies. They're outspending the obama campaign 2 to 1. Fred, nobody, no republican has won pennsylvania since 1988 in a presidential contest. Of course, the romney campaign thinks with the polls tightening up they have a chance. Take a look at this. Ed the polls. A four point advantage in the president. That is within the sampling area. President obama had a bigger lead here in pennsylvania just a few weeks ago. Fred? 

[00:06:44]


>> So, paul, is that feeling that the ads have helped the mitt romney campaign kind of put themselves over the top or at least near the top? 
>> Reporter: This state got no attention in the presidential contest until the last week or two. You know what? The obama campaign says that the romney campaign is doing this out of desperation. This is a last-minute bid to try to win pennsylvania because the obama campaign says the romney campaign is not doing well in ohio, in other states like wisconsin and iowa. Romney campaign says, no, not at all. We're making this last minute pitch because we think we can broaden the map. But you know, four years ago we SAW john McCain and sarah palin come here to pennsylvania the last minute. We have seen other republicans like bob dole in '96 and president obama as well make pitches here in pennsylvania. They were not successful either. Fred? I guess we'll find out on NOVEMBER 6th, RIGHT? 
>> Just three days away. Appreciate it. We'll check back with you throughout the afternoon. 
>>> It has been five days since superstorm sandy and the gas crunch in new jersey is so severe that the governor there is calling for gas rationing. Plus, will polling places in new jersey be up and running in time for the election? We'll see what's being done.To power our lives. While energy development comes with some risk, north america's natural gas producers are committed to safely and responsibly providing generations of cleaner-burning energy for our country, drilling thousands of feet below fresh water sources within self-contained well systems. And,sing state-of-the-art monitoring technologies, rigorous practices help ensure our operations are safe and clean for our communities and the environment. We're america's natural gas. ?????? ??????

[00:10:30]


>>> we're awaiting president obama in a swing state of ohio. Meantime, in another swing state, that of virginia, bill clinton campaigning on behalf of the president. Let's listen in at chesapeake, virginia, at indiana river high school. 
[ Applause ] 
>> I don't know about you but I'd rather you save the gasoline and export the oil if that's what we need to do. And that's why governor romney is having such a hard time breaking through in ohio. So what didhe do? He ran -- he put -- he put a bogus ad on saying that for president had allowed jeep to move jobs to china. Then he said the president had allowed chrysler, which owns jeep, to move jobs to china. Then not satisfied with that, since fiat owns part -- he said -- I can't make this up. He said that the president had allowed the italians to move jobs to china. 
>> All right. You're listening there to bill clinton. He's in indian river high school there in chesapeake, virginia, campaigning on behalf of the president who is campaigning in the swing state of ohio. Of course, if you want to see any more of clinton's speech, go to cnn.Com/live right now. All right. Now to the latest on superstorm sandy. There are reports that at least 22 million gallons of gas are headed to the northeast to relieve in the shortages. Gas rationing got under way in new jersey in 12 counties in an effort to cut down on wait times. People there had been waiting in miles along lines for hours to gas up their cars and get fuel for their generators. 

[00:12:30]


>>> All right. Some voters in new jersey will face a pretty big election day challenge because of superstorm sandy. Five days after the storm polling station managers are working to make sure the voting goes as smoothly as it possibly can. Joining me right now explain what they're doing is dennis kovitz, president of the new jersey association of election officials. Good to see you. 
>> Hi. Thanks for having us here. 
>> Okay. This is a huge undertaking. A colossal challenge. How do you even go about it? It would seem that so many people in new jersey are so inundated with personal problems and worries, the last thing they're thinking about is election day. So how do you make it easy for them since their homesave been destroyed, that means polling stations may have to move or there may not be power to kind of keep those polling stations going. Where do you begin? 
>> We're working on getting as many polling stations open as possible. The others will just have to move them somewhere close to their house. They're even bringing in trucks in southern jersey that they'll be able to vote in trucks so that we can have voting throughout the whole state of new jersey. The election officials throughout the state have been working 24/7 to get as many polling places open as possible. They're bringing in generators and the few that we can't get open, we'll have alternative sites that everybody can vote. 
>> So how do you get the word out? There are a lot of people without power. They're not able to see this conversation right here. They're not able to get on the computers to see where those new polling stations are, what measures have been taken. How do you convey this? 
>> We're trying our best. We're going through the media. We are going to have signs posted at all polling places that aren'tinstructing everybody where to go. Hopefully the word will go out. We're trying to get the word that there is mail imbalance which is a way of voting in new jersey. 
>> Even at this junk tour? 
>> At this juncture, they can walk in saturday, sunday, monday 8. 306789 to 4:30, you can walk into your county clerk's office, get a ballot and vote it. In my home county, my clerk has two offices open, one in westfield and one in elizabeth. Again, all offices will be open from 8:30 to 4:30 saturday, sunday, monday. They can go right in and vote. 

[00:14:55]


>> All right. Not to throw too much out at you, clearly this is part of -- this is probably part of your conversations. But people who can't get around. They don't have cars. They've been flooded out. They don't have transportation. How do they get to these locations? What kind of measures have been put into place to help them? 
>> We have no measures to get the voters to there. We're telling them get to the closest polling place. We have paper ballots at all of the voting places. 
>> I'm rry, you have no measures to get them there? 
>> Not to get the voters there, no. We're opening up as many as possible so it should be close to where they are. And, again, people can go into the polling place and vote on a provisional ballot. If there name is not in the book in the state of new jersey, we have plenty of paper ballots. They can vote on a provisional ballot at the other polling locations as long as it's within your county. 
>> In the end, how concerned are you that what may have been a robust voter turnout in many of these precincts will be greatly impacted by sandy and few people will come? Is that your greatest concern? 
>> That is our greatest concern. Because not only is this a presidential election, there is a lot of local elections. We have plenty of mayors, council races. D new jersey this is the first time for many districts we moved the school board election to the november election instead of holding their own. And they're usually won by a small amount of votes. It's certainly going to make a difference in this election. 
>> Dennis kovitz, thanks so much. And, of course, one of the guys who is hoping that people will turn out in a big way at those polling stations. Those measures, take advantage of those. President obama right now speaking in mentor, ohio. Let's listen in. 
>> -- How proud I am of erin and her sisters and their whole family. Give them a big round of applause. 
[ Applause ] there they are right there! Erin was pretty excited about meeting me. She saw justin bieber the other day. So I'm like the second most exciting person she's met. The in the last few days. No. My understanding also is that this man right here ju-- this band just won the state chonship. Best band in the house in ohio! In the house! Congratulations! And the football team is in its first play-off ga tonight. So the cardinals have a lot going on right now. Despite all that, the fact you still came out I'm grateful for. So thank you. For the past several days, all of us have been focused on one of the worst hurricanes in our lifetimes. And each day I've been getting on calls with mayors and governs, county officials just trying to make sure that people are getting able to help. I tell them the entire country is behind them. We mourn those who were lost. You know, we will walk with the people whose lives have been upended by the storm every step of the way in this long, hard road for recovery. I hope everybody is out there. I hope everybody understands this will be not just a couple weeks but it's going to be months of recovery for a lot of these families. Please do so for the first responders who are here today, it's a reminder of how important you are. When you see our firefighters, police officers, ems folks out there ery single day working, you know, it -- it's amazing. And so despite this tragedy, we've also been inspired by what we've seen over the last several days, over the last week. You know, you see heroes running in buildings. Wading in water, you know, to help their fellow citizens. Neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy. Leaders of different political parties working together to fix what's broken. Now, it's a spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is, no matter how tough times are, we're all in this together. We rise or fall as one nation and as one people. And that spirit has guided this country along its improbable journey for more than two centuries. It's carried us through the trials and tribulations of the last four years. Remember, in 2008, we were in the middle of two ws and the worst economic crisis since the great depression. Today, our businesses created 5.5 million new jobs. 

[00:20:23]


[ Applause ] 
>> all right. President obama there mentor, ohio, reminding people that his first priority even though he's on the campaign trail in this last weekend blitz for votes three days before election, his top priority is the recovery post superstorm sandy. 
>>> Hundreds of federal relections observers will be headed out to the polls on tuesday. Find out why after the break. Up. A short word that's a tall order. Up your game. Up the ante. And if you stumble, you get back up. Up isn't easy, and we ought to know. We're in the business of up. Everyday Delta flies a quarter of million people while investing billions improving everything from booking to baggage claim. We're raising the bar on flying and tomorrow we will up it yet again. ] year. In that time there've been some good days. And some difficult ones. But, through it all, we've persevered, supporting some of the biggest ideas in modern history. So why should our anniversary matter to you? Because for 200 years, we've been helping ideas move from ambition to achievement. And the next great idea could be yours. ?????? ?????? built people. The economy needs manufacturing. Machines, tools, people making stuff. Companies have to invest in making things. Infrastructure, construction, production. We need it now more than ever. Chevron's putting more than $8 billion dollars back in the u.S. Economy this year. In pipes, cement, steel, jobs, energy. We need to get the wheels turning. I'm p. Making real things... For real. ...That make a real difference. ?????? ?????? 

[00:23:47]


>>> the u.S. Justice department announced it's senng hundreds of federal observers to monitor polling places. Cnn's joe johns joins me from washington. Joe, why are they doing this? How unusual is this? 
>> Reporter: It's not that unusual. Four years ago they sent roughly the same number out to watch the election in 2008. The bottom line here is they are sendsing quite a number of people, something like 780 federal observers. They'll be going to something like 23 different states, about six or seven battleground states among them. 51 separate jurisdictions within the states, fred. And which states are we talking about? Going to be hitting the battleground states very hard, the state that gets the most federal observers of all will be the state of florida followed by pennsylvania. After that, ohioxas and so many others across the united states. You see them right there. Interestingly, they pick some of the states out because those states come under what is called the votinghts act of 1965. And that is a law passed by congress to sort of watch out for minority rights in certain states. That parentally has at least part of the mission here, fred. 
>> All right. Joe johns, thanks so much. We'll check back with you later on as the day develops. Thanks so much. 
>>> Meantime, let's talk about the new york area. Staten island in particular. One of the hardest hit areas after superstorm sandy. We'll meet a family whose home was destroyed but that apatient 
-- apparently is just the beginning of their loss. When you take a closer look... ...at the best schools in the world... ...you see they all have something very interesting in common. They have teachers... ...with a deeper knowledge of their subjects. As a result, their students achieve at a higher level. Let's develop more stars in education. Let's invest in our teachers... ...so they can inspire our students. Let's solve this.

>>> superstorm sandy dealt a devastating blow to staten island, new york, and after the storm, residents complained relief was slow in coming. Now one family who returned home to assess the damage suffered an even bigger unspeakable loss. Brian todd reports from staten island. 
>> Reporter: If you can't imagine what it's like to suffer through a massive storm, listen to nick camaratta. 
>> The water was up to this part of the door. I couldn't get into the door. I went around the side of the house and I stood on a box that was floating and I went through the window to get back in the house with my family. 
>> Reporter: Taking us through his house on staten island, the retired u.P.S. Truck driver said they scrambled to an upper floor, away from a floor where water would keep rising. And his wife and four sons survived. Just about all of their first floor didn't. Then just as nick and his family were recovering from the shell shock of the storm and the flooding trying to assess all of this damage, h took another body blow. He leads us to the side yard where he setup a small engine repair business and a trailer full of tools he'd need for his new profession. 
>> Last night they were banging on doors. Anybody home? If you're not home -- if we don't get a response from you, we're going to break your door down just to see if you're okay. They were all looters. I yelled out my window on a few occasions until I was exhausted tired. I wake up this morning and they pushed the shed open and went through all my tools. I have nothing. Every tool that was hanging, that was worth anything, all my air tools. There is nothing in the drawers but hand prints. 
>> Reporter: Could these have been people you knew, nick? 
>> It's sad to say the neighborhood guys. 
>> Reporter: You knew them? 
>> Yeah. I knew one of them. 
>> Reporter: He owns a house next door that was ruined by the flood. The tenant says she lost another home to a fire two years ago. 

[00:30:55]


>> I can't even explain what did I do that the same thing happen to me twice? I just feel like why me? 
>> Rorter: A tenant, an owner, his family left with so very little except -- my kids are alive, my wife is alive. We could move on. 
>> Reporter: Nick says he came up with a slogan for the new business, when your engine is sick, call dr. Nick. He said he's not dr. Nick anymore, at least not for now. He'll try to find work as a handyman. Ian todd, cnn, staten island, new york. 
>>> Something else that became almost a symbol of this hurricane sandy early on, remember this crane that was just bent as though it were just two thick or just nothing? This high-rise being built off central park, that boom of that crane has been kind of dangling precariously for many days now, at least five days now. And now we get confirmation from the new york city buildings department they began operations to secure that crane this morning. Workers are in the process of securing that boom which did collapse monday night. Some say it was 40 mile-per-hour wind gusts. Others say even higher than that. But that entire seven block area around 157 had been closed off because, of course, there is great concern whether anybody walking by the bujlding or driving past the building might be in harm's way. So, again, there are efforts under way right now to try to secure that boom of that bent up crane there 157 in manhattan. 
>>> Straight ahead, we'll talk to a staten island borough official about the recovery efforts and why some residents say they are the storm's forgotten victims. In that time there've been some good days. And some difficult ones. But, through it all, we've persevered, supporting some of the biggest ideas in modern history. So why should our anniversary matter to you? Because for 200 years, we've been helping ideas move from ambition to achievement. And the next great idea could be yours. ?????? ?????? snapshot progressive, bubut don't just listen to me. Listen to these happy progressive customers.

>>> Sandy's wrath caused more loss of life in new york than anywhere in the u.S. Residents wondered loudly why relief efforts have been so slow. They've called themselves the forgotten victims. Joining me now on the phone is staten island assemblyman michael kusich. What is the latest on the relief efforts? Why is it that people are feeling forgotten? Are they feeling they're no longer being ignored? 
>> Well, since thursday, things have really turned around. Things really turned around today since thursday. We have gotten the attention that we truly deserve out here. But staten island is always at a disadvantage even before the hurricane being the smallest of the five boroughs. We seem to be forgotten in most cases. But I think the fact was that the storm hit varied neighborhoods throughout the city. People were focused all around. And they did not really focus on staten island until, quite frankly, on thursday when we had a visit from senators schumer and gillibrand and our borough president made a plea to folks to come and help when there are 20 or so cameras that showed up on our island. Since that day, since thursday, we've been inundated with fema, the red cross is here in full force. We have the national guard. And I'm driving around now to one of the command centers at miller field. I'm seeing volunteers from all over the city and state just wanting to help. So in the last 24 hours, 48 hours, things have turned. And we're moving in the right direction. 
>> I understand that many of those volunteers that have kind of descended upon staten island were runners who were going to be part of the new york city marathon but since so many traveled from far and wide, they're there and they said, you know what? We want to pitch in in any way, shape or form. What do you suppose a lot of the volunteers are going to be able to do? What are they going to be equipped to do? 

[00:38:06]


>> We're asking volunteers to go right now to miller field. It is in the new york section of staten island. It is basically in between the midland beach area hit very hard and the new york beach area that was hit hard. It is a federal property that has a staging area for red cross, the national guard and oem and the city of new york. So that's where we're asking people if they want to volunteer, they can head to miller field on staten island. 
>> What about sanitation? Is that a huge concern for you? I understand garbage and debris is everywhere. There are other health issues that may crop up because of standing water. We're looking at image that's demonstrate that now. 
>> Sanitation is one of the issues that we're facing now that the storm is a few days past. Our new york city sanitation department is doing a fantastic job clearing streets and neighborhoods. Again, it's something that none of us have seen before. So they are working overtime and working their hardest. So we're getting -- we're getting private contractors to -- they're volunteering to help us. The issue is the garbage that people have at their houses, not so much the debris that we're trying to work with because that -- the concern is that it may become a health hazard. And we are working with the city. We did have a meeting with the city this morning to address that issue. 
>> Okay. Before I let you go, in about 15 seconds or so that we have left, now what about voting? I realize that's a low priority for an awful lot of people in staten island who are just in undated with the devastation here. Are there measures that have been put in place so that there are polling station that's are accessible for people to vote come tuesday? 

[00:40:08]


>> The election day is three days away. The board of elections is state of new york and the local boards have been working very hard to make sure that election day, election day happens. There have been contingency plans put into place. I have been on the phone with the board of elections and our folks up in albany about tuesday. 
>> So polling stations on staten island? 
>> Yes, on staten island and also in the city of new york. There were sections of the city that are affected. And they're coming up with a plan. If there are areas that we can use, we're figuring out where we can put polling sites. But that has been worked on even before the storm hit because our board of elections wanted to be prepared. 
>> All right. Michael kusich, you have your handsful there. Thank you for joining us. Staten island assemblyman. All the best. 
>> Thank you.

>>> Houston, waikiki, san francisco and washington, d.C., they all sound like great vacation destinations, right? And all of these places have received the presidential treatment. That's because former u.S. Presidents have stayed in hotels in all of those cities. Can you, too. Earlier I spoke with kate maxwell, the editor in chief of "jet setter." We started with the hotel in the epicenter of all things political, the madison in washington, d.C. 
>> The madison is named for james madison, the fourth president of the united states. It hosted presidents, bush stayed there, george bush when in transition to the white house. So, you know, it's got lots and lots of history going o there. It's also prime position in d.C. It's only five blocks from the white house. Jfk attended the opening in 1963.

>> And what's the price point? 
>> That's $279 a night. 
>> Let's go to houston, texas, a hotel called the huse tonian. And I'm sure this is a favorite of the bush family as if they needed a place to stay in texas. 
>> Of course, it is. It's a bush home from home, if you like. It's like a country club in the city of you might bump into george bush sr. At the manner restaurant or barbara bush in the spa. There is also an enormous activity center, 25,000 square foot. They have a rock climbing wall. They have lots of personal trainers. It's a really, really fun place to hang out. And that costs from $179. It is also very near the city's great art district and lots of great shopping.

Of every minute. Both are crisscrossing the country and hitting the crucial battleground states one lst time. The president's first stop today was a rally ino where he told a cheering crowd that his economic ideas are working. He's also stumping in wisconsin, iowa, and virginia. All today. And as we mentioned, wisconsin is one of those critical swing states the candidates are concentrating on. And campaign workers on both sides are out knocking on doors, trying to get people to the polls. White house correspondent brianna keilar joining us live from milwaukee, wisconsin. It will be a while before the president speaks there, but you got a crowd and lots of music, nonetheless. 
>> That's right. And this crowd is eagerly awaiting not only the president but katy perry who will be performing a smallncert before president obama. Here in wisconsin it's all about for the obama campaign getting people out to vote now on election day. Early voting wrapped up in this state yesterday, but here, voters can also register as well as vote on the same day. Back in 2008, more than 1 in 10 voters in the badger state did that. That's what the obama campaign is focusing on. When the president talks in the 4:00 p.M. Eastern hour, he's going to be trying to counter as he did in ohio, mitt romney's message about being the candidate of real change. He's been saying to his supporters that mitt romney is not about change, and also he's been trying to urge them to be patient, saying that the economic recovery is on the right track. 
>> After four years as president, you know me. You may not agree with everything decision I have made, you may at times have been frustrated by the pace of change, but you know what i believe. You know where I stand. 
>> The insin uation there very clear, the president saying mitt romney is the unknown. Now, here in wisconsin when you look at the polls, president obama has been trending ahead by a few points when you look at a number of polls. That's not a comfortable lead for the obama campaign. But it is a significant one. It is a consistent one. And they're trying to maintain that as they move tds election day. And they try to keep wisconsin as well as the other midwestern firewall states, ohio and iowa, in the column, fred. 

[00:02:23]


>> And all this while the president says the recovery from the storm is still first priority. How is he trying to stay ahead of that, at the same time campaign to keep his job? 
>> That's right. It's a tricky line to walk because here he is three days out from election day. He has to be campaigning obviously, and that's the sense the obama campaign has, but he has to be careful, especially as some more bad weather heads to that very vulnerable region. The difference today not only is president obama staying in close contact with his advisers, with cabinet secretaries and with local officials in these storm effected areas, but he actually has members of his cabinet blanketing the effected regions, his secretaries of health and human services, of homeland security, of housing. They're out in new jersey, new york, connecticut as well as some of his top advisers. So sort of serving in his place because he can't be there. And the campaign being very careful to point that out, that he's certainly managing his obligations as president while he's also campaigning here on the trail, fred. 
>> All right, thank you so much from milwaukee, wisconsin. And jim acosta is with the romney campaign, which is getting ready for a rally in dubuque, iowa, after a morning stop in new hampshire. We'll have a report from jim in just a few minutes. 
>>> Now let's get the latest on recovery. Five days after superstorm sandy, new york governor andrew cuomo said temporary fuel trucks will be deployed around the new york city area to alleviate the gas shortages. Drivers will be able to fill up directly from the tankers. New yorkers can also get around the city a little easier now as well. 80% of the subway service has been restored. That is under literally, under one week, 80% of the subway service has been restored from what was horrendous damage. 
>> Across the river in new jersey, there is gas rationing in 12 counties in an effort to cut don on wait times there. People have been waiting there in long lines for hours to gas up cars and get fuel for their generators. 

[00:04:32]


>> Our jim clancy is in long beach, new jersey, which is on th jersey shore. It's very windy, and that cold front that is apparently going to m this weekend, jim, give me an idea of what's happening there in terms of people trying to recover, pick up the pieces, move on, what? 
>> There's a major push going on long beach island today. They have brought in scores of heavy pieces of heavy equipment, utility trucks that are trying to repair some of the electrical lines, the overheadlines. This is long beach boulevard. This is where all of the major traffic fls, all of the power lines flow. As you can see, there goes a major flatbed truck, probably to take in or out some of the heavy earth moving equipment. This is one of the check points they have set up here, fredricka. A check point to insure that no one can get on this island. No one can pass into these areas that isn't authorized to do it. That's created a lot of, well, resentment, let's be honest, about people not on the island who have properties here. They want desperately to get out and see what is going on with their properties. To repair them, if it's at all possible. They're not going to be able to do that. Meantime, according to mayor joseph mencini who told me there may be as many as 1,000 people who have refused to leave the island. They sat out the stoand they say they're not going away. We wondered why. We talked to one, james. Listen to how he describes his reasoning. 
>> I can't leave, go there, go to work, and then come back. I have to stay here. If I leave, I don't knowhen I'll get back on the island and I have to protect the property, and I'm protecting the property of several of my neighbors by opening the windows and letting it ventilate. 
>> Now, it's going to be tough because, you know, he admits he has water, but he doesn't he electricity, doesn't have gas. There's no hot water. It's tough for the people trying to stick it out here. It all depends on when the other people are going to be able to return, when the infrastructures are going to be restored. According to the people trying to oversee this whole process, including the army anr national guard, it's going to take some time. It's absolutely going to take some time. And they don't want to let people back on the island because they want to be able to move the heavy equipment in without being impeded by the presence of what would be certainly thousands upon thousands of people in their vehicles. Fredricka. 

[00:07:07]


>> Big job, lots of misery. Thanks so much, jim clancy in long beach,ew jersey. 
>>> And just across the river, this is what happens when power is restored. 
>> That was in new york city's east village yesterday. Power back on in about 67,000 homes. About 70% of those in the city who lost power in the st now have it back on. 
>>> Oformer top economic adviser to president barack obama breaks down the jobs report and tells us whether he thinks it will impact the election. 
>>> Plus, it's in five days since the superstorm named sandy, but will the states impacted have polling places ready. The election is thrs away. We'll see what's being done.

[00:10:20]


>>> The october jobs report has been used as ammunition by the romney and obama campaigns. Republicans are emphasizing the increase in the unemployment rate from 7.9% to 7.8%. Supporters of the president point out 171,000 jobs were created during the month, more than economists projected. I had a chance to talk about the impact of the numbers with the former chairman of the president's council of economic advisers. He's now a professor of economics at chicago's booth school of business. I asked him if he agreed with mitt romney's assessment that the, quote, increase in the unemployment rate is a sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill. 
>> I don't think so. The last month, the unemployment rate came down three ticks. And the romney campaign complained that we hadn't created more jobs. This month, the number of jobs created was 30%, 40% higher than expected and was fairly strong. And then they criticize that the unemployment rate ticked up one tenth. It's the last number before the election, so I think both sides are going to see, try to go through and interpret what it means. I think overall, most economists view it as a fairly solid report. And until we get the growth rate of the economy up faster than 2%, 2.5%, th is probably about what we should expect from a solid report. 
>> How does one explain the kind of inconsistency? 7.9%. That's up, with unemployment. Then you talk about adding 171,000 jobs in october. 
>> Yeah, a great question. A lot of people misunderstood how the jobs work. There's two surveys. The jobs come from a survey of businesses. The unemployt rate comes from a survey of people. Each month, there's a lot of variability in both of those. All economists say don't look at any one month. Take an average of the last several months to get an idea of the trend that is far more accurate. Essentially what happened this month is we got a strong number coming from the businesses. You had a small tick up in the share of people participating in the labor force, so some of the people who had dropped out and don't count as unemployed came back in looking for jobs as consumer confidence rose and they thought the economy was getting better. 

[00:12:59]


>> Where are these jobs, the jobs that are being created or made available? What sectors? 
>> You saw pretty solid job growth in all sectors of the economy except for government employment. Government employment again fell pretty significantly, but across services, even manufacturing has been having some pretty good job growth. And retail trade, so it was kind of across the board for this month. Overall, what you have seen is the health sector, if you say over the last two years, where have the jobs been growing? They haven't been really in anything touching on the housing market. So real estate, construction, those things haven't done well. But a lot of services, a lot of export related, and a lot of manufacturing have been kind of the sectors leading it. 
>> So the president is promising in the next four years if elected he will create jobs in the millions. Mitt romney is promising if elected he'll create 12 million jobs. But at the same time, romney underscoring government isn't the one that creates jobs. How does either one deliver on the promise of creating millions of jobs? 
>> Well, you know, the first thing to note is when an economy is growing, even at a me pace, it's going to generate a lot of jobs. I think if you look at the last two, two and a half years in the u.S. Economy, we have added more than 5 million jobs in the private sector. So it's been growing at around 2 million a year. Under the romney call, what he's calling for to get 12 million, that would have to go up to 3 million a year from 2 million. A lot of people think that regardless of what happens in washington, you would probably see something along the lines of those, ofthose kind of rates because the economy will move its way back to the trend growth of 3%, 3.5%. I think one, you have to hope that the macroeconomy goes with you. Two, I think the policy can make a difference on the margin. And there's a difference of opinion between the two camps, romney's view that high income tax cuts and deregulation lead to growth. The obama view that it's investments in infrastructure, the work force, things of that nature that will lead to faster growth. And you know, you have to pick one or the other. 

[00:15:27]


>> And then ques or no, will voters take these numbers, these jobs numbers just days fore election day, into the voting booth with them? 
>> Probably not. I mean, certainly not the people whose power is out and they're dealing with the hurricane damage and stuff like that. But evidence is pretty that people get a general impression of the economy as opposed to looking and sayingering well, this was 171,000 and it was expected to be 125,000 so therefore I'm going to be really happy. 
>> That was the former chairman of the president's council of economic advisers. Jim acosta is traveling with the romney campaign for a rally in dubuque, iowa, after a morning stop in new hampshire. He filed thiport just a few minutes ago. 
>> Mitt romney is in the middle of a battleground blitz you might say in the last weekend before election day. He's been barnstorming from one state to the next. Starting in new hampshir he's here in iowa, then to colorado, then comes back to iowa this evening. Underscoring how important this battleground state is to incampaign math. He's been detailing his five-point economic plan, talking about how he wants to reduce the deficit, eliminate the president's health care law if he's elected president of the united states, and he's also going at what he believes to be a problem for the president in the final days of the campaign. He's been saying that the president has not been living up to his promises of bipartisanship in washington, and romney says if he's elected president, he will bring the country together. Here's what he had to say. 
>> He said he was going to be a post partisan president. He has been most partisan in dividing and attacking. He also said he would cut the deficit in half. He doubled it. He was going to get unemployment down to 5.2% right now. We just learned on friday it's up to 7.9%. 
>> Earlier in the day, the candidate's wife, ann romney, visited the back of the campaign plane and handed out breakfast food to the reporters covering the race for the last year and a half. Asked how she's feeling about the race, she said she's been touched by the people she's run across in the final weeks of the campaign. People have come up to her and told her about their struggles in this economy right now. As for this campaign, the way this is going to wrap up this weekend is that mitt romney is going to be heading off to ohio on sunday, and also pennsylvania, a battleground state, they believe they're now putting into play, and by the looks of it, it's getting more and more competitive as we head towards election day. Jim acosta, cnn, dubuque, iowa. 

[00:18:04]


>> Thanks so much, jim. Not just the white house. Democrats and republicans are waging a fierce fight for control of the u.S. House. Hear why one party has the upper hand. ?????? ?????? ?????? Hi dad. Many years from now, when the Subaru is theirs... Hey. You missed a spot. ...I'll look back on this day and laugh. Love. It's what makes a Subaru, a Subaru. 
DAD VO: Ok, time for bed, kiddo. Lights out. ???????????? 
(Sirens) 
(Train Horn) ???????????? 
VO: Wherever our trains go, the economy comes to life. Norfolk Southern. One line, infinite possibilities. 

[00:21:08]


>>> New polls out of some key battleground states. In ohio, a just released cnn/orc poll shows president obama ahead of mitt romney by just three points, well within the margin of error. An nbc/wall street journal/maris poll shows obama leading by six points. It'slso close in florida. In this poll, obama has a two-point edge. That's within the sampling error. But a mason dixon poll shows obama trailing romney by six percentage points, so a mixed picture there from two different polls in such a key state. 
>> Democrats are hoping, they're only three days away from taking back control of the u.S. House, but as athena jones reports, they face an uphill battle. 
>> Republicans won control of the house in 2010. Riding a wave of victory by tea party-backed candidates carrying a message of fiscal conservatism and strong opposition to obama care. So what's going to happen this time around? 
>> It's all got to go! 
>> Back in september, nancy pelosi had high hopes for her party's prospects. 
>> We have a very excellent chance to take back the house. 
>> So did republican house speaker john boehner. 
>> I continue to feel confident about house republicans' chances of holding on to our majority. 
>> Republicans have 242 seats to the democrats' 193. So democrats need a net gain of 25 seats to win the majority. Analysts say that's not likely to happen. 
>> The republicans will control the house again after november, so they'll probably suf very minimal losses if they suffer losses at all. 
>> For republicans, obama care is still front and center. Along with the economy. Democrats have tried to link republicans to paul ryan's plans to turn medicare into a voucher program, something democrats say would be disastrous for seniors. Republicans believe they have neutralized that message by arguing obama care hurts seniors by slashing medicare. Redistricting will have a big impact, helping republicans. 

[00:23:18]


>> For the most part, republicans because they made such overwhelming gains not only in congress but in state legislatures last year, they were able to control the redistricting process in a lot of key states. For example, north carolina, where democrats will probably lose a couple seats this cycle. 
>> Gop gains look likely in districts from north carolina to arkansas, among others. In fact, party operatives say they even put traditional blue states like rhode island and massachusetts into play. Democrats are trying hard to unseat gop incumbents in blue states like california, new york, and illinois. And could see gains in maryland and florida. So why do these house races matter? Members of congress will have to make big decisions in the coming month. Chief among them, reaching a deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, a series of tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect next year. 
>> The decisions confronting congress over the next four months are bigger than I think most of us have seen in our lifetime, at least on the fiscal matter. 
>> It's not just the fiscal cliff. 
>> Most people think we need fundamental tax reform, cuts in spending and entitlement reform. There's no indication the new congress will be willing to do that either short-term in the lame duck or longer term. 
>> So the forecast for the next congress, more of the same. Athena jones, cnn, washington. 
>> And we have more on the race to the white house. First lady michelle obama is expected to speak any minute now in southern ohio. You're looking at live pictures right now. Looks like a gymnasium of the university auditorium there. We'll take you there as soon as michelle obama enters. ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ??????

[ Male Announcer ] DON'T JUST REJECT CONVENTION. Drown it out. Introducing the all-new 2013 lexus ls f sport. An entirely new pursuit. 
>>> It is indeed crunch time for the presidential candidates. Election day is just three days uz way, and both campaigns are making a final push in the battleground states. Mitt romney wrapped up a rally in dubuque, iowa. Earlier, he was in new hampshire and later he makes two stops in colorado. President obama was in ohio, then he's in wisconsin and iowa and he ends the dan virginia. Now to the latest on the aftermath of superstorm sandy. Gas is now being rationed in 12 counties in new jersey in an effort to cut down on wait times. People there have been waiting in very long lines for miles and for hours to gas up their cars and get fuel for generators. 
>> I was in line at three gas stations. They all closed down while I was getting close. 
>> This is your fourth try? 
>> The federal emergency management agency has been coordinated with states to accelerate the distribution of fuel to retail locations. 
>> So despite the long lines at gas stations, sandy is expected to lower gas prices for election day. Aaa reports the national price for a gallon of gas fell 1.3 cents to $3.48. They say durin the stretch of declines, the average s dropped nearly 33 cents. 

[00:29:22]


>> A california family won't have to worry about the price of gas anymore. Lottery officials have found the winner of a $23 million super lotto plus ticket just days before the ticket expired. The winner came forward after her daughter realized she had bought the ticket and given it to her mom. Officials had launched a media campaign to try to find her. 
>> She called me at 11:00 at night, woke me up and said this is you, you have to see it. I said no, no, I'll see it in the morning. I went to sleep. I woke up and I had all these missed cal andtexts. I was like, wait a nute, maybe I shoulee what this is. As soon as I pulled it up, I was like, oh, m god, that is me. I was like -- 
>> oh, my. The lucky winner says she is going to use the money to help family members including two special needs children that she adopted. 
>> I want to take you straight to oxford, ohio, now where first lady michelle obama is there stumping for her husband, th president. She's at the miami university. Let's listen in. 
>> How focused we are. How heartbroken barack and I are because of those who have suffered through hurricane sandy. Barack has been working tirelessly with our governors and our mayors and our extraordinary first responders to make sure that those communities get all the support they need. And even in these times of great excitement, we have to stay focused on the fact that when people suffer in this try, we all come together. And we have to keep our thoughts and prayers going out to everyone there and make sure we stand behind them. Okay? 
[ Cheers and applause ] so let me get started by first thanking alex for that very kind introduction. I also want to thank your provost as well as his wonderful wife, who have joined us today. Thank you so much for hosting us here at miami university. Yeah. 

[00:31:34]

>>> Back to the campaign trail. First lady michelle obama stumping for her husband, the president of the united states, at the university -- rather at miami university in oxford, ohio, which happens to be the alma mater of the republican vice presidential nominee, paul ryan. Let's listen in. 
>> Like so many families in this country, our families just weren't asking for much. They didn't want much, and they didn't begrudge anyone else's success. They didn't mind if others had much more. In fact, they admired it. That's why they pushed us to be the best we could be. But they simply believed in that fundamental american promise, that even if you don't start out with much, if you work hard and do what you're supposed to do, then you should be able to build a decent life for yourself and an even better life for your kids and grandkids. And they also believed that when you worked hard and have done well and you finally walk through that doorway of opportunity, you don't slam it shut behind you. You reach back and you give other folks the sameances that helped you succeed. 

[00:36:25]


[ Cheers and applause ] and that's is howarack and i, and I know so many of you were raised. And more than anything else, that is what this election is all about. It's a choice. It's a choice about our values and our hopes and our aspirations. It's a choice about the america we want to leave for our kids and our grandkids. And what does that america look like? What do we believe? We believe in an america where every child in this countrys access to good schools. And prepare them for jobs of the future. We believe in an america where no one goes broke or loses their home because someone gets sick or loses a job. We believe in an america where we all understand that none of us gets where we are on our own, and we treat everyone, do you hear me, everyone with dignity and respect, from the teachers who inspire us to the janitors who keep our schools clean. And in this america that we are working to build together, we believe that the truth matters. That you don't take shortcuts or game the system. And finally, we believe in keeping our priorities straight because everyone here knows good and well that cutting sesame street is no way to balance our budget. 
>> All right, again, the first lady there of the united states, michelle obama, stumping for her husband at the miami university in oxford, ohio, which also happens to be the alma mater of the republican vice presidential nominee paul ryan.

>>> The outcome of the presidential race could be effected by some unlikely candidates. Candidates that most americans know little about. We're talking about third party independents. Jill stein from massachusetts is the green party nominee. She's a physician, instructor, and mother. She believes higher education should be free. Rocky anderson is a former mayor of salt lake city, utah, and is the justice party nominee for president. He wants an immediate end to the war in afghanistan. And he wants health care coverage for everyone. Virgil goode is the constitution party nominee, a one-time democrat who turned republican. He served in the house of representatives from 1997 to 2009. He hails from the battleground state of virginia. And gary johnson, he's the libertarian nominee, he's a formerriment republican governor of new mexico who believes america should end the war on drugs and legalize marijuana. For the first time ever, last week a debate invng these four took place. Longtime talk show host larry king moderated the debate in chicago. He's joining us right now from los angeles. Good to see you, larry. 

[00:42:44]


>> Good to see you, fred. Always good to be with you. 
>> Excellent. At that debate, we heard everything from marijuana to new constitutional amendments. Things obama and romney have steered clear of. Let's take a listen. 
>> Let's legalize marijuana now. And right now in this country, we are at a tipping point. 
>> We're calling for a constitutional amendment. 
>> Ten seconds. 
>> To clarify that money is nat speech and that corporations are not people. 
>> Neither of them talk about catastrophic climate change, and neither of them talk about poverty. 
>> I'm for no political action committee. Individual contributions only, and no super pacs. 
>> So larry, is there any indication at this junksure whether any of these four are getting any traction? 
>> Johnson is. He's the libertarian candidate. He was a two-time governor of new mexico. Governor romney's campaign has tried to keep him off the ballot. He's on in 4 states and he's a write-in in the other. He's a slight threat to the republicans. I don't think the others are threats at all. However, fr, they brought up pointsever discussed in the debates. Drugs were never discussed. Having a drug czar was never discussed. I think obama said he would eliminate it but we still have a drug czar. And a lot of the things that were just mentioned were not brought up in the debates. I think these people deserve to be heard. They're not going to win. They could have an effect. I do think, fred, I don't know if you agree, the only way a third party gets prominence in the united states, it has to be heralded by one strong individual. We go back t ross perot who started on our show and then cnn. If you have a ross perot character with a weakened president and a challenger that might have a scandal, that could emerge. Other than that, I don't see the third parties having great impact in this country. 

[00:44:48]


>> What were some of the contrasts, maybe the similarities as well to the debate that you moderated and what we have seen in the three presidential debadz, the one vice presidential one you brought up. 
>> Well, this was a social network debate. The questions were mostly submitted by people on facebook and twitter. The subjects, again, were not covered in the other debates. I think the pace moved faster. There were time limits, and as a moderator, I held to the time limits. Two minutes and one minute rebuttals. I held to that. I think everybody got equal time, and all of the times were kept. Allowed the studio audience to participate. So you heard cheering, you heard reaction to various statemen made. I think it made for a lively 90 minutes. 
>> Of those candidates, you say johnson is the one who poses the biggest threat to the republican party. As you reflect, you talked to an awful lot of president, candidates over the year, et cetera, when you try to draw comparisons to the many people you have gotten to know at your table, do you feel like this race is particularly polarized more so than any other race tht you have sn, presidential race? 
>> Yeah, it is. I have been involved in presidential -- as a broadcaster since I was in miami in the 1960 campaign. And that race, I listened to that debate on the radio. That was the first ever debate between the candidates running on television, nixon and kennedy. If you listened on the radio, you thought it was even. If you watched it on television, you thought kennedy won because of the way ty looked. This is the most vituperative of campaigns. The most calming thing has been the debates. The debates have been more calming than the campaigns have been. And frankly, I think we run too long in this country. England, I think, takes two months to run a campaign. I would guess, I don't know about the folks at cnn or you yourself, I would guess people can't wait for this to be over. And I also can't believe that some are still undecided. If you're undecided now, I don't know where you're living. I don't buy it. I figured it out, fred. There's one guy in toledo, manny schwartz, he works in a delicatessen, he's the deciding vote in this election. 

[00:47:12]


>> Very perplexing. Very difficult at this point to not know which way you're going. I'm with you. It's very difficult to grasp. What more do you need to hear? 
>> Do you know anyone? I know of nobody who is undecided? 
>> I met someone this week, person to person, we had a great conversation and I'm still perplexed. We'll see hot happens. Larry king, thank you so much. Of "larry king now" great to see you. 
>> Bye, thanks. 
>>> Humor and politics? Can they go together? Strange bed fellows. But they do work on the big screen. At least in some politic comedies.

[00:50:49]


>>> all right, just three days away from the prential election, and this week, we're taking aolitical spin on movie reviews. Last week, our movie cc grae drake gave us her three top political dramas. This week, she's counting down her political comedies. Grae drake joining us now from los angeles. Good to see you as always. 
>> Hello. 
>> Hello, number three on your list is "wag the dog." Let's take a peek as a little reminder. 
>> Why come to me? 
>> We want you to produce. 
>> You want me to produce your war? 
>> Not a war. It's a pageant. We need a theme, a song, visuals. It's a pageant. 
>> What did you like about this? 
>> "Wag the dog" shows how closely related show biz has been to politics. And robert de niro as you saw, as that spin doctor who is hired to take attention away from a sex scandal. Does that sound familiar in the '90s? Back when we were discussing the meaning of , this movie came out and was so close to reality, I'm not entirely convinced it hasn't already happened in real life. Like maybe some day christopher nolan is going to win the award for the war on terror. 
>> Number two, let's move on to "the election" and watch a clip of it. 
>> Capitals were pretty good, even if you got a rotten one once in a while, but then one day, there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple or do you want an orange? That's democracy. 
>> I also like bananas. 
>> Why do I not remember that movie "the election"? 
>> I don't know that many people do remember it. It was directed by alexander payne, and ferris bueller himself takes it upon himself to take down one of his students, so this isn't just about elections. This is about education. Tracy slick is played by reese witherspoon who is that girl in high school that we all hated. She has tons of ambition and unlimited resources. She's kind of a monster, but we all know she's g places, and this movie is mean and hilarious, and really sharp satire. 

[00:53:14]


>> Wow. You know, sometimes it is fun to laugh at one's self or laugh at politics because we take it so seerbiously, don't we? Let's move on to the number one pick "dr. Strangelove" let's look. 
>> Am I to understand the ambassador is to be admitted to the war room? 
>> That's correct. He's here on my order. 
>> I don't know exactly how to put this, sir, but are you aware of what a serious breach of security that would be? You see everything. You can see the big board. 
>> Not the funniest clip, but what do you likebout this one? 
>> We don't want the russian guy to see the big board, fredricka. That's a huge problem. Our whole government defense relies on the big board. Stanley kubrick directed this and it has to be number one. There are no hanging chads in my number one because this is such a sharp, sharp joke about what happens when the government has to assemble and d something really quickly. Now, you and I both know we're not exactly engineered for that. So in dr. Strangelove, a general decides he's going to drop the bomb on russia, which is a huge problem. So peter sellers in this movie playing numerous roles as he always does, he has to kind of coral all of these people in the government and try to stop this, the crazy war that's going to happen just randomly on one day. And this movie just keeps getting better with age because, you know, lines never stop being funny, as our world gets more and more ridiculous in real life. Like george c. Scott and the russian ambassador are fighting and peter sellers has to break it up by saying, you can't fight in here. This is the war room. 
>> I love it. 
>> And it's a classic. 1964. You are reaching back. Not to confuse it with "dr. No." You start thinking about james bond movies, especially since we have been engamed in so much bond stuff with the release of the double-box set, but "dr. Strangelove" a classic, a stand out in and of itself and your number one. 

[00:55:33]


>> Yes, and thanks to my dad who showed this to me as a young age and taught me not to fight in the war room and show people the big boards. Important lessons. 
>> Thanks so much. Always good to see you. Hopefully you have already voted early or you'r going to be getting out to vote on tuesday, yes? 
>> Oh, I'm definitely there. There's noquestion. That's one of the things that "dr. Strangelove" made me understand, that voting is important. We can't have a bunch of knuckle heads in office, right? 
>> Thanks so much. Good to see you in los angeles. You can get more from grae at rottentomatoes.Com. 
>> New election polls are out. The numbers say the same thing, though. The races very tight. How tight? We'll dig deeper into the new numbers with two members of congress. ?????? ?????? ?????? Hi dad. Many years from now, when the Subaru is theirs... Hey. You missed a spot. ...I'll look back on this day and laugh. Love. It's what makes a Subaru, a Subaru. time, and the candidate's speech is in pieces all over the district. The writer's desktop and the coordinator's phone are working on a joke with local color.

[ Female Announcer ] WITH CISCO AT THE CENTER... Working together has never worked so well. 
>>> It's the top of the hour. Welcome back. You're in the cnn newsroom. I'm fredricka whitfield. The final push is on with the clock ticking. The candlets are launching one last battleground blitz. Obama is campaigning in ohio, wisconsin, and iowa. While mitt romney is focusing on new hampshire, iowa, and colorado. Millions of americans have already cast their ballots and some are taking advantage of early voting today. Take a look at the huge lines in plantation, florida. The wait there has been up to three hours in some places. Barack obama heads towards election day with the lead among early voters in some key states. But it's not as big as the one HE HAD OVER john McCain four years ago. Of all the swing states, ohio could be the most important. No one had won the presidency without the buckeye state since 1960, and a brand new cnn/orc poll showshe candidates there are in a statistical dead heat. 50% of likely voters favor president obama while 47% support mittromney. An nbc/wall street journal/maris poll shows a wider gap with obama leading by six points. It's a tight racein florida as well. A poll shows obama leading by just two points, but a mason dixon poll gives romney the edge.51% of likely voters say they'll vote for the republican candidate, while 45% say they'll vote for obama. So another state that could be a make or break state for both campaigns, we're talking about colorado now, which is home to nine electoral votes. In 2008, obama won that state. But in the past, it has favored republicans. Kyung lah joins us from englewood, colorado, where mitt romney will be holding a rally r on today. Nearly 1.5 million people have already voted in colorado there by mail-in, early voting, et cetera. What is the impact that is expected? 

[01:01:17]


>> Well, what we're expecting is that we're going to know colorado very quickly, if it is overwhelmingly one way or the other. That's according to the secretary of state. This complicates things for those trying to get registered independents on their side, specifically mitt romney. If you look at the numbers, 85% of all registered voters will have voted before tuesday. Already, we're hearing 1.6 million votes have already been sent in to the secretary of state's office. That's what we know. The tough job for governor romney now is to try to capture a dwindling number of registered independents. And he's got to try to fire them up. So is that working? Well, we talked to a guy who is standing in line. He's a registered independent, and here's what he told us. 
>> We're pumped, energized, ready to go, yeah. Absolutely. Can't wait for tuesday. 
>> Polls are showing it's a dead heat. 
>> Really close. 
>> What is it going to take for your guy to win? 
>> Don't know. What more can you say? Turnout. 
>> So will he get the turnout? In the ground game here, and if you go to looking back at the last romney event, the last big one was at the red rock amphitheater, they had to turn people away. The people who attended that said it felt more like an obama 2008 event than something that they have seen from the republicans. So certainly there is energy on the republican side, but we should point out, fredricka, that the latest cnn poll does show president obama leading governor romney by a few percentage points. 
>> And so kyung, what about the so-called suburban mom. A lot of discussion has been taking place in colorado about how potentially influential they are. 
>> Ary influential vote. Let me give you the big picture first. Colorado has one third registered republicans. One third registered democrats, and a third registered independents. Drill it down even further, ong those registered independents, suburban mothers who are unaffiliated. They're the ones who overwhelmingly voted for president obama in 20008, and the republicans are trying to bring them back into the fold. We have spoken to some of the suburban moms and they say it's working. Some of them really want to go with governor romney. They don't feel the job security has been there, that president obama won't give it to them in the next four years. But then you talk to another suburban mom sitting next to her and she's going to stick with president obama in part because the deciding factor for her are the social issues. There are a lotof issues that go into play, but I have to y, top of the issues here is job security.

>> All right, kyung lah, thanks so much from colorado. Apprec athat. Let's drill down deeper on the strategy of both of the candidates and see how the last-minute campaigning is shaking out. Joining me now is tom price. A republican congressman from georgia a the chairman of the committee's policy committee. Good to see you. And che sheila jackson, a democratic congresswoman from texas, and she's not joining us from texas today. She's out on the campaign trail in columbus, ohio. Good to see you as well, congresswoman. 
>> Fredricka, good to be with you this afternoon. 
>> Excellent. Let's begin. We're talking about these candidates, president obama, mitt romney, they are crisscrossing these battleground states. Let me begin with you, congressman price. You heard kyung talking about coloradoo vital. It was obama country during the last election, but with the one third independent voters made up much of suburban moms, is this a strategy that romney is going to be spending more time there later on today. How focused is he on colorado and trying to sway perhaps those one third independent voters? 
>> That's colorado and it's wisconsin it's ohio and pennnd all of the other states that are still in play. And the independent voters are indeed absolutely pivotal. Each candidate want to make sure they get out their base, their base voters. When we look at the independent votes which is why we believe so strongly that governor romney will be the next president, we see high single and even double digit leads in the polls by romney and ryan. Their job is to deliver the final message of optimism and hope in america and urging people to get out to the polls. 
>> Let's tal about the independents because in the 2008 race, president obama, then candidate obama, was really able to appeal to the independents. In this case, it's not so cut and dry. What's the strategy or the focus as he campaigns against the battleground states? 

[01:05:53]


>> Obviously, we feel very good about the campaign over the next couple days. I have been in ohio. I happen tobe in a new congressional candidate's district, congresswomaeatty with the congressional black caucus and we're assured by the sentiment and tone from colorado to wisconsin, ohio, virginia, we're certainly still working in north carolina, but here is the key. Independent voters did vote for president obama in 2008. Independent voters like to set the country right side up. They understand president obama has been the leader in turning this country around, so much so that its growth and job creation keeps going up and up. They like to see an optimistic approach to government. That's what president obama has. They're also big believers in education. For a candidate like mitt romney who wants to abolish the department of education, we think we have a greater message for the independents, for women. We certainly are protecting women's health care. Those are issues the independents are interested in. As well as the economy. Who are they going to choose? Someone who sides with sort of the antiquate views of abolishing or eliminated planned parenthood and attacking women's health care or look to someone whoelieves in embracing all of america. That's an optimistic view. We're oistic and working hard and we really believe that nments along with those who are champions of president obama's cause will come to recognize that america is greater when we're united together. That's how the vote will turn OUT ON NOVEMBER 6th. 
>> So congressman, is that a big obstacle. Is there a sentiment that romney's views are antiquated and he's trying to overcome that. 
>> Great talking points by la jackson, clearly, but not the truth. The question is whether or not the american people want more of the president that results in higher taxes, more spending of money we don't have, greater regulations, decreasing ability for job creators to create jobs. Or do they want to move in a direction that is positive and upbeat for america with lower taxes, less regulation and making certain we balance the budget and decrease the debt and deficit. That's the kind of positive work romney is bringing. That's the kind of work he' done in the private sector in the public sector which is why americans recognize he could work across party lines and move progress forward for america. 

[01:08:17]


>> That brings me to the other wurbd that has come up a lot, big government, as it pertains to mitt romney. Now you have this crisis, this natural disaster that took place, and youalk about the bipartisanship. We have seen how government has needed to step in by way of fema. Romney has, you know, points of view in the primary, drudged up again by him saying fema is not necessary. Then we talk about bipartisanship. You're seeing president obama standing right next to what was a number one surrogate for romney. So you know, in the end, has this natural disaster how kind of skewed or changed some of the opinions or sentiments about what romney has been saying about government not working, government being too intrusive? 
>> Nobody's suggesting that governor christy still isn't indorsing and supporting governor romney. Clearly, he has and continues to do so. The fact is -- of the matter is we don't want government, we want it to be efficient and positive and working for individuals, not against individuals. So governor romney never said we don't need fema. What he said it was the local and state governmental entities that were the first individuals in in a disaster. That's exactly true. 
>> Let me say this, fredricka. Let me say this as a member of the homeland security cttee, I thank my good friend from georgia, we worked together, and I must say that president obama has worked the last four years republican members of congress. With senators, with house members on a number of different issues, patent law, a number of issues dealing with energy, a number of issues dealing with building up business opportunities. But the real policy questions that will help america, president romney to be if he's trying to be president, excuse me, is arguing that government should be small. Plain and simple. Not prophetic, a gross error. He's arguing for government to be small. He wanted to eliminate fema. He wanted to eliminate the department of education. 

[01:10:22]


>> Not true. 
>> You can't flip-flop as he has done and now in the tragedy of sandy, which I have been through with katrina and rita down on the gulf, you have to know that government has a purpose. I have always said that. It can be constructive. It's an umbrella on a rainy day to take the story at hand with sandy's enormous storm. But governor romney does not want to support governmenin the way that helps people. And that means eliminating medicare. It means not caring about seniors, not providing for pell grants. You can't flip-flop in the last hours to suggest you would embrace government. We all want government to be efficient, and president obama has been a leader. He has the smallest federal government we have had in decades under president obama. Smallest number of employees, but it has been efficient enough to be effective on the east coast, rising to the occasion, to the extent thatcan governors have given the president and his team compliments in their responsiveness and the mayor of new york has endorsed him. It's not about that. It's about the president wanting to support a constructive government and governor romney who is trying to be president, running against an efficient government. I think americans will see the wrongness of that. 
>> It's about whether or not the american people believe that 23 million unemployed americans is all right, whether they believe $5 trillion more debt under this president is all right, or her we want to go in a direction that pulls people together, that creates jobs. 12 million jobs that governor romney has laid out for his first term, and moving in a direction so that government isn't spending more money than it takes in. 
>> Clearly, it sounds like jobs, government -- 
>> president obama has created jobs, particularly in ohio where we restored the auto ndustry. No one can take that away from this past administration, but what they can attribute to governor romney is let them go bankrupt, and also a misleading and distorting ad that tells not the truth but a distortion of that which is so unfair. They will vote the truth and the truth will set them free, and they will vote november 6th and be free. 

[01:12:33]


>> Excellent, thanks so much to both of you. I appreciate it. Of course, the drum beat carries on. Just three days to go until election day. Manyiscussions to be had before folks in large numbers hopefully make it to the polls. Thanks so much to both of you. Appreciate. 
>>> It's canceled for the first time in 42 years. Talking about sunday's new york city marathon. Critwere afraid the race would hurt the sandy recovery efforts. Now runners have turned their attention from the race to those most in need. pro. Governor of getting it done. You know how to dance... With a deadline. And you...Rent from national. Because only national lets you choose any car in the aisle... And go. You can even take a full-size or above, and still pay the mid-size price. This is awesome. 

[01:14:56]


[ Male Announcer ] YES, IT IS, BUSINESS PRO. Yes, it is. Go national. Go like a pro. work arthritis. Try capzasin-hp. It penetrates deep to block pain signals for hours of relief. Capzasin-hp. Take the pain out of arthritis. 
>>> All right, you know by now the world renowned new york city marathon has been canceled. Mayor michael bloomberg made the decision yesterday. He faced a lot of pressure because many said the race would divert resources and manpower from the victims of sandy. Well, the race has been run every year since 1970, and it draws runners worldwide. Many runners supported the cancellation, even encouraged it. And they took offense to being called insensitive to sandy's victims. 
>> When the marathon was told to be pushing through and then there were some talks about the runners not being sensitive to the people in need, I think that's a little bit sad because as runners, we came here to help and support also the people. And you know, we thought if the marathon was pushed through, we would actually help the city get back on its feet. But now that it's not pushing through, we're still here to help. And our hearts go out to the city of new york. 
>> Joining me now, celebrity runner, tanya from hg tv's bang for your buck. Good to see you. 
>> Good to see you. Thank you so much for having me. 
>> You traveled from far and wide as well. She traveled from the philippines. You traveled from arizona? 
>> Arizona. 
>> You traveled from arizona to make it to the new york city marathon only to find out it was canceled. So how disappointed were you? 

[01:17:02]


>> Honestly, if this was causing dissension between the residents of new york city, mayor bloomberg did the right thing. He should have done it sooner. People are losing their lives, they don't have power, they're afraid of freezing. This race brings the city together. It shouldn't calls dissension. He made the right decision by cancelling it and sending though resources to the people that truly need them. 
>> And so now I understand an awful lot of runners who made that trip have decided, okay, I'm here. I'm going to be a volunteer. I'm going to help. There are a whole lot who turned out to staten island earlier today to help in any way, shape, or form. What are you going to do? 
>> That's exactly right. And that's where I got really excited yesterday when they did cancel the race. I didn't have to run 26.2 miles. 
>> You've been training for it, wait a minute? 
>> And I was running for north shore animal league. I called north shore immediately and asked them what I could do to help them. I'm actually walking dogs and helping the north shore animal league. They're the largest no-kill shelter in the world and they have taken in over 90 animals. And they're up at nassau community college right next to the red cross so the people in the shelter can actually see their pets, and they're caring for their pets. I'm up there helping them as much as I can and then I'm heading to staten island tomorrow as well. 
>> What o you suppose you're going to be ablto do in staten island because they're trying to organize the flood of helping hands and want to figure out how to best utilize everybody. What are you hoping you might be assigned or volunteer to do? 
>> That's exactly the problem, there are a lot of volunteers. People don't know what to do. Honestly, I don't care if I'm shoveling sand or moving furniture or have a dryer in someone's house, I think the point is we need to unite and come together and help the people that really need it. New york is a comeback city. They'll come back again. If the people from the philippines and everybody who was here to run the race helps, we'll make it a little better. 
>> In the meantime, you know, with the hg tv show "bang for your buck" we get to see your expertise is in the real estate industry. I understand you are, you know, licensed in many states, including that of new york. So when we talk about some of the hard hit areas, queens, the rockaways, et cetera, you have a point of view about the obstacles that might be ahead for some of those homeowners. Namely the ones who were living in homes where they may have been behind in their payments, facing foreclosure, et cetera. What is this recovery likely to be for them? Or the rebuilding efforts, the response? 

[01:19:42]


>> Right, so in september, we actually saw existing home sales jump 11% over the past year. We were actually getting into a little bit of a positive situation for housing. This is actually going to set back the national housing numbers. Let alone new york's housing numbers. Foreclosures in new york on average take 900 days. There re a lot of people in the foreclosure process who may say, this is far too much. I'm not going to tryo modify, I'm not going to try to do anything. I'm going to walk away. That leaves the burden on the banks. The banks are going to have a lot of decisions to make. Do they fix them, sell them as is and let investors come in and create the home and make the money on them? What are they going to do? But there's a lot of decisions to be made when it comes to housing. One of the hardest things for a lot of new yorkers is these homes are passed on from generation to generation. So there may not be homes that they want to give up. They want to re-create these homes, they want to make it home again. That's where they're really going to have to understand that yes, there's going oo be assistance from fema and your insurance, but you're going to have to get in and do some sweat equity to get the homes back to where they were. 
>> Thank you so much. I won't wish you the best or break a leg because you're not running tomorrow, but I wish you the best on your volunteerism activity tomorrow because, yeah, there's going to be a lot of heavy lifting, but the people in staten island are grateful you and so many other runners are volunteering to help them out. Thank you for your time.

But one injured veteran in alabama is turning his disability into an inspiration and a better life for his family. His story in this welcome home. A wave of patriotism swept the country in the wake of 9/11 and it changed noah galloway's life. 
>> I joined the army immediately AFTER SEPTEMBER 11th. I was going to the school at the university of birmingham. After we were attacked, I felt like it was what I needed to do. 
>> He deployed to iraq in 2003 and again in2005. When he was injured by a roadside bomb. He lost his left arm, left leg, and his jaw had to be reconstructed. It also marked the end of his first marriage. 

[01:25:11]


>> I laid in the hospital bed and where remember thinking it was all over. I was very physical, I lost two limbs, a wife. I remember thinking I would much rather have died than to have woken up like this. 
>> Then he recorrected with a childhood love who renewed his strength. She's a big part of what got me out of the hospital as quickly as I did. 
>> Noah and tracy now have two children in addition to noah's son from his first marriage. Tracy is candid about the emotional toll of his husband's injury. 
>> I think his disability makes things a little different. Little things that people don't think about, he wasn't able to do. But then again, he amazes me every day, too, because if i were in his position, I probably wouldn't want to get out of bed. 
>> Galloway runs races like warrior dash, tough mudder, and even the marine corps marathon to challenge himself and inspire others. 
>> Way to go. 
>> He also paired up with team extreme, which runs these races in gas masks, to raise awareness for injured veterans. 
>> We still have veterans coming out of afghanistan with injuries. And it's not that I'm this incredible guy, but my injury was before them. If I can show them the roult route I took to success, they can follow the same. That makes me feel good. 
>> Galloway has a website and is trying to get sponsors which he hopes will lead to a new career. 
>> It's been a struggle finding where I fit in with work and having found that there is a possibility of making a living off being somewhat of a special athlete. I go to the races, I'm not winning, but I'm a guy missing an arm and leg and pushing it, and people see that.

>>> All right, welcome back. We meioned the candidates are crisscrossing all of the battleground states. Virginia is one of them. One of the swing states. You're looking at eric cantor, house majority leader. However, any moment now, we understand vice presidential nominee paul ryan will be entering, and he'll be rallying there in richmond, virginia. When that happens, we'll take that live. Meantime, the other swing state, florida, democrats in that state are looking for an extension of early voting now. Cnn's joe johns joining me from washington with more on this. Why the extension? What's happening? 

[01:31:01]


>> Well, essentially they're going to go to the very different states, look around, and see if all the laws are being follow that the united states congress passed. Going to 23 different states, fred, including six battleground states. Seven different locations inside the state of florida just by itself. And think of what's going on there right now. We have gotten reports of very long lines on the last day of early voting. People waiting three hours, even four hours, just to cast a ballot. And as you know the democratic senator bill nelson there, has asked the republican governor, rick scott, to extend early voting. This being the last day. So far, the governor has said no. There's a lot for the justice department observers to keep an eye on, at least in the sunshine state. 
>> And so joe, are we talking about just extending it throughout the day instead of say, 7:00 being the time the polls close this evening, it would be 10:00 p.M., Or are we talking about extending it into a whole other day? 
>> I have heard it both ways. I heard extending it into sunday, of course, that's problematic because as you know, the state of florida passed a bunch of different laws including cutting off that last sunday before election day as early voting day. They say they did that because they wanted to give the election officials more time to prepare for tuesday. And the idea that they would now come at the 11th hour and switch back to the old scheme doesn't sound like something the governor would want to do. 
>> Ok and as it pertains to the justice department election monitors, what would they be doing as they descend on so many states or locations that they want to keep a closer watch on? Is it as simple as them standing there and just observing the people. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Doing the right thing? What is it? 
>> Right, it depends on the state. You have a bunch of different states that come under what's called the voting rights act of 1965. And these states have different places inside the state, a county, a city, what have you, that have been adjudicated years ago as perhaps having a problem with dealing with minorities an the vote. So there's a certain set of rules that go along with those individual locations. Then there a other states that they're just interested in. A couple spots in the state of ohio, for example, where they want to go and watch and see what's going on. We're told a lot of this has to do with concerns about language on the ballot, so you have latinos or asians or others who have equal right, certainly, to vote, and the question is whether they can read and understand the ballot well enough to vote. So that goes into it. And there are a lot of other concerns. None of which the department of justice shares with us until they run out and file a lawsuit or something. 

[01:34:02]


>> Right. All right, joe johns, thanks so much from washington. Appreciate that. 
>> Something else that considered a pretty big challenge or obstacle right now. In states like connecticut, new jersey, and new york. How do people vote? Given what took place with that superstorm sandy? Five days after the storm, polling station managers are working to make sure voting goes as smoothly as possible. But is that a difficult undertaking? Joining me to explain what they're doing in connecticut, connect kick' secretary of state, denise merril, good to see you. 
>> Good to see you. 
>> I understand already in some portions of connecticut like greenwich, everything is working again. You have the polling station in place. But then are there other areas in connecticut that were impacted by the storm where things are not up and running. The polling stations and power is not up and running? 
>> There are still a few that we're worried about, probably a handful at this points, but we've been in communication with all of the 169 towns where these elections are held. We don't have a county election system in connecticut, so that's a big challenging. But we're pretty confident we will have most of the polling places up and running and generators standing by if needed. 
>> So this means that early voting was interrupted, right, in many of these jurisdictions? Does that mean that you are anticipating longer lines, you know, more frustrated voters come tuesday? 
>> Well, actually, in connecticut, we don't have early voting, and we have very strict absentee ballot laws which have gotten in our way a little bit because we have workers from out of state that were struggling to figure out how we're going to get them a ballot. So that's one of our remaining problems. But in general, yes, there will be -- we're going to be watching it closely to make sure that everyone gets to cast their ballot on election day. 
>> Interesting. No early voting in your state. However, were there a lot of people displaced by the storm and one of the challenges might be how to get to the polling station? 

[01:36:09]


>> Absolutely. And I did a tour yesterday of places like greenwich and our biggest city, which is bridgeport, where there are a lot of poor and frail elderly people, and they're all clustered along the shoreline. There are some concerns there, some of them are still in shelters. Many of them still have no power. We do have power to most of the polling places, but I think there are some concerns about actually reaching people and getting them to vote. 
>> But it sounds like you're feeling very confident that people's voting rights will not be interrupted in a big way come tuesday in connecticut. 
>> Well, we're working hard on it, and there's been a lot of communication necessary, and we'll be monitoring things to make sure that things are going well. It is a challenge, though. An additional one on top of others we had. But we're hopeful. 
>> All right, connecticut's secretary of state, thanks for your time and all the best to you and your voters come tuesday. 
>> Thank you.

>> Fred, you know, there are some amazing people in the cnn.Com world who dream up the great ideas and then they pop up right here. People like to joke about how we get big maps. These are ones youget to move around and folks, all of them have hard information I think you're going to be intested in. Let's start with this one right here which is called the road to 270. We're showing you at any given moment the prediction for the electoral results inside this election. You can see what we think the states are going to do and we'll continue to update this as time goes on. I want to jump across the screen and show you something brand new. Look at this. How much money has been spent by each candidate in each state in the entire country. Also how many times they have traveled to each state, how much money they have raised in each state. All you have to do is click on a state, and look at the breakdown here. This is how far folks went. Let's see if we can weigh in to this. Colorado, not only are we showing you ad spending. We're also showing you approximately how many of the ads were positive and negative. You can compare two states and any category you want. Let's zoom in over here. I want to show you this. A few clicks. You compare any state in any category. Jus an example, I pulled up colorado and ohio to see how many times the candidates have visited. You can then with one click save this image, share it on facebook, share it on twitter.

[01:46:57]


[ Male Announcer ] Progresso. You gotta taste this soup. 
>>> All right, back to the scam pain trail, and right now, they're looking at a live performance of singer katy perry and her band there. They're at the delta center in milwaukee. Ahead of president barack obama's arrival there. She's been campaigning on behalf of the president. Earlier in the week, she was in las vegas and wearing an outfit that kind of looked like a paper ballot, a ballot for her selection of the obama/biden ticket, and later on in the 4:00 eastern hour, when he arrives, we'll take that live. Right now in richmond, virginia, republican vice presidential nominee paul ryan is speaking there. 
>> Like that smart person over there or a redskins fan. We love this country. We've got serious problems in this country. That requires serious solutions. And in order to put serious solutions in place, you to elect a leader. That's why in three days, we need to elect mitt romney the next president of the united states. You know, in the closing moments of the campaign, it's what you can see really what a campaign is all about at times. In these last hours, let me read you a quote from four years ago. If you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from. You make a big election about small things. You remember who said that four years ago? You do remember. That's what barack obama said in 2008. Sadly, that's exactly what he has become. As candidate in 2008, he appealed to our highest aspirations. Now, he's appealing to our lowest fears. Just yesterday, he suggested to his supporters that people ought to vote out of revenge. Look, mitt romney and I are asking for your vote, and asking for your vote, and we are asking you toote out of love for country. That is the kind of election we want. That is the kind of victory we want. That is the kind of victory you deserve. Usa, that is right, usa. 

[01:49:55]


>> Usa, usa, usa, usa, usa, usa. 
>> In 2008, president obama made lots of grandiose promises. You remember hope and change? Remember how he would bring everybody together? He has not met with our party leaders since last july. Remember when he said he would cut the deficit in half? It has doubled. Remember when he said he would create all of these jobs? Look, we just got the latest employment report. And the unemployment rate is higher than the day he took office. You have got 23 million americans struggling to find work in this country today. 15% of our fellow citizens are living in poverty today. It is the highest rate in a generation. We are nine million jobs shy of what he said would achieve if only he could borrow all the stimulus money and spend it on all of these interest groups. Look, this isn't working. We have a jobs crisis. Wouldn't it be nice to have an actual job creator in the white house during a jobs crisis? We need leadership. You know, one of my favorite historians, a guy named rufus fears, he did all of these election studies on virginia, on the founders, and the four common themes and principles, the characteristics that define a great leader in a nation's time when it needs a great 
leader, he said this: You need a leader with a moral compass and a leader with a bed rock of principles, like our founding principles, you need a leader for the vision of the country and the skills to execute that vision. That is mitt romney. This is the man that is here for the moment. The man and the moment are meeting. Look at what the man has done in his life. This is a man who when given a responsibility actually achieves. This is a man who where others have failed he has succeeded. This is a man who helped create tens of thousands of jobs, who turned around businesses. Who helped struggl businesses. And by the way, being successful in business, that is a good thing. We like success. We don't demean success, we don't envy success, we want other people to become successful. 

[01:52:38]


>> All right, vice presidential nominee paul ryan there in richmond, virginia, if you want to watch the rest of his statements there out of richmond you can go to cnn.Com. Next hour, president obama is scheduled to speak in milwaukee, wisconsin. We'll bring that to you live, as well. ?????? ??????

>>> all right, next hour, president obama will be taking the stage there in milwaukee, wisconsin. But right now you're seeing the warmup act of singer katy perry and her band there on stage. Earlier in the week she was in las vegas, wearing a kind of ballot type of dress, saying she was all for obama, and biden today, it is all campaign forward. Let's listen in. ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? 
[ man ] HELLO!!!! Hello!!!! 
[ all ] OHH! That is crazy! Are you kidding me? Let me see! Oh! What! That's insane! Noooo! Mr. Woodson? Oh hello! Hello! 
[ whistles ] HELLO!

[ Male Announcer ] AT&T. THE NATION'S LARGEST 4g network. Covering 3,000 more 4g cities and towns than verizon. Rethink possible. man. He's, he's on my back about providing for his little girl. Hey don't worry. E-trade's got a killer investing dashboard. Everything is on one page. I'm watching you. Oh yeah? Well I'm watching you, watching him.

[01:59:22]


>>> Welcome back, the top of the hour, you're in the cnn news room, I'm fredricka whitfield. Superstorm sandy, the aftermath is the first thing we're tackling right now. Work is getting under way to secure the new york city crane that partially collapsed during the storm, almost a symbol, a live shot of that right now. This is the top of that luxury condo building 157. And you can see the crane of it, the boom there, collapsed, dangling for five days now. It could be another six days or so before the s are able to secure it. Also expect the mayor of new york city, michael bloomberg, to have a press conference and of course we'll bring it to you live when it happens. 
>>> With just three days to go until election day, mitt romney and barack obama are giving their closing arguments to the public. And at this point it could go either way. The president is scheduled to speak at a rally in wisconsin in just a couple of moments. And of course, he will still have plans to visit iowa and virginia before the day is done. Earlier the president vowed to continue to fight for the middle class, and told a cheering crowd that he is someone who can be trusted. 
>> After four years as president. You know me. You may not agree with every decision I have made, you may, at times have been frustrated by the pace of ch but you know what I believe, you know where i stand. 
>> Mitt romney is also hitting the campaign trail hard. He started his day, rather, in new hampshire, stopped off in iowa and now, he is heading to colorado where he will make two stops there. During a speak in iowa, the former massachusetts governor encouraged voters to reach out to others with a different political view and says he plans to put the country back on the right track. 
>> You know, yesterday the president said something you may have already heard. That I found troubling. Spoke to an audience and said voting is the best revenge. He is asking you supporters to vote for revenge. I'm asking you to vote for change. 

[02:01:46]


>> Both president obama and mitt romney are still campaigning their nonstop. Here is why, the latest poll shows ohio pretty close. The president had made it to the 50% mark. Mr. Romney has 47% of likely ohio voters. The nbc wall street journal poll taken during the same period shows obama over the 50% threshhold, at 51% and mr. Romney at 45%. And with the 18 electoral votes, you can see ohio is the battleground of the battleground states. You can see what happens in the middle of the state in the capitol of columbus, my colleague is there in the state. So don, what appears to be what you're hearing there? What are people focusing on? What is the criteria people are using to make up their minds if they have not already? 
>> Reporter: Well first, I think that people think that governor romney and the president have taken up residence here in the state because they have been here so much. They will make a couple of more stops before the next 72 hours. This is the state, to really make up their minds it is the economy, the economy, the economy, and I think that is what people are really concerned about. The social issues, obviously, that is part of it. But the time now, the time has , I should say for social issues. Since that first debate, social issues out the window. It is really a numbers game now. And I is really about getting people to the polls to vote. And fred, that is what we're here doing, we're covering t ground game. Bcampaigns are doing their ground game to get people out to vote. And that is what we're covering, because man, it is really tight here. 
>> It is very tight, but it also seems that voters have made up their minds. It is very clear whether they're going to go democrat or republican, so one wonders why would the incumbent and the republican candidate spend so much time in ohio. Why do they feel like they can sway the voters when it seems as though they have made up their minds? 

[02:03:59]


>> Reporter: Well, I think they want the voters here in ohio, to see that they're at the top of their mind, whether mitt romney was here or barack obama was here. We're covering the national polls, they don't really mean very much. What counts are the swing states. So what counts here, local news, local med getting local publicity so that they're on the minds of the people. Shaking hands, touching as many people as possible. So that is what the surrogates and others are doing, when they see them on the television, they just click away. People just sort of see it and tune it out. And now it is about personal contact, that is why they're coming here. 
>> Uh-huh, we're looking at video of people knocking on doors, are people kind of receptive of the campaigners, trying to get those votes. They are being inundated with the television ads, sometimes that can be a turnoff, if anything. 
>> Listen, itepends on the day, right? You know you can get a phone call, on your phone at home, and it can be someone and you can be nicer, and sayu know what, please don't call back, thank you very much. So it depends on the da and the mood. They're having -- they're getting some traction, some good reception, some people call and just hang up. We did story the other day, the caller was for a romney person, said I just want to know if you're going to support governor romney come election day, and she goes hello, hello, hello? She laughed and said I guess that is a no. So it depends on the person, the day and mood. They're getting some traction and getting people out to vote. Hey, quickly, what I found, first-time voters, they're trying to get as many people in their ranks as possible. So I was at a polling place and the first time voter comes in, and people applaud. And we turned around to look at the first time vr. It was not an 18-year-old, but 40s, 50s, 60s, IT WAS OLDER People. 

[02:06:20]


>> What is the story behind that? Why? 
>> Reporter: I think because they hav the initiative, the ground game, and because the secretary of state in part sent ballots and applications to every single registered voter here in the state. And so that touched both people. I don't know who will energize the most, the right or le but they thought this sort of levelled the playing field. So they need to be on their game. 
>> Yes, and the sto why this is behind the story of the first time election, the person in THEIR 40s AND 50s, WHY THIS Galvanized to get them to get out to vote. That has to be a compelling story. All right, don lemon, thank you, you will be anchoring your shows from ohio throughout the evening, so we'll be tuning in, of course. 
>> Reporter: Right here at the beautiful boat house restaurant in downtown columbus. 
>> All right, love it. Thank you so much, don, appreciate it. 
>>> Another midwestern state that will factor in tuesday's outcome is iowa. That could play a significant role in how people vote. 
>> Reporter: In the heart of des moines, they gather to talk faith, family and the presidential election. 
>> Honestly what it all comes down to is what does the bible say and which candidate will follow the closest? 
>> Reporter: For bob and rachel bradshaw, that candidate is mitt romney. 
>> I don't know how in his right mind the president could be for abortion the way he is, and support same-sex marriage. It is just hard for me that somebody that claims to be a christian, you know, makes statements to support things like that. 
>> It has not been an easy choice to make, either way. 
>> Reporter: This family has fought with their te. 

[02:08:20]


>> My religious believes, in an honesty, don't align with either one. In all honesty, it will probably be mitt romney. 
>> Reporter:57% of voters identified themselves at evangelicals, many were uneasy on romney's past on issues like abortion and the mormon faith. But that was then. You previously said that the romney campaign snubbed the social conservatives? 
>> I think he has tried to prove he has made that out reach to social conservatives and economic conservatives, he has done a good job here in iowa. 
>> Reporter: While others seem to be moving to mitt romney's camp, here in dubuque, the president may face more of a challenge. The catholic voters here are split on issuese abortion, funding for ntraception, and the government's role. 
>> The life issues for many catholics, they hold that dear and central to their faith. But then there is this belief that remains that the democratic party somehow cares for the poor better. I think it comes down to th tension. 
>> Reporter: How big a role does your catholic religion play in your vote? 
>> I think it is big, I'm an ex-nun. And I -- the group of nuns that I associate with this day push for obama. 
>> Reporter: Is the pro-choice stand difficult for you to reconcile? 
>> It was difficult, it bothered me a long, long time. 
>> Reporter: As did the same-sex marriage issue, that she ultimately looked past, but for others, some issues are non-negotiatable. 

[02:10:22]


>> I am pro life and wanted an administration that supports that view. And I would say the sanctity of life and marriage. 
>> Poppy harlow, joining us, you have been all over the state, barack obama won in 2008 in that state. Polls show he is ahead. But could mitt romney really make a run in these final three days? Because it looks like the majori of people you spoke to in that piece are big advocates, big supporters of romney. 
>> Reporter: Well that is when you talk about mitt romney, they overwhelmingly backed santorum, but it seems that they moved into that romney camp, largely because they will oppose obama strongly on the same-sex marriage, and funding for contraception. Now the religious vote, when you talk about catholicvoters in dubuque, they were not traditionally in the vote, they seem to be split more because how outspoken the president has been on those social issues and health care reform. I will tell you that neither of the groups we have talked to have been thrilled, necessarily, with their choices right now. And I think that is something that is very important, the enthusiasm, to get out to the polls, don was saying that every single vote counts in ohio and here. You need that enthusiasm, and we're not necessarily feeling that in iowa fred. 
>> All right, poppy harlow, in dubuque. 
>>> All right, a critical swing state, yes, florida qualifies. We'll tell you about a sometimes overlooked voting block that could make a difference in the suns state. time, and the candidate's speech is in pieces all over the district. The writer's desktop and the coordinator's phone are working on a joke with local color. The secure cloud just received a revised intro from the strategist's tablet. And while I make my way into the venue, the candidate will be rehearsing off of his phone.

>>> All right, on to milwaukee, wisconsin, president obama rallying for support there. Let's listen in. 
>> United states senator tammy baldwin. Now, wisconsin, for the pa several days all of us have been focused on what is happening on the east c. And it is one of the worst storms we have ever seen. I have spent this morning talking to local and state officials there, and you know the loss of life, the hardships the folks are going through are just heartbreaking. And it is a reminder of how fragile things are sometimes. And as a nation, we have got to mourn those who have been lost. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their families. You know, we're going to stay with the folks whose lives have been unended every step of the way, until we have fully rebuilt. That is what america does. That is what we're about. Because the thing is, in the midst of these tragedies we're also inspired, about heroes that go through buildings and wade rough water, neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy, leaders of each party working together to fix what is broken. It is a spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is, no matter how tough times may get, we alwaysounce back because we're all in this together. We rise or fall as one nation, and as one people. And that spirit has guided this nation along its improbable journey for more than two centuries, and it is what carried us through the trials and tribulations of the past years, we were in two wars and crisis, since the great depression. And today, we have created 5 million new jobs. The american auto industry is back on top. Home values are on the rise, we depend less on foreign oil than in the last 20 years. And because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women, the war in iraq is over. The war in afghanistan is coming to a close. Al-qaeda is on the run, osama bin den is dead. So we made real progress these past four years. But wisconsin, we're all gathered here today because we have got more work to do. As long as there is a single amican who wants a job but can't find one, our work is not even done. As long as their families are working harder but falling behind, our work is not yet done. As long as there is a child any place in milwaukee, any place in wisconsin, any place in this country, who is languishing in poverty and barred from opportunity, our fight goes on. Our fight goes on because this nation cannot succeed without a growing, thriving middle class. Our fight goes on bec america has always done best when everybody has got a fair shot. Everybody is doing their fair share, everybody is playing by the same rules. That is what we believe. That is why you elected me in 2008. That is why I'm running for a second term as president of the united states of america. Now, wisconsin, in three days you have a choice to make. It is not a choice between two candidates or two parties, it is a choice between two very different visions for our future. It is a choice between a return to the top down economics that caused our economy to crash. Vote -- it -- it is a choice between that and a future that is built on making sure everybody is playing their part, we'reating a strong and growing middle class, but also ladders of opportunity for people who are willing to work hard to get into that middle class. You know, and -- listen. Keep in mind we don't -- as americans, expect success to be handed to us. As americans, we honor the strivers and the dreamers and the risk-takers, the entrepreneurs and the small business people. The folks who are the driving force behind enterprise system. We also believe that for our markets and for free enterprise to succeed, everybody has to have a shot. Opportunity has to be open to everybody. Not just some. We think our country succeeds when everybody has the chance to get a good education and learn new skills.

>>> This month, the u.S. National soccer team advanced in world cup qualifying, thanks in large part to a half dozen german-born players fathered by american soldiers in the military. Here is cnn george howell in the "black in america" report. 
>> Reporter: This year marks the 25th anniversary of that famous phrase, but the impact of the u.S. Military build-up in germany during the cold war is still being felt today in an unlikely place. The soccer field. A half dozen sons of american soldiers stationed in germany, born to german mothers have elected to play for the u.S. National soccer team rather than germany's in the last few years. R some, this decision relates to their racial identity. Danny williams and the other five players all had african-american fathers. What does it mean to be bi-racial in germany, versus is being biracial in the united states? 
>> When people look at me they know I'm not 100% german. I feel more american than german. 
>> Reporter: He was the first to join the american soccer team. 
>> I'm different, when you see me, the german people, I'm a different guy, I'm mixed. 
>> Reporter: Unlike williams, whose american father raised him in germany, jones grew up in a single parent household. 
>> My mom and him, when I was young, went separate ways, and for me it was hard to grow up with no dad. 
>> Reporter: But since playing for the u.S., Jones has started up his relationship with his father, after scoring his first goal for the stars stripes, jones performed a tribute for his father. 
>> Reporter: You gave a salute? 
>> Yes, we called me after the game, saying thank you, your mother, father, everybody sees it, proud of you.

>>> Bottom of the hour now, welcome back, everyone. I'm randi kaye. 
>> I'm victor blackwell. Thank you for starting your morning with us. Here's five stories we're watching this morning. 
>>> Number one, the lights are starting to come back on for some families in the northeast, but not fast enough for others. Five days after the storm, more than 2.5 million customers are without power across 15 states ask d.C. It could be another week before power is fully restored while people have been lining up for hours just trying to get gas. Many gas stations are still out of commission. 
>>> And new york mayor michael bloomberg has canceled the new york marathon for the first time in its 42-year history. People were outraged by his earlier decision to go on with the aftermath of the storm. It wouldn't divert resources but says in a statement that the race had become controversial and divisive. 
>>> Number three, we're down to the last three days before the election. President obama and mitt romney campaigning across several key states this weekend. Both candidates will be in colorado, ohio, iowa and virginia while romney also makes some stops in pennsylvania and new hampshire. 
>>> Number four, it's taking some voters up to four hours to cast their ballots in florida. One of the election's most crucial swing states. Remember early voting in the sunshine state started a week later than it did in '08 because of a new state law. The republican state legislature reduced the number of early voting days from 14 to 8. 
>>> And number five, gas prices are falling across the u.S. Aaa reporting the national average dropped just over a penny to $3.48 a gallon. That is the 23rd consecutive decline. Prices are lowest in south carolina, where the average gallon will cost you $3.17. 
>>> The images of sandy's destruction have been striking. The economic losses devastating. In addition to the homes lost because of the hur the more than 20,000 flights were canceled across north america. Fedex tells "new york times" it has been struggling to find gas for its delivery trucks. The advertising company have lost $5 million because of tv disruptions and movie theaters took in only $3,000, $3,000 total in the city. The monday before that it took in $500,000. Here to talk more about the economic impact of the storm is trish regan in new york. Trish is the host of "street smart" on bloomberg television. Trish, thanks for being with us. It seems like economists have been torn on the impact of this storm. Some say this will even out because there will be so much construction for the rebuilding effort. Others say that won't be enough. It won't work for waitresses who are waiting in restaurants. How do you see this? 

[00:02:50]


>> I think the latter there, victor. Good morning. I think the reality is that there is still going to be aot that is lost from this economy. Initial estimates right now are 30, 40, some as high as $50 billion that could be lost as a result of all of this storm activity. However, and this is what you're referring to. Some economists are saing, well, you might see a pick up in building activity and homes need to be rebuilt and construction projects need to resume and, thus, you could see another $30 billion potential in construction that happens after the fact. Nonetheless, as you point out, you're left with all those economic costs in the immediate term. All those waitresses not waiting tablesight now are not making tips. The movie theater that was closed in new york taking in, as you point out, $3,000 in revenue. That stuff has a snowballing effect. What it does, victor, it creates an immediately slow down in the economy that hopefully, at some point, starts to turn around. But those losses are very real and they t time to dig out from under. As far as the construction goes, yes, we will probably see more construction, but think about all the construction projects that have been put on halt. Think about all the buildings in downtown manhattan that they were building for new apartment buildings that they can't work on right now because they have to deal with flooding issues and the cleanup. Granted, people will come in and they will make money on the cleanup. But the overall net probably leaves the economy in more of a loss than a gain. 
>> You talked about how slow this has been going. Trish, the recovery has been slow and hard fought from the start. And you add sandy and all that has been interrupted. Some economists say that this could mean a half percent hit to gdp. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> How long will we see and feel the impact of this storm? 

[00:04:51]


>> Depends on how quickly we can start to turn around. I think they're absolutely right. We will see an impact to gdp. The last thing we need, victor, as this economy is in a very, very fragile state. The good news here is typically when you have an event like this, things do turn around. It's not like the massive financial deleveraging process that we've been going through as an economy overall since 2008. That's a very different systematic problem. Right now we're dealing with a temporarily halt which should then result in more spending after the fact. But that doesn't change the fact, victor, that this is going to be a very difficult time. You know, this is really the last thing this economy needs right now as it's trying to mend itself. 
>> We just got that job's report on friday. 171,000 jobs added. The lab department said the impact of sandy was not factored into that calculation. What do you think we'll see moving into the november numbers and december numbers because of the closed businesses? Are are we looking at, you know, a loss of jobs? Are we looking at justeven? 
>> We are adding jobs to this economy. 171,000, when I heard that number, it nearly knocked me off my feet because I was looking for more in the vicinity of what most economists were anticipating, around 123. That was a big number. As you pointed out, you are absolutely right, it did not factor in sandy because that was last month's number. What have you done for me lately and, clearly, sandy will have an impact. You know, it's to be determined because don't forget this is part of the country we're talking about, not the entire country. Part of the country, of course, being affected. There will be some jobs added. For example, in construction and cleanup. But, the retail sector, the services jobs when you think of waitresses and waiters at restaurants here. Some of those more service oriented industries, those are going to feel the pain. So, netnet, again, it's not going to be good, but it's not going to be as awful because you will see some jobs being added for construction.

>> there has been a series of extreme weather incidents. Anyone that's not a political statement, that is a factual statement. Anyone who says that there's not a dramatic change in weather patterns, I think is denying reality. 

[00:11:43]


>>> There may be denial over what caused hurricane sandy, but no denying its effect. Absolute devastation. The storm surge that battered the jersey shore in lower manhattan was dramatic, but climate scientists say, get ready. There are more sandys sure to . 
>>> What is also sure to come is more bitter fighting over climate change. Mitt romney drew a laugh at the national convention in august when he said this. 
>> President obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oces, and heal the planet. 
>> Former president bill clinton hit back at those comments this week. 
>> He ridiculed the president, ridiculed the president for his efforts to fight global warming aeficial ways. He said, oh, you're going to turn back the seas. And my part of america, we would like it if someone could have done that yesterday. 
>> Bloomberg business week had its own so subtle message to nay sayers featuring this cover story and in a surprise move michael bloomberg endorsed president obama thursday saying the president is a strong leader on global climate change. Professor of geosciences at princeton university. He has been studying climate science for three decades now. Good morning. Thank you for being here. You live in lower manhattan. You saw the storm's devastation first hand. Were you surprised by sandy's magnitude? , Of course, I was surprised. Even though I do this kind of work professionally. Sandy was not caused by global warming, but it was made worse. Believe me, it's no laughing matter. This situation is going to get worse as long as the world continues to warm and the world is going to continue to warm as long as we keep burning primarily coal oil and natural gas for energy. That's putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. That's pumping up th temperature of the earth and causing the seas to rise. 

[00:14:04]


>> Let's talk specifically about manmade climate change. How much do you blame that? 
>> Climate change, as I said, didn't cause sandy, but it made it worse. Climate changed caused, for instance, the sea level at new york's battery to be a foot higher than it was a century ago. That made the storm surge worse, that increased the flooding of the subways. They have brought the seas to the point where they knocked out electricity. I was without electricity for the last four days. In fact, only at 4:30 this morning did my electricity and heat go on for the first time. So, we're in a situation where we haven't been prepared. What we've got to do is cut emissions to slow the warming well, at the same time being smarter about defending ourselves from t rising sea. 
>> We hear so much about sea ice and just over the past 30 years, 1.3 million square miles of that arctic sea ice has melted. If you take a look here, that's about 42% of the lower 48% of the u.S. States. How soon could we see all that arctic ice gone, do you think, and what are the implications of something like that happening? 
>> Always be arctic ice in the winter, but summertic ice which was projected to more or less disappear by the end of the century actually may disappear some time within the next few decades. We don't, we aren't sure what the implications of that are for storm patterns, but there is a theory that actually sandy's trajectory towards the unite states was partly determined by the fact that sea ice had disappeared early this summer and that caused what is called a blocking high to steer the storm right in our direction. As I said, that speculation we're going to have to learn more about it and what we're sure of, it looks like the arctic is going to open up to shipping, for instance. A lot of geo political implications and a lot more exploitation of resources up there which can have both positive and negative effects, for instance, destroying the wild aspect of the arctic as a nal eco system. 

[00:16:04]


>> New york city is a city shaped by water, built on water, it is an island. 520 miles of coastline. It is very vulnerable. On top of that, the city was designed before the sea levels rose a foot. You've actually been warning, from what I understand, city officials for years about this and what might happen in terms of something like sandy. So, what kind of response did you get? I'm just curious. 
>> In new york city mayor bloomberg and governor cuomo, a lot of talk about protecting the city from storms like this. But, unfortunately, the action has fallen far shof the talk. For instance, while some simple measures had been taken over the last few decades, there were still subway entrances which were too low and which, therefore, the storm surge was able to go down and swamp the subways and stop the system. The electoral power plants, for instance, it one feeding my house, the distribution stations were down b the river instead of up in safe territory where they should have been moved. This is an old city and a lot of infrastructure was prepared before sea level rose. But, hey, we're in a new world. Sea level is rising. It's not going to stop for quite a while, even if we ged the emissions under control. We have to redesign the city to be more habitable in a warming world. That's not just for new york, that's everywhere along the coast worldwide. 
>> Yeah, there was some talk about levees. Would levees help city like new york city? 
>> There are two ideas. One is a storm barrier, of the sort they have in london on it the thes which is raised into place every time there is a storm threat. It is expensive, it would cost about $7 billion, I understand. It is doable and I think the discussion needs to begin in a serious way about planning and see figure we really need it. I think it actually is probably a wise idea. Over the longer term we have a bigger problem if one or both of the polar ice sheets start to disintegrate faster, it could be we need a permanent sea wall whether than just a temporary storm barrier. A lot of things that could be done cheap, easy and started right away like ng the subway entrances and moving the electoral sm from the water. Less talk from our political LEADers AND MORE ACTION.

>> You actually voted this way in early voting in '08 in florida? 
>> Yeah. In 2008 I was living in jacksonville at the time, and i waited in line, and it only took about an hour, and I thought an hour in line. This is forever. 
>> Nothing like this. 
>> Nothing like this where people are waiting this long. 
>> We know there's been a lot of issues, a lot of talk about this whole early voting situation. The republican-dominated state legislature, you may recall, reduces the number of early voting days from 14 to 8 so that could be one reason why these lines are really, really getting long, and obviously the republican governor there is taking a lot of heat for that, and some of his critics have said it's a push by gop to lower the voter turnout. 
>> Yeah. 
>> So it's interesting. 
>> I don't think this conversation will end on election day. 
>> We'll actually be talking more about it with john zarella who is there with those voters, and we'll talk with him coming up in the 9:00 hour here, 9:00 eastern. All right.

=======================================================

>> Good morning, everyone. Kaye. Nd I'm victor blackwell. It's 8:00 on the east coast. Acout west. Thanks store starting your day with us. 
>> We start this morning with politics and the countdown to election day. There are just three days left, and that means the candidates are going to be busy. This map shows the final stretch for the president. It means six swing states. Mitt romney trying to hit eight states in his final push. That includes a stop in new hampshire this morning, and we'll take you there live in our next hour. We've got correspondents spread throughout the battleground states to bring you the latest on the election and the final push for both the candidates. 
>> Now, one of the states where both candidates will be making several stops, ohio. You knew that was coming. Cnn's white house correspondent dan lothian is in mentor, ohio where president obama will be campaigning later this morning. Dan, the crowds for 2012 have not been as big as the 2008 crowds. Big turnout expected for his last campaign weekend though? 
>> Reporter: Oh, definitely. I mean, the white house says and the campaign rather says that the president has been facing in these recent days some fired up supporters. They expect the same to happen here in ohio today. We've been talking so much about the big push in the battleground states, but ohio being the most important, the president made three stops here yesterd he'll be making two events or two stops in this state today, returning here again tomorrow. The campaign saying that the reason that they are making this big push here is not because they are concerned at all about losing ohio but because they believe that this is ay important state, and the big pitch from the president has been the auto industry and the bailout. The president talking about how his policies have helped to save a lot of jobs here and how mitt romney's vision is -- will only hurt the people of ohio saying that criticism from mitt romney is just massaging the truth. But the -- the president even beyond just this message the auto industry is trying to draw a sharp contrast between his policies and the vision of mitt romney saying that it all boils down to the issue of trust. 

[00:02:17]


>> The thing is here, us a make this choice, us a talk to your friends, your neighbors. You've got to remind them one of the things you're choosing is -- is about an issue of trust. After four years as prfsident you know me. You -- you may not agree with every decision I've made. You may be frustrated sometimes at the pace of change, but you know that I say I mean and i mean what I say. 
>> Reporter: And it's not just the president alone campaigning here in the state of ohio. The first lady will be here today, also jill biden will be campaigning here, and then some big-time entertainers, stevie wonder, will.I.Am also here in the state and other battleground states. We hear that katy perry will be performing at one event supporting the president so a big push, a very hard push as we count down to election day. Victor? 
>> Dan lothian in ohio, thank you. 
>> Long links and a close race. That about sums up the race in ida. This new nbc news/"wall street journal"/marist poll shows president obama with a two-point lead over mitt romney. That is well within the margin of victory, so basically we'll call it a dead heat, but when you go beyond the polls you see voters waiting for hours so they can cast their votes. There's been a lot of controversy over early voting in florida this year. It started a week ago and early voting ends day. Our john zarella joins me now from plantation, florida. John, good morning. I understandhat you voted yesterday. How long did you have to wait? 
>> Reporter: Yeah, you know, i did, and I'm really glad I voted yesterday because when I vot the line here was just back over there. I think, dominic, you can give them a shot of where I was standing, and it took me from the time I got in line to the me I walked out the door, two hours and ten minutes to vote, so if you look at where the line is now, which winds all the way around and down there, it's, we estimate, about 700 deep, and maybe about a four-hour wait for the folks to vote. It's nice out and a festive atmosphere. Everybody is happy. If it gets hotter during the day that attitude and atmosphere might change a little bit, randi. We expect the long lines to last all day today because this is, as you mentioned, the last day of early voting in florida. 

[00:04:51]


>> I hope there are plenty of coffee and doughnuts to go around there. There was this effort, talked about it this morning, to get the early voting extended, but that's now out the window completely. 
>> Reporter: Does not look like there's any chance that will happen. Inally four years ago, 14 days, down to 8 days today, so only one sunday, and traditionally on sunday a lot of the black churches get all their people to come out and vote and that's not going to happen because this is the second sunday they would normally have is not there, and the governor, from what we understand, is not inclined at all to -- to extend early voting, so we do expect to see lines like this, and the other part of that is a lot of people are saying that because of the shortened time for early voting that on election day we're likely to see these kinds lines as well which could mean that people will be in line well past the time the polls close at 7:00 eastern time here on the east coast. 
>> You know, just a moment ago in my lead-in in to you we showed this nbc poll with a short two-point lead for the president there. Are we going to see any chance of a repeat of the 2000 election in florida? 
>> Reporter: We hope not. 537 votes. I don't thanybody will ever in our lifetime see anything like that. Famous last words, right? 
>> Exactly. 
>> Reporter: But the reality is, you know, we had the butterfly ballot back in 2000. We had the hanging chads, a lot has changed since then, but quite frankly, you know, there are always some sort of glitches and issues. Hopefully nothing of the magnitude like that back in 2000, but clearly this is virtually a dead heat in florida, as it was back in 2000. Again, remember, four years ago, the president obama, he only won, you know, 51-48 so it was a slim margin even back then when he had all of that tremendous momentum behind him four years ago. So tight, tighting tight race here in florida. 

[00:06:55]


>> John zarella we'll check back with you in our next hour and see how you're doing as well. 
>> Reporter: Sure. Thank you. 
>> Anderson cooper takes a look at the candidates' final push before the election in "america's choice 2012, countdown to election day." Be sure totune in tomorrow at 8:00 p.M. Eastern for that. 
>> Now to the latest on superstorm sandy. The lights are starting to come back on for some families in the northeast, but not fast enough for others. Five days after the storm more than 2.5 million customers are without power across 15 states and d.C., And the heartache is also growing for lots of families with the storm now blamed for 106 deaths in the u.S. Overall, it's left 175 people dead, including the victims in canada and the caribbean. Meanwhile, national guard troops are continuing to search and rescue. They are also helping to clear debris so crews can get the power back on and deliver food to people who need it. In new york, after a lot of criticism, mayor michael bloomberg cancelled the new york city marathon for the first time in 42 years. It's never been cancelled. It was set to take place tomorrow. No decision yet on whether it will be rescheduled. And at noon eastern, gas line will start being rationed in 12 counties in new jersey. To cut down on long lines at gas stations, people can only buy gas on odd-numbered days like today if their license plates end in an odd number. Same goes for the even days. 
>> Yeah. It's -- it's a mess. I mean, they got to do something, right, to make it a little bit easier for folks to get gas line. 
>> More time getting gas than waiting to vote. 
>> A lot of people wereworried they would run out of gas in the gas line. Much more ahead for you this hour. 
>> Yeah. Here's what's coming up. 

[00:08:58]


>> Regardless of the winner here, your health care, contraception and marriage are at stake. We'll break down the state ballot battles. 
>>> Sandy has brought devastation across the northeast, but it may also have been the october surprise. We have the latest on the recovery efforts and sandy's impact on the election. 
>>> Baleground new hampshire. Three days left, and now it's all about the ground game. We'll take to you one of the contentious swing states. Bob... Oh, hey alex. Just picking up some, brochures, posters copies of my acceptance speech. Great! It's always good to have a backup plan, in case I get hit by a meteor. Wow, your hair looks great.

>>> I cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state and for the people of our state, and I heard it on the phone ersations with him and I was able to witness it today personally. 
>> I think the people of new jersey recognize that he has put his heart and soul into making sure that the people of new jersey bounce back even stronger than before. 
>> Talk about stran bedfellows, president obama and governor chris christie now united in crisis. They have been working closely to clean up new jersey after superstorm sandy left parts of the state in ruins, but christie's been far from friendly with the presiden in the past, acting as one of mitt romney's most outspoken attack dogs, slamming the president's leadership in stump speeches and campaign rallies all year. Listen to christie just two weeks ago. 
>> He never ran anything in his life so the president doesn't know how to lead. We watch what he's been like for the past four years. He's like a man wandering around a dark room, hand up against the wall, clutching for the light switch of leadership, and he just can't find it, and he won't find itn the next 18 days! 
>> Apparently governor christie thinks the governor has found it. Cnn contributors errol lewis and eric join us. I want to read a tweet you posted not too long ago. It's so cute that obama is trying t look like he's in charge with the hurricane. Someone should ask the libyan consulate for a comment. Do you still stand by this, and what do you make of this new relationship between the president and the governor? 
>> Yeah, absolutely I stand by the tweet. You know, I think it's a little bit farcical and the media to ask as if there's something the president can do. A massive storm bearing down on the coast. I wish they had opinion in the situation room the whole time the ambassador was being dragged through the streets of benghazi instead of going to las vegas. But on the substance of president and chris christie. This is what politicians do. They go out on the campaign trail and bash each other and show up together when they actually have to get down to work and they tend to work. Even, for example, harry reid, said there's no way the democrats would ever help mitt romney pass his agenda if he's president, of course they would. There's a difference between talking trash on the campaign trail and actually getting down to business. 

[00:15:12]


>> Errol, let's go to you on this. Eric says there's nothing the president can really do but governor christie says he's actually watching this in person, that the president is taking charge. 
>> I would beg to differ. I mean, we've seen botched federal responses to natural disasters before. This, whatever else you want to say about it, has not been a botched response. There are hundreds of thousands of people without power, and to see the presint get there and sort of publicly tell all of his cabinet members I want all phone calls from local officials returned within 15 minutes, spare no expense, cut through any red tape, change the laws, if you have to, but make sure the aid gets there on time. Several of his cabinet members, janet napolitano has been here on the ground. Everybody that I've been reporting on has said, down at the local level, that this makes a big difference. It gets the -- it gets the bureaucracy moving. If he did nothing else, he certainly made that happen. 
>> Will this, errol, have any real effect as we go into tuesday and actually as early voting continues considering that chris chri delivered the keynote address at mitt romney's convention? Is there,going to turn into a real numbers change for the president? 
>> There may be a slight advantage to the president, but it won't be because chris christie, you know, hugged him and had nice things to say about him. It will be because a lot of people will not be voting. There are a lot of people who are just going to be out of it. Here in new york, all up and down the coast of new jersey, there are going to be a lot of people with much, much more on their minds than anything related to casting a vote. I think depending on where you're talking about, in new york city as least, these have been some of the most conservative precincts in the city, just completely devastated and unlikely to be casting any votes for congress or anything else. 
>> Eric, what do you hink? Do you think that there is a political benefit to the way that the president and governor romney have handled the aftermath, the response to superstorm sandy? 
>> You know, I'm kind of the mindset that it's probably neutral. Errol is right that the areas that were devastated in new york, a lot of them are republican, but new york and new jersey were going to go for barack obama anyway, and delaware as well. Much of the areas that were hit are going to go for the president anyway. My question is really more academic than partisan. I do wonder given that the philadelphia area there was also some power outages and gas delays, is that going to impact the philadelphia turnout for the president and help mitt romney in pennsylvania which I've always thought, including today, I'm not really sure even with this push in there if mitt romney is going to win, maybe. It's all going to be at the margins if it helps or hurt anybody, even in a tight race I'm not so sure it's going to matter very much.

>>> Welcome back, everyone. 22 minutes past the hour now. Unlike much of the rest of the country, new hampshire's economy is humming along and unemployment is at less than 6%, so when president obama and mitt romney visit the battleground state, their stump speeches tend to include promises of more job creation. Our david mattingly visited two small businesses there to see what their executives think about the candidates' proposals. 
>> Reporter: Randi, victor, the unemployment rate in this critical battleground state is under 6% and well under the national average, so when it comes to campaign promises about creating jobs, businesses here say leave that to the professionals. Two new hampshire small businesses that found a way to beat the recession. One is a free-wheeling tech company. Producing codes that makes e-mail and the internet work tter. The other has been in business for five generatio. 
>> High carbon steel photograph needles. 
>> Reporter: Manufacturing metal pins for everything from antique phonographs to the military. 
>> These are ping that go into the ammunition boxes for the u.S. Government. 
>> Reporter: In tough times they both found ways to create new jobs. What every candidate talks about they do. Is there anything miss in what they are saying about creating jobs? 
>> I don't want to be cynical but people politicians don't create jobs, it's orgizations and people that create different ideas and they go and they service customers. 
>> Reporter: Ceo jeremy hickox went from 53 employees in 2010 to 170 today. Surprisingly I find campaign promises of job growth falling short amongst some employees. 
>> Government doesn't create jobs, right, and I think that's why trying to think about too much about, hey, we're going to pick a business person or someone with a lot of job creation experience, that doesn't really tell me much. 

[00:23:43]


>> Reporter: Rebounding from layoffs in 2008, this family-owned business now employs 36 people, adding six in just the last two months. Smarter, more skilled workers. Those are the promises these new hampshire voters want to hear most. 
>> It's hard for us to find new help. We have plenty of work, you know, tons of hours. It's hard to get new young people in here. 
>> Repr: And after almost a year of non-stop campaigning on job creation plans, there's no complete agreement on which candidate can deliver. Just a show of hands, how many are voting for romney. How many are voting for obama? And one undecided. 
>> Reporter: One vote apart and one undecided. That's pretty close to how recent polls are showing this race in new hampshire. Too close to call. Randi, victor? 
>> David mattingly, thank you very much. 
>> Interesting to hear the company say we have the jobs but we just need to fill them.

>>> Bottom of the hour now. Welcome back, everyone. I'm randi kaye. 
>> I'm victor blackingwell. Here are five stories we're watching. 
>> Three days left until the election, and that means candidates with campaigning hard in the swing states looking for every last vote. President obama has eight stops on his agenda from now until monday, including two sepate trips to ohio. Myth romney has six states on his travel plans, two stops each in ohio, iowa and colorado. 
>> It's been taking some voters up to four hours to cast their ballots in florida. You know, that's one of the most crucial swing states. Remember, early voting in florida started a week later than it did in 2008 because of a new state law. The republican state legislature reduced the number of early voting days from 14 to 8. There are 29 electoral votes up for grabs in florida. 
>>> The death toll from sandy has climbed to 106 people, and nearly half of those deaths are in new york. Nearly 2.7 people, 2.7 million people are without power for at least another day that. Number slowly going down as power crews work feverishly. Many people are desperate for fuel, heat and food. New jersey is now rationing gasoline to cut down on long lines. 
>> Story full four, its journey may have lacked the fanfare of "endeavour" but the space shuttle atlantis is finally home. "Atlantis"ade the 12-hour journey to the kennedy space center along with some special guests. The second man to walk on t moon buzz aldrin and the first female shuttle commander eileen collins. "Atlantis" flew 125 million miles in its 33 missions. 
>> And before you head to bed tonight, remember to turn your clocks bone hour. Daylight savings starts tomorrow morning at 2:00 a.M., So we get an extra hour of sleep. Hope you enjoy that one. 
>>> Let's go to long beach island, new jersey. Cnn's jim clancy is there. Jim, this area was devastated. The pictures show it. People still can't get to their homes. Are you seeing crews show up there this morning, to clean up, to get the power back up? 

[00:30:41]


>> Reporter: Let me give you a real quick update. We've got heavy equipment moving. They will be plowing sand. Remember, literally, thousands and thousands and thousands of tons of sand washed off the beach and swept across the island. They are going to be trying to clear roads today. We've seen contractors moving here almost non-stop. They are going to be trying to board up, to cross-brace a lot of the homes that are on pilings, you know, really in danger because all of the sand has washed away. The pilings are now very shallow. We've got health inspectors coming in as there's food that needs to be just cleared out of here. There's no refrigeration because there's no electricity. All of these fundamental problems trying to be addressed at the same time we've got the election coming up. There's some absentee balloting being done but very long lines for that, I understand. They are going to try to address that. The mayor, joe mancini will be holding a press conference here in a coupl hours time. They will be trying to address those problems. Many residents want to get back home but simply can't. Trying to do a lot of this without people on the islands so that trucks and everybody has access. It's going to be a very, very busy day in this communities and communities right up and down the new jersey shoreline. Back to you. 
>> A lot of work still to be done. Jim clancy live in long beach island, new jersey. Thank you. 
>>> It is a busy day on the campaign trail for mitt romney. He's got stops in new hampshire, iowa and colorado on the docket. We'll bring you some of his new hampshire stop live in our 9:00 eastern hour. The hairied pace of both campaigns highlights how close this race really is. Joining me now is barbara comstock, a member of the virginia statehouse and a senior adviser to the romney campaign. Barbara, good morning. Welcome. You're in cincinnati today, so why don't we start there in ohio. 
>> Yes a. 
>> A key swing state, a big state that either candidate needs. The autoworkers there. Here's mitt romney's pitch. 

[00:32:42]


>> Who will do more for the auto industry, not barack obama. Fact checkers concern his attacks on mitt romney are false. The truth, mitt romney has a plan to help the auto industry. He's supported by lee iacocca and the detroit news. Barack obama chrysler to italians who are going to build jeeps in china. 
>> I'm mitt romney and I approve this for a minute. 
>> Forget for a moment that general motors and chrysler have decried this ad as false or misleading but in the ad governor romney says he has a plan for the auto industry. I'm curious what that is and why we haven't heard much about it until now unl a week before the election. 
>> As ad itself says, lee iacocca and major executives support governor romney, and I'd point out people who were on the obama economic council are supporting mitt romney because he does have a plan on day one to turn this country around in terms of jobs. With the auto economy and everything else, you need to put people back to work, and on day one he's going to get the energy economy going and allow us to have the keystone pipeline open up, be to drill offshore in my home state of virginia so we can get those good jobs going, and then he is going to, you know, increase economic opportunity for everybody, so that's why he's having so many people, even people on the president's own economics council, are supporting mitt romney because he and paul ryan have a plan for day one to get jobs. I mean, this president -- 
>> I was asking you about the -- I was asking you specifically about the plan for the jobs for the auto industry, and I do want to mention, too, even chrysler's chief executive officer has debunked this ad. The jeeps will not be made in china. He said certainly not at the expense of the american workers. Christianler -- >>e said -- I wanted to clear that up. 

[00:34:46]


>> That's what the ad points out that that is -- that they are doing that. He obviously we want to have more cars made here. We want to have more trade. 
>> It's not a the expense of american jobs is the point. It's not at the expense -- 
>> there will be -- ll, this president has lost. There are fewer jobs today in all -- in pretty much every industry under this president. Unemployment has been stagnant. He said if we spend $1 trillion that we would have a 5.2% unemployment, and instead it went up this week, 7.9, higher than when the president came into office. The president has failed on all of his metrics. He said he'd turn the economy around with the $1 trillion. 
>> The last jobs report offered good and bad for both campaigns. The unemployment rate is up slightly, added about 171,000 jobs. We know where you stand on that, buin terms of you saying there are fewer people orking. In fact, our research shows 194,000 more people are working today than when the president took office in january 2009 so what do you say to that? 
>> Well, we know in order just to keep pace with population growth you need to have job growth o250,000 a month, and we have never -- we don't hit that with thi president and he has no plan except to spend more money and do all the things that have gotten us further into the ditch. He has not turned around the economy, and he said if he couldn't get the job done in four years, that it would be a one-term proposition. We absolutely agree, and joe biden said that, you know, the middle class has been buried, and certainly here in ohio we've seen, you know, where average income is going down. You have a great governor here in ohio. There were 30,000 people here at the ohio rally, governor, senator portman, and they are doing all these policies to turn around the economy. They need a partner in washington with mitt romania any who is going to work with your governor, with your senator, to do things that will get more jobs for ohio and get this economy turned around and get those people back to work instead of having a $1 trillion welfare economy that nobody is happy with. People want to go back to work. 

[00:36:53]


>> Let talk about your home state of virginia, coveted prize certainly for both candidates what. Makes the romney campaign think that they can capture virginia at this point? 
>> Well, are leading in virginia with independents, just like we are leading in ohio and everywhere, and in virginia we're very concerned about, first of all, the president's tax increases are going to hit our economy just like they are going to hit ohio very hard. Two-earner families are going to get hit hard and our small businesses will get hit hard. We have a big small tech industry and the tax increases will put our smalt businesses in jeopardy at the same time it -- 
>> let me interrupt you here -- virginia unemployment though is among the lowest in the country at 5.6%, so how will you combat that? 
>> Well, virginia's unemployment is low because we've observed what president obama didn't and did the absolute opposite. We cut nding. We cut taxes. We made jobs our number one focus which is why we're one of the number one places to do business, number one place for jobs, but, again, just like governor kasich and the folks here, we need a president who will work with us, not work against us, and that's exactly -- we can't aord all the taxes from obama care, from the president wants to increase taxes at the same time in virginia. He's going to cut up to 200,000 defense jobs which in virginia are a key thing, not just for our national security, but a key thing for our economy. 
>> Let's stick to taxes. Let's stick to taxes here because one of the center pieces of romney's economic plan is the tax rate change, including for the wealthier, the job creators, but a recent report from the non-partisan congressional research service found no correlation between the cuts in the top tax rates and economic growth. Congressl republicans railed against this report, as you're aware and under pressure the crs actually with drew it. Now on the surface that sounds pretty bad so I want to give you a chance to defend the party. Why did they basically kill this report? 

[00:38:57]


>> Listen, I'm not actually familiar with that report, but i know the reports that have said that the president's tax increases will cost us 700,000 -- 
>> let me -- this is a report -- this is a report from a non-partisan group saying that the -- 
>> which they with drew. mish McConnell's office said they had concerns -- they had concerns about methodology, that's coming from mitch McCONNELL'S OFFICE, CONCERNS Over language. Apparently they were using the language tax cuts for the rich so you can dispute the language but you can't dispute the findings. I'm just curious now that you know a little bit more about it what your take it on it. 
>> I know on capitol hill, i know the congressional research service well if they with drew that report they with drew it because they needeto go back and do more work on it and it was inappropriate, so I think that speaks for itself, but the national federation for independent businesses, the voice of small business throughout the country, has said the president's tax increases will cost us 7or 700,000 more lost jobs. We can't afford four more years of an obama economy that's not working, where you have people losing income on average of $4,500. He said he was going to decrease our health care premiums by 2,500. Now they have gone up by 3,000. That's a difference of $5,500. 
>> Okay. 
>> That's cog individuals -- 
>> let's just stick to the topic at hand there. I just want to -- 
>> well, take-home pay I think is the top number one topic for everybody in having a job. 
>> I just want to be clear though that the leaders at the crs said that they did not want to actually withdraw that report and it was apparently under pressure from the gop. 
>> Well, I think if they with drew it it speaks for itself. 
>> You're not fully familiar with the situation so maybe we'll have you back on and we can talk about it a little more. Barbara come stack, appreciate that. Thank you. 
>> It's not just the next president that's on the ballot this tuesday. Still ahead, I'll detail the controversial initiatives voters will weigh in on including health care and abortion and same-sex marriage. Hello!!!!

>>> As voters head to the polls across the country to choose the next president, they will also weigh in on a number of controversial ballot issues. Three of the biggest are health care, abortion and same-sex marriage. So let's talk about what's at stake and who is behind the funding. First, let's go to obama care. Look at the map. Voters in alabama, florida, wyoming and montana will decide if residents and businesses can be forced to participate in health care reform. If this initiative passes, businesses would not have to buy health insurance for their employees and people would not have to buy it for themselves. Another big issue in florida is abortion. It's already illegal to spend federal money on abortion. Amendment 6 would make it illegal to spend state dollars on abortion except in the cases of rape, incest or to save the life of a mother. Now, right now there is an effective ban on it but this would make it legal. Partisan groups have spent a lot of money on this up. On the left, planned parenthood has spent more than $3 million to dt it. On the right other politically active groups like the national right to life and the susan b. Anthony list have spent about the same amount. Third, it's same-sex marriage. Voters in maine and maryland and minnesota and washington state will either legalize it or ban it. Now, it's important to say that gay marriage has been on the ballot in 32 states so far. It has failed every time. Now where it's been legal it's been approved by the courts or the legislatures and in a cnn/orc poll in june, it found that a majority of americans support same-sex marriage rights reflecting a shift in public opinion over the past two decades and billionaire new york city mayor michael bloomberg has tapped into his personal fortune donating a quarter million dollars to support the cause, the legalization of marijuana in some states and the death penalty are also on the ballot in some states.

>> In the battleground state of wisconsin, volunteers for the romney and obama camps aren't easing up on their ground game, they are doubling down and knocking on more doors, making more phone calls to encourage as many of their supporters as possible to get to the polls on tuesday. Ted rowlands caught up with some volunteers. 
>> This is what the political ground game looks like in racine, wisconsin. Chelsea shields and add am grass are part of team romney and terry jackel is part of team obama. Each side is armed with addresses of people that support their candidate. Their job it s to meet them face to face. If nobody is home, leave a pamphlet. If somebody answers get them to vote. 
>> My name is tery. 
>> Hi, I'm chelsea. 
>> I hope I'm making a difference. I believe I am. 
>> Reporter: Both campaigns believe going door to door and making phone calls. 
>> Hi, my name is ben and I'm volunteering today for mitt romney. 
>> Reporter: Makes a big difference even though a lot of time the people answering the phone. 
>> Sometimes people just don't want to talk. 
>> No, okay. Thank you very much for your time. 
>> Reporter: Aren't in the mood to talk. 
>> It gets old after a while getting all the political calls, people at your door all the time, and it's one of those things you can understand their perspective. 
>> Reporter: 
>> While they may say they are upset they are getting contacted at the end of the day there's a higher possibility for them to vote on election day. 
>> Reporter: Historically it's the democrat who have had a better ground game in part because republicans are better coming out on election day. 
>> Both campaigns I think have realized if you don't have a real field operation in wisconsin you do so at your peril and would I love to say we have a ground game and they don't but they do. 
>> Reporter: According to a marquette poll released president obama is up in wisconsiby eight points over mitt romney among likely voters but when you look at the people who are both likely to vote and follow politics, that lead shrinks to only two. Both sides acknowledge that getting out the vote is crucial and a huge part of doing that is finding the volunteers willing to keep calling and knocking until the election. 

[00:48:35]


>> Is this your life now until a week from tomorrow? 
>> We're going to keep going up until the very end, keep making calls and doing doors unl the polls close. 
>> You're out there. I'm going to be out there more. 
>> Ted rowlands joins us now from racine, wisconsin. How is the race looking there? 
>> Reporter: We mentioned a poll by marquette university that had the president up eight points, a cnn poll released after that has the lead a little bit more narrow, within the margin of error. Both sides agree that this is a -- an election that could go either way. The state of wisconsin could go either way and the difrence will be who can get their base out to vote. 
>> Well, they both are certainly trying hard to do that. Ted rowlands thank you very much. 
>> Reporter: You bet.

>>> The heartache isreg for families across the northeast as sandy claims more lives. 
>> According to the latest numbers, the storm is blamed for 106 deaths in the u.S., And when you combine the deaths in america and canada and the caribbean, we're up to at least 175. Nick valencia joins us now for more on this. Nick, in terms of just the loss of life, which area was hit the hard nest. 
>> We have to remember, victor and randi, even before the superstorm made landfall in the united states, it was already a fatal storm t.Caused major damage in the caribbean, places like haiti, places like jamaica, even puerto rico. 67 deaths blamed there just in the caribbean alone, and when you fast forward and bring it to the united states, the two states that were affected the most, you guys know this, new york and neighboring new jersey, new york had about 48 deaths and new jersey 22, and that's just in those two states alone. 

[00:53:38]


>> So much concern as I was driving around up there this week covering this story. We hit upon a patch on the new jersey coast where a lot of people were concerned about leaks from natural gas, and you found actually another danger, right, carbon monoxide is another concern? 
>> As I was going down a list of those that were victims of superstorm sandy another thing that pointed out to me was the preventable deaths, more than a handful of victims diedom carbon monoxide poisoning. People like mark riffle, 51 and two others in pens pen. They had generators inside their homes, running in their garage, and they eventually died from inhaling those fumes, but as we marched up to the preparedness and officials were hosting the press conferences, we talked about getting the emergency preparedness kits ready, major evacuations, going to higher ground, things like the generators and the poisoning from carbon monoxide that didn't really get mentioned and certainly got overlooked by some of these people. 
>> All of these stories are tragic, but you know of one that's especially heartbreaking, a father and a daughter who stayed behind to protect their home. 
>> We hear these numbers, 106 deaths in the united states, but they are staggering numbers alone. It isn't until we start digging into the personal stories you really see how far the deaths resonate and the impact that they have. The tragic story of angela -- I'm sorry, angela and her father who stayed behind. What makes it more tragic, during tropical storm irene the family evacuated, left their house only for it to be looted. This time they made the decision to stick around. Their house was demolished and they were found in the remains of the rubble. Just a very tragic story. She was just 13 years old, described as a very lovable, likable kid. Her friends made a facebook page to dedicate to her and memory of her. It's a very sad story. 
>> All of them are sad, but that one especially. Nick valencia. Thanks so much.

>> And I'm victor blackwell. 
>> That makes it 6:00 a.M. Out west. Good to have you starting the day with us. 
>> Showing you now some pictures from portsmouth, new hampshire. Can u see ann romney there as she usually does getting ready in introducing her husband mitt romney. He is making his trek to many of the swing states, including new hampshire. That's going to be very interesting as we come down to the wire to hear what he has to say there in new hampshire today. 
>> In the minl days of the campaign, they just have the rallies at the airport to save time instead of driving to a location in town, have it right there on the tarmac, and you see the believe in america plane right behind the romneys. 
>> Mitt romney is certainly going to be busy, the president as well. Mitt romney is trying to hit eight states in his final push. That includes, of course, new hampshire and also pennsylvania which isn't one of the swing states, but he is certainly trying to -- to get it -- to get his campaign voice heard out there as well. Let's check in with jim acosta. He's our national political correspondent. He's on the ground there. Jim, give us your point of view from where you are. 
>> Reporter: Well, randi and victor, good morning. I think what we're going to see this weekend is basically what you're describing here the last couplef momen this is a swing state blitz. It's a final stage of this campaign where we're going to see the candidate barnstorming through just about every swing state you can think of, and we saw just a few minutes ago before mitt romney took this stage some of his surrogates out here, bobby jindal, john thune, kelly ayotte. That's also a part of what's happening this weekend. All of these surrogates, 100 different surrogates inside the republican party will be fanning out across a number of battleground states to bring the romney message. Started to hear that yest the president was talking about the jobs numbers yesterday, describing that in his words as real progress. Mitt romney is saying it's not good enough and that the country needs real change, and last night he laid into the president for something that the president said at one of his events yesterday when he said that people should be, quote, voting or said voting is, quote, the best revenge. Mitt romney took aim at that last night and said that in his mind voters should be voting for what's best for the country, and so you can hear the gop nominee is getting started out here, his first event as he'll be criss-crossing the country going from iowa to colorado and back to iowa before heading back east. 

[01:01:31]


>> Jim, stay there in just a second. Let's listen in a bit. 
>> Just go by and say look, let's talk this through a little bit, because, you see, president obama came into office with so many promises that he's fallen so far short and just remind them of some of the things that they may have forgotten. He said that he would be the post-partisan president but he's been the most partisan, dividing and demonizing. He said he would cut the deficit in half. He's doubled it. He said he would focus on jobs, instead he focused on obama care that kills job and said he'd bring health insurance down $2,500 a year, the cost of it for an average family. Anybody here have their insurance go down 2,500? 
>> No. 
>> As a matter of fact, the average is up $3,000 per family. Look, the preside said that he would work across the aisle, he would meet regularly with leaders in the republican party. Do you know how long it's been since he's met with the republican leader of the house or the senate on jobs or the economy or the deficit, since july he hasn't met with him. Look, he just has not been able to deliver on the promises he's made. Talk is cheap. Record is real and takes hard work, and he has not been able to accomplish it, and I actually have a record of accomplishment and that's why I'm running. As you know, I started a business. I actually helped turn around another business and helped turn ound the olympics and you may have heard I was governor next door in massachusetts, and there are a couple of democrats in massachusetts in my legislature. We have 85% democrats. We had a multi-billion dlar budget gap, but we didn't fight each other. We came together and looked for ways to solve the problems. We actually cut spending. We didn't just slow down the rate of growth. We cut spending, and then we cut taxes. We mate our state more attractive for job creators, and at the end of four years instead of a huge deficit we had a big surplus. Instead of losing jobs every month we were gaining jobs every month, and instead of higher taxes we had higher take home pay. That kind of bipartisanship has to finally be brought to washington and I will. Now the president has more promises but we know where his promises will lead, the same place as last time, not to jobs, not to reducing the deficit, not to lower health insurance costs. In fact, all those things will be worse off. I actually have not just a promise to make but also a plan to describe. I've got five things I'm going to do to make sure we get this economy going and get good jobs again, rising take home pay and rising home values, five things. One, we're going to take advantage of our oil, our coal, our gas and our renewables. Number two, we're going to get trade that works for us, and that mns opening up new markets for our goods so we can sell in latin america, in particular, and we'll crack down onaters like china when they cheat and steal jobs unfairly. Number three, we're going to make sure everybody has the kind of skills they need to training that actually gets them the jobs that they want and make sure we finally fix our schools. It's unacceptable that our schools are not the best in the world. I want to make sure we finally put our kids and their parents and the teachers first and the teachers union is going to have to go behind. Number four, we're going to do something that actually -- that actually has been spoken about for years but just not done, and that is we're going to cut federal spending. We're going to cap it, and we're going to finally get on track to a balanced budget. And number five, we're going to champion small business. We want to help small business grow and thrive. Look, the president wants to raise taxes on small business. I do not. I want to bring them down. The president's been adding more and more regulation. 

[01:05:45]


>> You've been listening there to mitt romney speaking, making another last push there in new hampshire. Let's bring in our jim acosta who is following mr. Romney along the trail. So jim, you heard him there. He did -- he went through his five-point plan again, not giving a whole lot of specifics but certainly trying to lay out what he would do if indeed he is elected come tuesday. 
>> That's right, randi. You know, at this point, it's hard to get all of those specifics out there. I mean, he has been hammering the five-point plan repeatedly for the last couple of weeks of this campaign, and I think by now his supporters probably know what those specifics are, but you're right. I mean, he is laying out his agenda for his first 100 days in office, you might say, but randi, I have to tell you, one of the things we picked up here on the campaign trail in the last couple of days, mitt romney has really gone after what he believes is a weakness in the obama campaign strategy. The romney campaign believes that president obama, and they are making the case is, trying to make thecase, that president obama has sort of forgotten his mandate for when he came into office, that he was supposed to bring about this era of post-partisanship going back to barack obama's speech back in 2004 about, you know, there are no red states and blue states only the united states of america and the romney campaign has tried to make the case and mitt romney himself has tried to make the case in the last several years that barack obama has forgotten that mandate so you're hearing mitt romney trying to sound like the uniter in this race, and I was just talking to a senior romney advisers a few moments ago before mitt romney took the stage and he said that they feel like that tare the barack obama of this race because they are trying to unite this country and bring about a unifying theme. It's going to be up to the voters to decide whether or not that's the case, but interesting to note that the president is also starting to talk about those theme he started doing that yesterday. He's expected to do that throughout this weekend, and so it's going to be interesting to watch as both of these candidates sort of recalibrate these messages, you know, fine tune them, hone them for the final few days of this race, randi. 

[01:07:49]


>> The battle to be the great uniter certainly is -- is under way. Jim acosta, thank you very much. 
>> You can watch the rest of governor romney's rally on cnn.Com where they are streaming it live.

>>> Well, in a is one of the critical swing states that could go a long way to deciding this election. Voters are split in the latest polls, so who will win is anyone's guess in a state that has developed a reputation for voting problems, and this year voters are dealing with incredibly long lines now in an effort to avoid long lines on tuesday. We get more from our john zarella. 

[01:12:13]


>> Reporter: Call it the florida frenzy that gets people on their feet and singing. ?????? I will march in ?????? ?????? we'll march in ?????? 
>> Reporter: Some camped out just to say they could be first in the door. You would think it was an after-christmas sale. 
>> We've got two sleeping bags in case it gets cold. Got a blanket. 
>> Reporter: Some came by bus from churches and long lines not a deterrent. 
>> We waited 100 years to get here so what is three or four hours. 
>> Reporter: This is early voting in florida. Democrats make it a point to out big numbers in early voting, and they usually outnumber republicans, and if you want to avoid long lines on election day, we, you stand in long lines now. Waits up to five hours in some places. This may be the product of some residual subliminal long-lasting aftereffect from the 2000 election fiasco, remember, 537 votes. Bottom line, people here believe every vote counts, although there are some who don't trust the early voting stuff and simply won't do it. 
>> I've always felt if I voted on the day of the election, my vote would really be count, and I've heard of other scenarios in which people have voted early, and their vote doesn't get counted. 
>> Reporter: State election officials say about 9 million of florida's 19 million people will vote in this election. Roughly 40% of them before election day, either by early voting or absentee ballot. While early voting is democrat party strength, republicans traditionally do very well in absentee ballots. In miami-dade county, of the quarter million ballots mailed out 130,000 have been returned, sorted by precincts, and in some cases if there's no signature. 
>> The returns on absentee ballots have been somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 a day. 

[01:14:13]


>> Reporter: While all this is going on behind the scenes, workers at phone banks for both parties. 
>> Did you mail in your absentee ballot. 
>> Reporter: Are urging voters to get out there because both parties know that once again in florida this election could be too close to call. 
>> I bringn our john zarella now. Tonight is it for early voting in florida. Didn't some democrats and maybe a couple of non-partisan groups try to get that extended because of these lines? 
>> Reporter: Yeah, they did, because of what we're seeing here behind me, but the governor, rick scott, was not inclined to extend the days. You know, it was the legislature that cut the number of days from 14 down to 8, and -- and, of course, you see what the result is with eight days. I was in line yesterday, verdictors and I started right in this spot, and by e time i got around there and in the door it was twoours and ten minutes for me from here until I got done voting. Look how much longer the line is, you know, dominic, our camera man is panning around to give you an idea. We figure it's probably three to four-hour wait from th back of that line, three to four hours, folks in line are telling me, victor, that in fact that is right, the wait is three to four hours from the back of the line, and we expect to see this all the way through this evening. You know, I was talking to one party official who said, you know what, with the acrimonious nature of politics these days, it is so great to see people out in these lines, you know, staying, standing three to four hours to exercise their vote. At least that is one of the great things about, you know, the american political process and people actually coming out here to do that, but, you know, the polls are very, very close. As we know, the latest poll in florida, the president up 49-47, virtually a dead heat and it keeps flip-flopping back and forth so florida once again is going to be right there at the end of the day on tuesday night as one of the principal players most likely deciding the presidency. Victor? 

[01:16:25]


>> With all the jackets and blazers around you, it looks as if there's pretty mild weather. You know this time of year, having liz and david and worked in south florida myself. At any time it can be 90 degrees standing out there for five hours.

>>> The final unemployment report before the election released on friday, and job growth was stronger than expected, 171,000 jobs added in october, but while that number went higher, the unemployment rate went along with it. Now at 7.9%. Christine row monks is waving all the business news for us and its impact on the election. Good morning, christine. You have a big show coming up this morning. What do you have planned for it? 
>> Well, we're going to talk about that jobs report, how it's kind of the last piece of evidence that folks are going to have before they vote on tuesday, and, you know, what kind of vision for fixing the jobs market are you going to vote for? Are you going to vote for mitt romney or going to vote for barack obama's version of how to get the jobs market growing more robustly? 
>> How much of an impact do you think it's going to have? Just days away from the election could. It have an impact, do you think, at the polls? 
>> I think that now you've got both of these candidates in their closing arguments, right, and it comes down to who you think is going to be a better steward of jobs, the kind of jobs and jobs growth in this country going forward, and mitt romney is making this case that, look, I've done this before. I've started businesses. I know how businesses work and it is businesses who hire. It's the president who is saying look, give me four more years. I started this recovery. It hasn't been what we'd like but it takes more than four years to fix something that was so fundamentally broken in such a big, big, big calamity for the economy, and it comes down to which one of those visions you believe? Do you believe that the president deserves four more years to get the jobs market really going, or do you believe he doesn't have what it takes and mitt romney does? 
>> Is it too early to call what we're seeing a trend, do you think? 
>> When you look at the jobs, i think the trend is pretty solid. I mean, you look at jobs growth over the past too years and you've seen just enough, pretty much just enough to absorb new entrance into the work force this year and move forward for the jobs market but it's not strong enough to significantly lower the unemployment rate. 

[01:22:20]


>> Right. 
>> And the question is does this end get bert or does the fiscal cliff and political uncertainty and slowing in europe and slowing in china, are all of these things outside of our control going to conspire to keep jobs growth down, so it's a really interesting moment right now for the jobs market. 
>> Yeah. It certainly is. I also want to talk to you though about the storm which i know, of course, you're dealing with in new york, but as the lights come on, the next step certainly for a lot of families is trying to file an insurance claim once they get the power back on. 
>> Yeah. 
>> And gasoline to fill their cars and go and file the claims what. Seeing inters of that process? 
>> Well, the process is just beginning. You've got thousands and thousands of insurance adjustors right now who are meeting with homeowners who have fallen tree branches in their house, who have problems at their home, who have got flooding damage. All of this is beginning right now. You know, I'll tell you from a very personal point of view here, you know, I waited in line two hours here to get only five gallons of gas for a generator at my house. I have no power. People are trying to deal with the insurance part of this at the very same tim they are just trying to cope with tay to day. It's a very -- I don't know i the rest of the country really understands what a very hard and painful moment this is basically from virginia to massachusetts, but mostly in judge and in new york and connecticut, and so people need to make sure they keep very good records of every person you're talking to at your insurance company. Find your paperwork for your insurance policy. Look on the declarations page. We do know t governors of these states have said that you wiot have to pay a hurricane deductible. Your deductible will be what you think it is, and also be careful about the flooding issue because only 14% of the people in the northeast have flood insurance. When a hurricane comes and brings water you need flood insurance. That's an issue where you'll have to deal with fema and the federal government as well. 
>> So difficult because with all the flooded homes, a lot of people have lost their paperwork. They can't even find it, right. They have lost their homes. 

[01:24:20]


>> I know. 
>> Such a tough time certainly. Christine, thank you very much. We'll be sure t join you for your "bottom line" which starts at 9:30 a.M. Eastern time.

>> Steak. The term steak comes from the old Norse wo s-t-e-i-k, and it means any strip of meat or fish on a stick grilled over an open fire. Of course, the British were the ones who ate a ton of beef. The beefeaters were paid 24 pounds of beef a month to stand in front of Buckingham Palace, and there were also all sorts of beef eating clubs in London as well. Now, it turns out that tradition came over here to America in the 1700s. There were beefsteak houses. Now, why was it called beefsteak? Why not just steak? Well, we had other kinds of steaks here. We had buffalo steaks or venison steaks. So it was beefsteak for a long time. Finally, by the late 1800s, they were just called steaks, and they were called steakhouses. Steakhouses got very popular in the 1880s. Gage and Tollner, for example, Keens, et cetera. Well, it turns out that beef was transportable by then, because of the railroads that went to Chicago. They were processed and put into chilled cars and sent back East. So the steakhouses really became enormously popular, and still are today. Now, there's one last little thing. There's something called the sirloin flap meat. This is a cut people didn't know what to do with. They sold it as Bohemian steak, for example, or bavettes, from the French. But a few people caught on. There was a butcher shop in New Hampshire, they marinated these strips of steak, and sold them as grill candy. Well, steakhouses got hold this, and of course, steak tips are now on every steakhouse menu. So let's go into the kitchen with Bridget and figure out how to make a great version of grilled steakhouse steak tips. Okay, I need to get a little bit upset, because I've had... dozens of times people have come up to me and said, "The best recipe for steak tips is you throw some Italian salad dressing on top of them. Well, here's the problem. all, when you go to the supermarket and you buy a package and it says, "Steak tips," it often looks like this. These are not steak tips. 

[00:03:16]


>> No, they're not. 
>> This is probably from the round. You can tell because there's very little fat. The her thing you'll notice is th it's not a coarse texture. So you're starting off with something that is not steak tips, which means they're going to be tough and dry. And then you say, "Well, I can fix that, right? I can just pour the bottle of salad dressing." Well, the problem is this has a lot of acid in it. And guess what-- it doesn't soften or tenderize meat. It's just that maybe quarter inch on the outside that just gets mushy. You're not actually softening or tenderizing the interior, you're not adding that much flavor, and you have the wrong cut of meat. But besides that, it was a great start. So let's just forget about this idea. Forget about the bottled salad dressing and the wrong cut of meat, and start with the right cut of meat. 
>> Right. 
>> And the right method. 
>> That's right. And you know, we called a ton of different steakhouses asking them for their secret ingredient and method, and they all agreed that steak tips on the grill should be really well charred. But they all say that they should be marinated. And they offered up their secret key ingredients, and we tried them all. We tried marinades made with beer, but it made the meat really kind of bitter. And we also tried marinades made with things like ketchup and even barbecue sauce, but it tasted like it came from a smokehouse rather than a steakhouse. And we even tried one with cola, just like Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, whatever. And what we found was that it gave a nice char, because there's a lot of sugar in there, but it was just kind of messy, and didn't have a ton of flavor. So we're going to do it the right way with the right ingredients, okay? This is what you want to look for when you go to the supermarket to buy steak tips. You actually want to buy what's called a flap steak. And this is about two and a half pounds of flap meat or flap steak. And we're going to cut that up on our own in just a minute. So let's talk marinades. And we're going to start off with soy sauce. And this is a ird cup of soy sauce. Tons of sodium, so it's actually going to season the meat. This also has those glutamates in it, which are flavor compounds. Makes the meat taste even meatier. This is a third cup of vegetable oil. Now, a lot of marinades, they skip adding oil in there. And we actually found it was essential, because some of our ingredients, namely this one, garlic, is actually oil e. So in order for this marinade to taste like garlic, you've got to add the oil in there. And this is five cloves of minced garlic. One thing that we learned from those earlier tests was the barbecue sauce and the ketchup and even the cola have tons of sugar in it, so they gave a really nice char. So we're adding sugar ourselves. This is three tablespoons of dark brown sugar. Now, this is a tablespoon of tomateto We're going to give some body to this marinade. So we've got a tablespoon of paprika, and a little bit of heat. We've got a half a toon of black pepper, and a quarter teaspoon of cayenne. We're just going to whisk all this together. All right. Now I'm going to put this right into a zipperlock bag. Pour it right in there. So let's move back over here to the flap steak, or flap meat. This particular cut has these long muscle fibers, whic chewy. Some say just way too chewy. So the first thing that I want to do is break up those fibers. And just poke the meat, just prick it all over. We're shortening those fibers. And also, by doing this, we're going to allow for more surface area for that marinade to eke into the meat. All right, so I can't say it enough. If you want great steak tips, you've got to cut the meat yourself. So we're going to go for about two and a half inch pieces here. This one looks like it could be cut in thirds, lengthwise. And just cut right across. Good sharp knife makes all the difference in the world. Let's get these into that bag, seal it up. Burp the bag. And I just want to make sure that they're evenly coated. d I'm actually going to leave these in the bowl, just in case there might be a little hole in the bag. And I'm going to put these in the refrigerator. And they should sit in that marinade for at least two hours. But you can actually do this up to 24 hours in advance. All right, so we're just about ready to grill off these beef tips. Now, we've gone ahead and preheated the grill for about 15 minutes with all the burners on high, so it's good and hot. It's the perfect time for us to clean off the grill grate. Just a nice grill brush should take care of that. And now we also want to oil the grill grates. And this is going to help season the grates and prevent the food from sticking. So you can just take some paper towels, just dip it into attle bit of cooking oil, and just rub it backnd forth on those grates until they're nice and glossy. Let's go ahead and put the steak tips right on. Hear that good sizzle. 

[00:07:48]


>> Now, the grill is on high now? Is that the right... 
>> It is on high, that's right. So we're going to cook these for about eight to ten minutes with the lid closed. Of course I'm going to go in there and flip them over, make sure that they're nicely browned all over. But this is actually going to cook the steak tips until they're about 130, 135, which is actually medium. 
>> Now, I remember when we tested this and I went, "What?t? Steak at medium?" Because that would actually be kind of tough and dried out. Ain't true with steak tips, because they have very long muscle fibers. You catually see it in the meat. And when meat gets to 120, beef gets to 120, those fibers start to shrink in diameter about ten percent. When you get to 130, 135, they shrink in diameter about 25 percent, which is a lot more room, which means when you go to chew a steak tip at 130, 135, it's kind of medium, but actually it's much softer. It's better. So in this case-- it's a rare care-- we go to medium. 
>> That's right. 
>> And we'll be back in a few minutes when we get there. 
>> All right, so it's been about eight to ten minutes. I want to check out these steak tips. And they look good. All right, so I want to get a temp, make sure that it's between 130-135. Spot on. So these are ready to come off the grill. Throw them on a platter. All right, so that'll do it. Now we just have one last thing to do. We're going to tent these with foil, just for about five minutes, let them rest, so all those juices stay inside the meat 
>> I've counted them. They'd better all be there. 
>> All right, I promise there will be some left for you, but let's take them inside. 
>> Good. 
>> All right, Chris, you ready to dig into the steak tips? 
>> Yeah. You know, I'm one of your biggest fans. Right now? 
>> Great support... yeah, right now. Mm-hmm. Perfectly cooked, I might add. 
>> Mmm. 
>> Mmm. They're tender, they're juicy, a lot of flavor. The secret to great steak tips is actually starting with the right cut of meat. Don't buy those packages that are already cut, because they probably aren't sirloin flap meat, which is what you want. Got a coarse texture. You want to cut it up yourself. We did a marinade not with bottled salad dressing. We used a lot of glutamates-- soy sauce, because it has some salt in it, tomato paste, we had vegetable oil, garlic, a little bit of heat to it. Used a hot grill, eight to ten minutes. But cook it until it's about 130, 135, a lile more, and that actually gives you much more tender steak tips. So there you have it, from Cook's Country,the world's best, Bridget's favorite recipe, I think, fabulous grilled steak tips. It's been said many times that looks can be deceiving, and that's especially true when it comes to pepper mills. I've bought many, many pepper mills over the years because I liked the color, I liked the design. I got them home, and they just didn't grind much pepper. Now, one handed pepper mills is even worse. So here's what I want. I want one that delivers a lot of pepper, and I'd like it to be something you put on the counter and it looks okay. 

[00:10:50]


>> I can deliver a good pepper mill, Chris. I'm not sure I can deliver a beautiful pepper mill. I'm going to hand this one to you. 
>> I know this one. 
>> This is our benchmark pepper mill. That's the Unicorn Magnum. It's fabulous output, fabulous grind quality. 
>> And it's butt ugly. 
>> Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 
>> But iworks. 
>> This one was one of the one-handed pepper mills that we started out with. Let's just compare. We'll show how much pepper these give out. That one has a lot more output. 
>> It does a great job. 
>> This was crazy. It was hard to use, didn't have much output. We disqualified all the really weird ones like this one, and ended up with this lineup that you see here. There are five one-handed pepper mills. Price cap of $50. You can spend a lot more than that on one of these. know how expensive pepper mills get. But we weren't about to. These four are all electric. This one is manually operated. And really, what we wanted to do is compare the grind quality in the output to at black one that you just used, which is our benchmark. Great output, great grind quality. In ten seconds that'll put out a full teaspoon or two grams of pepper. And that's the testing that we did with all of these. Some of them we had a hard time with. We had a lot of different testers. Some men, some women, large hands, small hands. This one, for instance, had a power button on top that was fine for me, but some of the testers with smaller hands got thumb cramps after a while holding the power button. This one was easier fotesters to use. Why don't you try that? That one you just tip over. There's no power button. Just tip it, and not much happens. 
>> What? 
>> That's why we didn't like it that well. Very little output, you can see, because there's one little thing. It jams easily. And it's a little noisy. We actually had some people comparing the sound to a dentist drill. Put that one away. 
>> Well, yeah, it doesn't work. 
>> Ts big red one did very well. You try that one. It was comfortable for everyone to use. The output and the grind quality matched the unicorn magnum. But, you know, that one is also not really a thing of beauty. It's expensive at $40. And even though it did all of our testing on a single charge, you have to plug it in. And when push came to shove, we really decided we'd rather not plug in our pepper grinder. And that left us with the winner. This is the Chef'n Pepperball. I want you to try this one. 

[00:13:03]


>> The ugliest one of the lot, I noticed. 
>> It's the most interesting design. It's a little cartoonlike. Give it a shot. It took a little while to pump out a teaspoon of pepper-- about 45 seconds. compact, it's solid, it was easy for all of our testers to operate, and you will lwve this-- the price is right. It's $12. 
>> So once again, Adam has found a winner, the Chef'n Pepperball at a mere $12. And I guess I just have to repeat that saying, "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." Here's a little note from a viewer I think you'd appreciate. "My daughter, Abby, age six, is an early riser like me, and we often watch episodes of Cook's Country before Daddy wakes up." 
>> Aww. 
>> "e thinks Bridget and Julia are very nice to teach Chris how to cook." This is like the best cooking school in the world. What are you going to teach me today? 
>> Today we're going to make dill potato salad. 
>> You put in dill to potato salad, and I think that's how you get dill potato salad. Am I wrong? 
>> Sounds easy. 
>> So we put a little bit of dill in here, typical. 
>> Can't taste it. 
>> And there's not enough flavor And then we said, you know, "Let's get the grass clippings thing and put a whole bunch in." 
>> Yeah. Too much of that fresh dill really tastes bitter, and as you said, has that grass clippings texture. 
>> So more complicated than simply adding dill. 
>> It is. 
>> Of course. 
>> Of course it is. 
>> So we put those aside, okay. 
>> And we tried lots of things to add dill flavor, including dill pickles, the dill pickle juice, dill relish. But of course, those tasted more like pickles than fresh dill. So we went back to the real thing, which is freshly washed fresh dill. And what we're going to do is infuse it into various ingredients in the recipe to really bring that dill flavor forward. Because it's hard to get a clean, elegant dill flavor. Sos is some fresh dill that I washed in a salad spinner, which is a really great way to wash herbs. And what we're going to do is we're going to mince up some of the fronds and use them separately. But we're not going to throw out the stems. We're going to use those, too. So I want to take off enough fronds that so when I mince it up it measures about three tablespoons. And we're going to portion that out throughout the recipe. 

[00:15:04]


>> I think I would have rough chopped it and be done. 
>> I heard that about you. But you really don't want the stems in the final salad, because they're really just too tough. So this looks like a good amount. So when I chop it up, it'll be about three tablespoons. There's some fresh minced dill. And now I'm going to take the rest of these, and just give them a coarse chop to help release some of their flavor. And then we're going to use these separately. So I'll put those in a little bowl. So now we're going to start really infusing this dill flavor into the various ingredients. d the first one we're going to do is the vinegar. This is a quarter cup of white wine vinegar. And I'm going to take a tablespoon of this minced fresh dill, add it to the vinegar, and to really help it infuse into the vinegar I'm just going to heat it up and l it steep. And it'll take about 30 to 60 seconds in the microwave. Mmm, so here we have some of that hot dill vinegar. 
>> Whew! It's like intense aromatherapy. 
>> It is, it is. And we're going to set this aside and let it cool and really let that dill fuse itself into the vinegar. And noth the rest of t rough chopped stems and leaves, we're going to do is we're going to infuse the potato cooking water. And of course that will add some real serious elegant dill flavor to the potatoes without being overwhelming. So what we're going to do is make a little sashay. And this is just a coffee filter, and this is half a cup of that minced stuff. I'm going to add it to the coffee filter. 
>> Is this, like, our elegant cooking class? 
>> It is. 
>> You keep saying, "elegant," and "sashay," and using French words. 
>> Dill to me is sort of elegant, so maybe that's why. I'm just using a piece of twine, wrapping it around, and really just tightening it. And here we have a nice little sashay, perfect for the potato cooking water. Okay, so on to the potatoes. Of course, we tried different kinds of potatoes-- Russets, red potatoes. Russets are a little starchy, and red potato is a little too waxy for this, although it's good in some kinds of potato salad. We liked the Yukon Gold best. It's creamy, buttery, not so grainy as the Russets. 
>> Okay. 
>> So I'm just going to cut it into three quarter inch pieces. And here I'm going to add it to this pot of cold water. This is three pounds of potatoes. And to this we're going to add a of table salt. And of course, not to forget our dill sashay. So we're going to bring this to a boil. And once it reaches a boil, we're going to quickly turn it down so it's just a gentle simmer, and cook until the potatoes are done. And once it's boiling, that takes about eight to ten minutes. 

[00:17:23]


>> Of course, being a test kitchen, we tested putting them in boiling water versus starting them in cold water. Two things. Cold water gently cooks the potatoes all the way through, so the outside doesn't get overcooked, which is what happens in boiling water. And the total time from starting up the flame to the end is actually a little bit ter. So cold water, you get nice, evenly cooked potatoes, and the outsides don't disintegrate. 
>> That's right. 
>> There we go. 
>> It's time for a few questions from our viewers. The first is about gluten free flour. They want to know if they can substitute that for regular flour. Well, the answer is yes and no. There are two kinds of gluten free flours out there. Most of them use potato starch and tapioca starch as a base. One kind we tested was made with bean flours, and the other kind we tested predominately used rice flour. So there's the two basic kinds. Both of these worked just fine in cakes. We fried some foods with a coating. We found the rice flour style doesn't work that well. They're a little bit too crispy on the outside. But the bean flour was fine. And both of these worked just fine for thickening sauces. However, once we got into pie crusts and cookies, we h a problem. Look, these are gluten free flours. What's gluten? It provides structure. When you do a pie crust, you want structure. So you end up with a crust like this, which is so short and sandy, it just falls apart. It's pretty much a disaster. When you make cookies, you also need gluten to create rise and structure. And these spread much too much in the oven, pretty much a failure. So the answer is gluten free flours work in cakes. They're used to thicken sauces. The ones based on beans also good for coatings for fried foods. But stay away from cookies, and also stay rom pie crust. Our second question today is, "How can I prevent lopside cakes?" Well there's a very simple answer to that. Either your rack in your oven is inserted properly, or the entire oven is not balanced right. And there are usually adjustments on the feet. So you can take this simple level and put this on the rack, in the oven, just to see if the rack's level. If it's not, you can change it. Now, if your cake does come out like this, one layer, there is a last-minute solution to is, which is take a large serrated knife, and you can actually even it up on the top, and now you have a perfectly level cake. Our third question is, "Do angel food cakes really have to be cooled upside do I wondered about that, too. Seems kind of Of course, cake pans for angel food cakes have those three tripods on them for exactly that. The problem with angel food cakes is they have no chemical leavener. They separate whites, just use the whites, and beat them. This is a form of leavening that people used for a very long time, until we invented baking soda. So this cake was cooked upside down, and this cake was not. By the time this cools, the cake structure is so fragile, it completely collapses, and you get a cake that's t half as high. When you turn it upside down, it keeps the height of the cake, the structure's intact as it cools, and then finally sets, you turn it rightside up. So a few questions and a few answers from Cook's Country. 

[00:20:23]


>> All right, so these potatoes have been cooking for about eight to ten minutes. And the way to tell if they're tender is to take a dinner fork and try to insert it into the potato. You should feel some resistance, but you should be able to put the fork all the way through. So now, of course, I'm going to take out this sashay. But talking about elegant, these, funny looking, but they work really well. All right, so we're going drain the potatoes. All right, so what we're going to do now is take a little bit of our dill vinegar, two tablespoons of it, and drizzle it over the hot potatoes. Because, of course, as the potatoes cool, it'll soak up some of that vinegar flavor. Don't want to add all of it now. We want to save a little bit of that vinegar flavor for the end. That's evenly tossed. Now we're going toet these potatoes cool before we put the creamy dressing on, or else it'll soak the creamy dressing up and make it really pasty. And this should take about 30 minutes tohill in the refrigerator. All right, so here we have our cooled dill potatoes, and we're ready to toss them with some dressing. And here's half a cup of mayonnaise. And to this we're going to add a quarter cup of sour cream. And of course the rest of our dill vinegar. A little bit of Dijon. This is a tablespoon of Dijon. This is half a teaspoon salt, and a quarter teaspoon black pepper. And we're just going to mix this all together. All right, I'm going to put this over the potatoes. And here we have the fresh dill that we chopped at the beginning. This is about two tablespoons. And now we're going to add some scallions. And this is three fresh scallions. I'm just going to slice the greens nice and thinly, of course, using that claw with my non-cutting hand. >> So you don't slice your fingers nice and thinly? 
>> That's right. Add these to the potatoes. You really don't want to overtoss the potatoes. You want to make sure you have everything in the bowl. 
>> Okay. And then just mix it really gently. And that way the potatoes won't break down and turn to mush. Oh, thisooks delicious. All right. 
>> We're not going to have to let this sit, are we? 
>> I'm afraid we are. 

[00:22:23]


>> I don't see any plates and forks. I'm getting... 
>> I know, I know. Of course, you know, you can eat it warm if you want to, but I think it's better if it's chilled. 
>> That looks good. 
>> We're going to cover it with plastic wrap and put it back in the fridge and let it just chill for about 30 minutes. All right, so this potato salad has been chilling for about 30 minutes. I'm just going to take a little taste before you, just to check for seasoning, because of course, when you have a chilled salad, it loses a lot of its flavor as it sits. So you always want to reseason it with more salt and pepper before serving. 
>> Just leave some for me when you're tasting it, please. 
>> Mm-hmm. Mmm. 
>> Mmm. 
>> A little bit more salt, and a little bit more pepper. 
>> Julia grew up in a very frugal household, soy used to have potato salad for dinner with nothing else, right? 
>> I would happily eat potato salad for dinner. 
>> So would I, actually. 
>> Mmm. 
>> Mmm. This is perfectly cooked. 
>> And that dill flavor is so clean and clear. 
>> So there you have it, dill potato salad three ways. We used fresh dill in with the salad, we made our own vinegar with a quick stay in the microwave, and also a little sashay of dill stems and fronds with the boiling water to infuse the dill flavor into the potatoes. So from Cook's Country,a super dilly potato salad. You can get this recipe, you can get all of our recipes from this season, testings, tastings, you can actually watch selected episodes of our show.

Ns to sandy. Today, it's the tale of two remarkable lines. This one for folks just looking to fill up, as the shortage of gas for the northeast leads to rationing and a lot more. And these lines, folks lining up for early voting in florida. Some waiting for four hours to vote. So far more than 25 million icans cast ballots in 34 states and we're with louisiana residtial governor bobby jindal shall the storm after the storm. Jack welch on the d.C. Storm. And charlie rangel on the government's stormy response to sandy and how it reverberates. And first the very latest what's going on. Forget the dollars, it's sandy thing is turning dire, very dire, over 100 dead now with the count expected to go higher as rescue workers finally reach the flooded homes and no less than michael bloomberg predicting more bodies will be found. And president obama fema headquarters this morning, holding a conference call with the governors of new york, new jersey, and connecticut. And it's that '70s show in the garden state all over again. New jersey governor chris christie ordering odd-even rationing to ease the incredibly long lis. And odd numbers on the license plates, odd days and even numbers on the plates, in some 12 counties and governor mitt romney wrapping up an event in new hampshire and governor gin cal travelling with him. We'll talk to him in a few moments. Back to staten island and the storm after the storm. Those escaping death now pleading with city officials for food,water, and any help they can get. To anna kooiman on staten island now, anna? 
>> All right, well, good morning to you, neil. Yeah, you mentioned over 1 deaths at least caused by hurricane sandy and 22 of those right here on staten island at least. And as police are saying, those numbers could be going up, as they continue to uncover debris and potentially find more bodies. We're about 300 yards from the ocean or from the water here and I can tell you that there's pretty much not a home in this neighborhood that has not been completely destroyed by hurricane sandy. And residents are hoping for food and for water and for information, now, homeland security secretary janet napolitano did tour the area and promising resources and governor cuomo promising 100 million for relief forhe victims of hurricane sandy and this morning, announcing a temporary deployment of gas trucks to try to help with the shortage. But these residents, they are just absolutely desperate neil and I'm joined by a staten island resident. 

[00:02:59]


>> Good morning, how are you. 
>> Reporter: Tell me what it you've been dealing with because you're all fired up. 
>> Well, we're stuck on the avenue and a lot of other neighbors and we have no electricity, no phones, no cell phones, and what's happening, we can't get in touch with fema. We tried to put online applications and most of us do not have-- you have to go to neighbors. 
>> Reporter: And check the internet and you say I don't have internet. 
>> I don't have it and I've been chasing fema since yesterday. They told me to go to susan wagner, they said to go down by the beach hi found out supposed to be here at nine o'clock this morning and now they're on mount loretta. 
>> As you're chasing them around, what are you doing, how much gas do you have in your car. 
>> My generator is pumping water out of my home and other neighbors are trying to help so I have to wait online, one o'clock, two o'clock to get a few gallons if we're lucky. Appreciate if maybe officials would come down and hand out papers and tell us where you'll be tomorrow the next day so that we can get to you. And how do you feel like the response has been from the red cross? A couple of days ago they said they tried to get ten trucks onto the island and having a hard time because of the traffic issues. Have you felt like their response has been better in the last couple of days. 
>> Yesterday was the first day they came down with some food. And I didn't even know that to come back water and food and no one came to tell us they're here. 
>> That's the thing, it's having to be word of mouth as much as possible and saying to check twitter as well, but many people don't have a way to charge their cell phones even. We can tell you this tweet came out producer piping hot meals prepared by our partners, southern baptist and loaded on red cross trucks for staten island. Sou know, and that's the thing, you really are having to rely on old forms of communication, aren't you. 
>> Yes. And my other thing, I do work for the city and bloomberg has said that mandatory employees go to work, I can't, because i have a basement and other parts full of water and we may not get paid for it. How do you this to your people of your city I don't know if my husband has a job. And I need my income, but i need a day or two, that I have some time, we'll be calling our bank, and he says you may not be able to use it. How do you do this to us? It's supposed to be your city. 

[00:05:21]


>> Residents on staten island in particular has been upset about the new yorkity marathon that was going to be going on tomorrow. I can't count how many expletives, I've heard regarding that. How do you feel about the mayor bloomberg deciding to cancel it. 
>> Excellent the people need hotels to stay in and to have people come here for a marathon is just pathetic, pathetic. 
>> Initially his reasoning, it's been going on for decades and rallies and invigorates the community. Do younk there's something else that can be done to try to rally the community other than a marathon that you would suggest. 
>> I would suggest let's get everyone together come out and help and let the officials come out here and see how you're living before you wear about a marathon. Two, three weeks from now if possible, bot now. 
>> And I would like to say that we know the death toll is about 200, not the 19. 22 is what we have on record, but we can tell you as well. And thank you so much for your , good luck to you, we can tell you neil, a lot of residents tell us they think that number is much higher, back to you. 
>> Neil: Thank you, anna, very, very much. In fact mayor bloomberg intimated yesterday in a press statement in the one before he canceled the marathon. The reason we're going back to staten island, you might hear from officials at fema and the administration that everything is fine and teams are on the ground addressing it, the fact of the matter is it's not fine. Take a look at staten island, that's not fine and texting and tweeting relief reminders to folks who don't have internet and power, it shows the folly of what's going on here. So, when we were talking yesterday, as we were about officials of all stripes, and patting themselves on the back, it's little a mystery why so many of their constituents want to just give them a swift kick in the rear, including my next guest who just electrified folks when she was joining me last night on fox news. Back with us mary anne, a staten island resident. She's spoken to us about things to the mayor the fema officials are not seeing, are not reporting, are not grasping, how are things looking now, mary anne. 

[00:07:29]


>> Neil, it's just another day. Things don't look any better than they did yesterday. Finally, we see red cross in the field, but they're located there, try and walk through the debrisment and everything in the street to get there and it's impossible. And I believe that the death toll also is much higher than that I know for a fact in duncan hills my cousin lives there, the property, no one's every been there to look at it. And you know, they say, oh, listen to the news and do twitter and facebook and do that, there's no electricity. 
>> Neil: And mary anne, when you say no one has been able to look at the properties in other words, a lot of homes underwater or homes uplifted or moved and no way to get to them and the feeling, some fema folks are talking about, that the body count could be higher, right? 
>> I'll bet that the body count is higher, many areas in duncan hills that have not been touched. My cousin's there and she's been there since the day this happened in her home. No one, no one has been to her area, duncan hills in jefferson and called her this morning all she has the is cell phone to see if she's okay, I'm in my own devastation, but I couldn't get to her because of the flooding. 
>> Neil: Mary anne when we were chatting yesterday on staten island, I thought it was the rodney dangerfield of new york boroughs and I said that in a kind way, that it never gets the respect or attention it deserves, I this case you had among the worst storm damage anywhere. Does it bother you when you hear fema officials, administration officials commending each other for the great job they're doing? You don't seem to be seeing it? 
>> Well, you know what? I have to go back to what miss napolitano said from yesterday's interview, staten island is devastated and she didn't pat anybody on the back just said who was present. I think these politicians, they're all for themselves, they're living in tir houses during the storm in warm blankets and warm homes and they're just looking at each other, you know wh? It's the people who count, not the politicians, we have a right to speak, and to say what we want to say. And our politicians are suppose today back us and be there for us and I'll be honest with you, outside of a handful there isn't many and lost total respect for bloomberg, even though he canceled his marathon run, because common sense you take care of people in need befe you take care of yourself. 

[00:09:59]


>> Neil: Mary anne be well. I wish the best for you, as do our viewers, mary anne. We only show this, folks, to put thi in perspective. You're hearing glad-handing how it's under control and not a problem and that was the same kind of initial reaction we got after katrina, 2005, I'm not again, not comparing the gravity of the two events, but comparing the immediate initial reonse over the handling of this event and what I'm noting is the distinct difference in the coverage of 2005 versus this storm in 2012. And whether it's going to be an issue a few days from know you. 
>> It could be. What we're seeing now that the mayor's moment of let them eat cake, passed, the maraon. I've yet to see him in staten island. 
>> Neil: I don't know that he's been there yet. 
>> That's interesting. Doesn't that tell you everything that your two people you listened and other lady you interviewed said. The fact of the matter is, there is a political effort to run the clock out and with the media just like they've done on bya, just like they've hidden the truth about libya, it's t hide the truth about this and the service of obama's campaign of the let's get it straight. The president-- 
>> and the first to take camera crews to go to staten island and show it, fox was. And other media glom on. You can't ignore this, is there a disconnect? 
>> There's a disconnect. Politicians want to say everything is okay, the reality is quite different. My god, what were they going to do, have runners outn staten island stumbling over bodies? The fact that they don't care about ordinary people. And the president took ownership of this the other day when he said to governor christy, oh, 15 minutes, call me every 15 minutes, well, where is the federal response for these people? Why hasn't there been more done. People sitting in gas numbers for hours, and should go even and odd. How many years do you take to learn-- 
>> and we've heard now at that things are under control and officials tell us things are under control and we get more and more evidence, wait a minute, they're not under control. They're saying outside of those immediately impacted states people notice-- 

[00:12:12]


>> they see real people in lines, when they see it, that's my point about the mainstream media, but when they see it, going, hey, that's not well. And these people, and they're, you know, start thinking, wait a minute, this is supposed to be all solved. It raises doubt. So, I think that the more these stories get out, the less the president wanted to own this he should have stayed in the white house. Going out and campaigning six events and doing a fema thing. Hey, get something to somebody, that's the test. 
>> Neil: All right. Pat goodell, thank you so much. This situation is escalating not easing. Forget the cost the nearly 3 million folks without power and the fact that a body count could rise and maybe substantially. Again, it's not katrina 2005, but the reaction and the indifference and the cockiness on the part of officials who tell you all is under control, very, very similar. The only difference is this, the media treatment of it. MORE AFTER THIS. bowl of your neght Chicken Pot Pie Soup and it's so rich and creamy... is it really 100 calories? Let me put you on webcan... ...lean roasted chicken... and a creamy broth Mmm I can still see you.

>> phenomenal job. The good news the help has been coming. 
>> We had a good plan. 
>> It's been excellent. 
>> Well ecuted. 
>> Let me thank you and your entire team. 
>> A lot of criticism of fema back in the katrina days and today you hear nothing, but good things about fema. 
>> I want to thank craig fewgate, craig lives and breathes this stuff. 
>> All right, you know, I'm hearing all of this glad-handing and back slapping and I have a lot of friends, obviously, family in the metropolitan area around new york, a lot of friends very close ones in staten island. I knew what was going on. And I want you to juxtapose these guys high-fiving each other and this. 

[00:16:50]


>> Fed up, fed up, this line, that line. What are we? Is this america? 
>> We have no food. 
>> People trapped in here still. 
>> Don't have anything anywhere to go, I don't he no clothes. 
>> People here still hurting, still looking for people. I mean, it's crazy. 
>> Nothing's been done here. 
>> You can't do do anything. 
>> You'vot no gas, nothing. 
>> Years in my home and then lost it. 
>> And who are you going to believe, officials, saying everything is hunky-dory, we're on it or those who are right, knee deep, literally in the middle of it. Bobby jindal knows how to handle these crisis and handled more than a few of them gettinghelp, troops, immediately to those affected areas. Governor jindal joins me right now. Governor, they're not getting out there. There's a great disconnect between the help that we're told is on the way and there 
-- and the reality for a lot of these folks, what do you do? 
>> Well, neil, three things, obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to those who have been victimized by the storm, by hurricane sandy. Obviously the folks in louisiana know what it's been like, been through katrina, riisaac, if you're outside the impacted area ando and donate to your favorite charity, those involved in helping people to get back on their feet, we've experienced the faith-based groups and charity groups are so many times the first on the scene, very, very effective and a lot of times more effective than the governor and I agree with what you're saying earlier. The reality it's way too early for any elected leader to be declaring victory or scoring political points reality of helping the folks, getting fuel, water, people inheir homes, and power turned on. Way too early to be patting themselves on their backs. And many times the hardest work is the storm, in the aftermath. Communities devastated. It's different when it's more than a home or block, as you've been showing on your show and other shows, wn you've got an entire community devastated makes it that much harder it get back on their feet. Inside of trying to score political points, it's important to focus on helping people. My experience, our experience in louisiana, look bureaucracy doesn't move as quickly, not accustomed to moving quickly and it's not a partisan issue, you've got to push the bureaucracy at every level, federal level to move quickly, have a sense of urgency, to get the job done, worry about paper work and other stuff later, but to focus on results not process, that's my experience in every one of these challenges, whoever is in charge you've got to push the bureaucracy. 

[00:19:35]


>> Neil: Do u think that if the president said this this response has been adequate and proves that it's not been or maybe it's even a lotorse than he's ever let on, that this comes back to hurt him in campaigning, business as usual, will come back to hurt him? 
>> Well, look, a couple of things, one, it's way too early for the president or anybody else to say how the response has been going. There is still an ongoing crisis, still people, as you've been reporting on. There are still, in the very early stages of recovering, responding to this, this massive storm. So, it's way too early for the president to say that the response has been one way or the other. Secondly, I think most folks aren't worried about the politics, they're worried about getting the folks back on their feet and getting them-- just, you know, I think one of the most eloquent expressions and heard it during katrina and now, this is america, we should help our people and ldn't have to wait long for food and basics, basic supplies, shouldn't have to wait for those things so, i think the most important thing now is not the political points, not the political posturing on both sides, but to help these folks get back on their feet and stop declaring victory and speeches, help these people get back to some sen of normalcy. For many people they're looking for several months if not year work to rebuild their communities, not going to happen overnight, so the quicker we can help them get back to some normalcy, some kind of semi permanent housing and some sense of rebuilt schools for the kids and energy power, food, utilities, just the normal basic necessities of life, the better those communities and people will be. 
>> Neil: Governor jindal, ank you very much. We'll continue to monitor this, respond to this, not just by showing you, but by actually doing something, we'll take a close look at this, and economic impact on this on a day both campaigns are out full throttle to get out the vote and a lot of the early vote, and 35 million americans already doing so, it's going to get very big, very interesting, very hot very fast. Jack welch, very soon. It's hard to see opportunity in today's challenging environment. Unless you have the right perspective. BNY Mellon Wealth Management has the vision and experience to look beyond the obvious. We'll uncover opportunities, nd hidden risk, and make success a reality. BNY Mellon Wealth Management

>> All right. We have been focusing on the aftermath of hurricane sandy and regardless what happens in the end it's going to have a big impact on the economy and the economy is improving, the administration says, in the final reports before the election, a surprising better than 170,000 jobs added to the economy. Unemployment rate at 7.9%. Back with us is jack welch who might quibble with that rate in and about the last time, but still don't necessarily buy these numbers. 
>> Neil, look, the real unemployment rate, if you take the last ten years prior to the 2009 recession, the 10-year average of let's call it the participation rate, how many people are working temporarily, full-time, and you take that number and take the ten year average and ran it now, work for us, you would have an unemployment rate close to 11% and that's what the real unemployment rate that people are feeling out there, not discouraged workers walk away all that stuff, but that's the real rate. Now, this number of 7.8, that popped in the other day just didn't make any sense, I mean, you had a number that suddenly had more people added since ronald reagan's biggest month in june of '83 in september. That didn't-- 
>> so, apparently you were questioning the math? 
>> I was question the methodology, to go out. 
>> Neil: Gotcha. 
>> It's 2000 people on a phone in three phone banks calling people, saying, hey, are you working? Hey, how much time are you working? 
>> Be way, they're calling at home in the middle of the day? They're obviously not. And what is your sense then of the economy, jack. And the president tells people, look the trend is our friend. Things are getting better. Mitt romney says, if this is better, it's bad. So, what, what is your gut? 
>> My gut is that the economy in gas and oil is improving because of fracking, in automotive because of object did the obsolescpence. And the economy is running along at 1 1/2% gdp rate and might get 2 now and then. Look what happened in the third quarter. 62% of americans miss their revenue forecasts, that doesn't bode well. Challenger came out this week with an announcement that-- layoff announcements are up 41%. 

[00:27:30]


>> Neil: So why is this there dichotomy between average folks and one consumer nfidence survey out very high, but bosses, guys like you, not nearly so confident? Tactful in fact, very dower. I generally worry when my boss is depress and I wonder why should I be happy? 
>> The industrial economy right now is so uncertain. Look, if -- let's talk about this election and going forward. As I see it, 2013 or 14, we've got four, if you will, question marks. The first two, the fiscal cliff everybody talks about. You know, the debt,he taxes, how are we going to handle revenues versus costs. The second one, the regulatory wall no one's talking about. The wall that's going to hit with ozone pushed back to 2013, when american has a chance the right now to have this be the american century, this gas and oil break through with fracking and everything has a chance to change the world and we have a chance to be the most competitive country in the world with low cost energy across all businesses, with a great chemical industry, coming back. But that all depends on how we handle regulation. And this administration, more important to our future, lisa jackson, hilda solis, steven chu, regulating-- 
>> and you say it's going to be regulated to death and put a crimp on everything we do. 
>> This is the most important election of my life. 
>> Neil: Of your entire life? 
>> My whole life. 
>> Neil: Even the lincolnone? 
>> I knew you were going there, go to my softer underbelly. But neil, we have a chance to turn america totally around. 

[00:29:37]


>> Neil: What would happen if barack obama won, jack? 
>> I don't know the answer, but noi this, there's a high probability ofegulatory crimp in the whole gas fracking area. 
>> Neil: But, the whole big picture, jack welch sees barack obama reelect $, if it were to happen, what happens to the country? 
>> Slow growth, growth that will come back with - we have a monetary policy tt makes money free, so we'll have a slow growth, 1 1/2 to 2% versus the opportunity for 3 to 4% growth rate. Neil, we talked about the middle class. The the middle class has been hammered with $4,000 lower take home pay than before. The only way to get a middle class, high paying jobs from a very competitiveamerica, that will come from energy independence and low cost energy for every industry we have. That's what we need. We have a chance for the fiscal cliff with president romney who can work across the aisle to get a solution to the revenue costs and we have a huge chance to get north american energy independence and make america the most competitive country in the world. We have the intellectual horsepower and once we get the energy and have the low cost energy, this can be the american century, but it's not going to the american century if you've got a sll piece of this in new york, take the marcelist, the only state not doing anything in that area is new york, because they need another study, another study. These regulators are going to choke us. 
>> Neil: Jack welch, always an honor and a pleasure, thank you very much. Seems to know a thing or two about what he's talking about. We'll have more after this. Ll also find us in person, with dedicated support teams at over 500 branches nationwide. So when you call or visit, you can ask for a name you know. Because personal service starts with a real person.

[ All ] I'M WITH SCOTTRADE. 

[00:34:39]


>> All right. Here is the very latest. Welcome everybody. Take he election day, set in stone, think again. Lk again this morning, hurricane sandy could force an extra day of voting in new york city, that could potentially impact presidential races and maybe the presidential race, I think that new york is safely blue unless there's a cataclysmic change. And we'll talk to the guy who could lead that charge should it happen. And sandy may be gone, but the changes left behind are far, far from over. It's hard to believe, but 3 million people are still without power, not just a couple of states we're tal over 15 states. And some of the outages could last near week as temperatures continue to drop and tempers flaring in connecticut where utility workers were pelted with eggs and long lines for gas are not going away. Across new york, reports of more long waits and triple-a says nearly half of all gas stations in new york and new jersey remain closed due to sandy and some people have been waiting in lines up to six hours, just to fill up. I might take a look at what's going on in washington right now. This is the million puppets march. Started as a million muppets, but protests of mitt romney's plan to rein in pbs and funding for pbs, are other puppets sympathizing, this kind of tells you what's happening to the country. I'm telling you guys, it's rome, the final days. We've got senate races heating up in the middle of all of this puppetry. Pollsters are start to go say the democrats will maintain control, my next guest says not so fast. George allen the republican running for senate in virginia,barely lost last time by just 1/10 of a point or so. Right now the polls have him even with tim kaine and we reached out to tim kaine's office and have not heard back. They keep blowing us off and hopefully we'll hear back, but they just keep blowing us off. And senator, governor, good to have you. What do you think the senate looks like right now, if you had to handicap it? 

[00:36:52]


>> Well, I think it's very close and all we can do is make sure to win virginia. We have a tight race in virginia, but my wife susan and I are working hard all over virginia and encouraged by the enthusiasm that we see that people envision a better future than what we're hving to endure these days. Virginians, care about the economy and the threat out of failed washington leadership on sequestration and costing over 200,000 jobs in our defense industries and jobs in virginia being at risk and obviously, our military readiness harmed. You listen to jack welch, he's exactly on target, what we see in virginia is people in washington with the epa regulations outlawing coal which is causing thousands of job losses in communities in southwest virginia. And I'm told virginians on day one if I'm sworn in as your senatorintroducing a law off our coast and with mitt romney in the white house, he'll say yes to our cold fields and our coast and we could hav a manufacturing renaissance and also more affordable fuel and electricity and a better quality of life. So, we're trying to motivate and inspire people for positive constructive ideas, that can get our country ascending once again and i want to be virginia's senator. My opponent wants to be president obama's-- 
>> well, a very good campaign pitch there. I do want to talk about what you would do if you did get to the senate. It would be a lame duk session of the senate and congressman, that would have to handle some of the pressing issues, the fiscal cliff tha jack welch talked about and you alluded to with the sequestration cuts. There is talks just about extending all of those bush rates, all of those cuts, putting them off for six months, maybe even a year, so that either reelected president obama or newly elected president obama can get their respective arms around this and either hammer out a new tax code, simpler tax coder something like that. Do you think that's likely? 

[00:39:03]


>> I would like to see that happen. I don't think raising taxes in in weak economy would do anything other than put people out of work. The best way to raise revenues is with a vibrant economy and people working and getting a paycheck rather than worrying about unemployment benefits being extended and I do think that there's a basis for an agreement, a bipartisan agreement to reform our tax code to make it more simple, more fa, more competitive, remove the loopholes, particularly for businesses where right now, american businesses are hit with the worst tax in the world at 35%. The international average is 25%. I've been advocating 20%. And if that were done over 500,000 new jobs would be created, and the dynamics of it, would be over 23 billion dollars in new revenues and also, unleashing our energy resources throughout our country, the federal government could get over 1 trillion dollars in revenues, without raising taxes. So, I'd like to see the people in both parties come together and work out a more simple, fair, and I think job creating tax system than the very complicated one that we have right now, tt puts american job creators at a competitive disadvantage. 
>> Neil: All right, senator, very good having you. Be well. 
>> I'll do my very best, thank you, neil. 
>> Neil: All right, senator. We want to update you what's going on in new jersey right now, we're about an hour and a half, a little less than that from gas rationing and the first time we've seen that since the '70s, I'm old enough to remember that, and dad would give me the keys to the car, fill up your mother's car, odd-even days, what's happening in new jersey. And what if you're just driving through new jersey, you have no idea about this. It takes effect at noon, the idea to cut down the lines, so, see how that goes, but i have an idea this is not going to be received well. And what about the people trying to fill up, containers for their generators? And odd-even days for them? I'm telling you,his could be a mess, but governor christy is trying at least to get it under control. This reduced sodium soup says it mahelp lower cholesterol, how does it work? You st he to eat it as part of your heart healthy diet. Step 1. Eat the soup. All those veggies and beans, that's what may help lower your cholesterol and -- Well that's easy 

[00:41:19]


[ Male Announcer ] Progresso. You gotta taste this soup. 

[00:44:14]


>> May be less after pain in the gas. York governor cuomo along with the department of defense setting up emergency mobile fuel stations this just coming into us from the area that will allow free gasoline stributed to gas strapped customers. 10 gallon per person limit. I don't know where these setup centers would be. But that they're trucking up to 12 million gallons of fuel to the new york area for this, beginning like now. This weekend. And this on the same day we're about a little over an hour away from gas rationing going into effect in the state of new jersey, the first time we've seen that since the last energy crisis back in 1979, ott plates that end in odd number get gas on odd days, even numbered plates on even days. And, but most folks in new jersey have no idea this is happening and most travelling through the state have no idea this is happening, so imagine their surprise a little afternoon that they have the wrong plate and they expect gas and the guy tells them at the pump, sorry, you'll have to come tomorrow. That should go down well. Anyway, reaction to all this have and what could be a storm whose final tally could be nort of 50 billion dollars and former ceo of payne webber and so many he, keep them rolling below his name. How do you think it goes down. 
>> New yorkers cthrough it's a serious problem. The lemtations of the infrastructure in new york and around the country, this is the prominent a couple of years ago, and now, the infrastructure is old, see it in the frastructure, the roads, and the ability to delivery gasoline. And fortunately we have a great mayor in mike bloomberg-- 

[00:46:24]


>> a lot of people saying maybe not that great, and the marathon thing. 
>> A little late in that decision, but he made the decision and I think the fact is that the infrastructure this have great country is not up to. 
>> Neil: And how do you pay for that? 
>> You're going to have to pay for it with taxes and I think in the case of president obama and the next president, anything about infrastructure is creates jobs, vible jobs and people will see people out there working. Visible jobs in the community, making a direct impact on what's going on. 
>> Neil: I agree with you, but every penny i earmarked for infrastructure, I know it's a dirty word, it's not there. For every dime, for a road or bridge, a lot of dimes, because we never get the roads and bridge. Between tolls and surtax and fees, and to do the very thing to be done I think most would agree with you, we don't see it. Do we need like a infrastructural lock box? 
>> And it gets diluted by the system and one of the issues in the election, the government keeps getting bigger and bigger. Is that problem going to get bigger. Eventually in this conduct, the problem is so ble, so obvious, that even all the politicians can get togher and present something that's practical and effective and will work. 
>> So, if we switch players in the white house, let's say president obama comes in. Will it chge? Do you fear-- I knou've addressed this in the past in several administrations, that there's just a tone in washington, that makes getting anything done impossible? 
>> Yeah, I've been down there and uortunately that's the tone and whatever you say it'shard for the administration to get everything done. They've handed over the the keys to the congress and the congress is filled with idea logs willing to sacrifice the futu of the country in order to push their own point. You've got to hope this time around, whoever is the next president will be able to walk across the aisle, get some compromises and more important than that, pick the right priorities, obviously, there's a fiscal cliff, right, we've got to take care of that. Beyond that, there are multiple things that have to be done about the economy, the most important is having a job friendly creation opportunity. It's not easy, so, wall street, I think, I think markets will go up no matter whoever wins. 

[00:49:00]


>> After we've heard, markets, pressages, are you in that camp. 
>> I think the reality is, yields are too low to keep your morning in things that are earning nothing. 
>> Neil: That's a good point. Don marin, thank you so much. We talk about the interest rate on treury notes and bonds and anything beats virtually zero percent and that's the hope, hope springs eternal. How do you we fix the infrastructure mess, how about 12 million for fema for a start? Congress wants that. Think hazard today? Think again. The spot you missed could be a killer.

[00:51:43]


>> All right. S as the rescue efforts tip along the northeast coast, along atlantic city and right through staten island where damage is now in the tens of billions of dollars, to the guy who says fema to the rescue, but fema needs more money to rescue. The democratic congressman from the fine state of pennsylvania, give them another what, 12 billion bucks, right? 
>> Well, 12 billion is the bill. It's about 6.7 billion for fema and another 5 billion to help state and local governments. Your governor there in new york says it's 50 billion dollar problem in terms of cost to new york, new jersey, you've got to do something with rebuilding that coastline and all of the damage. In philadelphia, connecticut, the damage andost to local government. So, I would put forward a bill, there will be a bill to provide emergency funding because the storm, as there always is, and the question about, you know, when we move and how we move it. I think we should move forward aggressively now because you know, I heard on fox business that it's 25 billion in retail sale losses, I mean, we -- there's going to be a real economic consequence here and we need to respond. 

[00:54:11]


>> Neil: You know, maybe I'm maybe the only one in the country that doesn't share your enthusiasm for fema because I saw a lot of fema officials and others slapping themselves on the back about the great job they're doing, congressman and looking at staten island andd ooking off the jersey coast and seeing, well, they're obviously unaware or not addressing some of the real problems out there. They're still a lot of ridiculous things like texting and tweeting people about what they can do, and the people have no power and no phones. This is part and parcel of the problem, if you're going to argue giving billions in more money believing they're up to snuff of dng the job. I don't see that. 
>> When you're in the middle of the crisis and-- 
>> I'm in the middle of the crisis and I was in the middle of the crisis and was with people in the crisis and they say the people in charge of addressing the crisis don't do anything about the crisis. 
>> Let me just say this, neil, there's no the better agency anywhere in the world to respond to emergencies and as you just mentioned there are 12 million gallons of gasolin being flown in through six c-130's, and flying utility trucks from as far away from california to help repair power lines, power's coming back on in parts of new york and my belief is that by-- 
>> well, you and i, we're going to argue over fema and whether it's worth it because I disagree, that's okay. I'm very, very-- 
>> the only agency we have to deal with these problems. 
>> Neil: I'm concerned where you're going to get the 14 billion, 12 billion, just go deeper into debt? 
>> Well, look, what we need-- this is about a month and a half of what we spent in afghanistan. So, let's be clear. If in new york and new jersey and connecticut and pennsylvania is not worth a month and a half of what our country is spending in a place that most of us will never ever see. 
>> Neil: Okay. 
>> I don't know where our priorities are. 
>> Neil: All right, congressman, thank you very much. And the scene right now ocean county, new jersey.

>> ?????? ?????? your battle your bucks and now neil cavuto. 
>> Neil: It is fast and furious and just starting. Three days left to go and none 
- nonstop new york governor announcing temporary fuel trucks deployed in key locations in new yor city and long island. Eight million gallons and 28 million on the way, gas sorely needed for emergency vehicles and just a lot of folks to fill up. New jersey which has gaserationing is giving voters in the state post sandy options. They can drop by the county clerk's office to vote in person or text a approximate number to find out if their polling location was moved to the storm. That assuming you have power to do so. Long lines in florida. Folks waiting upwards to four hours. Miami-dade androward county are reporting the longest line. Newt gingrich with us now. And the long voting lines. In florida and other places we have seen them speaker, what do you make of them? 
>> I actually don't know. The gall up organization said among early voting romney led by 7 points and that was a startling number because the obama people told us ey voting and ground game and voting offices was the sea. Carl rove said if you look at absentee ballots it is favorable to mitt romney than obama and michael baron said mitt romney will win in a land slide. They tend to be in places for mccain and not for obama. It is hard for me to know what is going on. 

[01:01:39]


>> You and me both. One thing that was interesting when I listened to the president talking about early voting trend and talk up in ohio and democratic camp is saying just to compensate for the early voting disadvantage mitt romney is out in ohio. I don't know how that extrap polate this out. He would have to get 59 percent to win the state on election day. How do you see ohio? 
>> I was in hamilton county, cincinnati and delaware county on monday. Everywhere I went. It was enthusiasm for romney . Feeling that hamilton county, cincinnati, won 28,000 votes for obama and 12 to 20,000 votes for mitt romney and if that happens you talk about a land slide. It is almost impossible for obama to suffer a 50,000 vote turn around in hamilton county and winco - win ohio. 
>> Neil: You warned about the coming deadline yet it is getting close. As a former speaker and you know how the washington process workings. What do they do whether bark obama or mitt romney is reelected. Is it a lame duck session or what? 
>> Guest: If they are smart they postpone it and settle down and set down a series of doable steps. A couple of guys in the room and magically come up with a brilliant solution to the problem is bad of an idea for a free society as I can imagine. This is all fixable if it is done methodically and new idea and solutions . For example, if you liberate the federal lands for the development of natural gas and oil, you can get a trillion in royalties over the next 20 years with no tax increase . If you apply american express and visa and master card to tracking fraud in medicare and medicaid. You can save by not ping crookings. The problem with washington, people get stupid. They get in a room and come up with a big slogan and staff writes it up at 3:00 in the morn pass a bill that no one understands it is a bipartisan rush to being prty dumb and worst possible way to govern. They have the time and they should set goals. They should solve 1-12th of it a month. 

[01:04:33]


>> Neil: You appear to be saying, look, those cuts and all of the bush rates that automatically expire. You would keep aller extend them all? 
>> Guest: Why put an axe over your head and say stand there and watch me cut myself in to because I am too stupid to pull the axe down safely. It is a dumb idea a year ago and now and decimate our military and makes no sense at all. And I am not proud of either party for participating in it. 
>> Neil: There is a march and rally in washington right now. Calling the million puppet march. It was supposed to be a million muppet march to protest obama's proposal to cut. Nine puppets got sick . Puppiets are represented there as well the silliness aside. It is disturbing that this is a big focal point of the debate when we are really talking about reigning in the growth of government? 
>> Guest: This happened in 1995. Any time you mention pbs they try big bird. The actor who plays big bird gets $317,000 for being inside of the bird seat. Sesame street company makes revenue and six percent comes from the government. It is so important to liberals. National public radio get ace million and don't they call it national taxpayer's radio. These nusions will all survive. No one talked about closing them. They will all survive because people want them to survive. The idea of borrowing money from the chinese to give to big bird is absurd . It is like watching the fiasco you are seeing in new jersey and new york. This is the second major crisis with the department of homeland security failed abysmally. It needs to be overhalled because it is incapable. 

[01:06:50]


>> Neil: What did you make of the congressman telling me 12 or 14 billion more to f? 
>> Guest: If you are a liberal democrat you want to spend more and you would like to spend more last week on something else and if you are a liberal democrat you want bigger goverent with more unionized employees and that is the model of the world you believe in. And look at new jersey and new york. The absence of an intelligent affective plan, we are giving away gasoland we are now rationing gasoline . You raise a great point. Are neigh they waiving people on the out of state cars or people with the wrong licee having to go to a hotel to wait until tomorrow to buy gasoline. 
>> Neil: It will not go down well. It will not go down well. Speaker, always a pleasure . Newt gingrich. Swing state polls that show the contest is tight. We added up the states where the president and mitt romney and respective running mates are going. There might be states for the next three days they don't exist. Highlighted states do. This is the focus of the election. Everyone else. Sit down . Colorado is one of those state that is is getting good deal of attention. An independent pollster. It is not surprising that the swing states get the attention they do. But it seems disporportionately so this time. What do you make of that? 
>> Guest: Not only neil disporportionate, but a smaller group of states. Typically we had targeted states. Some states either in your camp or not . Now is down for the most part nine states. Colorado had 100 million just on television. The president's been here and romney . The president has been here 15 times. I lost count and they clearly don't believe the polls at the moment. Because recent poll up here said the president is ahead by two. And a poll that said mitt romney up by three. And romney is here this afternoon . President here tomorrow. I think they both believe the state is in play and nine little electorial votes can make the difference. 

[01:09:28]


>> If you are mitt romney and fear you may not take ohio . You know this better thana i they are all over the maps. Some polls have it within the margin of error and if not for the president. Not all but many. Can you cobble together a series of other states like colorado that could make up for that? 
>> Absolutely. Obviously he's still believes in ohio and you are right. I think there is going to be an examination of polling if romney wins and ife wins ohio hat is as newt said a land slide. 
eil: YOU THINK THAT IS Going to happen that he wins ohio? 
>> Guest: If he wins ohio there is a land slide building. There is a debate going on most polls ippedicate the president is ahead there. But the romney people are arguing that they are missing this republican enthusiasm that has been animated by the great debate and a lot of work . If that is true, there will be an examplation - examination of the methodology of national polls that were taken there. But he will have to put together the 270 electorial votes and he will need to win most of the other major competitive state. Sconsin, and nevada, and obviously florida and virginia. Heel have to put that whole package together and he looked at pennsylvania in the last few days and put money in there. 
>> Neil: That is a tough one. That is a tough one. 
>> The numbers are not good there. 
>> Neil: We'll watch and floyd, thank you . In the middle sandy and a lot of these states are without power and if you want to go to your voting precinct, you will not be able to. There is a paper ballot and you can write down your voting preference and they count it by hand and makings for a long election night n new york, they are trying to extend voting in the next day so people will have more time to do that. New york is aacred blue state but could affect the delay and a number of congressional races and compel other states to start wanting to do the same thing. To extend a voting deadline, is something tha would be for everybody. It is a federal act, but individual states can do one at a time their own thing. If new york does that and others fol, and then what? It you turns into a late election night and week. Going nonstop covering this? It could get messy, after is this. Ah. Fire bad! Just have to fire roast these tomatoes. This is going to give you a head start on your dinner. That seems easier

>> Neil: Miami-dade, early voting today, starting today, that is a very long line and this is typical of what we are seeing in florida. Some that is in the country. They have 25 million . Be that as it may a sign of the times for the voters turn out being be heavy. It is always whose base and who comes out. In new york metropolit an area it could be a question of power. And on election day itself. What happens in that event and how do you get up and running and voters to the polls in that event? A fellow following it closely. John coxly. New york board of election spokesperson. And one of your ideas was extend voting to the next day november seventh, right. 
>> It woun't happen the next day. Do you to a natural disaster less than 25 percent of the registered vores in a particular jurisdiction don't turn out there can be additional day of voting that takes place no less than 20 days after the election. We have to determine the turn out in the area and then the state board would desigate when the election would take place. 
>> Neil: That could be confusion and abuse? 
>> We have never done it before. It is the first time it happened. 
>> Neil: Have you had election than fewer of the -- off have voted? 

[01:17:38]


>> No, last year we had impact from hurricane irene and lee and a similar situation of moving poll sites and we were able to do that and this ovision of the law would not be available for that. As said we have never done that. 
>> Neil: Now, a cynic in me would say it is sort of like a football game and you don't like the sore and you extend to a fifth or sixth quarter. I know that is not your personal intent but you can see it is like rigging a vote to get a desired response. 
>> There would have to be agreement with the all four commissioners two democrats and republicans to do the additional delay voting. 
>> Neil: If you don't get it from the majority. 
>> You have to get at least three votes to do it. 
>> Neil: How likely do you think it is? It is difficult to predict. For every voters to go to the pollthere would be a poll . We'll try to make sure we are not under that thres hold. 
>> Neil: Thank you. In new york a safe blue sta. Ronald reagan won new york . It is not unprecedented for a republican to win. But it would impact the congress. And all because of the storm that shut down electricity and polling places in the new york metropolitan. And at issue new jersey. People can text their choices in earlier than normal so it is done and done soon. Charlie rangel on all of that and much more after this.

>> Neil: I told you a while ago because of what you are seeing in new york and staten iphrand so many parts of thitate without power. They are toying of extending the election beyond november 6th. A follow up day could be actually weeks later and they would allow more folk to vote that might have been unable to on november 6th. Reaction from charlie rangel. What do you make of that idea? 
>> If is chaos. My god, the winner would not want to go anywhere near that. We had a legitimate case you agree in florida with bush snatching the election away. And they court went along with it. 
>> I know that. 
> And let's talk about this. 
>> I I win that election, if it is one, it is won. That would be changing the rules no matter who wine're winnings. 
>> Neil: They say if the turn out is under 25% it would be a reflection of people unable get to the polls. You're saying it doesn't matter. 
>> Guest: I am saying the rules in the games of the election expected from people and government is there. Subjectively you get the turn out you expected it is not see so. Making certain that people have an opportunity to vote, you take my word for it. They can take tents and launch it inside. And you have no id that you are in a tent. We have generator except lack of enthusiasm for people who want to vote not to be able to vote. We can do it. 
>> Neil: Okay. What do you think of h this is going to affect things around here. Much of thitate is s without power and many more coming back on. But a lot of folks could be in that cycle on election day?

>> Guest: Going to the long run. The overwhelming majority of people will not be . The compassion and sensitivity that people have, for people helping others that suffered more than they suffered each and every day is totally unbelievable. My confidence in america and especially new yorkers, during the time of crisis makes me believe that when I got people asking me if they can go to staten island to help anyone out there and got churches cooking fo for anybody that may have lost energy in terms of food, I just hope the good will feeling continues . The longer run, whether people believe we should invest in infrastructure or not . Whether they have concern about global warming or not. This will change dramatically economically. 92 thatwhat are your folks doing for staten isld. I got impressionitaten island was rodney dangererfield and no one paid attention or gave it much do. And a lot of officials ngratulating themselves on what a great job they are doing and I look at those people out there and they are saying hello, not out there. Is there a disconnect? 
>> Guest: They stopped the mara thon. 
>> Neil: Took a lot of bitching. Depest guest they got what they wanted you think it was the right decision in >> 
Guest: Under the circumstances. I would havemented the support and money and go to worth while causes to ease the pain. If I was ontaten island i would want everything stopped.

>> Guest: Millions would robbery there to contribute. You have people suffer they allow movie star to get on tv to laugh and jump and dance you could be right. 
>> Guest: I am glad now. How is the race going to go? 
>> I thought it was going to be tight. But there is no question in my mind if people are disappoint in obama and take a good hard look at hisonent obama will return to office and he's begin.

>> Brian: I don't -- >> guest: I don't drink.

>> Neil: I am not sure how the final davis rome looked or the babylonian empire I am sure it would look like this. A million pupple march going on in washington d.C. Starting out the million muppet march to protest mitt romney's move to cut out spending for pbs. Public broadcasting system including sesame street and big bird. The actual big bird is 8 feet talk. It is a fake march. Anyway. We have got a multibillion dollar clean up to worry about and sequestration cuts and expiration of all . Bush tax rates and these people are mad about puppets. Okay. Ed henry traveling with the president. Edward good to have you. How are thingings - things out there. 
>> We are here with the president and in all seriousness he will have a big rally in ohio . A big crowd in the gym. It is one of those key bbushes. But four years ago when he was a rock cand date. One of his final rallies on the last weekend before he was elected was in cleveland and he had 80,000 peope in part because of a cleveland browns game and this time there are several thousand but no where near 80,000 mentors in the suburb of chef clef. He - cleveland. He is now the incumbent and the problem he is dealing with. Mitt romney is running as a cand date of change. We have seen the president pushing back. Saying that mitt romney is not a cand date of change and charge that he is pushing old failed policies of the past. Hing am bring jay z and bruce springsteen. And the president last case here is to say look. There is progress. You saw the unemployment kick up slightly and a creation of jobs 170,000 and better than expected. And he's saying it is not good enough and slow process and notinge in the state of ohio. Unemployment rate is 7 percent and better than the national average. They believe in the obama camp it would be a midwestern fire for them and they will carry it and make it hard for obama to reach the electorial votes he needs to take it away from the president. 

[01:34:56]


>> Neil: We look at the president's travel plans. I am confused of the polls. We know from karl rove. 181,000 viewer democrats turned out for early voting or to file absentee ballots. I don't know if that means anything in and of itself. But it is a gap from last time. Are they talking about that or what do they think? They are. And this is why it is significant. Early voting isco part of the obama strategy to get reelected. Democrats are more likely to do early vote republicans turn out on election day and not engage in early voting. The president needs a boost in ohio, florida and seeing big crowds and like in nevada out west as well the other thing to note, the president's travels were significant . They have thought if they look at polls suggesting that the president has a big lead in ohio. Why is he coming here six times, the obama camp may be leading but they realize they don't have it locked up f. They had it locked up they wouldn't be here and in they had wisconsin locked up. That is a democraticitate that could go republican because of paul ryan . The president points out that mitt romney has been in places like virginia and florida that he wanted to wrap up and bottom line. Both sides have a lot of battle grounds that are up for grabsncluding right here in ohio. 
>> Edhenry. In mentor ohio. 
>>> And now to send scott to south carolina in congressman extraordinarye. What is it? A president visiting key states like ohio and wisconsin that he is worried. Should he be? 

[01:36:59]


>> I think he should be worried. No doubt about it. Early voting trend. The democrats are not showing up early. We are consistently won ohio in november 6th and this would be no different. Intensity factor is on our side . The voters abysmal response from the democrats. And in the end, what is positive for us, people want change. Because they want jobs. This the president wants to own the economy. Well it is his and it is not good. 
>> Neil: Congressman, the president is saying begin the latest jobs 180,000 jobs and best performance in eight months that those jobs are materialize that you are wrong? 
>> I say the unemployment rate went 7.9 to 7.8 and hovering around 8 percent . Factoring in the folks no longer looking for jobs, unemployment rate is 10 percent . Some say closer to 11 percent. We can have a conversation about statistic, but american people understand who is working and who is not work underemployed. 23 million americans looking and unemployed. 
>> Neil: Can you see a scenario where mitt romney wins it without ohio? 
>> It is difficult, but if you winorth carolina virginia and florida, it gives you more flexibilitiy in other states, but we anticipate because the difference in margins of error of throw percent in the last poll. 50-47 and bringing them altogether. In ohio we are in a positive position and my understanding is that the race is closer than 50-fren and down to one point now . Three more days of campaigning tips it our way . If the voters are that democrats are not there . Republicans will show up on election day we'll win ohio as 

[01:39:14]


WELL >> Neil: Your democratic colleague wants more funding for fem a. What do you say? 
>> I say pray for the victims of hurricane sandy and the fact is, last ye, one of the things we did in congress, we kept the money for hurricanes and emergencies outside of the budget process. We had specific funding for those emergencis and goods is october 1st new funding year srt there is a lot of money there and if there needs to be adjustments, we have month to go. 
>> Neil: But now is not the time to do it? 
>> Guest: Certainly not. There is plenty of mon yeif there is a short fall toward the next hurricane season adjustments can be made >> 
Chris: Thank you congressman. In florida early voting is ensuing. And if I put a verb to that tampa, florida much of the case in the sunshine.

You don't stand in a long line to vote unless y really, really want to vote . Some of these standing on the line for four hour to get the chance. Think about that. Sometimes you will stand in a four-hour gas line for gas. Would you stand in a four-hour voting line because you need to vote.

>> Neil: This is it a rally in ohio . To the right of your screen in florida. Lines waiting to vote in tampa, florida. Early voting is in full throttle now. I am not sure how much. 25-32 million that is a record . On voting day we'll have 30 percent of the americans already voted, eligible voters. That is the final figure. It is a figure none theless. Robert is a obama fundraiser you know, that is a big shin dig they had the other day where both candidates showed up . There he is waves to the peons in the crowd here. Good to have you. 
>> Guest: Nice to be here >> 
Chris: You think it looks good. 
>> Guest: I think he would win. He looks strong in the battle ground field. 
>> Neil: T reason w karl rove who lives and breathes the numbers. He looked at the number of democrats who came out t vote early and that 1810,000 viewer have done so. And putting that back wards, he said that is not good for the president . In the meantime 75,000 republicans better for mitt romney. 
>> Guest: I thior every karl rove. He's highest in the certainty. 
>> Neil: Bottom li we don't know. 
>> Guest: But look at early voting. Romney would need 55 percent in the swing states basod where early voting is today. That seems too high. 
>> Neil: You are average you pick up a couple is not. You feel good about the president. But to hear those chatting who like mitt romney. It is all ultimately a judgment call the economy. It is better and good. Economic numbers are better but not good; what do you say? 

[01:46:18]


>> Guest: There a big debate on the august number and we only had one revision which was up. And testimonies you the august number improved. 
>> Neil: Even you job growth was half what it should 
>> Guest: I would not agree with that. You have a sector called the housing market that is just starting literally starting to move forward. 
>> Neil: You are saying be grateful with the numbers. 
>> Guest: It is not as fast as we want. But you have job gains in 32 
STRAIGHT MONGS >> Chris: You are a great numbers guy and that doesn't keep up with population growth. It a innocent. Since the preside took off. He iswn on the job? 
>> Guest: No, we have created over three million newype of 
JOBS >> Chris: There is no way to prove that. Created what? 
>> Guest: Look at job loss versus new job gain. Like the construction sector. We had three million new jobs created. And the only other president that did that wasonald 
REAGAN >> Chris: It is a made up number. 
>> Guest: It wouldn't be the 
FIRST TIME >> Chris: A lot of colleagues on wall street are worried about another four years of barack obama. They think that he's called them names and he said they don't pay enough taxes and on't like him and some of them hate him? 
>> Guest: There is a lot of vitriol. 
>> Neil: You think the president overplayed the rich villian thing. 
>> Guest: The rhetoric of fat cat campaigning and if you look at the policies what we should debate. No one could debate the new reform for wall street. I was there. 
>> Neil: I am on the job council. How often do you meet? 

[01:48:22]


>> Guest: We have calls every two weeks. 
>> Neil: Is the president in on the call? 
>> Guest: No. 
>> Neil: That tells you a lot. You never did that. 
>> We gave a year in review that we are working on the administration with 60 that does not need legislative is shes and one of them most important issue is infrastructure. We have fast forward. And I wrote in wall street journal with two other people in january 2010 and supported that the president this country needs nationa partly cloudy bank. He's on board with that. It is partisan politics and not because it is not a good idea. 
>> Neil: Robert good to see you. Thank you very much. Cheerios cholesterol as part of a heart healthy diet. That's true. ...But you still have to go to the gym. ?????? The one and only, Cheerios ?????? #@0y0y3??o????????y Leading that food drive effort. Wall street legend in his own mind. He loves staten island of his own and disturbing new to share with us asl >> thanks for getting the word out on what is going on in staten iland. I am not leading anything. The entire community is here leading it in the abence of any federal assistance whatsoever. 

[01:53:15]


>> Neil: We heard the possibility of moreictims than we know in staten because authorities are only now getting to flooded homes. 
>> I can tell you the shelter we are working at closed at 8:00 and set up a couple of tables in the street in one of the most affected areings. You know my brother and his friend and hundreds of volunteers are out here. This morning helping people dig out and we hear the sanitation guys screaming the is bodies in the pile and they pull away debris and unfortunately unreported right now that was an hour and half ago. Three more people deceased. God bless them. 
>> Neil: John, we are hearing that this is the first time rescue workers can get to these homes, but there is a lot of these homes. We are told hundreds of them . You know this area better than I do. Are there that many homes up to now people haven't gotten to? >>Il. All of the houses that are affected you can get to. People in the neighborhood and people in the communities can get to them. We see huge convoys of fema and janet napolitano and homeland security driving by with clip board and writing things down. But not a single soul in the street. We have volunteers and people who are affected giving water out of their own house. People need blankets and you can get to these homes. The question is where is the government assistance? Neil. We have spoken many times. There is not a federal agent helping a single person where we are. 
>> Neil: When janet napolitano was there yesterday and federal local and state officials are patting each other on the back and saying great job, you are not seeing that there? 
>> I am on the ground and live on the ocean and my house was affected we got iturped control and not as bad as othereople and we got out on the street and people are helping others. No, material agencies are driving through with clip board and all of the yellow vests and flash lights and not doing a single thing. They are writing reports and looking at clip board and no one is helping. People need help out here on staten island very badly. 

[01:55:46]


>> Neil: John, thank you for doing your part. Only serves as a reminder, we are hearing throughout much of the official talked-dom that everything is going well . Fema is doing a great job and officials are on top . How many press conferences it and they are commending each other and saying they are all ahead of this and responding to this. But if you go to staten island and see what is happening on the ground there is a huge disconnect. Before they start patting themselves on the back, they might want to start lifting the load off of these folks back. They don't hear it or see it it is worse than you have been told.

Hello there. Is this the house? I've been trying to get you. Michael, do you realize it's 5:30 in the morning? Who is it, agatha? 
[Buzz] that michael. We had a party here last night, and the last guest hasn't driven out of the driveway yet. Take it, take it! Hello. Kitchen. Lucy speaking. Yes, I know, I know. Yes, miss ann. What's that racket? The telephone's been ringing all over the house. I'll talk to him. Michael, what do you mean at this unholy hour of the morning? Oh...Well, good morning, miss ann. It's a cheerful morning, now, isn't it? I was wondering if I might talk to miss judith. No, you certainly might not! She hasn't got two hours' sleep yet. I wouldn't disturb her for the world. Oh! 
[Telephone rings] 
[ring] 
[ring] 
[ring] 
[ring] 
[ring] this is miss judith traherne of the sleepy trahernes. Oh, is it, now? Well, this is mr. Michael o'leary of the wide-awake o'learys. I have a cash customer for that colt. We can get 10,000 if you snatch it quick. If you mean challenger, not 10 and not 20. My head's just woozy, not vacant. If you don't mind my saying so, miss judith, it might be better for you to take charge of the cups and the ribbons and leave the handling of the horses to me. I do mind your saying so. I gave you your orders last night, michael! I ought to slap that man's face. He is impertinent sometimes. But what can we do? He's just about the best trainer money can buy. I suppose he is. What time is it? 

[00:02:17]


Woman: About 5:30. Good morning, martha. Hello, daffy! Come up. We're going to the stable, martha. Are we? Mm-hmm. Couldn't you both go back to bed and get a little sleep? Would you get us some coffee, please, martha? Yes, miss. 
[Laughing] well! Here we go. Come on. What's the matter? Are you asleep? It's a nice world, if we can just stay in it. What do you mean? You'd better let me drive. No! I will not! 
Michael: Good morning, ladies. So I managed to get you up, did i? Michael, don't be fresh! I hear you've got the finest string of horses in the country. The least you could do is to come down and let them have a look at you. Surely, if the little horses can get up early in the morning to run and jump for you, you can get up to watch them. Michael, really! 
Woman: Hi! 
Man: Hello, judith! 
Second woman: Hello, george! We're going to be killed someday. Ann, come here! Thanks for the lift! 
Judith: Take it away, bob! 
Ann: I simply wouldn't stand for it! I won't. He's got to be fired! He's going to be. And right now. He thinks he can lead us around like a lot of horses. You're right, fire him. Me?! Oh, no! I'm not the mistress here. I'm only the secretary. Oh, but, darling, you have the character. You're always telling me so yourself. He's-- judy! Hello, everybody! Good morning, alec. Oh-ho, what a party! Glad to see you're still on it. All ready for tonight. All I got to do is change the orchid, see? Good morning, ann nice, sensible ann. Good morning, parasite. Why don't you go to bed before they put you there for good? Well, now, confidentially, it's a scheme. Your man michael told me he'd give me a nice, fat commission if I could get our sweet carrie to buy your colt challenger. Michael? He wouldn't dare! And I can use the cash, too. Now, this is the end! 
Woman: Judy, darling! Hello, carrie. I will take that colt off your hands if you let me have a bargain. I won't sell you the horse, but I'll sell you his trainer! That's who she really wants to buy, but he won't even look at her. I never heard of such a thing! Judith, do you want to sell that colt? No, I do not... Colonel, dear. 

[00:04:21]


Michael: I think you ought to buy that horse, colonel. He's a perfect darling. You can even invite him over for tea. He'll play around on your front lawn with your children and your dogs. Why, he's a love. He whinnies. Unfortunately, a steeplechaser has to have more than just a pretty smile. Colonel mantle, my father held that foal up in his arms and said, "judy, here's a champion! By victory..." 
Michael: "Out of field nurse by man of war. Let's call him challenger." You catch that horse at the two mile pole with his heart bursting and a water jump ahead of him, and he'll fold up on you. Michael, you might fold up, and I might fold up, but that horse has the breeding. 
[Chuckles] that was for me, I take it, miss judith. I told you I wanted to run him this morning. Where is he? Well, he's in his stall having his morning cup of tea. Well, go bring him up here. And when I tell you to do something, do it! Yes, ma'am. That head again? Oh! It comes and goes. I'll show him that that horse has courage! What are you going to do? Michael, how long have I had you? One month and three days. Remind me to think about firing you. Well, I don't think you'll be firing me, miss judith. We're going to get on together. Now, just because I called your little darling a coward, i-- someday you'll learn that courage is in the blood. Now, take your little horse and run along. Good riding, judy! 

[00:06:35]


[Michael laughs] well, what's the matter with him? I never seen... Ha ha! Aah! 
Man: Something's happened! 
[Judith screaming and moaning] well, how are you feeling now? Oh, fine. How is the shoulder? All right. How you escaped being hurt, I'll never know. Ann, do you know something? What? That colt didn't throw me, I threw him. What are you talking about? You know what happened? I saw two jumps. I tried to take him over the wrong jump. You saw two jumps? Yes, that's what it was. It was the ghastliest feeling. Everything went fuzzy. Judith, why didn't you tell dr. Parsons these things? Oh, poor old befuddled parsons. You know what he always says. "My dear, you've been staying up too late, and you've been smoking too many cigarettes." So you are, you know, and the house is always filled with gangs of people, and-- if he only knew what happened last week at the colony. What happened at the colony? An old lady was coming through the swing doors. I knocked her umbrella out of her hand. Why? Someone said I was drunk. And another time, coming out of helene's on park avenue, I ran right into a woman with a dog on a leash. I ran right into the leash! Oh, judith, you-- oh, I didn't hurt the dog, but the woman was furious. Confidentially, darling, this is more than a hangover. If you don't tell parsons these things, i will. No, you won't, ann. You're my best and my truest friend, and you won't tell a soul. I wouldn't have told you, except-- well, I won't have a dumb animal blamed for my mistake! Yes, elizabeth. What is it? Dr. Parsons is here. Dr. Par-- look, judith, I had to promise him you'd go to a specialist about that giddiness. Oh, but I haven't any time for doctors! Martha, bring my things, will you? Listen, darling, you may be really ill! But I haven't time to be ill. It's just some minor nonsense. Very well, then. But if you're going up to town, I'm going with you. You're not going to have another tumble and ruin all your pretty clothes. Don't be silly, ann. I'm perfectly all right alone. Oh, you're as stubborn as a mule. 

[00:09:02]


Man: Are we ready? She says she's not going with us. Thank you, martha. Oh, darling, I've so much to do. You have the big specialist examine her. Good-bye, children! 
[Judith tumbling] 
Dr. Parsons: Careful. No, I'm sorry, dr. Parsons, I'm afraid it would be useless. Dr. Steele has closed his office, you know. Mm-hmm. Permanently. No. He's not coming back. You're welcome. Good-bye. Sounds good, eh, wainwright? I'm going to cry in a minute. Don't forget... I got to be out of here in 45 minutes. What shall I do with this case of dr. Parsons'? He's dreadfully worried. He asked me to hold you here by force, if necessary. Well, you tell dr. Parsons I've waited nine years to catch this train, and I'm not going to miss it just because some long island nitwit fell off her horse. Listen to this "miss judith traherne, daughter of the late sportsman and wire manufacturer..." Imagine putting that stuff in a case history, huh? Say, don't forget you have dr. Carter waiting for you. Oh! Say, I'm awfully sorry, doctor. I believe when I left, you were calling me an idiot. You know, the boys at the club were talking about you last night. Were they? They won't believe it. What? A man in your position giving up a practice like this. Joe, what do you know about brain surgery? Well, I think if I had the surgical courage, I'd be in it. To go inside of a human being's skull and tinker with the machinery that makes the whole works go-- that is romance, isn't it? Romance, huh? There's your romance. Hmm? Florist bill? Yes. Flowers for my last patient. He was a gifted young composer. In fact, the night before the operation started a new composition. He didn't finish it. Maybe you read about it in the papers. Yes. Yes. The operation was a brilliant success. The patient just happened to die. That's a pretty old joke, fred. Is it? Well, look at any brain surgeon's mortality rate. You'll find out just about how unfunny it is. Are you quitting because you've lost your nerve? What? What else can a man think? I'm not quitting. I'm going back to medicine. Medicine? What do you mean, "medicine"? I have a little laboratory on a farm up there in vermont. Medical research bureau is backing me, and fisher in philadelphia is going to do the pathology-- incidentally, the best man in the country, so that's that. How many men would give their eyeteeth for a practice that you're throwing away? What is this research, actually? Cells. Cells? Brain cells. Why do healthy, normal cells go berserk and grow wild? Do you know? No. Nobody knows! But we call them cysts and gliomas and tumors and cancers, and we operate and hope to cure with the knife, and half the time, we don't even know the cause. Our patients have faith in us because we're doctors, and-- well, you can tell the boys they can split up my practice, and welcome! 

[00:11:57]


[Chuckles] you and pasteur. Maybe you're right. Someday, somebody will discover a serum that will be to these growths what insulin is to diabetes and antitoxin is to diphtheria and maybe earn his title of doctor of medicine. Dr. Parsons is here. He is? 
Wainwright: He insists. Well, I suppose I should be polite, huh? I suppose I must be going. Your train! 
Steele: Yes, I know. 
Carter: So long, fred, old boy. You'll be back. Don't hold your breath! Ha ha ha! Good luck, old man. Thanks. Fred, can't you put this thing off, whatever it is? Sorry, doctor. I've closed my office. Have you read the case history? Oh, you mean this gossip sheet? Something about a wire manufacturer's daughter? Oh, please. Never mind about that. This girl's desperately ill. I've been watching her like a hawk, and she's been losing ground each day. Well, if two minutes will do you any good, I'll talk. What's this about headaches? She's been having them persistently, even before the accident, I suspect. Before? She calls them hangovers. Yeah? Three weeks, and you wait until now? You don't know that girl. She's a very stubborn patient. Only yesterday she went to a revival of cyrano in theernoon and played bridge half the night. She won't cooperate. She won't even tell me anything! Won't talk, huh? Fred, we're old friends, and I'm desperate. I brought this little girl into the world, took care of her father until he died. Well, if she's such a great horsewoman, why was she thrown? Ah, that's it. It was a queer sort of accident. She crashed into the right wing of a jump, almost as if she'd held her horse deliberately at it. I was there. I saw it. You sure it was the right side? Yes. Why? Hmm. Well, in that case, I'd say your best bet is to get in touch with findlay. Findlay's in europe! All right, then get park. I don't want park or any of the rest of them. Hang it all, they're no better than I am. I want you! I'll be stuck here another nine years. Fred, you're always talking about e obligation of doctors to humanity. Well, fred... There is humanity. Sorry, doctor, it can't be done. I , I've closed my office. 

[00:14:19]


Judith: Come on, ann, this is ridiculous! I'm late already! Judy, please! This is dr. Steele. How do you do? How do you do? My name's traherne, judith traherne. Or don't names matter? Hmm... I mean, to that cold, scientific eye of yours, we're just little guinea pigs, aren't we? So glad to have met you, doctor. Come on, ann. Where did you get those burns? What burns? Your right hand. Here, between the first two fingers. Oh, I never noticed them before. I see. Will you come in here a minute, please? Come along, judy. You wait. Let me have this, will you, doctor? I'm going to see miss traherne. 
Steele: When it's time to go, you be sure and warn me. 
Wainwright: Certainly, doctor. Oh, just a moment, doctor. I haven't much time. As a matter of fact, I haven't much time myself. Dr. Parsons tells me you're a great hunter. Well, you could hardly expect me to enter your office leading a pack of hounds. Please. 
Steele: I understand you don't like to talk about your health. That's right. Any particular reason why? It's just a boring subject, that's all. Oh, most people love it. I make my living by listening to them. Then I'm afraid you're wasting your time. I'll send you a bill. I'm 23 years old, an only child. I weigh 110 pounds, stripped. I've had measles, mumps, and whooping cough all at the proper ages. I believe I have no congenital weaknesses. Shall I go on? Oh, yes, please. My father drank himself to death. My mother lives in paris. I take a great deal of exercise. I'm accustomed to a reasonable quantity of tobacco and alcohol. I'm said to have a sense of humor. Is that enough? All the inconsequential facts. Thank you. What are the consequential ones? Does that light bother you? Not at all. Do you use your eyes a great deal? I generally keep them open, doctor. What do you do with yourself down there on long island? Oh, horses, dogs, shooting, yachting, travel, parties, gossip-- all the pleasures of the station-wagon crowd. You don't think much of that, do you? No, not much. Why not? It just doesn't appeal to me, that's all. Do you condemn everything that doesn't appeal to you? Oh, by no means. You asked for my opinion. I gave it. Well, anyway, that's my racket. What's yours? Mine? Well, brain surgery-- large practice, about 10 days off every summer. Sounds awful. It is. Then why do you do it? Because, like yourself, I've been caught in a racket. Oh, doctor, what a relief to know that you're no better than I am. Thanks. 

[00:17:36]


Steele: Ah, but you see, I'm clearing out of my racket. I'm leaving for vermont in about, uh, 15 minutes. Vermont! You don't mean that narrow, pinched-up little state on the wrong side of boston? That's the one. No kidding? No kidding. What are you going to do there between yawns? Ah, you wouldn't be interested. Oh, come now, doctor, after leading me on like this! Well, I'm going to do scientific research on the growth of cells. In little guinea pigs? No, just cells. Sounds silly. So I'm told. Still, I almost envy you. It must be nice to believe in what you're doing. Don't you? Not in the way you do. Oh, I'm not complaining. Taken all in all, they've dealt me a very good hand. I'm young. I have no particular responsibilities. I don't intend to cultivate any, either. One's freer without. I shall probably marry someday. No hurry about that. When I do, I shall build a house on a ridge I know with a glorious view. I have my horses. Any luck, I'll have about 40 years of that. I think that's a pretty good setup. That light was bothering you. Why do you keep harping on that? There's nothing wrong with my eyes! You were squinting. I was not squinting. Sorry, but you were. Well, suit yourself! It's your office. What did you do yesterday? Played bridge in the afternoon. I went to the theater in the evening. Other way around, wasn't it? Yes, I guess it was. What was the play? Um... Cyrano,wasn't it? Yes. Why? Did you like it? Well, I had such an awful headache, i-- how long have you had these headaches? Oh, i-- I don't have them. You have one now. No, I have not! How'd you make out at bridge yesterday? Let me think. I-- quickly! I don't remember. I know. You lost. Yes, I lost. How much? How can I remember? I play bridge every day. Losing a lot lately? Yes. Playing badly? Well, i-- forgetting what cards are out and what's bid? Why do you ask me such stupid questions? Wait. Did dr. Parsons say you could go out yesterday? I'm accustomed to looking after myself. But you did disobey his orders, didn't you? What if I did? Why do you pay a doctor for advice and then disregard his advice? I didn't call him. Someone else called him. Oh, so you're taking orders from somebody else, are you? I've never taken orders from anyone! As long as I live, I'll never take orders from anyone! And I'll tell you something else. I'm well, absolutely well! I'm young and strong, and nothing can touch me! And neither you nor dr. Parsons can make me an invalid out of me! And now I'm going! Wait! I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time! That's right... Run away because you're frightened. That's not true! Yes, it is true. That's why you've held certain things back from dr. Parso. You were afraid to admit them... And that's why you didn't tell him you've been having these headaches for months, but you have, and lately they've been getting worse until now you're never free of them. And your eyes-- they've been cutting out, too, just like somebody shutting a pair of folding doors, till your vision is almost cut in half. You pretended it was your imagination, but it isn't. Then that queer, dull feeling in your right arm. You can't laugh that off. And I'll tell you how you got those burns on your fingers. A cigarette. You didn't feel the burns because your sensory nerves are paralyzed. Your memory is all shot to pieces. You can't concentrate. Look at your bridge scores. And you're irritable because your nerves are all on edge. You won't admit it, but you can't deny it, can you? Now I think we'll get somewhere. Come on. Come on. Now, just hold my hand with your right. Now squeeze. Tight. Come on. Good and tight. That's it. Good. Now the left. That's right. Now, would you mind removing your coat? Well, I'm afraid this coat is all there is. Oh. Well, just sit up here, then, will you? That's it. Maybe we can move this sleeve above the elbow. Yes. Oh, just a second. 

[00:22:34]


Steele: Miss wainwright. Nothing in here to bother you. 
[Knock on door] 
Wainwright: It's nearly time, doctor. I know, I know. Now, give me your right elbow, please, and just relax. Hmm... Now the left. Good. Now will you cross your knees, please? Ha ha! This always makes me laugh. Yes, it is silly, isn't it, huh? Good. Now the left, please. Now, don't be frightened of this. It's just an electric light. You're very kind to your guinea pigs, arent you? Just look straight ahead, please. Hmm... I've been told they're a nice color. Do you agree? Hmm. Just once again, please. That they're a nice color? Oh, yes, yes, fine. Now I'm going to ask you to close them. Hold your hands out, palms upwards, please. Now tell me what this is. It's a cube. Hard or soft? Hard. Good. Now, can you tell me what this is? I'm not quite sure. I see...Now, just a minute. Can you tell me what that is? 
Steele: Move it around in your hand. Know what shape it is? I can't quite make out. Can you tell me what this is? A pencil, silly. That's right. May I open my eyes now? No, no, no, not yet. Now, here. Is that cloth rough or smooth? 
Judith: It's a piece of silk. I see. I'm going to fool you this time. What's this? Hmm. You can't fool me. It's still a piece of silk. All right. You can open your eyes now. Am I promoted, teacher? Now, I'm going to ask you two more questions. How long is it since you first noticed these headaches? Oh, horrible months ago. About five or six. Have your eyes been bothering you for that long? No, that's only lately, in the last few weeks. Oh, that's a big help. Now I want you to tell me-- dr. Steele, if you don't leave immediately, you'll miss that train! Cancel the tickets. Doctor-- 

[00:25:00]


Steele: Never mind. There are other trains on other days. Yes, doctor. Thank you. Not at all. A few days one way or the other doesn't matter. I'm sorry I've been so difficult. You were a good sport. If I weren't that, doctor, I'm afraid I wouldn't be much of anything. Tell me. What's wrong with me? Is it my eyes? Well, I'd be a pretty poor excuse for a doctor if I told you before I was positive myself. Anyway, for the next few days, I want you to have some x-rays taken. Lots of them. Otherwise, you'll lead your normal life-- see your friends, give parties-- do everything you have been doing, with one exception. What's that? You've got to see a good deal of me. I bet you'll be a frost at a party. 
Judith: Thank you. Anything else, gentlemen? No. I think that's all. Can we go somewhere and talk for a moment? Yes. 
Judith: Yes. Come right in here in the sitting room. You'll find cigarettes on the table. 
First man: Thank you. Better put your shoes on. 
[Laughter from downstairs] hey! You guys, be quiet! There are doctors in the house! Hey, what have you got? I don't know. Maybe it's kittens. Well, what's the verdict? Dr. Steele will talk to you. Well, good-bye. Good-bye, miss traherne. I'll show the doctors out, judy. 
Judith: Right. Then come up, will you? All right. 
Man: Good-bye. Would you like a drink? No, thanks. Well? The prisoner will rise. The sentence? We've got to operate. Operate? On me? Where? No. Well, after all, the brain's like any other part of the body. Things get out of kilter, have to be adjusted. Oh, no, I won't! Ann! Ann! 

[00:27:16]


Ann: What's the matter? Come here! Quickly. Tell her. He wants to operate! Operate? Yes. On my head. Oh, no. You've made a mistake! I knew almost at once. I just wanted confirmation, that's all. What's she got? Yes, what have I got? Technically, it's called glioma. Glioma? Oh, don't listen to him! Sounds like a kind of a plant. Yes, it is rather like a plant, a parasitic one. If it's taken care of, why-- all surgeons are alike, judy. Don't be upset, darling. We can call in other doctors. We'll wait, hmm? Yes, yes, of course! But you have to face it sooner or later. Suppose we just don't talk about it anymore! What? Another headache, miss judith? No, not another headache. Yes, a big headache, and I want a bottle of champagne for it! 
Judith: I said no, and I mean no! 
Woman: Excuse me, please. She's very nervous, doctor. I can't seem to do anything with her. She wants to see you. Did she take the medication? Well, let's get her to sleep. 
Ann: You know, darling, it's still not too late to go home. May I come in? This is your doctor speaking. Yes. 
Judith: Hello. 
Steele: Well, how is everything? Everything's awful. Is it? Look what you make me wear. Oh, my. They are pretty dowdy, aren't they? I suppose you brought some nice things of your own to wear? Yes, I did. Some lovely nighties. In fact, I bought two new ones especially for...For this. Well, miss dodd, I don't see any particular reason why miss traherne shouldn't wear her own things, if she wants to. Martha! Martha, bring that over here. See? Oh, it's-- it's lovely. Yobetter turn your back. No. I think like this. Let's see. That's much better. There. Very pretty. Oh, thanks. Here's a present for you. Whats that? Something to make you sleep. Come o there. Thank you. But I don't want to sleep. Anyway, how could I in a two-by-four like this? At home, I have a bed that's big enough for six. Why, I can't even move. Now, just a moment. Just a moment. Let me show you something about this bed. Now, watch this. See that? Rest your legs. Now the back. There. That's for your back. Make you feel much more comfortable. Why, before you're through here, you'll want to take it home with you. That is much better. You know, I can't understand about me. I've never given in a fraction to anyone before, and here I am letting you bounce me up and bounce me down. Exactly where-- where does it happen? Here or-- now, now, now... That's my worry. How do you do it? What do you do? Chatterbox, aren't you? It is a distasteful subject, isn't it? Well, I don't care. I don't care about anything. This is a nice bed. It's a nice room, too. Ann, you're miles away over there. Come here. I love you, ann. I don't know what I'd do without you. I love you. Do you two like each other? Of course. Sure. Well, I want you to... Because I love everybody. Will they cut off my hair? Just a little. I don't want my hair cut off. It'll grow back. Of course it will. Silly of me. You know something? What? I feel sogood. Nothing to think about. You're going to sleep now. That's right. I must do everythingou say. I've put myself in your hands. They're rather nice hands... Good, strong hands. Doctor? Ye will you do something for me? Yes. When you get inside my head, see if you can find any sense in it. 

[00:32:40]


[Ring] dr. Steele? Yes, dr. Steele is all through in surgery seven. It's all clear. 
Man: How are you, doctor? Wednesday afternoon for everyone? All right, wednesday afternoon. Dr. Driscoll, was that the laboratory's last word? I'm afraid so. There's no hope? Nope. Those are the pathological findings. She's bound to get a recurrence. And that means... Oh...About 10 months. Invalidism, I suppose? No. I think it's a rare case. She'd apparently be as well as any of us. That is, until... Well, her sight may fail her near the end. Amblyopia. Yes. It'll only be a few hours after that. And I brought her into the world. Hang it all, steele, don't stand there saying nothing! It's a rotten business, doctoring. What's the matter, steele? Glioma. Malignant? A girl like that-- so alive, so entitled to live. Then this thing, this growth comes along and puts a period to it. Makes you almost wish it happened on the table. Are you going to tell her? Do you want her to know? No. Then there'your answer. Watch her temperature. I'll be back later. Yes, doctor. I brought that little girl into the world. Did you, now? 

[00:34:59]


Ann: Doctor! She'll be all right. How long? Oh, a few weeks' convalescence. Will she really be all right, just as she was before? I think I can promise a complete surgical recovery. You thinkso? What does that mean? Will she be well? Yes. Martha, look. It fits beautifully, doesn't it? Yes, miss. Couldn't tell a thing, could you? Thank you. That's very good. Behold. A new woman from top to toe. Don't get up, alec. New shoes, new stockings, new dress, new head. And a new disposition. What was the matter with my old one? 
[Ann whistles] like it? Oh, it's very nice. Oh, alec, behave! What was wrong with my old disposition? Never mind, darling. I've always loved you despite your faults. I got to get another drink. I have to go down, too. Come on, ann. Of all the cheek! What's the matter? It's michael.S taken to whistling for us Whistling for us? Oh, ann, it's challenger. 
Judith: Good afternoon, michael! 
Michael: Good afternoon, miss judith. How nice of you to bring him. Oh, you have got him in good shape, haven't you? 
Michael: Yes, your little horse is in fine shape. Turn him around so she can see him. But he'll still never be a steeplechaser. We're teaching him to crochet. He's working on a set of doilies. You'll take that back when he wins the national. Everyone around here is glad to see you back. Are they? How nice! Yes, indeed, they are. The boys at the stables, even the horses. Take your hat off 'm talking to a lady. 

[00:37:14]


Judith: I'm very glad. Thanks for bringing him. Anything for you, miss judith. Anytime. All right, take him on. Doesn't the world smell nice? I wonder where our new england friend is? Isn't that him coming through the gate now? Well, come on, then! Ann...Ann, do I look all right? Think I ought to change my dress again? There used to be six dresses on the floor. Now it's 12. You used to be mad. I don't know what that doctor's done for you. You're madder still. him and spoil it. I'm going to be very busy with my friends, and I'm not going to seem too anxious. And don't you be too anxious, either. Hi. 
Man: Judy! Carrie. Hello. Oh, judy, you've never looked better. Thank you. Oh, thanks, martha. That hair! How clever. Do you like it? Gwen! When did you get back? It's good to see you. It's good, honey. Really good! This house has been a morgue. Thank you, colonel. 
Woman: Oh, darling, frank will sell you those horses. Oh, how wonderful! I'll talk to you about that. I'm the business one. Let's have some champagne. Where can he be? He'll be here. Well, I'm going to have some. He told me I could. Will you? Yes, thank you. Thank you, agatha. Here's to me, to life. And may you never be ill again. Thanks. There he is. Have those things come yet? I don't know. Well, go see, will you? 
Alec: Colonel mantle, dr. Steele. 
Steele: How do you do? Speaking generally, I consider doctors a pack of frauds. Tried to tell me port is bad for my gout. How do you do, dr. Steele? Oh, hello, judith. How are you? Hello. Come on. That's my gang. They're here every day. Sit down, will you? Thanks. You're late. Yes. I was at the hospital. Were you? Mm-hmm. Have a drink? No, thanks. I had one. You said I could. Thank you again for everything-- for my horse, my first day, my drink. Been a good girl? No. Hmm. I thought not. Why? Well, I knew you wouldn't be. I knew you couldn't be. What do you mean, a good girl? Well, I am. The idea! Did you drive in for lunch and come right back home? Father, I cannot tell a lie. Uh-huh. What did you do? I bought these shoes. Oh...Very pretty. Very nice. What else? This...And some other new frocks I think you'll like. Oh, thanks for the two inches off my middle, and thank you for my life. What can I do for you? Oh, just wait! Why are you so grumpy? Oh, you always say I'm grumpy. Well, I've been a good girl until today. I've practically been your slave. And I am well. Look. Reflexes, terrific. Balance, perfect. And I can walk a straight line. I can even walk backwards. Excuse me, will you? They're here. The man wants to see you. Good. Now go in and look out for our doctor, will you? Kneel on him. Club him, if necessary, but make him have a drink, ann. Get that look off his face somehow. 

[00:40:36]


Ann: Penny for your thoughts? Oh, hello, ann. How are you? Hello. How are you? You look as if you needed a drink. No, thanks. What do you think of judith? Fine. You did that. You should be very proud of yourself. Yes. Dr. Steele, when you came down to judith's room right after the operation, you had a certain look on your face. I put it down at the time to the strain, the tension of the operation. I don't understand you. I saw that look on your face just now. I'm irish. I may be psychic and funn I'm probably quite wrong. Is there something-- something about judith that you're holding back? If there is, please, I am her best friend. Will you come outside, please? Then there is something. I can't save her. Nothing can. Nothing. What? She's going to die. No! No, that isn't true. You shouldn't have touched her! I'm not going to argue with you now. The facts are these-- i--well, I'll try to tell you in simple layman's language. You mean, she's going to have that pain again and that ghastly confusion? No. She's not going to suffer anymore. S all behind her now. Yes, but you told her she could ride. That's the freakish nature of this thing. She will ride. She'll seem well and normal, like everybody else. How long have you known? Since the operation. Why didn't you let her go then? I haven't jurisdiction over life and death. How will it come? Quietly. Peacefully. God's last small mercy. Will she have no warning, no chance to be ready? There may be a moment towards the end when...When her sight may not be quite as good as usual-- a dimming of vision. Then a few hours-- perhaps three or four. How long has she got? A year? Six months? Four? Possibly more. I don't believe it. Ann, she must never know. No. No. Boo! You sneaks, hiding out on me. What's the idea? Well, actually, we were talking about just how much you should do. I told him you'd had the devil of a day, but he said it didn't matter. It's been the best day of my life. This is for you. Oh, judith, you shouldn't. What's in it? A little gold and a lot of sentiment from a grateful patient. Look at that man! I thought a surgeon had to have such steady hands. Let me help you. Oh, thank you. Oh, well, they're very pretty. I'm so glad you like them. We couldn't think of anything else, could we, ann? Of course, it isn't enough, really. I've an idea. This is my birthday. What? Well, it is really, you know. My new birthday. Let's all three of us each year get together and celebrate, shall we? Come on. All right. 

[00:45:20]


Judith: Let's have some champagne right now and start. Come on, everybody, we're going to have some champagne. 
Alec: Where have you been, honey? 
Judith: Oh, outside. 
Judith: Now, I'll wear my green slacks in the morning and my big hat for lunch. He'll like that. I've got to look my best. If ever little judy had to knock them for a row of pins. Oh, agatha, here are the menus for the weekend. Martha, come here. Now, it's up to you. For evening-- ann, do you think we ought to dress for dinner tomorrow night? Give them a bit of swish? Just as you please, darling. Oh, no, I don't think so. They'll be tired. I'm getting to be such a hostess. This is my first real weekend. The house just reeks with dignity. Of course, I'll have the kids in. I'll always have them. I don't think he minds them. Do you? I don't suppose he will. What's the matter? Nothing, only I've got to get through these bills. It's the 10th of the month. You'll put on your best dignity, won't you? And help me keep dignified? 
[Laughs] well, I'm here, and I think I'm somewhere very nice. Look at me. I'm looking at you. You're in love. Yes. I thought so. What about him? Has he given you any encouragement? Not a ripple on the water. He drives me crazy, but-- but when I just think of him, i... And when I think if I hadn't fallen off that horse. It was awful, but it was wonderful. Life's a different thing. For the first time, I wake up in the morning with something to live for, something besides horses and hats and food. He's very fine, isn't he? Very worthwhile, isn't he? Oh, but if only the spaniards or the french had settled new england instead of the pilgrims. Yes, but if he hasn't given you any signs, how do you know? Well, that's it. I don't know. But he didn't go away. That's one sign, mr. Watson. It must mean something. Don't be against me. I'm not against you. Good. Ann... Will you do something for me? Of course. Well, I was just thinking you might take advantage of any lull in the conversation tomorrow just to mention what a good wife judith would be, what an ideal wife. Well, don't you think I would be? Oh, the best. Well, keep both fingers crossed for me. Ann, one day it'll happen to you. Then you'll know how wonderful it is. Martha! Martha. Murray hill 7-7340. 

[00:48:31]


[Knock on door] may I have miss judith's telephone book, please? Is that murray hill 7-7340? May I speak to dr. Steele, please? What is it? You and have got something to talk about. Yes? Does judith mean anything more toou than just a patient? Perhaps it's impertinent of me to ask you that. No, it isn't. I think I know. I think you do care for her. Yes, ann, I do care... So much. What are you going to do? Are you going to go up there this weekend and tell her... And hold her in your arms? Are you? Or are you going to go away and leave it to us? Which is better? I don't know. I haven't slept for two nights. Neither have i. This morning I saw it coming, and just now, a little while ago, I asked her to her face, "do you love him?" She answered, "yes, I do." It's up to you. She said that? You know, ann, before, women never meant anything to me. I'd never met anyone like her. I was all set. I had plans, made arrangements. I know. Vermont. Why don't you go away for your own sake and the sake of your work? Work. How can I work when I can't cure her? There's nothing else in my mind. I just sit here. I can't think of anything else. Oh, ann... I'd give my own body if I thought it would do any good. Isn't there anything? Anything? What's she ever done this should happen to her? She's never harmed a soul. She's never done anything to anyone except kindness. I know. Here...Look. Here's a letter I got today from vienna. The last finding in the case. There's the translation. "Not a chance in the world." I don't know where to look next. Here's this heinzig in vienna, the greatest in the world. 12 of them. "Prognosis, negative." "Negative." "Negative." Oh, I'm so sorry for you both. You couldn't marry her. You know what she'd expect of marriage: A home, children, plans for the future. You couldn't do that to her. The great thing, ann, is for her never to know. But could you stand watching her growing happier every day with this thing creeping up behind her? Could you stand that? I couldn't. It isn't a question of what you or I could stand. The main thing is for her to be happy... Every hour. Ann, all my life I've been able to tell people what to do. And now, i-- telephone, doctor. This is dr. Steele. Are you operating, doctor? Are you in your office, doctor? Well, there's a very good friend of yours waiting for you he, a very grateful patient. Well, you'd better hurry. I have a vague feeling of relapse coming on. All right, hurry up. Good-bye. Ann! Ann! She's out, miss judith. Where'd she go? Weren't you telephoning the doctor's office in there? Yes. Well, wasn't miss ann there? What do you mean? I heard her telephoning. She made an appointment. Said she was going down there. Today? Yes, just a little while ago. Oh, well, that' 

[00:53:19]


[car door slams] hello. Hello, judy. Where have you been? For a drive. 
Judith: Where'd you go? Town. What for? Shopping. What did you buy? Oh, i, uh... Ann, where did you go? Judy. 
Martha: Good afternoon. How do you do? Oh, hello. You did hurry. Yes. How are you, ann? 
[Door slams] did I stumble into something? Yes. We were on the verge of a jealous scene about you. What? Darling. Poor fool. Don't you know I'm in love with you? Would you like some tea or a drink? Tea, I think. Elizabeth. 
Elizabeth: Yes, miss judith? Bring us some tea, please. Yes, miss. Sorry. You couldn't have said anythi wanted to hear more. Judy, dear... I love you so much. Understand? 
Woman: Yes, miss wainwright. 
Judith: Hey, is anybody here? 
Wainwright: Oh, how do you do, miss traherne? Oh, hello, wainwright. How are you? Fine, thank you. The doctor isn't here. Where is he? I was to have lunch with him. Well, he wants you to meet him at the restaurant. I haven't had a chance to congratulate you. Oh, thank you. It's a strange world, isn't it? The first time I came here, you were packing, and it was the end of my life. Now you're still packing, and my life is just beginning. Couldn't I while I'm waiting? No, thank you. We're all finished...Well, almost. 

[00:55:45]


Man: All set, lady. Excuse me, please. Certainly. Now, youose boxes out and then come back. Yes, ma'am. You know, I darn near broke my neck to get that doctor of yours. I'm mad about him. Of course, it's the screwiest setup-- vermont and long island. We live in different worlds. I wonder if vermont and I will understand each other. What do you think? 
Wainwright: I don't know much about vermont except what he's told me. He loves it, doesn't he? 
Wainwright: Mm-hmm. Well, then I will, too. You know, wainwright, I'm going to sell my house, my apartment, and my horses-- all except challenger. I'll keep him. He's a champion. Am I disturbing you? Not at all. I'm glad he's going to give up cutting people open. He's one of the great scientists, and I'll be mrs. Pasteur. We'll be such useful people in the world. "To all to whom these presence shall come, greeting. "Be it known, frederick steele is a fellow of the something or other." I'll tend his house and-- and mind his books and-- and answer his mail and... "Judith traherne." Wainwright. Hmm? What does "prognosis" mean? It means what the future of a case looks like. What does "negative" mean? That's not so good. It means hopeless. 

[00:58:38]


[Door slams] 
Man: You were sitting at the bar! We've been looking all over this place for you. 
[Orchestra playing strauss waltz] take away the flowers, will you? Yes, miss. I'm awfully sorry, darling. I had a consultation. Gee, you look lovely. Have a drink. No, thanks. You should have one someday. I will. Perhaps on our wedding day. Our wedding day. What's the matter? Could anything be? How many of those have you had? Several. If I'm late, I'm sorry. Oh, ann, don't be sorry about anything. Sit down and join us. We're playing games-- hide and seek. You can play, too. Puss-in-the-corner. What's she talkg about? Nothing. Would you like me to leave? You two dear friends must have so much to talk over. My dearest friends. Have a cocktail, ann. I'm going to have another. Waiter. Yes, I'll have a cocktail. You sure you won't have one? Two of the same. They're fine. They deaden the brain. You know about brains. Ey loosen the inhibitions, make the tongue waggle. Are you sure you're feeling quite well, darlg? You should know how well I am. Am I well? Shh. It's a secret. Or don't you two know about secrets? Judith, will you-- judy, darling! Oh, carrie, dear, what a nice hat. You remember the eminent dr. Steele. Yes, of course. Judy says you're frightfully good. You must look me over sometime. Do sit down. Thanks. My dear, if you have anything wrong with you at all-- anything at all-- you must fly to him at once. Of course. Will I see you at the radcliffe hunt next week? Of course. Judy, you'll be in vermont. Oh, yes, vermont. I hear it's cold in vermont. In the winter, but it's nice. You must come to vermont, carrie. 

[01:01:13]


Carrie: Oh, I will, of course. Anyway, darlings, nice to have seen you. Good-bye, ann, doctor. I meant to ask you, doctor, will I be a specimen case? Will I be in the medical journal? Shall we order? Waiter. Would you mind telling me what this is all about? Why don't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me? Well, i... I think I'll have a large order of prognosis negative. What do you mean? You know, oeufs sur le plat. Prognosis negative! Do you know what "prognosis negative" means, doctor? Explain to her. Or have you? It means a few months of pretending you're well, then blindness, then-- judith, we can't talk in here! Oh, yes, we can. It was a question of humoring the patient, wasn't it? "Give the poor dear everything she wants. Time's so short. Marry her if necessary." I know now why you went to his office that day-- to beg him to marry me out of pity. The kind dr. Steele. You're both so kind. So long, my friends! Judith, you're wrong!

Man: Oh, good. Come back, and I'll meet you at the bar. 
Rider: Right-o. 
Man: Hello, judy. 
Judith: Hooray for me! Give me a light, will you? Thanks. Oh, judy, darling, you were wonderful! You drink the bar dry, but you still retain your seat. Hello, martha. Excuse me, miss. How's the old homestead? All right, miss judith. You know, I don't know how you do it. It amazes me the way you can stick on a horse. You know, I'm one of your best friends, darling. I don't care what people say about you. How nice of them. Drink the town dry. Take all their husbands and sweethearts. I still say it's none of my business, but-- then I'd agree with you. Well, of course, if you want to adopt that attitude-- you can already fill the yale bowl with people who are sore at you. One more doesn't matter. Martha, I can't possibly change unless i have a drink. 

[01:06:37]


Martha: Yes, miss. Miss traherne, could we have you now? No. I want another drink. Hello, judith darling. Hello. Miss judith. Yes, michael? I'm going along now. I've got the horses packed. It's snowing outside, so I want to get back before it gets too thick. Good. You did very well, miss judith. Thank you, michael. Oh, miss judith. What? I was wondering if you'd care to drive back with me. That little mare's got a bad case of bronchitis and can't possibly last the night. Hello, george. Jessica's girl? Yes. Why don't you put her out of her misery? I'll get there if I can. 
Woman: Judy, darling! Hello. Sit down, please. Hi! 
Alec: Hello, judy! Here's a tragedy for you. Jessica's girl has bronchitis and can't possibly last the night. Jessica's girl is a horse. Poor jessica's girl. The usual. 
Bartender: Yes, miss. Here we go again. Judy, darling! Yes? Trotty, trotty. Where's ann? 
Man: She blew. I guess the way you were riding, honey, sort of gave her the jitters. Poor ann. Miss traherne, please, they--they want you to come. I got you. The cup? Yes, the cup. I'll tell them you're coming. The cup. The darling cup. Excuse me, kids. I've won a prize. 
Alec: Hurry back. Mm-hmm. Well, if it isn't the extraordinary surgeon. I've been trying to see you. How's the mortality rate these days, doctor? Are you having fun with the knives? Drop it. Why aren't you in vermont with the bugs? You know why I'm not. I want to talk to you. When I need a doctor, I'll send for one. I'm not in your care any longer. You'll always be in my care. Will i? Is that part of your duty-- to hang on to the very end? To watch with those scientific eyes? Drop it! I know how you feel-- anything to strike back at me. But don't do it this way! What do you mean, this way? This. There's nothing in it. What do you want me to do? Stay alone in my room and think how in a few months-- judith, I want you to find peace. We all have to die. The tragic difference is that you know when, and we don't. But the important thing is the same for all of us: To live our lives so that we can meet death, whenever it comes, beautifully and finely. Beautifully and finely! I'll die as I please. Now, leave me alone. You hate me, don't you? Oh, yes, I hate you so much, and for so many reasons. I hate you for not telling me the truth. I hate you for letting me hurl myself at your head! I'm so ashamed! I can understand. Miss traherne, please, they're waiting! Oh, let them wait! They've got plenty of time. Oh, all right! Oh, wait a minute, judy 

[01:09:25]


Judith: No, no, I have to go in for the cup. Please. Yes. 
Alec: Dr. Steele, how do you do? Hello, alec. Can I buy you a drink? No, thanks. 
Man: Judy's certainly on this town, all right! Hey, you're talking about a friend of mine. Oh, yeah? Yes! 
Woman: Oh! Say! 
Woman: Well, what's the matter? 
Man: Oh, lady, he made a crack about judy, and the gentleman socked him. 
Michael: Do you think she'll pull through, doc? I think so. Respiration's easier. Yeah. Lucky we got her in time. 
[Door shuts] is she dead? No. It was touch-and-go for a while. It's more touch than go now. Whew! I actually said a prayer. She's game, though. Put up a brave fight. What, are you cold? I have a fire in the tack room, miss judith. Would you like to go in and warm yourself? Why not? 
Michael: Well, thanks, doc. 
Doctor: Call me if you need me. 
Michael: I will. Good night. Clarence, get yourself some blankets. 
Clarence: Yes, sir. 
[Turns on radio] first cold's always the bitterest. The first and the last. 
[Turns off radio] talk to me, michael. What shall I talk about, miss judith? Anything. Just talk. You know, it was a great show tonight. I came to think you may not be entirely wrong about challenger. Did you? I was scared, though. Was I that bad? No, but there's something about the way you ride that puts my heart in my mouth. Do you mind if I say something to you, miss judith? Of course not. I asked you to talk, didn't Oh, well, I think you've been going too hard lately, night and day. You can't do that and keep on with your jumping horses. It's terrible hard on you. I was hoping that maybe, in the state of mind you were in, you wouldn't ride tonight. A silver cup isn't worth it. I wanted that cup. I had to show the gentry I've still got what it takes. You sure have. I told you to keep on talking, michael. You know, you and I are kind of alike, miss judith. Are we? How? You've the spirit in you, the same as I have in me. It's the fighting that counts. You've got to have action in your life, the same as I've got to have action in mine. We only live once, miss judith. Just once. Tell me about you, michael. Me? Yes, you, as one human to another. We've always talked about horses. What's there to say? Well, do you have a happy life, michael? I guess I was born out of my time, miss judith. I should have lived in the days when it counted to be a man, the way I like to ride and the way I like to fight. What good's riding and fighting these days? What do they get you? What are you trying to do, burn us up? Are you afraid to burn, michael? Are you afraid to die? I wouldn't want to die while you're alive, miss judith. You're making love to me, aren't you? You invited me to talk to you as a man, didn't you? Yes. I'm as good as some of them that's been playing around with you. They're all afraid of you. Oh, I know. I've heard them talking. They'd go after you, but they're afraid of you. I wish to heaven I was in their boots. What then, michael? The nights I've laid awake thinking of you. The things I've wanted to say to you ever since I first laid eyes on you. You're afraid. No. Is it because I'm a stable hand? Is it? No, michael, it isn't that. I just can't go on this way. First it's this, then it's something else. Michael, I just can't die like this! Die? Yes. I'm going to die in a few months, michael. Oh, heaven forgive you for saying a thing like that. Yes. Heaven forgive me. When it comes... It must be met beautifully and finely. That's what he said. Oh, I'm all shot, michael! 

[01:15:49]


Judith: Murray hill 7-7340. Ann, you should be asleep. Poor ann. You've had so little sleep. Where did you go after you left the club? I've been so worried about you. To the stables with michael. Judith! Oh, don't worry, darling. I was saved. Course, for what I was saved isn't quite clear. Is that steele you were calling up? Doesn't matter. There wasn't any answer. This business of apologizing to a man really doesn't matter. Ann, I'm tired... So tired. Come along. Let me put you to bed. Why? I'll read you to sleep. Why? So I can dream? Oh, judith, my darling, please don't talk like that! Please don't! Ann, I don't know what to do. It's the waiting day and night. Would I be wrong if I made it happen...Now? Would i? Judith! Please don't talk like that. Don't! Please! 
[Sobbing] 
Ann: Don't. Please, don't! 
[Crying] you know, I see the dawn come up about four days out of seven in this place. Something always seems to happen. I don't know how it does, but-- say, can I fix you another drink? No, thanks. 
[Intercom buzzes] who can be calling at this hour of the morning? 
Alec: Hello? Judy! Yes, he's here. Come on up. You know, push the tenth button in the elevator. Judy? Yeah, it's judy. You know, doc, I've loved her for a long time, but I can't help her now because, well... You're the one man. So be nice to her, will you? All right. 
Judith: Hello, alec. 

[01:17:50]


Alec: Hello, judy. Hello, doctor. Hello, judy. This is a nice time to come calling, isn't it? Come in. You know, I searched half the town for you two. I even rang your night bell. I thought doctors were always on 24-hour duty. Well, as a matter of fact, alec very kindly asked me to come around here, and we've been talking. Did I interrupt something? Oh, to the contrary.Ou know-- say, the dawn's well up, and I was going to cook some eggs and bacon, and wouldn't you like some? Well, I just thought of it as a way to get me out of here. I'm kind of bright that way. Glad you dropped in, judy. Fix her a drink, doc. Shall I make one? No. No, thank you. You could do something for me, though. What? Forgive me? There's nothing to forgive. Oh, but... The things I said to you. Darling... It's good to say things. Gets them off your chest. I understood. Did you? Do you? Yes. You said you wanted to have peace. Where is peace? Within yourself. Judy, come here. I tried to do all the things I said I would. Tonight, i-- darling, there's been no one but you. Darling. How good it is to call you that again. I had to come and tell you--no one. See, I couldn't go on with the thought that you might be bitter toward me. I didn't want you to think of me like that. But I love you, judy I know you do. May I take back every rotten thing I ever said to you? Darling, help me. I've been so stupid. I've crammed every minute so full of waste... And now there's so little time left, and I don't know what to do. I'm afraid. You're so right and strong. It's all right now, judy. It's all right. May I see you sometimes? You're going to see me every day. You're coming to vermont with me. Am i? Yes. Maybe we'll find that peace there, together. No, that--that wouldn't be fair to you. We have so little-- forever, judy. Will you marry me? Marry? Oh, wouldn't it be marvelous if we could... Have a real wedding and be given away, and... And church bells and champagne and... And a white frock and orange blossoms and a wedding cake? That's one thing I won't have missed, and you're giving it to me. I can never love you enough. Oh, judy. Good morning, elmer! Blowy, isn't it? Sure is, mrs. Steele. How's the sciatica? Fine, mrs. Steele. Martha! 

[01:22:27]


Martha: Yes, miss judith? Here's a letter from miss ann. 
Martha: Oh, how nice. Is she coming down? Not yet, but soon, I think. "I'm still trying to rent the house, "but no one seems to have any money, and I'm not going to let tramps have it." Why do people complicate their lives so, martha? All those horses and that house. Here we have nothing, and yet we have everything, haven't we? 
Martha: I think you have, miss judith. I wonder she hasn't popped up to see you. You haven't seen her for three months. Oh, she'll be up soon. She wants to finish her work first. What's that? The doctor's lunch. Hasn't he had it yet? No. Why not? Well, I knocked on his door twice. I tell you, miss judith, when he gets busy with his bugs, he's like a bear with a sore head. Why, I wouldn't disturb him for-- 
Judith: Well, I'll disturb him. Am I afraid? Thank you, martha. Whoo! 
Judith: Hey! Your lunch, doctor. Oh, judy, I've told you-- you were rude to martha. I was not rude to martha. Martha knows, as you should know, that-- well, henry, the damage is done. What damage? Me? I've told you never to come in here when I'm working. This joint is aseptic. You're crawling with microbes--bugs! Me? Yes, you. Well! That's a fine way to talk to your wife. Coming in here with all this food. We've got too many bugs in here now. And just as I was about to discover the secret of life. Well, maybe not at this particular moment. Oh, but you will, and you might have. I guess it is my fault. Judy, darling! I am sorry. Oh, there's nothing to be sorry for. Your little bugs met my little bugs and the food's little bugs, and they all got together and had a party, and they're going to get so cockeyed drunk they won't be any use to anybody. You're mad! Oh, henry! Yes, doctor? Get that food out of there and prepare for another experiment. If at first you don't succeed, then try, try, try-- hey, just a minute. I'm hungry. Do you realize it's almost 2:00? 

[01:24:39]


Judith: Oh, no, no, don't you touch that! It's probably got some bugs in it. If the sandwiches' bugs got into your bugs, it's more than probable that your bugs got into the sandwiches. Just a minute! Give-- no. All right! All right, toughie! Oh! It's cold! What's new in the world? Guess what. I got a letter from ann. She's coming to visit us. Read it. It's in my pocket. What did you do this morning? Big things. What? 
Judith: I walked. Oh. Here, martha. Can't have that. It's got bugs in it. Where did you walk? To the village. We'll give you your lunch here. May we use your table, martha? 
Martha: Why, of course, miss judith. Sit down. What's new in the village? Well, there's a well-founded rumor that it will be twins for mrs. Dibble. Say, this is great. We'll give the old girl a field day, show her the great village of brattleboro--the shopping district, the city hall, and we'll even take her to the dance on saturday night. Ooh! Oh, now what? Come here. What did you do? Mmm. 
[Laughing] 
[horn honks] 
[honk] 
Judith: There you go, daf. Thank you, leonard. 
Steele: Well, here we are! Here she is, martha. 
Ann: Hello, martha. How are you? First rate. It's good to see you, miss ann. We're going to fatten her up and give her some country gravy. Oh, it's perfect! Don't you like it? Yes. Want to see my lab? Yes, I'd love to. Come on. 
Judith: Bring the things in, leonard. We'll unpack for you. Don't take her in. She's got bugs, too. 
Ann: Oh, this is nice. Ann, isn't judy beyond words? No blue moments at all? No. We never even think about it. In fact, we don't even talk about it, and you mustn't. Of course not. Not even with your eyes. You'll be tempted to, but watch yourself. You see, we just pretend that nothing's going to happen. Understand? Well, come on. I'll show you the rest of the place. Ann, this is henry curtiss. Miss king. How do you do? How do you do? Well, ann, how do you like it? Splendid! Well, someday, perhaps in my lifetime or somebody else's lifetime, we'll find a serum that will put an end to these growths. 

[01:26:57]


Ann: Hey, judy, your thing-a-ma-bobs have come. 
Judith: My what-a-bobs? YOUR SEEDS, YOUR FLOWERS, YOUR BULBS. Judith: How wonderful! 
Ann: Oh, here's a tongue twister: Incompara-- incomparabilis,silly. Oh, now, ladies, what kind of language is that? Incomparabilis. Incomparabilis. Oh. Listen, darling, be sure you plant them in the sun. I will. Oh, here's one for you-- jonquilla narcissus. Ah, that's a good one. I'll name a horse after that one. Go along! I'm going along right now. Good-bye, miss ann. Good-bye, mr. O'leary. And now to be serious for a moment. About the grand national. Ah, I knew there was some reason why you came up here, michael. I still think $1,000 entry fee is a lot of money to wa on that little horse of yours. Oh, but it won't be wasted. Bet you 6-to-4 challenger wins. You got a bet. Shake. Have a good time in philadelphia. Thanks. I'really excited. I'm going to wear all my best clothes, and we're going on a tear. Oh, miss judith, you're looking fine. Am i? Good. Yeah, sure. It makes me believe in those prayers I've been saying. So long, doc! Don't call him doc! That isn't respectful. See you at the nnal. Bye. Ann. There's a storm coming! What? It's getting darker by the minute. We'll have to take our raincoats with us. I suppose it'll rain cats and dogs and ruin all our nice bulbs. Look how it's clouding up. It's getting darker every second. It's funny. I can still feel the sun on my hands. Ooh! Judi 

[01:30:43]


Steele: Oh, it's futile, meaningless! Cruel! Not if you take revenge for it. Revenge? Yes, revenge! By going on with this work and these experiments, by wiping out the...Something that will take me from you...One day. And with each blow you strike, you can say, "that was for judith, my wife!" Come on! 
Judith: Lucy! 
Lucy: Yes, ma'am? 
Judith: Now, no more nonsense. You run off to new york and have your big moment, and I'll wait home, as a proper wife should. Darling. Yes? Tell me something. Have I been a good wife? Oh, judy. Oh, that makes me very happy... Happier than anything else. I've loved it so, every minute. How can I make you understand? Look out there. Somehow, it's been like that-- shining and quiet. Yes, judith. It has. Hasn't it? Nothing can hurt us now. What we have can't be destroyed. That's our victory, our victory over the dark. It is a victory because we're not afraid. Come on. I'm sorry. It must be the going-away. Judy, you're marvelous. Remember while you're away, tie your tie properly and brush your hair... And for heaven's sakes, buy a new hat! 

[01:33:04]


Steele: Why, that's a good hat! Well, I can't let you go in front of all those people looking like a country farmer. Come say good-bye to the old boy. Ann! He's off! 
Steele: Thanks, lucy. Darling, here's a list of places you can reach me. Oh, we won't need it. Run along. Drive like mad. Good-bye, ann. Take care of everything, won't you? Yes. Good-bye, darling. Now, mind yourself in the big city. I'll be all right, but it's going to be lonely. Don't tempt me. Get going. Bye! Hurry home! Have you planted the hyacinths yet? Yes. No, I don't know. Come on. I must help you plant them. You see, they're his favorite flower. You'll dig the holes, I'll put them in. I want to very much. Thank you. 
Martha: You didn't go, miss judith. No, martha. Come along, ann. You will water my flowers, won't you, ann? Take care of them. D, ann, you will take care of my doctor, won't you? He'll need someone. He mustn't be alone. You see, it's so much worse for him than it is for me. Oh, really, that's true. I'm the lucky one. All I'll miss is growing old and being tired and worn out. Never leave him, will you? I promise. Ah, don't. Don't, ann. I'm happy. Really, I am. Now, let me see if there's anything else. Oh, yes. One more thing. When michael runs challenger in the national-- oh, and he'll win, I'm sure he'll win-- have aty and invite all our friends. Now, let me see... Silly old alec, if he's back from europe, colonel mantle and old carrie and-- oh, yes, and don't forget dear old dr. Parsons. Give them champagne and be gay. Be very, very gay. I must go in now. Ann, please understand. No one must be here. No one. You see, I must show him I can do it alone. Perhaps it will help him over some bad moments to remember it. Ann, be my best friend. Go now. Please! 

[01:36:26]


[Children yelling] oh! Martha, miss judith. I'm going up to lie down now. Oh, miss judith. Daffy? Daffy! Don! Don, come here. Oh, darlings. Darlings. Now--now, go down now. Go on. Go down. Is that you, martha? Yes, miss judy. I don't want to be disturbed. erertz Tes

[00:12:33]


[??????...] 
>> Joan: Most of us d never leave the house without makeup, let alone appear on national tv without even a drop of concealer. But this group of daring women did just that as they bared all for our cameras and for murad's state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment. The women had their skin analyzed and measured for wrinkles, skin texture and hydration beforeer 30 days of ing resurgence. 
>> I can see that my lines are not as deep. I can feel my skin is smoother. But the computer also tells me that and the computer gives me numbers that are incredibly different from 30 days ago. 
>> What happens with hormonal aging is there's less estrogen in your body andrefore less in your skin. 
>> When you first came in, it was quite a bit and look after 30 days, the difference.

>> O.K., It's time now to meet the man behind the science. He is considered one of the world's foremost authorities on skin care and skin health. Please wme dr. Howard murad. 
[Cheering and applause, ??????...] 
>> so wonderful to see you! 
>> Now, it's been a little while since I've actually seen you, doctor, right? 

[00:14:35]


>> It has, and I have to tell you something. This is from my heart. You absolutely lk fabulous. 
>> Well, thank you. I mean, I have nothinge that I'm doing any different than just using my murad every morning and every night. I have not missed a day since i met you five years ago. 
>> What people don't quite understand is your skin is connected to every organ in your body. And when your hormones begin to diminish, you begin to have drier skin, more lines, pores begin to enlarge. And you just don't have that glow that you used to have. Unfortunately, most of the things that are out there that are being used just focus on one thing, but the whole system has to be addressed. 
>> And I think one of my main complaints to you when we first met was lack of hydration. 
>> And the moisture is a very critical part. The one thing that happens to us when we age is we become drier, all over the body, including the skin. The real issue is hormonal aging. As we encourage your skin to soak in some of the nutrients that I've developed in the products, the results are amazing. 
>> All right, so, we have some ladies in the audience and they'd like to ask you some questions. 
>> Oh, I'd love to hear some. 
>> All right, what's your name and what's your question? 
>> Hi, my name is betty and all the products I use make me break out or are irritating. Can I use resurgence sensitive skin? 
>> Absolutely. We have ingredients like avocado, wild yams, soy extracts... Many agents that soothe the skin and make it feel wonderful. So it really works well for somebody who has sensitive skin as well as hormonal aging. 
>> All right, we've got another question out there. What's your name? 
>> I'm davina, thank you joan and dr. Murad. I seof the skin care infomercials and I'm wondering what makes resurgence better than the other products that are available on the market today? 
>> O.K., Wait a second. May I step in on this one? 
>> O.K. [Laughter] 
>> o.K., Because it really matters to me. It is based on one thing only: Results. 
>> Dr. Murad: And really, it's not typical of infomercials, because it's based on years of research, years of actually looking at patients and seeing the results and looking at all the different attributes of the formula, making sure it was something that was perfect for what hormonal aging is. 

[00:16:46]


>> When I heard about hormonal aging, I really didn't know that much about it and it was great to learn more about it and i thought, "well, I'm 39, could i really have hormonal aging, is this what's going on?" And it was great to find a product that actuahelps fight hormonal aging. 
>> At 48 years old, I was gonna give up. My skin was dry, dull, spotty and I started looking like my mother. Sorry, mom. I thought, wl, maybe this is what I'm supposed to be, I mean, there wasn't a whole lot I could do. But since I started using the resurgence product, I look younger, I feel better, I feel better about myself. I know that I'm gonna use this product for the rest of my life. 
>> The wrinkles have disappeared and the suppleness has returned. My husband actually cupped my face in his hands and said, "girl, you've never looked better." 
>> Female announcer: Now it's your turn to get skin this beautiful with murad resure.

Doubling young people is my bread and butter, and resurgence is really gonna help me to continue to look youand I like to take very good care of my skin because I'm still a woman at the end of the day, even though I do stunts. 
>> My a-ha moment when I knew resurgence was something special was when my "spa girlfriend", the one who's tried every expensive product under the sun, after I'd only been using the product one week, came up to me and went, "what are you doing? What are you on? What have you done? What have you had done?" And I go, "oh, it's the new resurgence line that I'm using." 
>> There's a certain point where you think, I'm just getting older, there's nothing do. But it's so woerful to find someing that makes it softer, that makes it easier, there issomething I can do. I'm not going to look 30, I don't expect to look 30, I don't even want to-- but to look young for my age is great. Thank you, dr. Murad, for caring about women of all ages. 
>> Now, doctor, I know that you and your team at murad get thousands of letters from women,me but they shared one with me that I want to take a moment and just share it with all of you today.

Ck as I was, I broughtll my resurgence products and I would climb out of my hospital bed and put the resurgence on. And the nurses would come in and they'd say, "you'd never know what you've been through because you look so healthy. What are you using on your skin?" So I said, "well, let me tellyou about it." 
[Laughter] 
>> it's so powerful ou get up in the morning and you look in that mirror--

[Laughter] 
[cheering and applause] 
>> Joan: Most of us would never leave house without makeup, let alone appear on national tv without even a drop of concealer. But this group of daring women did just that as they bared all for our cameras and for murad's state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment. The women had their skin analyzed and measured for wrinkles, skin texture and hydration before and after 30 days of using resurgence.

>> I will never put anything else on my skin other than resurgence for the rest of my life, and I can't believe I'm saying that on national tv with no makeup, but it's true. 
>> It's just this healthy, hydrated look and I love that. 
>> I feel younger, I look younger-- I love how my skin looks! 
>> I'm 52 and I have a nine-year-old daughter, I'm an older mom, so when I go to the school to pick up, I'm probably with around 30- to 32-year-olds. I have seen dramatic results in less than 30 days. A lot of the moms have come upto me and said, "josie, what are you dointo yourself?" It's just, it's been exciting and my daughter marissa is like, "my mom's doing something really different!" It is the best product I've ever seen.

Announcer: 29-year-old Ray and 27-year-old Jeanita met at a party nine years ago. They expected to have a one-night stand and go their separate ways. But the relationship stuck. And when they soon learned they were pregnant, they quickly married and welcomed two children. But the good times came to an abrupt stop when Ray learned his wife was pregnant again, by another man. (choked up): I've been struggling, trying to... trying to live with it, but... it's been a problem for me. He never supported me, way before I even cheated. He never told me that, you know, he cared about me all the time, he neverold me that he was gonna be there. Announcer: Ray says he can forgive but not forget. Today onDivorce Court. Bailiff: All rise! Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge Lynn Toler presiding. You may be seated. Toler: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. I'm here today with Raymond Miller and Jeanita Miller. Mr. and Mrs. Miller, you have been married seven years. You have two children together, and you also have one child, uh, that, uh, you're both raising from a previous relationship. You, uh, don't want to be married anymore. And you want me to resolve an issue with respect to some automobiles, as a function of this divorce. However, before we get to that, I would like to know a little bit about your marriage, and why we're here in divorce court. So, Mr. Miller, I will start with you. Why don't you tell me how we've ended up her Well, Your Honor, I'm here today because I'm tired, and I want to, uh... pretty much end my relationship with my wife. I mean, I've been tired for a long time now, and it really all started a couple years ago, back in 2007. Uh-huh. Um... I decided that I wanted to change my life for the better, and I admitted that I had a probl and I wanted to fix everything, and try to make our family better. Okay. You know? And, um... What was the nature of your problem? I had an addiction problem. Uh-huh. 

[00:02:00]


So I decided to admit myself to a 21-day rehabilitation program. Uh-huh. During this time, she, uh... decided she was going to go live with her family in Kansas City. Mm-hmm. And... Uh, this 21-day program-- uh, period-- she met another man, ended up cheating on me, and having another baby by, uh, by this man. (chokes back sobs) And, uh... it's really bothered me since then. You know, I've been struggling, trying to... trying to live with it, but it's been a problem for me. Are you raising that baby now? No, I'm not. I told her at the time that I was going to be willing to do that for her. Um, she... That's not true, Your Honor. Wait, I'm gonna get to you. You hang on. She's lying. You know, there's always lies, but... But what happened? Did... you didn't raise the baby? Did you give.... Well, what happened is she decided to give the baby up for adoption. And, uh, it actually went to a close friend of the family, so the baby's actually still in our lives to this day. So you see him. Yeah, we see him at least once or twice a year. And, um... Is that hard? That-that is... hard, but I've learned to try to accept it, and... But it's really been hard for me. It's hard on you. Mrs. Miller, why don't you respond to what happened? Is it... is it true that you did have a baby with another man while he was in rehab? Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your Honor, it is true that I had another baby by another man. It's not true on the part that he wanted to help me with the baby. Well, let me ask you this, let me ask you this: when he found out that you'd done that... You understand that's a huge betrayal. That is a huge betrayal. I mean, tremendous. When he responded, did he respond with anger, and-and-and push you away, or did he say he was gonna try? What was the nature of his response? He did not say he was gonna try to help me raise the baby, at all. But you can understand that, though... I said it was best on.... ...Mrs. Miller, though, can't you? It was best on my part to give the baby up for adoption, because it wouldn't look right in our relationship. 

[00:04:00]


It wouldn't. What did you expect of him in response that you don't feel you got? Uh... I expected that he would just support me on this. Uh-huh. But it wasn't... I could've supported you. That's a tough thing to support somebody on, don't you think? Yeah. I mean... I mean... it's kind of tough. I mean, 20... he was gone... 21 days he was gone. You know, three weeks. But that's not the only reason why he was gone for that. Well, why don't you explain to me what other reasons. He never.., he never supported me, way before I even cheated. He never told me that, you know, he cared about me all the time, he never told me that he was gonna be there. That's not true. He was always leaving all the time, leaving my two, the two that we... actually, the three that we currently have, and he was always in the street. When you say "leaving," what do you mean? Did he say... Like going with his friends, going to strip club, doing everything that he wanted to do. But you didn't... And so I felt like, that this relationship sn't going anywhere. Okay. Now, Mr. Miller, do... Now, first of all, nothing makes what she did okay. get that part. Right. But what I'm asking you is... She says she felt unloved before you even went into rehab. Before all this happened. Do you understand that that's how she felt, and can you see how she felt that way? I guess, in a way it does. I mean, were you a party boy? You say you had an addiction, right? Yeah. Yeah. I like to go out and kick it, you know. And people who are... you know, in the arms of an addiction, are often, you know, not real good partners. Right. But what makes it bad is I understood that, I accepted that I had a problem, you know? And I was willing to make the changes to try to fix our problem. Mm-hmm. You know? I try to put us together as one, and she always separates us. Announcer: WhenDivorce Court continues: Did Ray's drinking drive Jeanita into the arms of another man? The only time he's affectionate towards me is when he drinks. And when he's drunk, it's just... it's not happening for me. Yes. It's... just... It's just not there. I don't get in the mood for that.

Divorce Court is back with the case of Ray Miller who's divorcing his wife because she had a baby with another man. But has this union been Ray's way or the highway? Tell me what it is that he isn't doing that makes you feel so abandoned and alone. It's just things that he wants to do all the time. It's never wt I want to do all the time. Mrs. Miller, let me paint a picture for you. You got a guy who may not have been the most caring and loving and sympathetic husband, you know, when he was in the throes of addiction. You had another baby on him while you were married, and he is currently raising a baby that you had with another guy previously. Which is a good thing to do, and your two. Do you appreciate and respect how much that takes for a man to do that? I always appreciate him. It's not like I never appreciated things he did for my first son. He took him in when he was 18 m I never doubted him once ever. So tell me what it is that he isn't doing that makes you feel so abandoned and alone. It's just things that he wants to do all the time. It's never what I want to do all the time. It's always what he wants to do. Do you understand what she just said? Yeah. Tell me what she just said in your own words. She saying I'm not trying to include her in on the decision-making of the family. That's not what she said. What'd she say? Not what I said. That's not what she said. What she said was... ...you do what you want, and she never gets to do what she wants. But what I wan I always try to include the family. It's not me personally. But that's not the point. The point is it can't always be what you want. Sometimes you have to do what she wants because that's what a relationship is. u can't say, "This is what I enjoy, and I'm going to allow you to come with me." 

[00:10:45]


Sometimes you have to say, "Oh, I see you enjoy that. Let me come with you." That's what she's trying to tell ya. Do you hear that now? Yeah, I hear you. You say he's not affectionate towards you. Explain that to me. The only time he's affectionate towards me is when he drinks. And when he's drunk, it's not happening for me. Yes, it's just... I don't get in the mood for that. I just throw that out the window all the time. That's when he's more loving. That's not how it should happen. It should happen every day. You know, be more affectionate. Sitting on the couch with me and watching a movie. Be more affection... Just sitting close to each other, that's affection I want. Just sitting close. Just hold my head. Just sit next to me. I want him to hold my hand. Hold my hand in the store. Hold my hand in the store. You know? Just do the things, the little things. But you say she pushes you away. Explain that to me. Pushes me away. When he's drunk. Any time I come up to her, to try to give her a hug or try to kiss her on the neck, you know, show some little lovey-dovey type. You know how a man does it. Lovey-dovey sober. That's all I'm asking. Are you lovey-dovey sober? Or does that only happen when you been drinking? It's not as much. It only happens when he drinks. I'm more outspoken or out... Outgoing, extroverted when you're drinking. It seems to open me up a little more. Do you see we don't like that? You see why I push you away. I'm just gonna tell you now. We don't like a drunk guy... (mumbling) You see why I pushed him away. We don't. And the thing is, and the thing is, women are very cheap dates if you do us right. We really are. We don't take much. But it's those little... Because you don't see the value in those little cheap things that we want, you don't tend to do them. But if you just-- sober... "Hey, baby, how are you?" I try to do things sober. 

[00:12:46]


Trying is not the issue. That will make her feel good. That will resolve a lot of that pushing away. It's really at a alcoholic level because of how I feel from the past thin I try to cover up how I really feel to be somebody else. Announcer: WhenDivorce Court continues: Has Jeanita betrayed Ray again? My understanding is from your papers, you got your tubes tied without even discussing it with him.

But has Ray kicked his bad habits? I think you love that woman, but you don't know how to cope with your pain 'cause it's too scary to cope with it, so you drown it instead. Do you do substances to avoid feeling pain? Are you running from what hurts you all the time? Yeah. That's basically the problem. Do you think that might be it? I think so. 'Cause what I did in the past. And when you run from how you feel, you can't cope with how you felt about something that hurt you, so it stays there. It doesn't get better, it doesn't go away. You can't conquer it, you can't get past it 'cause you never work with it. You just, you just cover it up with booze. And you can't get what you want becaushaven't dealt with how you felt, right? Yeah. Yeah. And you can't get what you want that way. I think you're a good guy. In fact, I think you're a great guy. I think you love that woman but you don't know how to cope with your pain, 'cause it's too scary to cope with it, so you drown it instead. Did I get that right? Yes, you did, Your Honor. Yes, you did. (applause) Now, Ms. Miller, I have to say this about you, though: You seem to be a little self-involved yourself. My understanding is, from your papers, you got your tubes tied without even... discussing it with him. That's a lie, Your Honor. 

[00:19:07]


(gallery murmurs) That's a lie, Your Honor. We was right in front of the doctor when I asked him, "Do you want your tubes tied?" And he said, "I don't care. Do what you want to do." And so I did. I said, "Forget it." I'm just gonna get my tubes tied. I probably said that out of anger at the time. Anger or not, we're sittin front of a doctor-- asking you-- I'm asking you because this is us. This is our relationship, anger or not. I d you over and over, "Do you want me to get my tubes tied?" And I said okay to the doctor, I'm gonna get my tubes tied. She knew I wanted more kids in the long run. You should've spoke up. But did you know he really wanted kids? He... did want more kids. You know... you can't-- oh, that was a convenient out. You knew he was angry; you knew he was speaking out of anger; you should've backed up and said, "Hey, look, let'lk about this." I mean, you can get your tubes tied anytime. We could've, but at that point, I was just tired. I was tired. Of having babies? Toler: Huh? She said-- tired of having babies? Tired, just tired. It's more stress, itn me, and now I realize that, you know, having babies is expensive; very expensive. Oh, that's so true. That's very expensive. They're expensive, they're a lot of work... they're, you know, I mean, they're just... you know. (gallery laughs) I mean they're no joke, right? I know. Announcer: WhenDivorce Court continues: Is it time for Ray to forgive and forget Jeanita's past indiscretion? Say, "Look here... "you love me or you don't. "I did the best I can, I'm as sorry as I can be. Let's walk forward or walk away." Do you think that today's couple should work through their problems and stay together? Call: ...to vote now and see if America agrees with your opinion. You'll also receive some valuable offers.

But you're, like, "Hey, man, let's do something with this." So let me talk about the arbi... the arbitration. Mister... Mr.-Mr. Miller, you're suing. You want $3,500 from her for the Cadillac DeVille that you say she left in front of a family member's house and was stolen. Tell me about that. JEANITA: Your Honor, that car wasn't stolen. Ray: Let me, let me explain. During the time that, uh, that I was in the rehab program, uh, she, uh, took my car to Kansas City with her, and, uh... You just cut loose and went wild when he went into rehab, didn't you? Your Honor, can I...? TOLER: Yeah, Ionna let you. All right. She probably felt like king of the world. She was free, she had a nice ride, didn't have no man looking down her shoulder... and next thing I know, my Cadillac's missing-- where's it at? How does it just disappear in the middle of nowhere? She had no explanation. I still, to this day, don't have a explanation of where my car is at. What do you know about what happened to the car? I went, when I went down to, to down with, uh, relatives... the car was with me. At that point in time, we had a debt that needed to be paid. 

[00:27:15]


I paid it the first time, but I couldn't pay it the second time. The car got-- the belt broke off of the car, so it'd sit. I went down to another, uh, other family, and at that time, I just left the car there. I couldn't take it with me, I couldn't fix it, I didn't have no money, so, yehe car was left. He think it was stolen, it wasn't stolen. I think they repo'd it. Because we owed on it. Toler: Here's what needs to happen: You both need to go into counseling individually to shore up the holes that you have in your souls. I mean, you just need to do that. (applause) And then, once you get that done, you need to go into counseling, marriage counseling, together, so you know how to communicate with one another and talk to one another... 'Cause we're not very communicative. Toler: No, no, I know you can't, but you guys got a whole lot of homework to do in your own heads before you deal with each other's. I'm not gonna deal with this car business. I'm just not-- you know, it's, uh... who knows what happened to the car? Who knows? No one knows what happened to the car... A UFO could've came and... picked it... ...you were married at the time, and it was a mess. I heard it was repo'd. Toler: It doesn't even matter. You guys got a lot of work to do on your own selves, and then you have to work on your marriage, but I'm not gonna give anybody any money today. You gonna work on it? Yeah. You really should...

=======================================================

Cia's role in the benghazi attack and what it m for director petraeus. Let's go "outfront." I'm erin burnett and good evening. "Outfront" tonight, bloomberg comes to his senses. After days of standing his ground despite anger, tration and resentment, the new york city mayor late tonight canceled sunday's marathon. It is the biggest in the world. He said we cannot allow a controversy over an athletic event to distract attention away from the critically important work being done for the storm. The controversy, holding a marathon with all the generate rs, food, water and police that requires as new yorkers still reel from sandy. On stateland today, there was this message for the mayor. After what we heard from person after person there. We were there again today and met this owner of a local garden inn. This hotel is overflowing with people sharing rooms. Every one of his rooms, people there have nowhere else to go. Richard refused to kick them out to make room for the marathon runners that were supposed to stay there. 
>> People are dying on staten island. They are dying. And I have a dilemma, do I pull people out who have no place to go to make room for marathon runners? I don't think so. I'm not doing it. I can't do it. 
>> While victims on staten island and many other new yorkers are relieved the mayor canceled the marathon, the news was hard for some. When our producer broke the news to this runner, tears filled her eyes. 
>> They're pulling out bodies of little children and us runners are going to walk through and run through their neighborhood in our fancy marathon outfits like nothing happened. Let me tell you, the mayor made the right decision 24 hours too late. 

[00:02:06]


>> Emotions are running very high tonight. The long lines for gas are not getting any shorter. For a third straight day, they lined up waiting hours and hours to get to the pump before the gas runs out. A lot of them are running out of gas before they even get to the gas station. The government says it's trying to make sure fuel gets there more quickly, they're trying to lift restrictions on nonamerican tankers. Some might say why didn't that happen sooner and for some, the progress is not happening fast enough. We're hearing stories of fights. In one case, a man pulled out a gun in a fight for gas in queens. But the problem isn't just getting fuel to the gas stations. The problem is getting power there. It will make a lot of the gas stations start working like that. 3.2 million customers are without power and the majority are in the new york and new jersey areas. Those are people filling up those containers for generators. We brought you stories of desperation on staten island last night. Frustration at the slow response. People I spoke to there call it forgotten and said they were being treated differently. Today, some of their cries for help were heard. Just hours ago, janet napolitano went to staten island to view the clean-up and she assured the island's residents they have not been forgotten. 
>> We know that staten island took a particularly hard hit om sandy. And so, we wt to make sure that the right resources are brought here as quickly as possible to help this community, which is so very strong, recover even more quickly. 
>> Brian todd is live on staten island and brian, what is the situation there tonight? 
>> Erin, the same here is still one of devastation. You've got scenes like this behind me. This house on cedar grove avenue and many others like it. Either completely velled or in a condition that's thot much better than that. This neighborhood has seen some signs of life, of hope, after a couple of days of just real despair and feeling cut off at the lack of relief agencies here. We've had new york city bulldozers, sanitation trucks, dump trucks here clearing off this neighborhood. The national guard was on the ground all day today and there have been some shelters set up a little less than a mile from here run by thred cross and fema and janet napolitano was on the ground. Those are all important steps at the very least symbolically for the residents of this neighborhood who have felt cut off. They're still kind of angry that it took so long to get here, but fema and the red cross are on the ground right now, so that's a positive step. The thing to rememr, the fema facility, red cross, they're about a mile away from here. A lot of the people in this neighborhood don't necessarily know they're there because they have no tv, no internet, no phonrvice. Little cell service, so word of mouth isn't getting around to quite as many people as maybe as those who could use that facility over there. So that's still a challenge for the red cross and fema to serve people inside this neighborhood and get aid to them when people don't necessarily know they're only about a mile away. 

[00:05:41]


>> Thank you very much. As we said, so many were frustrated, but they're there now trying to help. A lot of people there have trouble communicating. A these are areas where there's a lot of poverty and that's something that is similar to another part of new york tonight crying for help. In additionly to breezy point queens, the rochaways in queens are desperate for assistance. There is no power, no food, no clean water. Not a place you've heard a lot about. It's home to 120,000 people, but more than half of them live below the poverty line and that is making a desperate situation even worse. "Outfront" tonight, the ressman who represented the area. You were out visiting with the constituents today. The situion is desperate. 
>> It is very bad. People feeling neglected. A number of public housing developments. No power, young children, cold, don't know what tomorrow is going to bring. And no food. Because they're isolated. On a peninsula that has no train service anymore. No gasoline and there's no place to go. So they have not ate literally. Don't have anything to eat for the last three or four days. Fortunately today, there were trucks. Fema did deliver some trucks and there was food being delivered. Working, he was able to get jet blue and delta airlines, it to give them praise because they brought in food and were feeding some, but it's still similar. People don't know. We've got to get the word out, but there's no electricity. No telephone. No internet access and trying to get the word ond they're frustrated. 
>> What are the biggest frustrations they have? 
>> One, first thing is -- and then at night, because of the security, you know, you've got individuals that are concerned about security. You've got some who still want to go back to work, there's no bus. The bus service, the last bus leaves at 5:00. So folks facing isolated after that. Some people work late. Some need o to work early. That's over. You have I saw today fortunately, some of the shop owners had genors and they allowed some of the residents to come in and just get some warmth and plug in and charge their cell phones so they could trto communicate with someone. It's tough situation. 

[00:08:09]


>> And it's hard, too. These are the awkward things to talk about, but th is a place where half the people are below the poverty line and that plays a part in this, in their voices being heard. 
>> What's concerned is people are hungry. You know, some others -- start breaki or looting or anything of that nature, we want to make sure that does not happen. And so, you know, there are some national guard out there and i had a chance to talk to some of them. They said they need some other and I got to say, people do not want to be forgottbout. 
>> But who's blame for this happening? The disaster is in so many places. Some places get help more quickly. Who's to blame for the neighborhood not getting what it needs more quickly? 
>> I don't necessarily put blame on someone. I'm an elected official. We have to do more. We've got make sure they know that the people exist. I've been able to communicate with the govr's office. They have been very concerned. I had an opportunity to talk today to secretary donovan of hud. And I believe he's going to come in tomorrow. We're going to try to -- resources there. So, it's just we've got to make sure that no one is left behind. No one is forgotten about and everybods some kind of special circumstances. And these individuals, there are seniors that need help and assistance. And have the problem this, that no one on the peninsula has power, but some still have water in their becames, some of the mes. When you talk about turning the power on, you've got to have generators out to get the water out first so when the power comes on, there's no chance of being electrocuted. Hard working class people lost everything. When I was out there, many were saying thank god you came. They're working and it's a difficult situation. Thank you for being out here. We know there's going to be some help, but we need it in short order. 

[00:10:44]


>> I hope the people hear you tonight and all the organizations can get out there. Thanks so much. We appreciate your time. It has been a very tough week with many storie anguish and loss, but today I witnessed totally up expectedly a bright light of home. The story coming up. 
>>> Up next though, john king with a brand new poll out of ohio. How close is the rac the buckeye state. And later, the obama administration gets a boost from today's jobs report. So, this is not something I want to say, but I didn't say it. Someone in the campaign said it. Why are they talking about the president's loins?L. And tea parties. I'll have more awkward conversations than I'm equipped for because I'm raising two girls on my own. I'll worry about the economy more than a few times before they're grown. But it's for them, so I've found a way. Who matters most to you says the most about you. Massmutual is owned by our policyholders so they matter most to us. Massmutual.

[00:12:44]


>>> OUR SECOND STORY "OUTFRONT,"find their own path. All of US serving you. US Bank 
>>> Our second s "outfront," four days before the election, new cnn poll in what probably is going to be the most crucial swing state of all. We say probably. Most people say definitely. 50 to 47% with the president ahead. Within the margin of error. John king is in cincinnati tonight. John, another poll neck and neck, probably be a very long night on election night. What stood out in that poll to you? 

[00:15:08]


>> It is remarkable. If you look deep into the poll, the president might have a slight advantage, but this is a classic swing state and we have a dead heat. The president's getting the democrats. Governor romney's getting the republicans so you want to look at the middle. 48% for goveor romney. 46% for the president so a dead heat. Both candidates are in the state today and will be back to make their case. Because of ohio's diversity, what's the demographic composition. Among nonwhite voters, he's getting 70% of the vote. Cleveland, columbus, here in cincinnati. A growing latino population. The president starts with a head start. The white vote, 44% to 53% for romney. I wouly this. If governor romney can keep the white vote closer to 40%, he has a chance and getting minority turnout, ts the president's recipe for success four years ago. 
>> I know that is so crucial when you look at ohio, what do you see there? 
>> The reason, it has -- you look at a couple of different places. The north of the state. Cleveland, over to toledo. A place where we think we see evidence the auto bailout is helping. Across the industrial north. That means a lot of blew collar white voters supporting the president. Then you come here to the southwest corner of the state.Ncinnati is in hamilton county. It was blue four years ago. The state including cincinnati, 52% for the republicicket, 47% for president obama. Mitt romney -- it's a classic swing state, both campaigns essentially getting what they need where they need it. Who can turn out the vote. 
>> And turn out the vote comes down to the ground game and they are saying we have a better ground game, more people. 
>> I see the president has head start in early voting and that's important because his coalition includes college students and african-americans, people less reliable to turn out on election day, so that head start helps the democrats and president there. I was here four yearo. I like to retrace my steps to see how it feels now compared to then. IT WAS CLEAR john McCain was toast and the president was going to carry ohio. It's a lot different this year because the romney campaign have enough to get over the top, that's the question we'll answer in the next hundred hours or so, but the intensity at the romney campaign was off the charts. Governor romney's expecting some 30,000 people in ohio tonight not that the ohio people aren't working hard, too. They have a very impressive obama operation, but the republican operation compared to four years ago, it's not a comparison. Much better. We're going to have an interey come tuesday. 

[00:17:33]


>> It's going to be exciting for the whole country. 
>>> Last minute moves. A strategy that's either desperate or brilliant, depending on who you ask. Mitt romney is making an 11th hour push for pennsylvania. A jackpot with 20 eltoral votes. Pouring 6 million into the state on advertising. He's never led in a single poll there since he became a nominee. Cnn has that in the obama category, but the president's lead has been shrinking and polls show president obama had been up as much 11 and 1 points over the summer and fall, but in a quinnipiac poll, he was only up by four. Paul and ryan along with john avlon in toledo, ohio. Romney has outspent the president in pennsylvania since he became the nominee. I saw this. I was stunned when our producer looked at these numbers. Of the 15 million tol, jin this week alone. Is this money well spent? 

[00:19:44]


>> I think it makes a lot of sense for this reason. Now,t's true that ohio might be a tighter state, but the on is, it's the marginal benefit. Mittomney spent a ton of time in ohio and if spending an additional few hours as we get closer to the election could make a big difference in pennsylvania gen he has spent far less time in that state, that's what you've got to think about. Real aional hours in ohio make that much of a difference there, where as in pennsylvania, it could be a difference in defeat. It's 20 electoral votes versus 20 in ohio. This could really scramble the map. 
>> I'm going to look at the map in a second, but first, paul, i want to go to you. Mitt romney has put 2 million ads worth in pennsylvania over the past week and become's going to campaign fohim on monday. He had a much, much wider lead in the summer. How did he lose the lead? 
>> It's a tough race, tough year. He's not going to win by whatever he won last time. This ibad move for romney. It's going to disappoint the people in places where he might have a chance, iowa, colorado, florida. Pennsylvania's not gone for a republican for president since reagan and bush and when bush sr. Carried pennsylvania, he also carried california and illinois and new jersey, places where they would hunt romney down with dogs. Thisnot like the map he needs if he wants to win pennsylvania. I don't really wish him well, I don't wish him any ill. But he's wasting money. 
>> What's the strategy, john avalon. Had and in will had had had you're in ohio tonight. Is the push in pa a a sign of weakness in ohio? John king's talking about he feels it's neck and neck, erent than he felt in the last election, but do you think that? 

[00:21:49]


>> President obama has had a small but steady lead in ohio. We think the romney campaign i looking at a saturation point. There's not much more than you can do except get out the vote. With money, the with the candidate's time more importantly, I think speaks to change the strategy because the current strategy isn't working. Theylooking for alternate paths to 270. States where it looked like romney was pulling ahead in. Florida, virginia, colorado. The fact the romney campaign is running an ad in florida trying to tie the president to castro and chavez speaks to insecurity on his part about whether the cuban population will come out to vote. I think this is evidence of a scramble to hit 270. 
>> And let's look at the map. I promised I would. Paul and ryan. If romney could pull off a win in pennsylvania, this does make the path to 270 completely different. So, he wouldn't even need ohio. We have 237 for obama, 206 for romney. 95 up fograbs, so if romney gets pennsylvania, we call it a snatch because it's very difficult to do, he's in the lead. 226 to 217. So then it becomes easier. He gets florida, colorado, virginia and he wins. He doesn't need ohio. Is that his best hope because that sounds like a difficult task. 
>> And you have republicans in pennsylvania much beer than anyone expected and that's kind of softening the demonstrates there might be an opportunity there. It's possible the republicans will lose, but if you get a better result than you did in 2008, you're build ago future and for the parthat makes a big difference. Losing by a few points rather than 10 or 11, that actually matters. 
>> You're saying that mitt romney should spend his time somewhere else. 
>> He ought to be buying hot dogs in -- toledo, avlon? 

[00:23:49]


>> Yes, I am. 
>> You ought to be hanging out in these or john king in hamilton county in cincinnati. He's down three in our poll in ohio and that seems to be pretty baked in, so I don't have high hopes. But florida, colorado, those are republicans in those states breaking their necks for mitt romney right now and he's telling them he'd rather be in pennsylvania. Bad mistake. 
>> If he loses florida, you know it's game over. 
>> He's got to go to florida. 
>> I understand, paul, but i mean I think if he wants to win the election, so obviously -- clashing -- 
>> I actually -- won't win pennsylvania. He's not going to win it. 
>> Go ahead, john. 
>> That's point. Is that romney right now -- just a few weeks ago, starting in florida, you could feel it. Those polls have all tightened up and here in ohio, that small lead president obama's had, this is a main street republican state but toledo area tonight where I am tonight, erin, this is home to the plant that the romney campaign has been running ads on. There's a real sense that he was in play, he had been spending a lot of time, but people here take the auto industry very personally and that ad that has been called dishonest by some folks has caused a lot of ill will to the romney campaign. I think it makes more sense to play in those states rather than trying to push in pennsylvania. 
>> Thanks to all three. Scrambled map makes for an exciting weekend. Next, how big was the cia operation in libya and what does it have to do with what the obama administration has been telling the public about what happed there? And an update on the crane hanging over new york city. The plan to secure it, and how LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE.[ all ] OHH! That is crazy! Are you kidding me? Let me see! Oh! What! That's insane!

[00:29:51]


>>> welcome back. We start the second half of our show with stories we care about and focus on our reporting from the fronnes and we begin with the department of justice, which is sending observers from the civil rights divisions to polling sights. 780 will go to 51 jurisdictions in 23 states. Their going to be watching to see there is no discrimination based on race or color. 
>>> There are now plans to secure what has become new york city's latest touris attraction. That's the crane. Try and go by there. Tourists love taking pictures of it. Mayor bloomberg announced work toe crane is going to begin tomorrow. They say it will take 36 hours just to secure the boon to the building. Officials are hoping they will be able to let people back into the their homes and businesses by monday night. No word yet on who will be held liable in anyone for all those out of their homes, hotels that are empty. 
>>> We're monitoring the scandal linked to libor. The interest rate linked to how much you pay on your mortgage. Today, the royal bank of scotland says it expects it will soon begin discussing a role. Barclays paid $450 fine to settle their role earlier this year. 
>>> Hyundai and kia are going to lower fuel economy estimates for a lot of their models after the epa determined they overstated their ratings. The automakers blamed proceed rall efforts. They'll reimburse customers to cover the additional costs associate wd that change. 

[00:31:57]


>>> It's been 456 days since this country lost its top create rating. Despite a better than expected jobs r report, stocks closed in the red with the dow down 139 points and now, our fourth story "outfront." How much was the cia to blame for the attack in libya area "the wall street journal" today reporting that the mission was a cia operation. They report only seven of the more than 30 americans evacuated after the september 11th attack were working for the state department. The rest were with the cia. Two of the four who died were publicly identified as state department security officers, but were actually working for the cia. Adam, bob, a former operative. Appreciate you taking the time. Adam, you reported that tyrone woods and glen doherty were cia. Have you learned why the cia was operate ng benghazi? 
>> After the fall of gadhafi in libya, it became clear to the cia and other officials that militants could get hold of some of the weapons that gadhafi had and these included weapons like man pads, which are shoulder fire rockets that can be shot at aircraft. There were thousands of them that had to be tracked, so it was important for the cia to surge officers into benghazi to search for those weapons and you had a lot of jihadists moving into eastern libya. 
>> And I know your report covers how the fact that the cia was so prevalent, created perhaps serious confusion on who was responsible for security. Bob, this was a covert operation and they were in libya trying to secure these weapons. Isrealistic to do that job, to be a covert operative and also be you know, you're doing quote unquote real job, providing security to the consulate? 

[00:34:10]


>> Erin, the problem is it's hard to hide that many westerners in a city like benghazi, then almost attach the american consulate makes it even more dift. Thirdly, the cia does not do physical security. Whether in afghanistan or iraq and that left it up to seven officers and that's not enough to do it. It fell between the cracks. Normally, it would be state department building barriers, hiring security companies. The cia just doesn't do that. It keeps its own security. They did a heroic job trying to recover the ambassador. I think the real mistake, it was a misassessment. Clearly, the ambassador knew, but that message didn't get up to the seven floor f the state department. 
>> Was the ambassador relying on the cia for security? Surely he knew who these people were and what they were doing and there would be a much bigger problem than the raw numbers would suggest, right? 
>> Clearly, this is a good article in the "wall street journal." This was a cia base using state department cover and the ambassador would have assumed the was going to take care of it. But keep in mind, these guys there that buy up weapons, especially the surface to air missiles, these things get out across north africa, the mid east, they're going to shoot down airliners. They were doing the right job. The problem is as I said, it's libya. A very unstable place. Everything I'd seen, the local forces there, some of them turns against the consulate and that's the worst nightmare. 
>> This arrangement, would use the state department as cover, when we try to ascertain who is responsible for this falling through e cracks, who is it then in this case? From your reporting? 

[00:36:21]


>> Well, I mean, we're eight weeks, nearly eight weeks after this september 11th attack and we remain, we get different stories from different agencies. The state department believed that it had a binding agreement with the cia that the team there, their muscle, would be the cavalry and that it would come when called. Thatas part of the rationale for keeping security at the level it was at in benghazi, but when you talk to officials close to the cia and congressional investigators, they say the cia thought it was more an informal arrangement and it wasn't their responsibility and they did not have staffing levels at the annex as it's called, at the cia base. 
>> All right, thank you very much. We appreciate it so much more to come on this story as we still try to understand exactly what happened and still to come, where some of those lessons went. A gring crisis in mali. A story we first told you about "outfront." And up next, a new poll in ohio showing the race within statistical margin of error. We're going to ask about this bizarre thing that was said by one of the president's today. 
>>> Our fifth story, the all up with me, I went to the citi private pass page and decided to be...Not boring. That's how I met marilyn... Giada... Really good. Yes!

I go to the gas station such a small amount that I forget how to put gas in my car. 

[00:40:10]


[ Male Announcer ] AND IT'S NOT JUST THESE Owners giving the volt high praise. Volt received the j.D. Power and associates appeal award two years in a row. ?????? ?????? 
>>> our fifth story, the all important jobs result. 171,000 jobs added in october. More than exists were looking for. The unemployment rate did tick up, but that's crucial because as we told you on the show, no president since world war ii has been re-ected with employment above 8%. On the trail, the president seemed enthusiastic. 
>> Today, our businesses have created nearly 5.5 million new jobs and this morning, we learneded that companies hired more workers in october than at any time in the last eight months. 

[00:42:22]


>> But this report had some warning signs. The average workweek was still stang nant. Unchanged for the fourth straight month. The average hourly pay for employees was down slightly on a yearyear basis, it didn't keep up with inflation. You see him there, president obama's campaign press secretary. The president said we've made progress, we have, but workweek not moving, and wages and ben bernanke would tell us is not a problem. Do you think it's fair to call this the kind of progress you want? 
>> I do. Look, we're overcoming the worst recession since great depression. You've seen the trends here. We're losing 800,000 jobs a month when the president came into office. Manufacturg was in decline. We've made a lot of progress. Businesses have created more than 5.4 million jobs. Manufacturing is resurgent. But we can't stop there. We've made investments in areas like education, research and development and infrastructure. We've got to continue to do that to create these good paying jobs for the middle class. 
>> As we've talked about, everyone wants good paying jobs. That's your goal, everybody's goal. About 60% of the jobs we have gotten during this recession pay less than the jobs people had before, so we're still not getting that wage growth. Paul hickey said for a recovery, wed have to have $250,000 jobs a month. That's a kind of job growth we need. So, when you look at it that way, we have a long way to go, don't we? 
>> Well, we absolutely do. That's why the president's goal is to restore economic security for the middle class. You've seen that median income grow. The question is where we're going to invest. He's invested in research and development that have created 250,000 clean energy jobs. Mitt romney would cut funding for research and development. While the president has invested in education to make sure our work es have the skills they need, doubled funding for pell grants, mitt romney would cut funding. 

[00:44:26]


>> So, let me ask you another question here. Actually, this is sort of related, but today, the president in his speech, was very passionate. David axelrod, you heard about this, ben? 
>> I saw the post on it not too long ago. 
>> Unfortunately, I am the one as the host here, who has to read you the quote when he was talking about the president and said I'll quote, you can see in the speech he's delivering that this is coming from his loins. I had the wrong screen up there. Coming from his loins and then in case you thought it was a mistake, ben, he followed up by saying I just wanted to say loins. I wanted to see if I could get loins in the story. It's funny, but it's -- too. Isn't it? 
>> I don't think anybody was intending to be tossing them around today. It was a long day on the trail, but I think you could feel the energy on the stump today. Thousands in small cities across ohio turned out. There's a sense we're coming back from where we were in 2008. This is the president's last campaign. He was making a forceful case on the stump and not return to the same policies that crashed the economy and devastated the middle class in the first place. 
>> As I was saying, this whole middle class issue and good paying jobs, the jobs we've created don't pay as much per hour as the ones we've lost. Manufacturing, which I know is a big area of focus. There has been some improvement. Op net, we haven't seen really a change since april and the manufacturing workweek is down. Looks like things are getting better, but those three statistics are not good. 
>> Well, we were losing, we were hemorrhaging really, manufacturing jobs since 1997. The president granted rescue to the industry when many pundits ran for cover and mitt romney said we should let detroit go bankrupt. The president has invested in manufacturing, community clenls and worker training, mitt romney cut back. It led manufacturing jobs to decline by twice the times the national average. It's clear we're overcoming the worst recession since the great depression. They led to job creation since world war ii and we passed them in 2001 and 2003. Mittney is surrounded by the same officials who put those policies in place during the prior administration. We can't go back to those policies and expect a different result. 

[00:47:22]


>> I will not be sad when i don't have to hear the same few lines. Ben, good to see you. 
>> We might all need a break. 
>> I always like seeing you. Thanks. 
>>> Still "outfront", we have news just in about the gas situation in the tristate area. We're going to bring that to you, next. And later, they lost their home and yet today was the best day of their life. ?????? ?????? believe broader mix of energies. That's why we're supplying natural gas to generate cleaner electricity... That has around 50% fewer co2 emissions than coal. And it's also why, with our partner in brazil, shell is producing ethanol

I like free. Free is good. MY MONEY. MY CHOICE. MY Meineke. 

[00:51:39]


>>> Just in, the defense department announcing it's second extra fuel to the new york area. The defense logistics area buying up to ten million gallons of diesel fuel for distribution in storm-affected areas. As we have been telling you, the panic for gas has created miles-long lines at gas stations, and many, many hours. Only 40% to 50% of the gas stations in new york city and new jersey are even operating tonight. Many of them are just out of service because they have no power. Something that perhaps could have been anticipated fore the storm. 
>>> Now to tonight'suter circle, where we reach out to sources around the world. We go to mali where the u.N. Refugee agency says there are as many as 85,000 more refugees in the country than previously thought. The agency says hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing a deteriorating situion in the north of the country where islamist militants have taken root. David mckenzie is following the story and I asked him how bad he's hearing it's getting. 
>> Reporter: It could be the next front line in the global fight against al qaeda l terrorists. That's the landlocked country of mali in west africa. Earlier this year, two islamic groups took over large parts of country. Now the u.N. Security council has given a specific deadline to come up with a detailed military plan to get rid of them. It's caused a humanitarian disaster. More than a quarter of a million people, according to the u.N. Refugee agency, have fled northern mali into regional states. This is an important story for the u.S. It came up several times in the u.S. Presidential election because these groups, including al qaeda in the islamic magrib are holding sway. Erin? 
>>> Coming up, after all the awful things we have seen this week, we saw this. In the middle of the storm. All you need is love. The story up next. The wheels of progress haven't been very active lately. But because of business people like you, things are beginning to get rolling. And regions is here to help. Making it easier with the expertise and service to keep those wheels turning. From business loans to cash management, we want to be your partner moving forward. So switch to regions. And let't going. Together. 

[00:57:19]


>>> Since monday night, we've seen so much destruction and loss following hurricane sandy as we've traveled around the broader new york area, but today, we stumbled on this. This is a wedding program. We stumbled on something beautiful. This is matt and christine. Today was their wedding. While were out covering the storm's wreckage, we glimpsed something unexpected. We had come to see a hotel that was full of refugees from hurricane sandy and while the coast guard and red oss were going to sleep in cots on this side of the wall, on the other, a wedding planned for 316 people was being set up. The bride is christine. Her parents lost their home this week in breezy point, queens. Her church, gone, too. We called her and she said we could come to her wedding. Her fiance, matt, is a firefighter and was an early responder in the storm. 
>> I went in the morning after and just recovery effort. Everyone lended a helping hand. 
>> Every guest lost something. The groom's parents said they had friends who couldn't come because they had no gas. Is there anyone at this wedding who was not affected? 
>> Nobody. 
>> Tim is the groom's uncle. Roberto is a close family friend. Both lost their homes but not their spirit. 
>> Everyone has been so wonderful. I can't get over it. I can't get over it. >>He thing about new york. WE SAW IT ON SEPTEMBER 11th. 
>> They said that, the truck coming out of breezy said this is nothing. We will rebuild. 
>> That sentiment isn't lost on anyone here. 
>> Very hard week. Very, very hard week. But everybody worked together. People are the main thing. 
>> Christine and her mom planned the wedding for a year and a half. 
>> We need this happiness today. We really need this happiness. Tomorrow we'll go back and we'll deal with what we have to deal with, but today is my daughter's day. I'm going to enjoy every minute of it. 
>> And it was a mont of joy. Making the horrific loss for a moment seem small. 

[00:59:19]


>> It's nice to have a reason to put the stuff behind us for a day and can't wait to see my wife open the door and hopefully we can have a good day in the midst of all this. 
>> I'm happy. Very happy. 
>> Wonderful story. Here is piers more began tonight. 
> Good evening. Breaking news tonight in new york, where after days without power from hurricane sandy, the lights are beginning to slowly go back on in lower manhattan and beyond. It is slow, but it is happening. Mayor michael bloomberg says most of the power in manhattan should return by midnight tonight, although some people will be left without it for another week.

And by: 
male announcer: OXO GOOD GRIPS. 
Oxo: Tools you hold on to. 
- The greatest shared meal that you can have is with a loved one, you know? And I have here claudine, my daughter, and shorey, my granddaughter, and it's terrific. We're cooking meat today, and every cooking technique can be used for cooking meat: Grilling, broiling, sauteing, stewing. Anyway, I like to grill meat, but if I cannot, the broiler works quite well, and that's how I did this one. Do you want to taste it? 
[speaking in French] Okay. 
[speaks in French] Okay? 
- What do you think? 
- It's good. 
- Can I taste it too? Mmm, this is really good. Here is how I did it. I like to buy a boneless leg of lamb. I like to separate the different muscle and trim off most of the fat. When you start opening up, you can see that there are different muscle. The larger piece of meat is the top round. You can do steak with that. Then there is the top knuckle, probably the most tender for a roast. Then I have the top sirloin here, maybe the most tender part of the whole thing, but it's very small. It'd make a large steak with it. Now, you have the bottom round here, which is divided into what is called the flat and the other piece, which look like a fillet, which is actually the eye round. There is a lot of connective tissue that can be trimmed and used for stew and even that small piece at the end of the bottom round. Now let's recap. This is the fillet, the top sirloin, the top knuckle, the top round, and finally the bottom round, divided between the flat and the eye round. But I'm going to use the top sirln I have here and the top knuckle. I will create a marinade to put it in, and I use some peeled ginger here. I smash it and put it into the food processor. Smash a couple of clove of garlic and about half of a jalape??o pepper that I take the seed out. Some roughly cut mint leaf. A bit of apricot jam will give me sweetness. A bit of soy sauce will give me some saltiness. A dash of water. Process the whole thing until it's liquefied. And I pour that marinade over the lamb, right into a plastic bag. I can seal it. And it should be marinated for at least two hours, but it can stay overnight. When you're ready to cook it, remove the meat from the bag. And you can, of course, do it in your grill outside or in a skillet grill or pan on top of the stove. We can also do it under the broiler. So for that, I place into a skillet and drizzle over some of the marinade. And then I will place it under the broiler, not too close-- about 4, 5 inch--because it has to cook 14 minute, about: Half on one side, half on the other side. And when the meat is cooked, it should rest for at least 5 minutes, 5 to 10 minutes. And then now it's ready to cut it into thin slice, beautifully pink, and serve it with its own juice and a garnish of fresh mint for a dish that my family loves. Claudine is here to help me today as we are salting pork chop, making a couple of one-pot meals. M from easy to elegant, this is essential pepin. 

[00:03:43]


[glasses clink]nk 
[upbeat string music] ?????? ?????? bone here. You know, I love meat. In fact, I love everything you put in front of me, not only the dishes that i when I was a kid, but, you know, the dishes that I cooked for claudine when she was small, as well as my wife's heritage. And today we're starting with pork loin tournedos with cream and calvados, just like in nmandy. 
- And prunes. 
- And prunes, right. And puerto rican pork and beans. You know that recipe, right? 
- Yes. 
- And the lamb navarin. At's from my mother. So let's start with this. I have a loin of pork here. And, you know, the steak, you can cook them as you want. It's a beautiful loin there, as you can see. I think I'll do four. Okay. 
- So I'm going to put these down next to each other. 
- Yeah. 
[sizzling] 
- And I learned. I don't drop them in. I try and place them very carefully so I don't get burned. 
- Just drop them from here so it can splatter. 
- No! Don't do that. 
- All right. So this will cook, you know, about three minutes on each side or so. Let's do our garnish. Titine, you want to peel-- 
- you want to start the prunes? 
- Oh, yes, start the prune, yes. 
- Okay. 
- Okay, here are the prunes. 
- And here's some water. 
- You only want to do it deep around your prunes. First, those are pitted prunes. But--and those are quite soft. So I could do that recipe without even doing anything to those prunes, because the quality of it are really nice and soft a creamy. But otherwise, I bring them to a boil in the water and leave it in the water to swell up a little bit and get soft. So... Let's see those. Nicely brown. Remember that this is practically a solid piece of meat. There's basically no fat. I cut the fat from the outside. So you don't want to overcook it, because they get tough. And after they are cooked, you want to put them into a warm oven for, like, 10, 15 minutes to rest if you have the time. You can leave them on the side as well, but it's good if they'ren an oven-- like, 150-, 160-degree oven. Maybe a bit of the skin to put as a- as a garnish or a stripper. But you see, if I take this, I really took only the top surface of it, and--which is where you have the essential oil. So you have a lot of taste but no acid, really. 

[00:06:36]


- Yeah. And it's not the pith, 'cause the pith is bitter. 
- The pith is bitter, so we put that later on in the sauce. You know what? I think they are ready. 
- Okay. 
- I'll put them on the side here. Can put them in a warm oven, but if you use them very soon, it's okay here. 
- All right, so now we're going to add the shallots, right? 
- Yes. Add your shallots. 
- And one lonely scallion. 
- Scallion. 
- About 2 tablespoons of the calvados. 
- Well, no, first add your scallion and then, I think, a little more oil so that it brown... 
- Okay. 
- A bit. And remember as soon as the alcohol goes in it, you can flambe it. When you put alcohol in something, even wine, when it reach to, like, 180 degree, 185--i forgot-- the alcohol rise in the form of vapor. 
- Okay, you want a couple tablespoons? 
- Yeah. Go ahead, go ahead. Pour a little more. That's it. 
- And this is pyrotechnic cooking. Yes. Do you want your chicken? 
- Don't put your nose on top of it when you put this in. 
- You want the chicken stock in? 
- Add your chicken stock. Oh, that's enough, maybe. So that's going to cook to reduce a minute or so. 
- And also you can use a wooden spoon to kind of scratch and deglaze anything, any little bits that are on there, 'cause they're good little bits. 
- Good. 
- I like the little bits. 
- Okay. So let it cook a minute. 
- So cream, but also we're going to dissolve a little bit of-- 
- maybe to do a sauce, yes. I have four pork chops here. Like 1/3 of a cup, about 2 tablespoon of cream per person, and-- 
- and I'm just going to dissolve this right in here. 

[00:08:38]


- I'm going to put the lemon here. 
- The lemon zest?Ze 
- the lemon zest, yes. 
- Okay. 
- It's going to infuse in it too. 
- And then this will be enough, right? You can add whatever you want? 
- Yeah, did you-- did you measure it? 
- Ah. No. I just put about 2 teaspoons in here. 
- But it doesn't really matter, as claudine says, because as soon as this touch, it's going to thicken on contact. So I want it to come to a strong boil. Now I want to taste it. Maybe it needs salt, pepper. 
- We didn't put salt, pepper, but we had-- 
- no double dipping he. Here's your own. 
- Okay, thank you. 
- Okay, it needs salt... For me, anyway. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- Does? 
- Yup. 
- Pepper? 
- Okay, boiling. This always makes me nervous, this boiling. 
- No, it's good. It's good. It's boiling the w it should be now. 
- Do you want me to whisk this in? 
- And a little bit of that. 
- Should I whisk as you pour? 
- No, no, you're good. Just pour it a little bit like this. It thicken on contact, you see. And I have enough here. See the viscosity? 
- That's perfect. 
- You know, I could actually put some of that directly in there. 
- Oh, that's going to be really good. 
- About 2 or 3 prunes per person. If you do that recipe for your mother, don't do it with prunes. 
- With the prunes, I know. 
- Hates prunes. Okay, the meat has rested now, and there is always liquid to show you that the meat has rested, you see? So we'll add that to it. This. This. That. And that right on top of it. 
- And you could strain this if you wanto, right? 

[00:10:38]


- Well, yeah-- 
- just to make it a little bit more elegant, but it's not necessary. 
- It wouldn't be more elegant. I put the shallots and stuff in there. 
- Would you like some chives on top? . What do you think? 
- I think since they're here, we can just do this. There. Ooh. 
- Wait a minute. Let me see. We cut a piece here. I'm going to show you inside. You know, it should be just slightly pink, like this. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- Want to taste it? 
- Oh, yeah. Yes, please. 
- You are e official taster today. 
- It's a very good job to have. 
- And this is the pork loin tonedos with cream and calvados. 
- Okay, are we going to go make pork and beans? 
- Yes, now we're going to do puerto rican pork and beans from the ancestry of your mother, right? 
- Yes. 
- And we have the pork chop here, and you can see it'suite different than the chop that we have which were the center loin. This has much more fat. This is toward the shoulder. Sometime ty call that country style rib, sometime farther than that, right into the shoulder with already a piece of the bone of the clavicle in that is country pork style rib, you know? But either one is going to be good. 
- Either way, yeah, that's what I was going to say. 
- You want to crush a little bit of that for me? I'm going to cut that into pieces. 
- So I can use my hands, but I cannot-- I'm going to start it with a scissor. I know that's really wimpy, but this way, you don't have to touch them. 
- Haven't seen that done. 
- I know 
- so... 
- So this just makes it a little bit easier to start crushing them, and hopefully they don't explode all over the place when you're putting your hands inside them. 
- Right. Okay, so we're going to start browning this around. Better put salt on it. 
- That's coming. Okay. Then you can just kind of crush them in here. 

[00:12:42]


- Okay. So that will brown 5, 6 minutes, you know? Nicely all around. During that time, you can prepare your vegetable, and then we finish the whole thing with the bean. Cut the jalape??o in half. Actually, it's not the seed that's hot. It's actually the rib. 
- The rib is--oh. 
- Well, this is what rick bayless told me, and rick bayless is a great specialist of that. So if you remove the rib, s what's strong. Garlic. Here is the oregano. And I may try two or three bay leaf. And you know what? We are going to do just like your mother do, cut all of the end of this to use the stem into the dish here. And we're going to turn it around. 
- Oop, they're browning. 
- They're browning, yes, nicely, yeah. Yeah, cut it there. We'll keep the top for other garnish later. And this can be cut into small pieces. Want to do that? Can do it like this or even with a scissor. So this is a classic dish of puerto rico, which sometimes we use black beans, sometimes red kidney beans. You know, one or the other work fine. And here, of course, we have the red kidney beans that I have here. I want you them to run them under water. And now this is brown enough. Like, nicely brown now. U put the vegetable. 
- And this is what's great, is that this is seriously just a one-pot dish. 
- Yeah, you can even do that in a pressure cooker if you're in a hurry. 
- And then 3 or 4 cups of water just to cover it really good? 
- Yeah, a good 4 cup, up to 6 cup of water. You know, I always start with 4, and if you see that it need more water, then you add more water at some point. This will cook a couple of hours-- 2, 2 1/2 hours, depending on the beans. You see when they are nice and tender. The pork itself be probably enough with, like, an hour, an hour and a half. But it doesn't hurt to cook it more. Maybe a bit of tabasco in there? 

[00:14:53]


- Yes. And a little bit of tabasco on the table too. 
- A lot of tabasco on the table. This is it, titine. You can do that ahead, or you can even do it in those pressure cooker with a timer, which I have one, and it's really good. 
- Works out great. 
- Ready for pork and beans, titine? 
- I am always ready. I'm going to get you a plate. There we go. 
- Look at that. Beautiful. 
- Oh, it smells so good. 
- The meat fall apart a little bit, but that's the way it should be, you know. That's the way it should be. Why don't u serve a little glass of wine with that? 
- Absolutely. 
- So here. 
- Here I have a carignan from alexander valley, which I think is going to go really, really well. 
- Yeah. 
- Nice, refreshing. D it'll stand up to the spice really nicely too. 
- I have a big portion here. 
- Oh, good. 
- A mess, of course. Let's get the-- 
- oh, the cilantro. 
- Right on top, huh? And we can-- you know, I mean, just-- 
- just some leaves. 
- The leaf like this. 
- I'm going to taste over here with you. 
- Okay. 
- You know what? It's always so fun to make home-style food with you. Hot. 
- That's really good. You know, it's good, but it's going to be even better tonight, in a few hours too. Puerto rican pand beans. And now we made, you know, that dish which is really from your mother, pork and beans. This is your grandmother. 
- Yes. 
- She does a navarin. Navarin is a stew of lamb that we do and very conventionally done with a shoulder, often with the back leg. She always did it with the breast when I was a kid, first because it was very cheap and secondly the type of dish u eat at home because you have to take the bone and enjoy it this way. Really inexpensive, and I think it has more taste with that. So we're going to do it just the way she did it, right? 

[00:16:54]


- Absolutely. 
- So we cut that in between. And this one doesn't happen to have much fat. It has some fat on this side also but not too much. But, you know, it doesn't really matter. I'll tell you-- I'll show you why, because we are going to get rid of the fat one way or the other. So youut those about 2, 3 pound, and you put them to brown in a beautiful, large, you know, heavy cast-iron type of cocotte like this, which I have one here. But I want to show you this one, which has been cooking for probably 15, 20 minutes. And so you can see the bottom of it. This is really crisp. You know, crispy. And there is not that much meat, but it's really flavorful and good. But there is a lot of fat here. 
- There is a lot of fat. 
- That's when you remove the fat. You know, you brown it all around, and then-- 
- lamb fat isn't good for much of anything, is it? I mean, you don't-- yeah. 
- The lamb fat? Oh, no, the lamb fat is really saturated too. Okay, so we can hold it this way. And look at that. 
- That's a lot of fat. 
- Yeah, probably-- 
- it looks like a cup. 
- Close to a cup of fat here. All right. Okay. 
- Get rid of this. 
- So that's it. I mean, there is a little bit of fat here, but now-- 
- well, I mean, not crazy or anything. 
- We're putting a couple of tablespoon of flour to singe it. 
- And that just sort of gives it that viscosity and everything? 
- Yeah, it's going to thicken it too. I'm going to mix it in and add the water. She always used water. She never used stock. 
- Do you want me to add it now? 
- Yeah, add. Maybe not all 
- you just tell me to stop. 
- The three cup--go ahead. Go ahead, pour it in. Okay, that's about fine. And in this now, we're going to put all of the different garnish. Okay, this is nice. The carrot. 

[00:18:57]


- Are you going to put the garlic and the onions in together, or are you going to do-- 
- everything together. 
- I love everything together. 
- Yeah, yeah. You've never done that dish, right? Not that particular one? 
- No, not this particular one. I've done things-- a lot of things like this but not like this, because you make it, and meme makes it. 
- Yes. 
- So... 
- But this one was always different, as I said, because of the-- 
- because of the lamb. 
- The breast. 
- Is tt easy to find? 
- Yes, I find them at the market now, and they used to be practically free. They gave them to you. Now they don't. But they are--they are far from as expensive as a leg of lamb or certainly as the rack. I mean, if you get into the rack, it would be-- and the rack, you know what, wouldn't even be good for that. 
- Why? 
- What would be good would be the shoulder. The rack is too-- would be too dry for that. 
- Okay. We have enough garlic here, sliced? Or do you want the last one? 
- Yeah, put the last one in it. It's okay. And a bit of herbes de provence. In the herbes de provence, of course, you have a mixture of thyme and savory and even a little bit of-- we have those beautiful-- 
- and lavender. Lavender. Sometime lavender. Sometime they don't do it. Type of dish you have on that cold sunday, you know, in winter. 
- And we have--and we're going to put the potatoes in here. 
- Potato too. You know, you can boil that for a little bit and put the potato after, but it really doesn't matter that much. Now, I like to have the potato, make it a bit fancier here. All of the same size, about this way. So you find small potato or if you find big one like this-- I mean, bigger than what you should have-- I'll show you how to mold them, so... 
- Mold them? 
- Yeah. I mean, you cut them in half like this. And you see the way I do, almost flat. Just to give a little bit of a face here. 
- Okay. 
- And that goes down. Now I cut here. And I continue cutting around like this to eventually look like if it was a regular potato that you cut. My mother would cut it in four pieces, that's it. But this is--sometime it's used for other thing, and, of course, the beauty of that is that we do that with peeled potatoes, so this is used in soup, croquette, mashed potato, or whatever. So you don't waste anything. 

[00:21:27]


- Oh. 
- Your knife is big with that. Try that. That's smaller. 
- All right. 
- And do it more with this. See my hand here? 
- I see your hand. 
- Look, this. 
- Okay. 
- This is the front. And the--you know, with your thumb. 
- Okay, like this? 
- That's incredible. 
- Oh, yeah, right. 
- Absolutely amazing. Okay. 
- Hey, look, I did it. 
- You did it. Okay. So we have everything included in there. Bring it to a boil. As you can see, when it bos, it's going to thicken a little bit use the 2 tablespoon of flour that I did here. And that's it. All there is to it. 
- That's going to be really good. 
- Let's bring it to a boil and wait for, like, 35, 45 minutes. 
- Okay. 
- You know, titine, when you cook that type of dish, you can't miss. It smell through the whole house. People know you're cooking. 
- Definitely. 
- So let's see. I'm sure it's cooked now. 
- All righty. 
- I check it out. 
- Ooh! 
- I can't see. That thing is-- yeah, this is very tender. You want to give me the peas? 
- Yes. 
- So the peas, you know, you just put them at the end, bring them to a boil, and that's about it, you know? If you put them at the beginning, they'll be all yellow and so forth. Well, that comes back basically to a boil, and-- 
- do you want me to chop some parsley to put on top, or do you want to put just a couple leaves or-- 
- yeah, why don't you chop a little bit of parsley on top while I'm drinking my wine. 
- [laughs] 
- And... Maybe you even want to taste it. 
- I definitely want to taste it. 
- You ow, I'll taste it and make it-- you taste it just to test the beans here. Yeah, the potatoes are really cooked. 
- And it's important to-- to taste, just because at this point, you can readjust for seasoning if you need to. Not that we do, but-- 

[00:23:35]


- that's some of the bone. And at home, of course, you would grab that bone. 
- Mm-hmm. 
- The meat is very moist around, and that's why it's not too fine, titine. 
- Okay. Mmm. 
- And here we are. You know, I would go directly to the dining room and put that in the middle of the table just like this. The lamb navarin of my mother. 
- There we go. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you. 
[glasses clink] 
- You know, when the cook is in a good mood, the food tass better. 
- Absolutely. I think that's true. 
- If you're in a bad mood, go for take-out. So when you cook, you have to relax. Cook with the enjoy a glass of wine. This is what life is all about. Happy cooking.

>> "The harmony game." 
>> That's not a bad -- 
>> no, beethoven... Beethoven's 200th birthday is coming up, did you know that?

>> Uh-huh. 
>> Just telling you it's coming up. I don't want you to get... 
>> Caught short. 
>> Caught from behind. He... The reason I am saying that is because of the harmony thing. There was this -- beethoven was writing this part, and parallel fifths were scorned harmonically. Right, you weren allowed to write parallel fifths. 
>> Right. Very gauche. 
>> So the guy said, "you wrote that in parallel fifths." Beethoven said, "where is there a law that says that you can't write in parallel fifths? Where did that law come from?" So he says, "this guy and this guy and this guy said it." So beethoven says, "i say that you can! Well, I'm writing in parallel fifths. I say you can." 
>> He was a fool, beethoven. Somebody else's 200th birthday is coming up in not so long. 
>> 200th BIRTHDAY?

>> the year was 1969. "Simon and garfunkel: Songs of america" appeared on national television. In fact, what you just saw was the very first performance, ever, on television of "bridge over troubled water." The album itself wouldn't come out for another month. Unlike anything that had come before it, it was a poignant LOOK AT THE 1960s, THROUGH THE Eyes and music of paul simon and art garfunkel. Thiserful documentary was so controversial that cbs only aired it once. It has never aired since. But this public television station is providing you with the opportunity to see it right now. Hi, I'm david rubinson and there is much more to come, including some incredible live performances of classics, like "the sound of silence" and "mrs. Robinson." Also, a visit with anthony DeCurtis, rolling stonemagazine, who wrote the liner notes for the "bridge over troubled water" 40th anniversary edition, that we're offering with our thanks when you support this station with a contribution of $100 or more. Simon and garfunkel were the quintessential folk-rock duo OF THE 1960s. They saw america in a way that spoke to those of who came of age in that decade, as we grappled with a country in social and political turmoil. Ongs of america" serves as a compelling document of that era and of simon and garfunkel. The opportunity to revisit it, more than 40 years after its premiere, is one example of what your contribution makes possible. This is where you turn to for programs about our national character, about our musical heritage, and about our history.

>> Scott sauer here, WITH anthony DeCurtis from rolling stonemagazine. Anthony, it's great to have you with us. 
>> It's a pleasure to be here. 
>> So put this in perspective. It's 1969. Set the tone for what's going on. 
>> Well, you know, people think that these are partisan times that we're living in. In 1969, people were seriously talking about the idea of revolution. Campuses were in an uproar over the vietnam war. The civil rights movement had gotten much more radical. Martin luther king had been lled the year before. Robert kennedy had been killed the year before. Richard nixon was elected on a strict law-and-order platform. So there was a sense that the country was just tipping. Really, it was a case of "which side are you on?" You know, one group called it "the days of rage" and that pretty much sums it up, I think. 
>> For simon and garfunkel, this is a time, for them, that they were trying to come to grips with this as well. 
>> Well, it's interesting. They were one of the few bands left that could really bridge the gap. I think the desire to, somehow, find a middle ground, you know, never really came to pass. You know, paul simon and art garfunkel were very outspoken in the show. So the sense that, you know, this was going to bring everybody together -- you know, it wasn't a moment where america was singing the same song. 
>> Not by any means. Well, this is partwhat you're getting when you put together that contribution of $100 and we can thank you with that 40th anniversary edition that includes the dvd of today's program, that cd, and even a behind-the-scenes documentary. We hope you'll make that contribution right now. 
>> "Simon and garfunkel: Songs of america" is a time capsule, preserving a unique moment in history. In it, we see two gifted artists rehearsing, recording, and performing the songs that made them great. The net effect is a feeling of time travel, recalling our own relationship to that time in america. This program is typical of public television, providing both entertainment and insight. The "bridge over troubled water" 40th anniversary edition that we're offering with our thanks when you support this station with your contribution of $100 not only features the timeless album on cd, but also, both today's program and a brand-new domentary about the making of the album, on dvd. Here's a peek at a segment from that documentary, talking about how the album came to be. 

[00:22:03]


>> Simon: After "the graduate" becoming a hit and "bookends" coming out, the songs were written over, you know, rather a long period. 
>> Oh, we were on top of the world. We were lucky sons of guns. There's nothing that brings out your talent than hit records. It puts you in such a good mood that you rise to the height of your stuff. You know that the world is waiting for the next thing you're going to put out. 
>> [ Applause ] 
[ whistling ] 
>> GarfunkelBODY GETS Dragged to the top of the charts. We were playing that game, in those days, delightfully. We'd do a show, we'd come back to the holiday inn, we'd sit on the end of the bed. Paul would noodle along with something he's writing. I'd be listening and thinking of the record we're going to make of this and, when three or four of them were ready to be recorded, every few months, we would gin the studio and put them down. 
>> Basically, I'd come in with a song and a lick and the two of us had already learned our harmony and we knew how to do it and roy knew how to do it. 
>> Roy Halee: I could actually sense what paul simon was thinking. I was always thinking "what would go nicely? What color would be really beautiful in this song or very commercial in this song?" 
>> [ Scat-singing ] 
>> stay on the up. 
>> We stay on the four. 
>> [Cat-singing ] 
>> there's a look at just some of the documentary, entitled "the harmony game."

>> [ "Mrs. Robinson" plays ] 
>> scott sauer, here, WITH anthony DeCurtis from rolling stone. Anthony, you wrote the liner notes for this new 40th anniversary collection. When you were listening or you were watching, what was one of the first things that really came to mind? 
>> Well, I wrote specifically about this movie and I was really intrigued to see it, after all this time, you know. And I was very much struck by what a document of the period it was, both in terms of the things that it addressed and, obviously, the music and simon and garfunkel, at that point, but also just how it was made. You know, all of the tricks that we now come to associate with rockumentaries, none of that was in place, and so there was a sense of kind of diy, you know, a kind of do-it-yourself feel to this movie. It's almost as if it was being made up as they went along and so, consequently, it feels very immediate, even at the same time as it's very much a document of its time. I was very struck by that. 
>> It really does capture them in a very creative period, but in a period when they're winding down, as a duo. 
>> Oh, "winding down" is putting it kindly. I mean, there's a sense in which, you k this is not a high point for them and, you know, they were really going to break up, you know, not that much longer afterwards. 
>> It really is a fascinating look and it's part of that cd-and-dvd combination that we're offering with our thanks when you make that $100 contribution. We hope you'll make that contribution right now. 
>> The "bridge over troubled WATER" 40th ANNIVERSARY EDITION That we're offering with our thanks at the $100 level is really spectacular. 
>> [ "The boxer" plays ] 
>> I mean, the songs themselves are incredible, but it also features, in addition to the 11-song album, it's now paired with a very special dvd that features today's program, "songs of america," and a brand-new documentary called "the harmony game," that has new, exclusive interviews with paul and art. This insightful new film tells the story behind simon and garfunkel's last studio album, "bridge over troubled water," the legacy of which remains shrouded in rock 'n' roll mythology, as e its legendary tales of inspiration, innovation, and separation. Paul simon, art garfunkel, and the collaboratorshare the journey in their own words and reflect back on its impact, 40 years later. Neither has been offered on dvd. Until now.

When all of those kids went up to woodstock, you had 300,000 kids at woodstock, there was a great joy of having 300,000 people who were related by something, by the urge to go to woodstock. Or by their age or by the music or something. The feeling of belonging is very strong at those times. This issue, which, up until that point, you may have feltav impotent to deal with, now at least you feel "i can touch n ."

>> I think, though, much of what we're saying, if not all of what we're saying, is extremely obvious. As obvious as it is that we shouldn't be in vietnam, or as obvious as it is that people are starving in this country, or as obvious as it is that there's inequality in this country -- and maybe even as annoying as it is to hear it. But it has to be said until they stop the war, until they feed the people, until they make -- make everyone free and have equal opportunity, or as much as that can be done within this society. Until that happens, then it's the function of... It's the function of the people to point it out and continually remind us of it.

>> today's program, "songs of america," was first broadcast by cbs television on november 30, 1969. It preempted "the leslie uggams show" and the sponsor -- believe it or not, I'm not kidding -- was alberto vo5. Now, this was a particularly volatile and memorable era in u.S. History. It's a visual document that offers a glimpse back in time. We see the explosive political and cultural events of the era through the words and music of two of the nation's most powerful musical voices. Hi, I'm david rubinson and we have muc much more to come, including a visit in the sdio WITH anthony DeCurtis of rolling stonemagazine. In many ys, simon and garfunkel's songs and VOICES DEFINED THE '60s AND The decades that followed. Both rolling stoneand the rock and roll hall of fame list "bridge over troubled water," "the sound of silence," and other landmark simon and garfunkel compositionsas among the best. Paul and art created the soundtrack for a generation with landmark musical performances that have earned a place in history.

>> ?????? Dee dee dee dee dee ???????????? 
>> scott sauer, here, WITH anthony DeCurtis from rolling stonemagazine. Anthony, in the film, we get to hear "bridge over troubled water." And this film was really the first time that people had a chance to hear that song. 
>> And it's, obviously, one of the great classics of the period. I mean, there are certain ballads, I think, that, in many ways, capture that sense of the END OF THE '60s, IN PARTICULAR, And the hopefulness of that song is something that, I think, really affects people and it's what communicates. And that very much comes through, this idea that, somehow, you could build that bridge over the troubled waters, you know, in this turbulent time, you could make the connection. 
>> You know, 40 years later, it's one of the songs that's been covered in many different ways but really seems to have stood the test of time, better than almost any song of that era. 
>> Well, you know, it is a song that lends itself to different interpretations. You know, it's gotten treated in a variety of different ways and paul simon, himself, in his solo tours, sings it. You know, on the other hand, you know, it's always been a great showcase for art garfunkel, you know, it's maybe his finest moment, you know, that whole "sail on, silver girl" part, and, you know, of course, the ending. You know, it's one of those classic performances that really define a career. 
>> Yeah, it really is. And that's why we'd love for you to have that 40th anniversary collection, that includes the classic cd, the classic album; plus the dvd, that includes today's film and that behind-the-scenes look at the duo as well. Please, make your contribution right now. 
>> Simon and garfunkel have known each other since elementary school and theirs is a dynamic relationship. When they were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame, paul said, "how could I be happier than to be inducted into the hall of fame with my oldest pal? And we can join all those other happy couples -- ike and tina turner, the everly brothers, mick and keith, paul and all of the other beatles -- maybe they'll have a separate wing for all of us." These are complicated performers and writers. "Songs of america" allows us to see them in the context of creating one of the most memorable volumes of work in musical history, against the backdrop of civil unrest and social upheaval. The "bridge over troubled water" 40th anniversary edition that we're offering with our thanks when you support this station with your contribution of $100 not only features the timeless album on cd, but also, both today's program and a brand-new documentary about the making of the album, on dvd. Here's a peek at a segment from that documentary, talking about how today's program came together. 

[00:53:11]


>> When they were out in california in '68, they met chuck grodin. 
>> [ "The boxer" plays ] 
>> and they also met, at that time, two television producers who laid out to them a marvelous format for them to present their music in a television special. 
>> ?????? "Kathy, I'm lost," I said though I knew she was sleeping ?????? ?????? I'm empty and aching and I don't know why ?????? 
>> I had met art garfunkel when we did "catch-22," I guess, somewhere in the year prior to the "songs of america." And I had this idea, which i presented to paul and art, that this special should reflect how it influenced paul's -- what he was writing about. The vietnam war, the poor people's march, equal rights for people -- how this feeds into his songs, one way or another. 
>> As far as the show did that night, it got killed by a peggy fleming ice skating special, which will tell you, you know, really, where the country was at, much more th anything else that I can say. I guess, in retrospect, it's something to be proud of, because we spoke up for who we were in our generation. 
>> [ "Bridge over troubled water" plays ]

>> Scott sauer, WITH anthony DeCurtis. Anthony, we talked a little bit about the times, but these times were really a time when simon and garfunkel were beginning to fray as a du 
>> yeah, and it's really kind of ironic because they couldn't possibly have been bigger. You know, "the graduate" had come out the year before, the film. They had the soundtrack. It made them bigger than they had ever been, put them on a level -- really, their only rivals were, like, the beatles. But that's the time when things often get difficult, you know? And, you know, for them, I think the fact that paul simon wrote the songs, but art garfunkel was the frontman, garfunkel was getting a movie career going. That was important to him. In certain ways, he felt like he was in paul simon's shadow because simon was the songwriter. All of these elements came together and are reflected in the music on "bridge over troubled water." A song like "the only living boy in new york" reflects simon's desire to go in the studio -- art garfunkel's on a movie set, you know. And so all of these things that, you know, at another time, might not have been as stressful, you know, really bore down on them. 
>> Really, an amazing document on their history, part of what we're getting to experience today, here on this public television station. 
>> You know, for your $75 contribution, please do not forget that you can get this incredible "best of simon & garfunkel" cd. We want to send that to you for your contribution for this public television station. You know, public television, of course, is also associated with innovative children's programming. Believe it or not, simon and garfunkel have a long association with children's programming on public television. After all, art voiced the singing moose on the "arthur" and paul simon has been on "sesame street" a number of times, performing songs like "me and julio down by the schoolyard" and "bingo." The popular character bob sang "feelin' groovy" in the very first seasonf the show and paul performed "african alphabet" with ladysmith black mambazo IN THE 1980s. In 2007, paul simon was honored by the library of congress during a public television broadcast that featured a who's who from the musical world, INCLUDING "SESAME STREET's" Grover and elmo, who reprised "feelin' groovy," in tribute to simon. Your contribution makes this public television station feel groovy. Whether it's innovative children's programming or landmark musical documentaries, it's your contribution that brings the programs to life. If you've made your contribution, thank you. If not, we are eager to hear from you with your support. Thank you.

>> I don't write to get something through to somebody. I write for various reasons. Some songs I write for the pleasure of writing a song. It doesn't have any great meaning. It's just a song.

Girls bounce balls and sing, chant. Those are songs. There's a pleasure in singing a song. There's a pleasure in writing songs. Some songs you try and express yourself emotionally.

We have to look around and see, "oh, there's a chinese kid in my class, there's a black boy." There's -- our group is so varied, and here we are, together, and, you know, we have to warm up slowly. We look at each other under our brows, sort of embarrassed. But... I think we all see the value of getting together. Here we are, we have this country. We can do great things whenever we have a spotlight on us. We have the power to do great things. And I think we all feel that it's tremendously valuable for us to fuse, but it's very difficult. All human beings have this wish to take their inner self and fuse it with the rest of humanity. And insofar as they're unable to do that, they're constantly reminded of this obstacle. They defend it, they find reasons to keep their isolation as a neces ingredient of their beliefs or whatever, but it's not true to what they feel.

>> phenomenal. It seems so appropriate to feature "the sound of silence" near the conclusion of "simon and garfunkel: Songs of america." Still beautiful and resonating with truth today, it was a song that propelled the iconic duo to popularity. It was written in february of 1964 by paul simon, in the aftermath of the assassination of president edy. As the decade and the program come to a clos against the backdrop of a nation in turmoil, it's a moving tribute to the impact of the thoughtful duo who were able to so perfectly capture the times through their songs.

>> Scott sauer here, WITH anthony DeCurtis of rolling stonemagazine. So, anthony, can you imagine a film like this being made today? 
>> No. You know, that's one the things that really struck me when I looked at it. It's so hard. You know, there really are these moments of tension between simon and garfunkel, that you can see, and that's something that, you know, these days, you would be very unlikely to see. But that's one of the things that's really great about the film. You know, there's a kind of raw quality to it. Raw, not only because of the social issues that the film is depicting, and how outspoken simon and garfunkel are about them, but also the kind of energy between them. At times, it's really great. At times, it's not so great. But you really feel like this is a real relationship, this isn't just something that's being done because there's a camera in the room. 
>> You don't get the sense that this was created by a publicist. This is more of an organic experience. 
>> Exactly. You know, it was so early on, in terms of what these kind of films would become, that there were no rules, and you know, that's what makes it feel so immediate. 
>> Well, it's a terrific document to, not only the era, but, of course, to the music and to these incredible performers. We hope you'll make your contribution right now, so this station can continue to bring you moments like these. 
>> The success of simon and garfunkel, as american music icons, has a great deal to do with the sheer poetry and depth of the song lyrics they wrote. Each song leaves you with something to think about. In "the sound of silence," we're asked to consider the dangers of keeping silent, rather than standing up and being counted, of being lulled into complacency -- "people talking without speaking, people listening without hearing." These are lyrics that resonate today, in a world where we text-message someone close by with a quick phrase, rather than engage in meaningful conversation, and where tv programs are designed to shock, rather than to communicate ideas. Well, you know that public television is different. This is the place of ideas, information, great entertainment. And this is where we're counting on you to let your voice be heard, by calling the er on the screen with your contribution. The "bridge over troubled water" 40th anniversary edition that we're offering with your pledge of support at $100 not only features the timeless album on cd, but also, both today's program and a brand-new domentary about the making of the album, on dvd. Here's a peek at a segment from that documentary, talking about how the title track to the album came to be. 

[01:19:14]


>> [ Piano plays ] 
>> and here it goes. The whole damn song is a gem. I love running through the line from top to bottom and delivering paul's intentions. If you're down and out, let my lucky gift of a voice be a friend. ?????? When tears are in your eyes I'll dry them all ?????? you shake out the human condition so you can be as honest as you can about these beautifully written words. 
>> I have no idea where it came from. It's... It just came, all of a sudden. You know, one minute, it wasn't there, and the next minute, the whole line was there. It was one of the shocking -- one of the shocking moments in my songwriting career. 
>> ?????? Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind ?????? 
>> Garfunkel: The fact is, from the moment I locked on to that melody and the fun of singing, there was a thunderous reaction, and always has been. ?????? I will ease your mind ?????? 
>> if a song jumped out of the radio, that meant there was some kind of magic in the way you cut it. 
>> Now, let me ask you something -- do you actually have "bridge over troubled water" in your cd collection? Last time I checked, I on it on the old 33 1/3. Can you imagine that? So call right now. You can have this, plus this "best of" as well, your $150 contribution. It is a terrific gift from you to us. Watch what we'll do with your support.

>> Scott sauer, WITH anthony DeCurtis. Anthony, we're showing this on public television now, but, in 1969, this aired on commercial television, but not without its controversy. 
>> No, not at all, and it's a very interesting thing. I mean, I don't think anybody would bat an eye about what's in this film. Certainly, in the intervening 40 years, we've seen plenty more shocking things. But, certainly, back then, the views that simon and garfunkel were expressing, about the war and about other social issues, were highly controversial. The initial sponsor for the film pulled out and, you know, they had to go and find another one, which they did. Simon anrfunkel refused to make any changes. So, you know, you have a sense of, like, what airing a film like this on commercial television is like. Yeah, I mean, it's still sort of the same way today. You know, things are on commercial television are meant to please a sponsor, an advertiser. 
>> That's very true. And, you know, I mean, I think that's one the virtues, of course, you know, of public television, is that, you know, the people are the sponsor of it, you know? Your contributors are the sponsor of it. And, you know, as long as they're happy and as long as they're seeing stuff that's interesting to them, that's provocative to them, that makes them think, you know, as long as it's appropriate, as long as it's smart, as long as it's serious -- and I don't mean "serious." It can have a sense of humor, certainly, but it's meant to kind of challenge and enrich the audience and it's exciting to have those opportunities. 
>> And those are the opportunities that you create with your contribution so, please, make your contribution right now. Thanks. 
>> You know, believe it or not, the director of this film was the actor charles grodin. Can you believe that? They got together in l.A., as we've learned and charles grodin had this idea and simon and garfunkel went with it. And I love the way the trajectory of the show comes, where you actually see things like civil rights marches and cesar chavez, sort of forming where the songs came from, and then, as the show builds, we see a lot more of the actual performances by paul and by art. It's just a terrific show. Obviously, a real creature of its times, 1969, and the fact that you would go from civil rights marches to an alberto vo5 commercial is just stunning. Well, we hope you have appreciated public television finding this documentary, bringing it back for you. And we know the ratings aren't going to be good -- they weren't good in 1969. What's going to let us know whether it's a success or not is when you call the number on the screen. Make that pledge of support so we can get out and find other lost musical treasures. For your $150 contribution, we will send you both the "best of simon & garfunkel" cd and also the cd of "bridge over troubled water," WITH THOSE TWO DVDs. It is terrific. So on behalf of scott sauer, ROLLING STONE's anthony DeCurtis, I'm david rubinson. Thanks so much for watching and for your pledge.

with abandon: Mouthwatering food, fun-loving people, and a d culture. From running with the bulls in spain to diving off bridges in bosnia, it's hands-on travel today as europe embraces life with gusto, inspiring us to get the most out of our lives as well. Enjoy this high-energy first segment, and il see you atreak. Hold on to your castanets. 
[lively music] ?????? ?????? when you dream of european travel, you might first think of visiting the great museums, wandering awestruck through towering cathedrals, finding meaning in the rubble of ancient history, and savoring cafe culture. But it's important to realize that europe is a vast and diverse continent with many more active ways to experience all it has to offer. It's a continent with incredible natural beauty that's as accessible as it is thrilling. Whether it's riding a canoe in the czech republic into postcard-pretty towns or biking around the pristine isle of aero up in denmark, europe comes with endless ways to get out of the museums and embrace life with gusto. If you've got the strength, you can try kite-surfing in southern spain, or you can always take it easier, wandering the pleasant paths and planked walkways in croatia's plitvice national park. The alps provide plenty of high-altitude adventures, whether hiking switzerland's berner oberland, scaling germany's zugspitze, or climbing high above the valley floor to the ruins of ehrenberg castle in austria. In italy, you can go on a truffle hunt in tuscany or peer into the crater of mount vesuvius just outside naples. And scandinavia gets your heart pumping. You can hike glaciers, explore the swedish archipelago, or go on a high-speed fjord safari. Wherever you go in europe, you'll find opportunities to energize your travels by trying active experiences. And don't forget to party. All over europe, you can join in local festivals and loosen up with new friends. pbeat music] Germany and austria have plenty of rowdy beer halls and convivial beer gardens where you can get a simple meal, a huge beer, and enjoy it all with the hometown gang. The most famous place to do this is the hofbraeuhaus in munich. While often full of tourists, it's a great place to cut loose and mix in a little low-brow fun with the high culture of all those museums and galleries. It comes complete with rivers of beer, cheap food, boisterous atmosphere, and raucous oompah music. Munich is the home of the famous oktoberfest, but you can enjoy essentially the same oktoberfest fun any time of the year in a good old-fashioned bavarian beer hall. For just as much fun and a little more intimacy, irish pubs offer travelers a cozy evening over a pint or two with locals. The pub is like a communal living room where children are welcome. Many pubs offer traditional music, creating a mini festival nearly any night of the week.

[applause] 
>> Thank you! 
>> Steves: And spain is a fiesta just waiting to happen. In andalucia, many cities have a spring fair. Pick the right town on the right day, and you'll be swept up in the commotion of fancy horsemanship, sherry spritzers, and colorfully clad se??oritas. Polka dots never looked so good. Northern spain hosts one of the ultimate spanish parties, pamplona's festival of san fermin. This multiday celebration has parades for the whole family, serious all-night partying for adults, and its breathtaking running of the bulls. Embracing both its thrills and spills, europeans live life with a bang. My european friends seem to understand that life is good, especially when you live it fully. And we know quality programming, like that which we enjoy here in public television, is part of good living as well. Consider how public television inspires us to get up and embrace life, to really experience our world. That's a treasure. In my travels, I've noticed an irony. So often, people in the poor world live life with a spirit of abundance, and here in the rich world, many of us live our lives with a mind-set of scarcity. I believe supporting public television is embracing life with a spirit of abundance. And right now, that comes with some great travel gifts. With these thank-you gifts, we're celebrating public television and making this station strong in your community. Contribute $60 for the europe through the back door guide book or the new season on dvd. Or contribute $160 for every gift we're talking about: The guide book, the new season on dvd, and the huge 13-disk boxed set with our entire 90-episode series. And at each level, you'll also receive the europe map, tour newsletter, and rick steves smithsonian magazine. Thanks for your calls. It's more important than ever that we have a people's alternative to commercial broadcasting, and this station is it, with a passion for programming that enriches our lives and celebrates our world. When you give at that top $160 level, you'll receive all the gifts, and that includes this dvd boxed set. Here's a little tease, just 60 seconds out of the 50 hours of travel fun packed into this gift. The rick steves europe anthology is the definitive video library of european travel. 90 episodes take you from the fjords of norway to the canals of france, from the wild coast of ireland to enchanting estonia. You'll discover hidden alpine villages, explore modern cities layered with history, feel the thrill of europe's festivals, and relax on the mediterranean. And there are bonuses you'll never see on tv. There's the practical europe through the back doorlecture I've been giving for three decades, some of my favorite scenes that didn't make it into the regular shows, and outtakes, proof that things don't always go as smoothly as it seems.

>> Steves: I didn't understand a word he said. 
>> Okay. 
>> Steves: For any traveler or europhile, these 90 episodes with 50 hours of video offer a lifetime of travel learning, lessons, and fun. Next up, it's time to eat, and we're in for some unforgettable taste treats. As you watch, consider the value of public television to open up our world, to introduce us to things we'd never know about otherwise. It helps us learn valuable lessons by getting us out of our comfort zone-- into new food, for example-- and exposing us to different ideas. Public television is a positive educational force. It carbonates our lives in a beautiful way. And it happens because of your enlightened support. Now bon appetit. Eating is one of the joys of life, and for europeans, food is almost a religion. They eat with passion. And when we travel, we can mix all the fine culture we see with tasty slices of that culture we can eat. To enrich your experience, make a point to create edible memories by savoring the fine cuisines of europe. The variety is endless, and if you know how to choose a good place, you don't need to spend a fortune. A few basic rules for eating your way through europe. Go for the local specialties. You'll get better quality and price. Eat seasonally. Don't miss truffles on your pasta in fall or fresh berries in norway in summer. Remember, location can make the meal. Bosnia may not be famous for its food, but eating under the bridge in mostar makes a lifelong memory. Most of all, eat fearlessly. 
>> It's very chewy, you will see. 
>> Steves: Oh, that's good. Try things you've never had in places you've never been, and maybe complement that with an extra glass of wine... Or two. Some of the most affordable and enjoyable food in europe can be found not while seated at a table but while standing in the street or in the market. Every country has its own beloved street food. It's fast, cheap, and delicious. In greece, try the corner gyro or souvlaki stand. Gyromeans "turning, referring to the slow turning round of meat, roasted pork or chicken, shaved just for you. Slice up that meat... Toss in a little salad... Add tzatziki, a garlic yogurt sauce, and spices... And wrap it up in a cone of toasted pita bread. I love it. In istaninl, on the golden horn, a fish sandwich fresh from the guys who caught it at one of the venerable and very tipsy fish boats. Oh, man.

[people speaking in foreign language] 
>> Steve: This is istanbul fast food. Now, what--this is what kind of fish? 
>> Fresh mackerel. 
>> Steves: For a fun snack any time of day, go for the local sweet. For many, the waffles in belgium are a cultural highlight worth traveling for. In the countryside, don't miss delicacies in the small-town markets. In france's dordogne region, that would be goose liver pate, foie gras. 
>> This should be strong, right? 
>> Duck is different. Duck is strong. The gooses are sweet. 
>> Yeah, that's a good 
description: One strong, one sweet. You notice the difference? 
>> Steves: Mm-hmm. And chow down at food festivals. The end of april brings the annual artichoke fest in the tuscan town of chiusure. Young and old gather to prepare these bristly and quite addictive treats. They love their artichokes here. 
>> They're wonderful. 
>> Steves: I can see why. It's tasty. Mmm! What is it about these artichokes? 
>> Well, this community brought back this artichoke from extinction. 
>> Steves: This particular species? 
>> This particular species you see here. 
>> Steves: Wow. So they have a festival every year, then, huh? 
>> Every year. 
>> Steves: Tell me about this slow food. This is related to the slow food movement, right? 
>> Absolutely. It's the idea that you have to eat quality and not quantity and that you have to preserve the variety of foods. 
>> Steves: So no chemicals. 
>> No chemicals first but also the varieties. 
>> Steves: Okay. 
>> More variety is better. 
>> Steves: And eat in the season. 
>> Absolutely, always in season. 
>> Steves: I'll be back next year for the artichoke festival. It's great. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Steves: For a step up and a seat, there are lots of casual bars and bistros, hometown hangouts where you can enjoy local cuisine in comfort without going broke. One of the best examples of this n. Every town tempts you with tapas bars, where you belly up to the bar and just point at things you'd like to try. In denmark, I love the open-face sandwiches, which can be both simple and elegant at the same time. You can munch the best pizza ever for the cost of a fast-food hamburger in naples, where pizza was invented. The rustic simplicity of sausages and fondue seems just perfect high in the swiss alps. A refined lunch of quiche and salad in an outdoor cafe feels just right as you enjoy garden-fresh produce and herbs in france's provence. A paella feast on the beach in spain is one of the tastiest budget food experiences anywhere in europe. And when you get tired of eating like a peasant and want to dine a little dressier, europe has plenty of gourmet restaurants. In countries famous for their high-end cuisine, like france and italy, eating a fancy meal is an esiapart of the traveling experience. And it can be just as rewarding in a region like spain. Here in andalucia, along with the melt-in-your-mouth jamon, you can taste moorish influences that come with a whiff of the exotic. No trip to croatia would be complete without the beautifully displayed bounty of the adriatic. Dining on seafood like this can be well worth the splurge. Fine restaurants can surprise you in countries thsed to be considered high-cuisine backwaters. In edinburgh, you can forgo the haggis and enjoy duck or lamb with sauces influenced by scotland's old alliance with the french. And in stockholm, spices brought by recent immigrants are enlivening scandinavian staples like salmon and reindeer. Of course, eating with abandon means indulging in dessert. Once again, there's a range of options from the high end, like an apple souffle in brittany, to a more casual but exquisite treat, like cream cake in sloveni to gelato in italy. Immersed in a people-filled passeggiata, you realize life is good. Wow, nothing empty about those calories. I've been thinking about the power of media in our society. We are what we eat; we all know that. And it's the same when it comes to tv. 

[01:45:11]


Consider this: The ideas and entertainment we consume are like food for our brains. It shapes who we are both as individuals and as a society. Sure, junk media, like junk food, can be fun. But for a society to stay healthy, we need a balanced diet with quality media. That's where public broadcasting comes in. It offers a full array of programs, giving us a cultural diet that's low in fat, not sugar-coed, and high in moral fiber. Since the media shapes our outlook so powerfully these days, we need to be careful about who controls it. If only a handful of powerful companies control what media is available to us, we end up with fewer choices and fewer perspectives. It weakens the richness of public discourse. How do we prevent that? That's what this membership drive is all about. With your contribution, you can help keep public broadcasting a strong voice in the ever-narrowing media landscape. Lately, powerful forces here in the united states find public broadcasting a threat. It's hard to appreciate how vital an element public broadcasting is in our society until, god forbid, it's gone. This pledge drive isn't a drag; it's a celebration of the power of the individual to make a difference. This is your chance to help make this station strong. If you understand that, then you know that calling right now is flat-out good citizenship. Consider these thank-you gifts, and then please give us a ring.

The savings from the tips you'll learn will earn back the cost of this book on your first day in europe. We americans need to use both our time and our money smartly, and that's what europe through the back door is all about. Up next is a visual extravaganza of european fun and culture illustrating how people all around the world embrace life differently but with equal enthusiasm. Thanks so much for helping public television enrich our lives by inspiring us to live every day to its fullest. Sure, travel is full of towering monuments and grand experiences. But it's more than the blockbuster sites that make it into the grand tour. So often, it's the little serendipities and impromptu encounters that stay with you and enrich your life. Allow yourself to be spontaneous. Be open to new experiences. When in turkey, go to a cafe and smoke a hookah. In spain's galicia, try some freshly snipped octopus. When in budapest, lose your inhibitions for an hour or two, soaking with hungarians in one of their venerable spas. Take a moment and appreciate street musicians you'd walk right by at home. In greece,p quietly into the 12th-century byzantine chapel, and risk having a mystical experience. 
[sheep bleating] When a flock of sheep blocks your way in ireland, it's your chance to chat with a shepherd and shake his calloused hand. Crack open a beer on the wharf in copenhagen, and listen to some jazz. Walk with the pilgrims a while in the camino de santiago, and be inspired by their dreams. Or leap into the river in switzerland's capital city, and cool off with the locals. Whether you're gazing awestruck at leonardo's last supper or just eating some crazy taste treat... Pigs' ears. I never thouvet I'd be eating actual pigs' ears. Travel is about breaking out of your routines, being spontaneous, and living life with abandon.

[lively music] ?????? ?????? watching that final segment, I was thinking that whether you're running with the bulls, jetting across some fjord, or just quietly savoring a fresh new perspective, public television can be our window on the world. It's really important. Today our nation is faced with complex and unprecedented challenges both at home and abroad. We need thoughtful media that boldly and honestly grapples with these issues. We need programming that respects our intellect, assumes an attention span, and is not beholden to advertisers. We need one place on the dial that belongs to us.

>> Steves: Hi, I'm rick steves. To showcase the beauties of public televisjon, we've put together a thrilling european joy ride. In the next half hour, we'll experience europe 
with abandon: Mouthwatering food, fun-loving people, and a vivid culture. From running with the bulls in spain to diving off bridges in bosnia, it's hands-on travel today as europe embraces life with gusto, inspiring us to get the most out of our lives as well. Enjoy this high-energy first segment, and I'll see you at the break. Hold on to your castanets. 
[lively music] ?????? ?????? when you dream of european travel, you might first think of visiting the great museums, wandering awestruck through towering cathedrals, finding meaning in the rubble of ancient history and savoring cafe culture. But it's important to realize that europe is a vast and diverse continent with many more active ways to experience all it has to offer. It's a continent with incredible natural beauty that's as accessible as it is thrilling. Whether it's riding a canoe in the czech republic into postcard-pretty towns or biking around the pristine isle of aero up in denmark, europe comes with endless ways to get out of the museums and embrace life with gusto. If you've got the strength, you can try kite-surfing in southern spain, or you can always take it easier, wandering the pleasant paths and planked walkways in croatia's plitvice national park. The alps provide plenty of high-altitude adventures, whether hiking switzerland's berner oberland, scaling germany's zugspitze, or climbing high above the valley floor to the ruins of ehrenberg castle in austria. In italy, you can go on a truffle hunt in tuscany or peer into the crater of mount vesuvius just outside naples. And scandinavia gets your heart pumping. You can hike glaciers, explore the swedish archipelago, or go on a high-speed fjord safari. Wherever you go in europe, you'll find opportunities to energize your travels by trying active experiences. And don't forget to party. All over europe, you can join in local festivals and loosen up with new friends. 

[00:03:09]


[upbeat music] Germany and austria have plenty of rowdy beer halls and convivial beer gardens where you can get a simple meal, a huge beer, and enjoy it all with the hometown gang. The most famous place to do this is the hofbraeuhaus in munich. While often full of tourists, it's a great place to cut loose and mix in a little low-brow fun with the high culture of all those museums and galleries. It comes complete with rivers of beer, cheap food, boisterous atmosphere, and raucous oompah music. Munich is the home of the famous oktoberfest, but you can enjoy essentially the same oktoberfest fun any time of the year in good old-fashioned bavarian beer hall. For just as much fun and a little more intimacy, irish pubs offer travelers a cozy evening over a pint or two with cals. The pub is like a communal living room where children are welcome. Many pubs offer traditional music, creating a mini festival nearly any night of the week. 
[lively fiddle music] ?????? ?????? 
[applause] 
>> Thank you! 
>> Steves: And spain is a fiesta just waiting to happen. In andalucia, many cities have a spring fair. Pick the right town on the right day and you'll be swept up in the commotion of fancy horsemanship, sherry spritzers, and colorfully clad se??oritas. Polka dots never looked so good. Northern spain hosts one of the ultimate spanish parties, pamplona's festival of san fermin. This multiday celebration has parades for the whole family, serious all-night partying for adults, and its breathtaking running of the bulls. Embracing both its thrills and spills, europeans liveife with a bang. My european friends seem to understand that life is good, especially when you live it fully. And we know quality programming, like that which we enjoy here in public television, is part of good living as well. Consider how public television inspires us to get up and embrace life, to really experience our world. Th's a treasure. In my travels, I've noticed an irony. So often, people in the poor world live life with a spirit of abundance, and here in the rich world, many of us live our lives with aind-set of scarcity. I believe supporting public television is embracing life with a spirit of abundance. And right now, that comes with some great travel gifts. With these thank-you gifts, we're celebrating public television and making this station strong in your community. Contribute $60 for the europe through the back door guide book or the new season on dvd. Or contribute $160 for every gift we're talking about: The guide book, the new season on dvd, and the huge 13-disk boxed set with our entire 90-episode series. And at each level, you'll also receive the europe map, tour newsletter, and rick steves smithsonian magazine. Thanks for your calls. It's more important than ever that we have a people's alternative to commercial broadcasting, and this station is it, with a passion for programming that enriches our lives and celebrates our world. When you give at that top $160 level, you'll receive all the gifts, and that includes this dvd boxed set. Here's a little tease, just 60 seconds out of the 50 hours of travel fun packed into this gift. The rick steves europe anthology is the definitive video library of european travel. 90 episodes take you from the fjords of norway to the canals of france, from the wild coast of ireland to enchanting estonia.

>> Okay. 
>> Steves: For any trave or europhile, these 90 episodes with 50 hours of video offer a lifetime of travel learning, lessons, and fun. Next up, it's time to eat, and we're in for some unforgettable taste treats. As you watch, consider the value of public television to open up our world, to introduce us to things we'd never know about otherwise. It helps us learn valuable lessons by getting us out of our comfort zone-- into new food, for example-- and exposing us to different ideas. Public television is a positive educational force. It carbonates our lives in a beautiful way. And it happens because of your enlightened support. Now bon appetit. Eating is one of the joys of life, and for europeans, food is almost a religion. They eat with passion. And when we travel, we can mix all the fine culture we see with tasty slices of that culture we can eat. To enrich your experience, make a point to create edible memories by savoring the fine cuisines of europe. The variety is endless, and if you know how to choose a good place, you don't need to spend a fortune. A few basic rules for eating your way through europe. Go for the local specialties. You'll get better quality and price. Eat seasonally. Don't miss truffles on your pasta in fall or fresh berries in norway in summe remember, location can make the meal. Bosnia may not be famous for its food, but eating under the bridge in mostar makes a lifelong memory. Most of all, eat fearlessly. 
>> It's very chewy, you will see. 
>> Steves: Oh, that's good. Try things you've never had in places you've never been, and maybe complement that with an extra glass of wine... Or two. Some of the most affordable and enjoyable food in europe can be found not while seated at a table but while standing in the street or in the market. Every country has its own beloved street food. It's fast, cheap, and delicious. In greece, try the corner gyro or souvlaki stand. Gyromeans "turning, referring to the slow turning round of meat, roasted pork or chicken, shaved just for you. Slice up that meat... Toss in a little salad... Add tzatziki, a garlic yogurt sauce, and spices... And wrap it up in a cone of toasted pita bread. I love it. In istanbul, on the golden horn, grab a fish sandwich fresh from the guys who caught it at one of the venerable and very tipsy fish boats. Oh, man.

I never thought I'd be eating actual pigs' ears. Travel is about breaking out of your routines, being spontaneous, and living life with abandon.

[flashbulbs popping] 
>> Dance is abment, and photography is about freezing a moment in time. Wow, beautiful. But ballet in particular, there are very definite lines to stay within. An arabesque can't be bent. The legs have to be straight. Good dance photography is special because movement continues in a still image. An essence of a human being comes forward. I started off as a dancer, and then I became a photographer. Has it been rosy all the time? Oh, no. Has it been easy? Far from it. But I have done what I've wanted to do, and I continue to to this day. I was born in englewood, and I grew up in maywood, new jersey. It was a magical setting for kids. My mother had big blue eyes and a ki sense of humor. And my father,hen we were little boys, very much involved in his career and in the military. But I looked up to him, and I wanted his affection. 
>> When we were owing up, we would dance all the time. We w do the twist if that was what was happening at the time. We were always dancing. 
>> On occasion, my mother would ask, "would you like to study dance?" And I would always give my father's answer: "Boys don't do that." I gave the answer my father wanted to hear. Didn't give the answer that I really wanted to give. I was 18 miles away from new york city, but I might as well have been on another planet, because there was no exposure to dance other than on television. The first time I saw real ballet was on the ed sullivan show. 
[applause] 
>> Now from the new york city ballet, jacques d'amboise with karel shimoff. And they're wonderful. Let's have a wonderful, wonderful welcome for them. 

[00:38:17]


>> And my mother would always scream from the den, when I was upstairdoing my homework, "they're on." And I'd go barreling down the airs, and we'd watch them in awe and in silence and just, ow, look at them." And I thought, "those are divine creatures from outer space. They're not human. They can't be." I thought ballet was a world one was born into, like royalty. I had no idea that one could learn it. When I was in tenth grade, I auditioned for brigadoon, our high school play. And I not only made it as a dancer; they made me a solo dancer, and I was thrilled. And we did the original agnes de mille choreography. A person who worked directly with her came from new yk to stage it on us, and he said, "steven, my goodness, you have these legs and feet and splits and extension. But you must study ballet as a foundation." So I went home, and I said, "mom, I'd like to study ballet now because"--and I told her the story. And she was very excited. She said, "of course." And myather was not so happy about it. 
>> My dad being an ex-military guy and kind of machismo kind of guy, it didn't set well with him. My father would have been more comfortable with steven excelling at football versus ballet, which he had no knowledge of. 
>> Our family, being second-generation greek, wanted so much to be american and to fit into the mold. And perhaps that's exactly where steven's father was coming from. 
>> I believe that in this country and our family and the world at the time when steven was looking to be a dancer that it was a bold move. It was a bold step. 
>> So I started taking ballet lessons in a little school in new jersey. And the first day I got there, there was a magazine with a picture of robert blankshine from the joffrey ballet leaping on thite house lawn in a giant split. And this answered so many questions for me, you know. This confirmed so many things. This said, number one, "there's a man in tights, and he's leaping, and it's got to be okay with the general public, because he's in front of the white house." And then I went in and took the class, and between the beautiful girls and the plies and the connection with the beautiful classical music, I knew that moment, "this is what I want to be. I want to be a ballet dancer." 

[00:40:45]


>> It's something that happens to very few individuals when you get a calling. No matter what, come hell or high water, you're going after it, and nothing's going to stop you. And that's what happened to my brother, I feel. 
>> So I took two classes a week for about four months. But during this period, there was a big change in my life at my high school. Being in a broadway show was cool for the high school kids. But being a formal ballet dancer was something I really wanted to keep to myself. But word got out, and I went from being the most popular or one of thst popular, funny guys in the school to a laughed-at, bullied, made-fun-of person. It was very rough, very rough for me to handle, to the point where I would go home every day after school, and I would just collapse. I said, "please, mom, don't make me go back to this high school. Please, I can't. Because I want to be a ballet dancer. I know it now. And I can't handle it." I was in a diner on the highway, and the waitress had this very balletic look to her. And I asked her if she was a dancer, and she said yes. And I said, "do you know of any great schools in new york?" She said, "the joffrey school is the best." I got up the nerve. I found out where they were downtown in new york city. I got on the bus on a saturday, since there was no school, and went in and walked up this stacase. It was very ominous, but I loved it. I knew where I was headed, I suppose. And I walked right into the office, and I said to the secretary, "i'm here to audition for a scholarship." So she asked me how many years I'd been studying, and I said four. It wasn't really a lie. I could have finished and said four months, but I just said "four," and I left "months" out. And she said, "you'll take the advanced class at 12:30." I went out, I got dressed, and I walked into the studio, and I was the first one there. And I sensed some great things had been happening in this room. I found myself a safe place at the bar. No one was there yet. I thought, "i want to be out of the way." And the dancers started to come in-- obvisly company members from the joffrey and other companies too and very advanced students. And then nureyev and fonteyn walked in the room. And then I knew, "i am in over my head." And the class began, and I ran around the room for an hour and a half, mimicking the dancers. It was basically a chase that I never kept up with. It was so difficult and embarrassing. So I walked back into the office, drenched with sweat. The secretary did not look up. All she said was... 

[00:43:51]


>> The teacher feels you have no talent. No talent. No talent. 
>> And I stood there absorbing that. But I was thinking "what's the alternative here? It's nonnegotiable. I am not going back to high school next year in new jersey." So I thought, and I thought, and then I said, "is there another class I can take?" And that's whee looked at me. And she said... 
>> There's one at 4:00. 
>> So I went out, sat down, waited until 4:00, and went into that class. And that was a completely different experience. That class was intermediate level. That was taught by another man. So theecond time I walked into the office, she looked up again, and she said... 
>> This teacher feels you are very talented. Very talented. Very talented. 
>> He said, "we must give him a full scholarship." So I went home, I told my parents, and the training began. And it was intense training. These teachers were very, very serious. 
>> The studying was extremely focused on learning technique. And I think I took four and five classes a day. I mean, you had a technique class in the morning. Then you had a menlass and a partnering class and another technique class. 
>> There w strong discipline involved in your stance and your behavior in class. There was no talking. At one point, the pianist was playing so loud, the teacher barked a real big correction across the room at me, and I said, "excuse me?" And he said, "what?" And I said, "excuse me? I didn't hear you." He said, "get out." I mean, it was that serious. 
>> Boot camp. It was like boot camp. 
>> For instance, the jumps at the end of the class, I was gasping for air, and he would scream, "don't stop! Don't stop! Don't stop!" 

[00:45:53]


>> Constant practice. That was the thing that amazed me the most, the amount of hours and hours of hard practice. You can't do the normal things that the rest of us were doing. The prom and staying out and all the things that teenagers do, he wasn't gonna be able to do. 
>> My father was angry about this american dream gone wrong. Head no interest in my becoming a ballet dancer, especially early on. My father would not allow my mother to pick me up at the bus stop. And it was a mile and a half from the house, maybe further. So winter, spring, summer, fall, I had to walk home, and I had to walk to the bus. 
>> Steven was very sad when he would come home. There were times where he would come home from the city and he would be exhausted. And I remember being at the house and him dropping his bag at the front door, being very tired, and lou being very, very forceful with him: "Pick up your bag. You shouldn't be that tired. This is what you want to do." I do recall the tension. The tension was great. 
>> So I'm now studying one year and four months. I had seen a performance of the new york city ballet during that year. And I fell in ve with this company. I saw the most beautiful dancing. I thought, "my god, that's perfection." And I thought, "that's the company, in a perfect world, for me." Again, I got up my nerve, and I went to the school of american ballet, and I auditioned. And then they called me into the office afterwards, and they said, "well, steven, you are a little overweight, you're a little heavy, and you're old; you're 16. But you show great promise. So we'll give you a year. We'll keep you in intermediate men's, and if you improve significantly, we'll let you stay." At that point in my life, I knew nothing about george balanchine. 

[00:47:59]


>> When george balanchine came to america in 1934, there was no american ballet in any real sense. What ballet we had was an entirely foreign transplant. And people experienced it as that. It was a foreign novelty. It did not arise from or speak to the american experience. The unique aspect of balanchine, his great significance, is that even though he was an emigre artist, he came to the united states and embraced america in all of its aspect. He loved the speed, the pace, the angularity of american movement. And he was determined to lay the groundwork for a genuinely american style of ballet. He did that first by starting a school, the school of american ballet. Once he started to get the dancers he wanted to work with, he put together a series of companies. But they took shape in 1947, 1948, and then became new york city ballet. Second of all, he created a repertory of dances that expressed his ideas about american movement and american life. Without balanchine's having done these things, I daresay that ballet in america would still seem like a foreign trsplant. Instead, now, half a century down the line, it feels like something that belongs to us, that comes out of us, and he did that. 
>> I started to learn a lot more about mr. Balanchine seconds after arriving at the school, because it was the only topic of conversation with all of the students. It was all about this great genius, this great choreographer, this great man. And the first time I saw him was when he would appear unannounced at the studio just to sort of spot-check the students and watch his teachers. 
>> All of us students were terrifd when he'd walk in the door. He'd come in for a little while, watch, and then leave, because I think he had a very good eye and knew what he wanted. As he always said, "i know what I want to see on that stage." 

[00:50:06]


>> Maybe a year or so later, if we were working on a piece of choreography, and he would be hands-on with us and show me how to hold a girl and put her over her leg. My heart was pounding with him within reach of me and looking at me and speaking to me. It was thrilling. It was thrilling. 
>> You know, I always felt he was a father figure for me. He was like the father that I never had. One time, I was very young, my first years, and I was walking home in the snow, and I didn't have boots on. So he picked me up-- took my bag, picked me up, and carried me over the snow and the slushy streets, the snow-covered streets. You know, we were his children. We werhis family. 
>> We adored him. We loved him. We worshipped him. But it was not blind worship. It was really out of true recognition of how-- how great he was. 
>> Balanchine was ballet, and we were balanchine dancers. 
>> Over the two years that I was at s.A.B., I was completely determined that this is what I had to do and had to be. And at one point in the spring of 1969, after class, I was changing in the boys' dressing room, and we heard the phone ring. 
[phone rings] And the door opened, and the secretary said, "a phone call for steven caras." And I turned to the boys, and I said, "it's mr. B. I got in the company." And everybody laughed. And I got to the phone, and it was betty cage, the company manager of city ballet, and she said, "mr. Balanchine would like to invite you to join his company, and if you are interested, please come in on monday and sign a contract." I couldn't believe it. I started screaming. And all the kids came out of the dressing room: "What's happening?" "I got in the company. I got in the company." 
>> Steven had a meteoric rise, which I believe the family just was astonished by. 
>> When he was accepted, I just thought, "this is very big. How many people ever can get this opportunity, no matter how good they are?" 

[00:52:10]


>> He had what mr. Balanchine wanted, which was the energy, the attack, strong technique. Balanchine wanted dancers who were interesting to look at, somebody you wanted to watch. And that was steven. 
>> I'll never forget how nervous I was the first day I was to take company class with city ballet. It was tuesday, the day after I signed the contract. I went into the state theater, I went up to the main rehearsal hall, and there I was amongst those dancers that I loved so much; for two years, I was watching from the audience. I found myself a place at the bar in the very back of the room, and mr. Balanchine walked in. He clapped his hands once, and the plies began. And then he gave a very quick tendu st, bum, bum, bum, bum, and then a very quick tendu jete step off the ground, off the ground, off the ground. The end of the bar, when everyone walks to the center, I stayed in the very, very, very back of the group just to get as tiny and as invisible as I could. But mr. Balanchine walked through the class. The waves parted. I thought, "oh, no, he can't be coming to me. I--he can't." He grabbed me, he took me by the shoulders, he walked me to the front of the room, he turned me around to face everybody, and he said, "this is our new greek boy. We will make him strong." And they all applauded. And I thought, "my goodness, he is a king, and he's a daddy. He's both." With only three years of training, how in the world could I keep up with the best dancers in the world? My first performance was maybe two days after I joined the company. The first ballet that I was in was the first ballet that I saw, a midsummer night's dream. And of all things to be in, it's the wedding march. And I thought, "how perfect. I'm rrying this company and this world that I love so much." But they taught it to me very quickly, and within a day or two, I was onst performing that. It's the simplest dance a corps member can do. It is so easy. It is intermediate easy. But I was petrified. One of the most beautiful girls in the company, linda merrill, was my first partner. 

[00:54:37]


>> And here is this absolutely gorgeous man with a beautiful physique, beautiful legs, beautiful feet, incredible partner, and he's dancing with me, d we're going for it. And I squeeze his hand to say, like"honey, we're going for it." 
>> There's a b pop noise, like a... 
[clicks tongue] And then the curtain goes flying up, and you hear... 
[makes buzzing noise] And then you see all these lights that look like diamonds, and a big cold rush of air-conditioned air hits you in the face. And there's this huge orchestra at your feet that was gigantic in sound and overpowering. And suddenly I felt so tiny and insignificant. But linda had looked at me right before the curtain went up, and that was just what I needed to hold me through this. 
>> I remember being in the audience and seeing steve onstage at lincoln center and crying... 
[chuckles] Because I was so proud and just amazed at what he could do. 
>> We leapt out of our seats. And, you know, we were applauding and thinking, "am I supposed to say 'bravo'? I think we'rsupposed to say that, so let's say it too." And the whole family said, "bravo! Bravo!" 
>> The actual time that my father admitted to steven how proud he was of him was many, many, many years after this particular evening at the new york state theater. 
>> I think, ultimately, he did understand. I think, ultimately, lou came to the realizationhat this was his son and that he did love him. But I believe much damage was done long before that. I think there's lasting damage, that loss of early love can never be replaced. 
>> When I joined the company, there was a great sense of formal protocol. Balanchine's leadership flavored t entire atmosphere. You dressed appropriately if you were backstage. You dressed appropriately when we flew to another country or another city. 

[00:56:48]


>> We werethe argonauts on a boat and all sharing this new york city ballet at a creative time. I mean, balanchine would do four, five ballets a season. Robbins would lead two or three. It was an amazing, fecund time of rich-seeded life and fabulous dancers and balanchine every day, every day there, and classes and every night in the wings, watching, watc 
>> when you went into class with mr. Balanchine, you never really knew what to expect. 
>> The bar was the fastest thing I'd ever experienced. It was, like, 20 minutes, and it was like this, fast, fast, fast, fast. Then we went to center, and he gave combinations for the girls. And I remember standing at the bar waiting for the boys' step for about what seemed like 20 minutes, and then all of a sudden, one of them went, "hello, mr. B., We are"-- and he went, "ah, boys. Ah, girls, go away. Boys, come on." And then he gave us a step. And double tour to a calm plie, that was the first step. Stone cold at that point. And then, of course, towards the end of my life with him, I wouldn't want to miss one of his classes, because I ended up thinking they were the best classes ever. 
>> Or sometimes you could see a bit of the choreography he was gonna put in the next ballet. 
>> Let's say, one day, he s gonna oreograph a variation and it had a lot of footwork. So one day, he'd be working on that in class. One day, he'd be working on some kind of special turns, one-time jumps, a lot of ports de bras. 
>> He told many stories. He often talked about cooking. I remember one time, he said, "you really need to read the gulag archipelago." 
[laughing] AND I SAID-- I said, "what? I need to read what?" "No, no, no, you must read solzhenitsyn." And I said, "i do?" He spoke every day abo art and literature and philosophy and things that mattered. Our class in the morning was as much a lesson in how he wanted us to look onstage as much as how he wanted us to behave and to be. 

[00:59:13]


>> I think that audience members that see ballet have a misconception that there is no pain and it's lovely and it's pretty and it's not difficult and it's effortless, and it's so not the case. What you see from the audience and what we're feeling are very often two very different things. 
>> When you're a dancer, you usually take class in the morning, you rehearse during the day, and then you perform at night. And you get tired. 
>> You might not know it, you might not even acknowledge it, but the physical rigors of, you know, basically seven days a week, all day long, rehearsals, classes, performance, it does take its toll. 
>> I have had probably a file that thick at the doct office. 
>> I've torn my achilles. I've had both hips replaced. 
>> Actually, my back just last year, I have three bulging discs. 
>> Knee injury, torn hamstring. 
>> I have a daily routine after work of putting my ankles in ice buckets. 
>> My kneeas basically going out, and I had to take painkillers and get out there and dance with that. 
>> My back, my neck, my hands. 
>> I tore my acl. 
>> I was in a demi-solo in a ballet called theme and variations. And I landed on one leg and fell to the floor. It completely affected my dancing for the rest of my dancing career. It was a turning point in the wrong direction. You know, it's one thing to become a member of a ballet company. It's another thing to last physically. But yet it's another thing entirely to make it emotionally and deal with, "not young enough, not thin enough, not tall enough, not high enough, not whatever enough." And that's what ballet is, and that's just physically. But what that takes on you emotionally is something else entirely. 

[01:01:17]


>> Everything that is being told to you is bally, "you're doing it wrong." So it takes a lot of courage to stand up there and accept that and say, "you're right. I'm doing it wrong, and I have to fix it, and it's my job." 
>> It's a very exacting profession. You know, it is about being perfect. It's about turning your human body into something that is perfectly beautiful and to--executing movements that are impossible perfectly. 
>> There's no such thing as the perfect dancer. And you are striving to be this. 
>> And there's a tremendous cost to that. You really don't value just yourself or who you are or how you feel or maybe even your humanity. But that is a cost you pay. And I would say that for some people, it's worth the cost. It was for me. 
>> It does get sca from time to time. There were a couple of ballets that I still remember, when i hear the music now, my stomach sort of goes in circles and knots. 
>> As you're standing in the wings and the music is coming, your entrance is coming, are your toe shoes in place? And the ribbons there, is your hair in place? But that's part of the excitement is overcoming that fear and trying to meet that challenge. 
>> It takes tremendous courage to be a dancer. It takes tremendous intestinal fortitude to go through the demands of that career. You are at every minutexposing your true self-- I'm gonna get emotional here-- to vast numbers of people who don't know you and only want you to fail. You've got to be able to step up, pick yourself up off the floor when you've fallen down, and keep going. It's a frightening thing to have to do. It's a frightening thing to have to dance. 
>> After about six years of dancing with city ballet, I was really blown out. I was emotionally and physically completely at the end of my rope. I was in the corps de ballet, but we danced eight performances a week, and I was in three and sometimes four ballets a night. And I went to mr. Balanchine, and I said, "i'd like to leave the company." And he said, "don't quit. Take a leave of absence. Get a job as a waiter somewhere. Tell us where it is. We'll give you great tips. And then if you'd like to come back and there's room, you've left the door open." So that's what I did. I took a leave of absence. So I took class every day. I stayed in very good shape. And about eight or nine months later, I received a call from lincoln kirstein asking me to come back to the ballet. He said, "stevie, the parade passes you by very quickly. Make the decision. Don't take too much time to make the decision." So within 24 hours, I said, "i'm back. I'm back." I went back because it was all I knew, all I knew. Ballet was my love, ismy love. It always has been. Well, en I came back to the company, I was back in some ballets that I had been in before. 

[01:04:34]


[dramatic orchestral music] ?????? ?????? but then some wonderful things took place too. Mr. Balanchine gave me a gift of the first theme in the four temperaments, which was sublime and a beautiful part. 
[dramatic orchestral music] ?????? ?????? my favorite role in the entire repertory was donizetti variations. And there are three boys in it. And when I did come back, I noticed that nine guys were called to learn those three roles, and I wasn't one of them. But when I found out his reason, it was a giant turning point in my life for me. Mr. Balanchine said, "oh, well, dear, you know, you've danced the part enough. Let's let others get a chance to do it. I want to see new faces." And that was a killer comment for me to hear, because i thought, "at 26, if I'm an old face, this means there's a time limit on my time in this company and as a dancer." And time is also the most expensive element in a world like ballet. 
>> Dancers have hard lives because they stop in the middle. And once they stop, they have to find a solution for the rest of their lives. And sometimes they do, and sometimes they don't. 
>> You can't dance all your life, unfortunately.T!T! Mr. Balanchine allowed no one to come in from any of the publications or any of the media to photograph the company. He knew it should be someone that thoroughly understood ballet. So when I asked mr. Balanchine I could photograph, he welcomed me into it and gave me privileged access, truly, to this private world. And I started playing with black-and-white film and photographing dancers from the wings and performance. I photographed them in rehearsal. I photographed them warming up. So I felt I had a potential purpose again. 

[01:25:17]


>> And he was always around, always around with the camera, always. It was like, "stop it." But there he was. And, you know, he was obviously very good at it, and he had a gift. 
>> The dancers liked my pictures because they knew a family member was recording them and they knew that I knew how they wanted to look. So they enjoyed seeing themselves from a dancer's perspective and knowing them so personally as people but also as artists. 
>> You always felt confident with steve photographing you, because he knew. He knew what the position should look like, and he always wanted the best for each person he was photographing. 
>> He knew what everybody would like, because he knew what the picture was supposed to be, not just the pose but the energy and the spirit in the picture. 
>> Steve knew the choreography, the moment. It was just natural. We felt naturally at ease with steve's presence, which is very important. 
>> Well, he was always joyous about it. It was--it was something joyous for him to take the photos. 
>> Martha swope, who was the reigning photographer of the company, she taught me how to develop a roll of film and how to make a print, and in turn, I cleaned her studio for her, and I walked her dog topo. 
[dog barks] Some of the first shots I remember printing myself in my own darkroom were of bart cook in square dance-- beautiful jump-- and a picture I loved of mr. Balanchine I took backstage in saratoga springs. It was in his typical western shirt, and he was thinking about something. 
>> But we all endorsed it, and we all loved him, and we all knew that he discovered a talent, you know, another talent. And dance is not forever, as we all know, so this was something that we all agreed to allow him to be around everywhere. 

[01:27:28]


>> Not long after I bought my first camera, we were filming ballets for pbs. And I asked mr. Balanchine before we took that trip, I said, "mr. B., Can I bring my camera and take some pictures?" And he said, "yes, as long as you're quiet and you stay out of the way." So I was thrilled. So in the ballets that I wasn't dancing in, I was photographing. So I was in the balcony, and I was in little nooks and crannies. And I took a bunch of pictures. A couple weeks went by. We're back in new york, and mr. B. Asked if I would bring my contact sheets his office the next day. And I said to him, "well, they're not very good. They're out of focus, and some are overexposed, and some are underexposed. Do you really want to see them?" And he said, "yes, dear, please bring them in." So I brought them in the next day, and I sat with him in his office. And he started to point at them. "I need 5 of this one, 10 of this one, 30 of this one." And when I heard mr. Balanchine say, "i need this picture, I need this picture," I realized I had an excuse to belong to the world that I loved for the rest of my life. And that's the day I knew I was a photographer. 
>> The next thing is, steve has become a company photographer, taking terrific pictures. 
>> He had the advantage of being a fantastic dance photographer because he was a dancer himself. So he knew exactly from what angle to take the picture. He knew exacy when to snap. But obviously there was a gift there too. And so his pictures always ended up being superior to any other picture. 
>> Iyou're somebody who has been inside these dances, who hasn't just watched them but who has executed them, then you know something that goes much deeper about their flow, about their structure. You really know not just where to point the camera and what's going to happen, but you have an instinctive sense of what moment you should try to capture. 

[01:29:34]


>> When somebody's moving, it's very hard to catch it at the right moment. He knows the right moment. He always did. So he was a fellow dancer who had a very great eye. 
>> A great photograph lets the subject of the photograph live. And you see that in steve caras' work. E lushness and sity his photographs draw us in as vieallowing us to be in that exact moment. You look at old, old photographs of nijinsky, for example, even though they give you some sense of what he must ve been like, they feel static. The shutter speeds were slow. There was no possibility of shooting in a performance setting. When you see a photograph like this, it is as though you've just looked up from your program and suddenly this moment is there before you. 
>> You feel the performance in hishotographs. You take one look at a steve caras photraph, and you know what it is to dance. 
>> Part of it is because he knows them. Then he has this opportunity to really get to the soul. 
>> When dancers are photographed, the passion comes through, and you feel their life. You feel their breath. You feel why they are so passionate about what they do. And it's contagious. 
>> We gain an excitement from looking at photographs of dance, because we are constantly brought back to this feeling of excellence. 
>> It takes us to where beauty, grace, agility all come together. Looking at photographs of dance brings us to another place. 
>> Within steve caras' archive, we are embracing many technological advances. We see his very early work in black-and-white, done under available lighting. He then moves to studio work in color. And he is now working in digital format. But his early work is on film, which is very important for a research archive. What photographers normally retain with their digital files is only their best images. With film, you have complete sequences. You see process. You see progress. We see sketchbooks within film that we will miss in the digital age. One of the most important components of steve caras' archive is that we can follow the career of certain dancers, such as baryshnikov. Early on, we see him in 1979 and 1980 under balanchine's influence dancing apollo as a young man. Later on, we see him in his dance a cloud in trousers. We see a much more mature baryshnikov, brilliant in his stance and in his definitive movements. In steve caras' photograph of suzanne farrell in vienna waltzesin 1979, we see a dancer at the peak of her performance. She is elegant. She is elongated. The sweep of her gown is stunning. But in this photograph, we have a record of this very moment for posterity. 

[01:32:39]


>> He's very interested in those transitional areas, the wings, the studios, the hallways, between the stage and preparation for the stage. 
>> That is the ultimate privileged view, the thing that we never get to see out front. 
>> You're putting your toe shoes on. You're getting yourself ready. You're doing the makeup. So your appreciation may be of the dance, the leaps, and everything that's going on on the stage, but he wants everyone to appreciate what happened to get them to the stage as well. I like that. One of my favorite shots is of gelsey kirkland in an a.B.T. Class. The potential revealed in that photograph is enormous. It hearkens to what will come in her future. Some of the most important photographs in sve caras' archive are of george balanchine interacting with the dancers. When he is showing them a gesture, when he is showing them a move, you can hear him speaking. And it's a reflective moment that he captures when suzanne farrell is portrayed in the wings. 
>> And when you see a photograph like this, you think you know the person in it because some part of their essence is coming through the image. 
>> Steve caras' career spanned it all. He was there. He did it. It's on film. 'S in prints. It's a cultural legacy that will be available for generations to come. 
>> IN THE EARLY '80s, Mr. Balanchine was there, but we all knew that he was feeling under the weather. And no one discussed it much, but still there was an air of concern for mr. B. 
>> But I know that as he grew more ill, he was there less and less. And at first, it was ver difficult for everyone, because they remembered him being there all the time. 
>> We sort of knew that it was getting towards the end. When mr. Balanchine's health started to fail, it was devastating. And to see somebody start to disintegrate like that was--it was heartbreaking. 

[01:34:54]


>> Well, they were devastated. They were in despair, because the company was george balanchine. And for many people, dance was george balanchine. 
>> The last night of our spring season in 1982 was july 4th. Traditionally, mr. Balanchine would bow once a year and at everyone's encouragement. I wasn't dancing that night, so I was out front with my camera, and I took the closest seat to the edge of the stage on what would be audience right, or stage left. Well, the ballet was beautiful, and at the very end, the crew normally turned the stage lights down. It would be very black in the stage, and mr. B. Would appear in front of the audience. But for some reason, they left all of the stage lights on, and it was extremely bright. 
>> And there are several of us dancers offstage applauding him. He's holding the curtain, and it looks like he's pulling it back, but he was actually holding on because his balance was so bad that he was very frail. And bouquets were being thrown to him, and the house jumped to its feet and was screaming. It was a cheer the likes of which I hadn't ever heard. It was like a rock concert. 
[cheers and applause] 
>> But I was staggered when I saw this photograph. I thought, this must be, in a way, the perfect photograph. It is the right man at the right moment pointing the camera in the right direction and telling the entire story of the moment through the image. 
>> This photo is probably-- it's gonna become the most famous photograph ever in the world of dance. 
>> I happened to be in the right place at the right time and take this photograph. I'm so glad I was there, because it's my favorite picture, and no one's dancing in it. 
>> Everyone knew that it was a matter of time and especially when he went to the hospital. 

[01:36:59]


>> Mind you, I'd been going to the hospital. I said, "oh, mr. B., how am I ever gonna be there without you?" And he said to me, "you must listen to petenow, because I can't do for you anymore, dear." 
>> Barbara hogan, balanchine's longtime secretary, called me, and she said to me that he's gone. And I said, "oh, my god." And she said, "why don't you come to the theater in a couple of hours?" And so a number of us met at the theater at, like, 6:00 in the morning. The big question was, should we do the matinee? And somebody asked me, "what do you think?" And I said, "i think we have to dance. That's what he would have wanted. We have to go out and dance, and we have to do our best." 
>> Everything we on. Everythi went on, because we felt, we all felt that that's what mr. Balanchine would want. 
>> And then the ceremony with hundreds of people packed in a very hot church. It was one of the most memorable and touching experiences of my life. 
>> Every time we lose a being, the world changes. But to lose a being who raised you like he did with steven and many of us-- he raised us. You know, we were all his people. 
>> I was born as an artist. I was confirmed as a dancer, what I wanted to be the day I saw that picture at that ballet school in new jersey. I said, "i wl be a ballet dancer." Mr. B. Made that happen for me. He taught us dignity, respect, protocol, manners, humor, music. He was everything to anyone who was a part of that world in my time. To me, personally, he saved me from drowning. When I left the company, it was because mr. Balanchine had passed away. And now I'm being hired by major publications and other dance companies. 

[01:39:08]


>> It's very hard for a dancer to do a photo shoot. You get very stiff, because, you know, you have to hold the poses. But with steven, it was just moving and fun, and we laughed. It was like dancing. And that, for a dancer, is mical. And I just crack up, smile, and he took the picture. And that's the one that they chose for the cover of dance magazine, to my surprise. 
[chuckles] 
>> He has impeccable timing. He knows the height of your battement. He knows the height of the position. In the studio and in performance, it's unbelievable what he can capture because of his sense of timing. 
>> And, I mean, that is a split second. It's a pose that's hit for a second or two, and then it moves on. But, I mean, the lighting and everything, the way he was able to capture it, was, yeah, spectacular. 
>> He did photo shoots out on the beach, you know, on a seawall. And I think he also trusts that if you have something to offer, he will take that in and respond to it so that you're working together as part of the process. 
>> When I met steven, you know, I knew his strength was ballet. And I helped encourage him to look beyond that. He started expanding his horizons a little bit. He was able to see what, you know, other choreographers were able to do in the modern genre, the contemporary genre. 
>> It's very hard for photographers to grab images of streb. What streb's subject actually is, is action and the implementation of action, the demonstration of action, and the presentation theatrically of action. Steven was all over the place. I think he got inside of the work that we were doing. I was in rapture, number one, when I saw the photographs that steven had taken, and not only that. I wanted them. 
>> That was probably one of my most favorite photo shoots that I've ever done. I love these pictures because he captured an essence of who I am not only as a mover but as a dreamer. His work is just extraordinary, and it stands apart. 

[01:41:18]


>> If lou was here, I'd say, "well, dad, look at your son. Look at your son." 
>> In my sphere, I would call steve a renaissance man. He knows music, he knows ballet, and he's a photographer. He's a speaker. He's a motivator. You know, his classes are incredible. 
>> I think he's among the best because he was a professional dancer. And that gave him the upper hand over everybody else. 
>> The dance world is lucky to have steve in it. 
>> I believe he's the greatest dance photographer that has ever lived. 
>> This will be, as he continues to photograph, one of the most extraordinary dance archives of the 20 and into the 21st century. 
>> If I could, I'd just walk through a world of steve caras' photographs every day.

Sure. Six weeks later senator sending a letter tepid response from this white house. 
>> Brian: Counter terrorism security group is the group that is is supposed to know what resources have every agency has. They know of multiple options and have the ability to coordinate counter terrorism assets across all agencies. They were not allowed to do their job. They were not called disturbing to say the least. 
>> Thartd. And reports now show that one of the first groups called was the fbi. The fbi comes in after the fact I was readi lot of material on the way over here. Different reports. What group, who was called when. It's clear there was a lot of confusion and not a lot of coordination. Have you got to give credit for the guys in that annex who, when they were called, said regardless of what assets are being brought to bare, we are going to put our gear on and head out the door and head to the sound of the guns which is what those seals who were ultimately killed did. They didt wait for someone higher up to call they made the call. That's the american way and kind of courage we want to see. 
>> Brian: Knows what it is like when the afghan forces get infiltrated and the guys you train turn their guns against you. Find out some of the libya security forces may have been working for the other side or at the very least been loyal to the other side. Your reaction? 
>> Not surprising. They discovered new documents that showed that there was concerns as recently as that morning of september 11th. Taking photos of the compound and police officers that were supposed to come in and provide additional security. This happens all the time in places like this where there is a security vacuum and you have got security forces whose allegiances are unknown. All you can do is as security personnel is watch those folks closely. You know, take away the sensitive material they might have or photographs or cell phones as best you can ultimately, if you are outnurebbed and they know the terrain. If you don't have additional security details there you are going to be vulnerable. That's exactly what happened. We are learning insider aspect to this. 

[00:02:08]


>> Brian: Showing loyalty to the other side by not doing anything to protect. 
>> That's right. Don't have to shoot at you. Don't have to dying in or send intelligence out. Go here, go there this is where they are vulnerable. That's sometimes all it takes. 
>> Brian: All right. Captain. Thanks so much for joining us. 
>> Thanks. 
>> Brian: Coming up straight ahead much the candidates stepping out in full force in battleground states. We will hear each of their final arguments and let you be the judge. Millions of americans were no food, no gas, no power after hurricane sandy. So, when will all this help come?

>> Steve: Total devastation in many cases. The people are powerless and long patience fast. Nearly 3 million people mostly in new york and new jersey waking up on this saturday morning. They are in the freezing cold in the wake of sandy. Dave briggs got o to staten island during the dark. The sun is coming up and, da I would imagine, yep, you are surrounded by even more devastation, aren't you? 

[00:07:12]


>> Unimaginable devastation, steve. More more so than michael whose home is right behind us, a home he cannot go into because of the red sticker that you may or may not see it's unsafe area you cannot enter your home. Michael, how difficults this to return home this morning? 
>> I can't explain it. Now it's 69. I'm homeless. 
>> I can't imagine. You were here with your two sons. 
>> I was working. They were just devastated. The wave took my son who was in that car and smashed it and he had water all around -- my oldest son came around the corner and was able to get the door open, I don't know how. And then they ran. And they were there from when the the first -- from the wave first hit until 9, 9:30 in the morning. 
>> You say this water record level surges. More than 10 feet sometimes. As high as 15 feet. 
>> Went over that building. 
>> Over that building? 
>> Right. 
>> How terrifying was that experience for you and your son? 
>> Well, for my sons, they were there, me, I didn't want to lose my sons, I didn't care about this pce. 
>> What do you do now? Where do you go? 
>> Well, my youngest son took us in and we got no clothes. The police department, my son, john, works for the police department. And they donated about 10 bags of clothes. There is people out there that want to help. It's a shame. Red cross truck. Patrol car coming around, it was so dangerous with the bull horn because we have always had floods here 4 feet. 

[00:09:22]


>> Many people are angered at the lack of response. At the lack of help they are receiving. They're pleading for food, for clothing, for gas. Are you angry? Or are you just upset? 
>> It's just a sign of the times. You know, there is too many other things that are more important than the people in the neighborhood. I mean, the politicians should start looking at helping all the people around. See the need. I mean, instead of spreading themselves all over the world. 
>> Lastly, what do you need? What do people here in staten island need? Because I know there is a lot of our viewers that would like to help. 
>> Just moral support. Maybe -- I have my family. There are some people that don't have anybody. Reach out to the people that really need that don't have food, I mean, I'm still working, but that's -- I chose to do it. 
>> A lot of perspective, obviously, 22 people lost their lives in staten iand. You lost your home. Our heart goes out to you. Thks for being with us this morning. Guys back to you. A lot of stories like michael's. He is not alone. This entire street. They all have stickers telling them they cannot enter their homes any time soon. 
>> Gretchen: That's so sad to see that raw emoon. 
>> Get the truck there. Can you get into those roads. These guys should get there get the red cross. It's not that big staten island where you can't get a dozen trucks in there today. 
>> Steve: Did you see him gripping his -- communicate with people. No electricity there. Nothing to plug into. So you wind up going stopping by the coffee shop or go to out at the mall in new jersey, nordstrom's has some power strips set up and falling chairs around it. Plug in phones and laptops and watch it and it also it's warm. 

[00:11:32]


>> Their assembly man came forward and said they are ignored. The white house scrammed -- scrambled to get them answers. 
>> Steve: They haven't seen it yet. 
>> Gretchen: Get to rick reichmuth who is normally here on the weekend. It's great to be in your company, rick. You are going to give us the weather island. 
>> The red cross has been out on staten island. They do an amazing job. That can provide some of those beginning basics for people. The electricity, obviously is such a big deal. 
[Inaudible] 
>> it's possible. If you get 10 trucks out there. Staten island. They had a lot of place informs go. When you spread a storm of this magnitude out across such a big area it takes time to get into all of those spots. The red cross, you know everybody, it's one of those great places to donate because they do such a great job every time after these storms. Big storm coming next wednesday also that we're going to be talking about. I want it show you. This thet five days looking cool all across the area. So people without power, you have got cooler days and cooler nights. The temps this weekend. The coldest we h seen. Tonight the coldest we have seen so far this year. That's the case out across jersey. Case in towards staten island. You see on this wednesday here. I will show you that more on a second. Wednesday is looking to be a big problem day. Next few days on long island as well. People without power still another cold one. Get towards wednesday. Take a look at. This we have been talking about a potential nor'easter. Good part is it is not a tuesday election day event it. It is a thursday event. We can't say exactly where this storm will be or how big it's going to be but the potential is in place for a very significant nor'easter. Not a sandy type storm but a nor'easter that could be big enough that could cause winds to get 40 to 50 miles per hour. Certainly some strong wind and rain and also some snow across interior sections. People here the exact area struggling potentially getting a storm wednesday, thursday. Real quickly I want to take to you tuesday and election day. It's actually looking really pretty good. The storm that's going to be our wednesstorm will b forming on tuesday down across parts of the southeast gulf. That's the only spot we will see problems that day. The rest of the country you are looking really really good for election day. One bit of good news for election world. 

[00:13:50]


>> Brian: The problem is the schools don't have power. Usually vote in schools. They have to send the national guard trucks to show up and -- if you think people are going to travel a mile in good whether or not weather and go to a school and now ask them to go 10 to 20 miles to find a truck to go vote without a phone system to get them in touch of where to go to find that truck is reallgoing to effect. 
>> Steve: They will park the military trucks right at the location you are supposed to go to. Rear than going inside you somehow do it right there. 
>> Gretchen: Thank you, rick. Touch base with you throughout the morning. 
>> Steve: With just three days until election day, the state of virginia is one of the tightest races in the country. Not only is the presidential race a virtual tie. The senate race will come down to the wire as well. Peter doocy live in fairfax, virginia with the very latest on the cmonwealth. Peter? 
>> And since it's saturdaybefore the election, today is the final chance that people have in virginia to vote absentee in person. That's -- this is where the folks in fairfax county can do that later on today. Virginians for the last few months have been inundated with political ads on the it v and on the radio. Those visits are not going to stop before the election day, before in the next three days. President obama is going to in bristow, not too far from here later on this afternoon with former president clinton. We expect to see mitt romney at least twice in the last three days. We have been seeing a the love the president lately and seeing a lot of mitt romney. Was in virginia beach a few days ago, talking to their very big military population and he was basically telling them that if h is elected, he will put a stop to the sequester, those automatic defense cuts. The stronger american military. So strong none would think of testing it no one would beat us battlefield. That is essential to us and to the world. Unlike the president I will restore that funding to our military. 

[00:15:52]


>> There is a really tight senate race in virginia as well between two former virginia governors. Republic george allen and democrat tim cane. The two have raised a combined $30 million. Outside groups have spent another $40 million just on that senatee. Mitt romney has been sing for allen and vice president biden was here this week telling virginia voters to vote for cane while also putting the emphasis just like mitt romney was o the military. 
>> Folks, understand one thing. Barack and I believe as i believe you do. That we only have one sacred obligation as americans to equip those we send to war and care for them and their families when they comb home. 
>> Since 1952, virginia has backed a republic in every single presidential race except 1964 and008, we only have to wait three days to see if they will back a democrat, back to back elections for the first time in over half a century. Back to you. 
>> All right. That all important swing state of virginia. Thank you so much, peter. 
>> Steve: New ho knew about the allen tim cane race or tom cane. 
>> That happens a lot. 
>> Gretchen: Within the margin of error of below 1 percentage point. 
>> We live in the margin of error steph steve straight ahead on this special saturday show. Fox news has gotten ahold of secret cables. Contingency plan was ignored. Women's group calling on the president to come clean. Up next,ear from one of the members of that group. 
>> And a husband in the diagnose house with his wife. This goes to the extreme to say he is sorry would do you this? 
>> Steve: She still looks steamed. ] time drop? Campbell's has 24 new soups that will make it drop over, and over again. ?????? ?????? from jammin' jerk chicken, to creamy gouda bisque. See what's new from campbell's. It's amazing what soup can do. Ve lately. But because of business people like you, things are beginning to get rolling. And regions is here to help. Making it easier with the expertise and service to keep those wheels turning. From business loans to cash management, we want to be your partner moving forward. So switch to regions. And let's t going. Together. 

[00:21:00]


>> Gretchen: The group women united clean. 
>> When the steals called, they got denied. Now, what did america get? 
>> A cru and disgusting video he that sparked outrage through the muslim world. 
>> A response to inflammatory mate posted on the internet. 
>> The united states government had nothing to do with this video. 
>> It is in response to a video. 
>> A video. 
>> It's time for the truth. It's time for change. It's time for a real commander and chief. 
>> Gretchen: Will the owe he bama administration come clean. Joining me is the sister of theter of the hijacked. Flown into the pentagon on 9/11. She is a member of the women united pac. 
>> Good to see you. 
>> Gretchen: You believe the president needs to come clean with the american people. What do you want him to say? 
>> I want him to tell it the truth. You know, I stood with 9/11 families on the morning of the benghazi attack with the president at the pentagon and he told us that our military delivered a cripplinglow to al qaeda. Leadership was devastated. Bin laden was dead and never threaten us again. Longest war in history would be over in 2012 what we knew the families standingn front of him the president had told us a beautiful lie. That al qaeda is not dead. That al qaeda is on the rise. And just a few hours later, thats proven out when we sa the black flag of al qaeda hoisted over our embassy. We think the american people need to be told the truth about what is actually happening in the middle east. The rise of the muslim brotherhood which is the political arm of islamist groups. And the fact that our -- this was not a consulate in benghazi. Everyone is calling it a consulate except the president and hilly clinton. 

[00:23:09]


>> Gretchen: What was it it? 
>> A consulambassy that gives out visas and passports and has an american flag flying and takes visitors. This was shadowing unmarked clandestine building there was no american flag flying there where the united states was engaged in a secret mission recruiting reebles war. They were including among them the jihadi population. In other words, our government was involved in the bad lands of benghazi which is run by ansar al sharia. The very same people that attacked our embassy. What people need to know is thatted when cia sent a reaction force from tripoli, they were held at the airport for three hours while our people were desperately pleading for help. 
>> Gretchen: Why? 
>> They were held by the libyans. The libyans wouldn't let them through. They asked for heavy weapons because all they had were light weapons, pistols and rifles and they were denies a well. President obama and hillary clinton put brigades benghazi mission. The american people need to know that that -- the 17th martyr brigades are named after 11 islamists who died common stralgt in front of the alian consulate in benghazi. Because they were protesting over the danish car tunes. When cartoons. They were not allowed to have weapons. They didn't come. Do you know when the 17th martyr brigades came? After all our people were dead and the attack was over. 
>> Gretchen: Some unanswered questions and you are harmed with a lot of information debra burlinggame thanks for coming on today.

>> Brian: Countdown continues for election day. The economy continues to be the number one issue for voters. 
>> Steve: President obama says he needs four more years to fix what he started. The question is what has he done in first four years. Nicole petallides from the fox business network joins us. Good morning. 
>> Good morning. 
>> Steve: The price of gas how much was it and now how much was it? 
>> We have a lot of great things to look at before and after. Here it is in 2008. 1.85. 2012, 3.80. So many of us have been to the gas pump have seen it over 4 bucks. 
>> Brian: The esident's answer during the debate was laughable. The economy was doing so much worse it had to be low. 
>> Steve: Blamed bush. 
>> Everything rg he has been doing in this administration has not been beneficial to the american people. You talk about unemployment the poverty rate. You talk about weare, you talk about how this ministration is spending. They are spending more on welfare than on any other item such as social security medicare, national defense more money is going to welfare, food stamps and stuff. 
>> Steve: Reason to explain 
that: Looat the poverty rate back when he took hold and now at it. It's up almost. 12.5% to 15.1%. Inspects not like we make these numbers up. These are the straight facts and bank failures is a good one to take a look at here. Back in 2008, 25 bank failures. 2 so far this year. And don't forget what we have been seeing. We have seen the administration add to our debt. 5 trillion in debt. We have had near zero interest rates. And, yet, at the same time, growth has been minimal and still on latest unemployment report, you see that we're really not growing fast enough at all. 
>> Steve: Going the wrong way. 
>> Going just slightly high ir. 
>> Steve: We need lots more jobs. 
>> We need a lot more jobs. At this rate what we have been seeing, we added 171,000 jobs on friday. 7.9%. At this rate when we talk to the former head of bureau of labor statistics, do you know how long it would take to get back? Almost 10 years.

>> Gretchen: Good morning, it's saturday, november 3rd, 2012. I'm gretchen carlson, thanks for sharing your time today. Brand new secret cables show the showing ending were in beng before four americans were killed. Why was that decision not made. 
>> Steve: As you saw on this program y the unemployment rate in the country has ticked up again. Just three days before the election. We now know more americans are out of work this month than last. How will this impact your vote? It's all about the economy, right? That's what we a going to ask governor mike huckabee when he weighs in in two minutes. 
>> Brian: From hope to change to revenge? We'll play the president's shocking comment that caught us by surprise and team romney's team too. The revenge to comment. "Fox & friends" for the second hour. 
>> Gretchen: Third. 
>> Brian: Third hour starts now. You know how I know it's the third hour? I'm on my third cup of coffee. 
>> Brian: I have never seen you jump down my throat like this. 
>> Gretchen: Come on. 
>> Steve: Brian kilmeade is back with us. He had damage. God bless you. You lost your entire first floor of your house. 
>> Brian: Right. 
>> Steve: You said, it could be worse I only lost the first floor. 
>> Brian: I haven't watched a lot of television. As bad as it is in staten island it's horrible. I want to let people understand how devastating it has been to long island. I'm not sure it's getting played I could be wro. All I get is satellite radio. Like many people I don'have electricity. My whole neighborhood got the very least thousands of people the first floor. My immediate left the house has exploded. The house next to it exploded. And then a lot of people didn't have flood insurance nobody knows what's going on. No sign that the heat is going on. The power is going on. Absolutely no communication. No cell service there is no gas leap. This is disaster. I want to make sure people know how bad things currently are on the island. I'm not complaining. I want people to know the people on long island you have got to pay attention there, too. 

[00:36:46]


>> Steve: You have a unique perspective. You are the embedded reporter for that particular situation and he has got some great. 
>> Brian: My family is going to look to be paid about this. 
>> Steve: Keeping your sense of humor we love that about you. You just mentioned staten island. Dave bringings is -- briggs is out there as the sun comes up and it is grim. 
>> Brian talks about people that did not have the proper covera here in staten island, that is all too real. If you look at the home just to my right it your left. We spoke with the owner this morning. His house is totaled. Unsafe area. That's what the red sticker on his window means. His house is totaled. He has coverage that did not include flood and hurricane coverage. It's all on him. He said many of his friends have the exactame situation. The next home, we just spoke with the owner who lost a porch, had to jump in the second floor window to stay safe with her and her dog. She is just one of many residents who actually consider themselves lucky this morning because, of course, 22 people lost their lives here on staten island alone in the wake of hurricane sandy. 106 people in the united states have been killed by this storm. It's an area that many are comparing to hurricane katrina. One state senator said this is our small katrina. My producer ron said this is very similar to the lower ni ward. He was there for two weeks. If we can pan just one more time to the other side of the street looks like piles of trash. Really what this is is people's goods, mattresses, chairs, desks, and on final note. The new york city marathon was, of course, called off. Many of the people here don't know that because they don't have power. I just spoke with one homeowner here. What do you think of the people that decided to cancel the marathon? She says she doesn't care. He is from russia been here for 20 years. Those are, quote. Sick people that were planning to go ahead with this marathon even though they cancelled itpeople were furious that they were ever considering it. More in the next hour including someone who lost their home. Guys back to you.

>> Dave briggs, thanks so much for that report. Being at the heart of it. 
>> Brian: Knicks did played last night packed house. Brooklyn put on on thursday. The knicks played unbelievable. The crowd seemed great. I was in dave and busters yesterday as well as the marriott. 
>> Steve: Because it was warm. 
>> Brian: It was packed. They were happy for the distraction I believe because there were a lot of people there that didn' look like basketball fans. 
>> Steve: Needed something to cheer for and they got it. 
>> Gretchen: Now for your headlines. President obama ordering the military to send fuel to new york in the wake of hurricane sandy. Gas shortages have sparked insanely long lines and left people panicked. Gas will be rationed starting today at noon. People with license plates ending in odd number will only be able to buy gas. Cars with license plates with even number. I have to tell you in connecticut all the license plates in line to get gas new york. A plea deal for suspected terrorist and al qaeda sympathizer in interview with u.K. Newspaper. The sun, the lawyer for abu hamza al masri says he may plead guilty to and return for a lighter sentence. This just weeks after pleading not guilty to 11 terror charges. He is accused of trying to set up al qaeda training camps in the u.S. And taking hostage in yemen back in 1998. New information in last month's friendly fire death. Nicholas ivy, a report revealing ivy and two colleagues were in radio contact just before they fired their weapons. They also were close enough to signal to etch auto other using flashlights.

Add this to the list of joe biden's greatest gaffes. Here is the vice president at a rally in wisconsin.

>> Steve: Oops? 
>> Gretchen: Huh? Never been a proud to you have been proud to be the vice president? I don't think he meant that the vice president obviously unasquare -- unaware that he gerald his words. 
>> Brian: Here is a clue is he in trouble when he is looking straight ahead. Prompter is here and joe biden looking straight ahead everybody and his staff sweating. 
>> Gretchen: Somebody fabulous off prompter is governor mike huckabee who joins us live this morning from columbus, ohio. 
>> Gretchen: I missed you in those debates this year because you always had the great quip. 
>> Thank you very much, gretchen. I want to say to brian and all of his neighbors my heart goes out to you guys. It just devastating. To see this destruction, you know, I don't think people can fully comprehend and god bless you for hanging in there and having such a great spirit. It's encouragement to everybody. 
>> Steve: Absolutely. 
>> Brian: Everyone around me got it worse and my family and everything likthat wondering when things are going to get started. I want to chronicle from the average day perspective what it is going to take to get the lights on, answers on insurance in cases of people needed fema. I want to see the response time and what the problem is with getting gas. Because if you look at what we did in haiti and other countries to help out, I mean, I'm not saying in a little while you are going to need air drops of food because the supermarketsn't getting restocked. Gas is not coming in and no one is going to be able to help there is a lot of trucks out there that can't even get fuel to help out. 
>> Only thing like this is katrina that I can ever recall. So many people devastated. And god bless you guys for hanging in there. 
>> Steve: The other thing about what's going on here is it is cold. It is freezing unlike back then when it was a bit warmer. We're going to talk more about that in a moment. Mike, we're just three days away from the election. The administration last thing they want to talk about is what happened with that coverup in benghazi. You know, they said early there were no warning science. We have, at this network chronicled between half a dozen and a dozen of them. Here another one, looks like a smoking gun a secret cable that said they had this emergency meeting three weeks before those guys were murdered. You know what? The consulate not safe. We should pbly go ahead and hide out over at the cia outpost about a mile away. Nobody did anything. 

[00:43:15]


>> No, they didn't. There ought to be a pulitzer prize for catherine herridge and jennifer griffin at staff at fox news they have done yo men's work to get the truth out. 
>> First to say the government lied to us and now they are covering it up. It's becoming more clear every day. Clear danger in benghazi. Indication that the reason that the ambassador went there re secretly and quietly because he knew it was a treacherous place to be. Why we haven't admitted that the only thing you can imagine is that we just don't want to admit that, you know, bin laden may be dead. But al qaeda is very much alive. It's the ambassador who is dead. Do you think america is going to get answers before the election? Three days away. The president has been successful in not taking questions about it. It's not going to happen before the election. Mitt romney has not made a campaign issue. 
>> Gretchen: Why? 
>> That's a decision the campaign has made. Maybe they fear that people would assume it's a last-minute attempt to play gotcha. But I think it is the driving issue I know the economy is important. When we can't trust our government with the basic integrity to tell us the truth about why our official representative to a country was murdered, then I think we have a bigger problem than our paychecks I really do. I think this is a huge issue. If president obama were to win I think it is going to dog most of his second term. 
>> Steve: It's one thing, governor, that fox news has asked for comment from the white house and the state department again yesterday they are stonewalling. Investigation, classified not going to tell you anything. There are a number of members of congress who have written letters to the white house and the state department and hillary clinton saying come on, there are four dead guys here, tell us what happened. They have completely being frozen out. Nothing. I have spoken with seral senators, lindsey graham on my radio show. He has explained he has repeatedly asked. One thing for a reporter toask. We kind of expect that the news media is going to get stonewalled. A united statesenator has a constitutional right and authority as part of the check and balance of the government to demand answers of the other branch of government. And they are not getting it. This is something bigger than just information flow. This is a defiance of the most fundamental understanding of our ccks and balances within the constitutional frame that we operate under. 

[00:45:51]


>> Brian: I always look for number one, I'm amazed very few people on the other networks are pursuing with any vigor this is something they were born to be investigative journalists regardless where they worked, number one, number two is I'm reading the "new york times" I notice trying to get a fall guy and his name is david petraeus. Starting to talk about how people inside the agency aren't happy with him. How general dave petraeus likes to be in charge and get saluted he doesn't like to g involved in the politics oft as if he is over his head. I can see them lining up a fall guy and he happens to be an american hero. 
>> Well, I think they have tried to find a number of fall guys if you will hillary clinton came out and said it was my responsibility. Then thesident had to come out in the debate and say no itas really mine. The buck is being passed everywhere here is what you are going to see happen. People in the intelligence community and so outraged by betrayal what they are going to do is start leaking information and it's already started. They are already instances of people who are starting to let information flow because they are frustrated that their sacred honor has been put on the line by this administration. They are north going to sit back and be quiet about it. 
>> Gretchen: Some point americans are going to find out all the answers. It probably won't be before tuesday. Governor huckabee, stick around, will you? Just three days before the lxz the unemployment rate has gone up. Now 7.9%. Will that impact tuesday's vote? We'll pick the governor's brain on that. 
>> Brian: Then the word illegal is illegal? The yor of one town trying to ban the word when describing immigrants. 
>> Steve: Plus, there could be blow back on the federal response to sandy, the president of the united states has just arrived at fema headquarters on the saturday before the election. That's never good. shared sharon, who emailed it to emily, who sent it to cindy, who wondered why her soup wasn't quite the same. The recipe's not the recipe... Ohhh.

[00:50:57]


>> Steve: Welcome to a special saturday morning edition of "fox & friends." Just three days before the big election, mike huckabee is out in columbus, ohio with us. Mr. Governor, big day yesterday for mitt romney. He had 30,000 people energized at an event there in ohio. One of the reasons people are excited about him he has a plan for the economy. If you look at the unemployment number yesterday it went the wrong direction. Up that frar 8%. It's at 7.9%. 
>> Steve, I will be honest with you, I think the message if I were an employer, and i am. What I say to employees is simply this. If you really want to keep your job, you need to hope barackbama doesn't keep his if you are determined that he needs to keep his you need to be prepared to lose his. If he is reelected what you have had the last four. The numbers haven't improved. Many cases gotten worse because his policies are antiness. I know that sounds harsh but it's the hard reality. When you continue to threaten people with higher taxes, increased cost of regulation. Government intervention you scare employers from wanting to hire anybody. 
>> Gretchen: One of the words tossed about this mor is stagnation when you look at the jobless number yesterday. It did tick up unemployment 7.9%. When you look at how many jobs are created 170,000 jobs how many jobs were lost, the same number, 170,000 jobs you see it as stagnation. 
>> I do. I will tell you there is another untold story. The jobs being created are jobs that generally are paying much less than the jobs that were originally lost. So there are many people in america whoade $80,000. They lost that job. Now they are back at work so their employment is counted as employment. But they are only making $40,000. That's what's not being told. Even in these job numbers. The earning power of the average american household is down $4,300. That means they have that much less money in their household their food and cost are up. Clothing and school. Less money to pay for it that's the real economic impact. 

[00:53:08]


>> Your opinion on this, governor. I don't think the president ever thought he was dealing with the type of candidate that would develop like governor romney has developed. When you see him in front of these crowds, when you see him with individuals, he is not the same guy he was six months ago and certainly not the same e he was three and a half years ago. You know that firsthand. Am I overstating that? 
>> You are not. Mitt romney has really hit his stride right at the right time. I was with him at a campaign rally in north carolina a few weeks ago I was sort of stunned. He is there. He was electric phiing that audience there san energy out there. Let me tell you what I think is going to happen. Remember the chick-fil-a day that no one saw coming? I think if you saw that many americans line up and stand in line for hours to buy a chicken sandwich so that their voices could be heard. You will see at love people that mbe aren't getting polled who will show up and be willing to stand in l for hours on tuesday so that america can feel their vote. I think that there is something very significant on its way tuesday with a will the of people who aren't that loud. They don't make a lot of noise. But they will show up and they are going to vote to change america. 
>> Gretchen: That's interesting. You are in ohio, you just went buy buy -- there he is. His photo. Is he going to do his show out of ohio tonight. 8:00 p.M. Eastern. You can catch it right here. 
>> Steve: We had the satellite until 20 minutes after the hour. 20 minutes and one second. 
>> Brian: Governor huckabee has to put his credit card in and evidently he maxed out. 
>> Steve: Would you want five more minutes. 
>> Brian: Evidently he maxed out his amex. 
>> Gretchen: What if your home and car were flooded, what do you do next? What if you didn't have any flood insurance in important informatioery homeowner needs to know coming up next. 
>> Brian: Made historic sweep in the 2010 mid terms. Can the republicans do it again? Ask the strategist pete sessions coming up. I never government a chance to say good by to the governor. 

[00:55:12]


>> Steve:5 more seconds on the count. 
>> Brian: What do we do with it? 

[00:58:37]


>> Brian: Tanker goes up in flames. The 18-wheeler flipped over. A driver was trying to make a wide turn. Didn't do it. Amazingly he only suffered burn marks on his arms and will be okay. A man eating a slice of humble pie after heated arguments with his wife. Publicly apologizing by holding up a knee on sign saying the man hopes his wife will see how much he loves her and give him a second chance. What does the sign say?I left you in anger. 
>> Steve: Took her for granted. Meanwhile, breaking news on sandy's recovery efforts. We have just learned that the president of the united states is at fema headquarters in washington, d.C. Meeting with cabinet officials to discuss disaster relief. Which, to many, is slow. This comes as thousands are expected to file insurance claims to recover some of what they lost after their homes and cars were damaged or destroyed. But what do you need to know to make the most of this awful situation? Joining us right now from washington, d.C. Is bob russbolt, ceo of the insurance agents of america. Bob good to be with you. >> 
>> Steve: I would imagine your agents in the northeast the phones have ringing off the hook the last five days. 
>> Hundreds of thousands of dlams coming into trusted choice independent insurance agents all over the northeast. I want to say to brian we are with you in spirit it is mind boggling what the people of long island, staten island and people of jerseyhore are going through. 
>> Steve: Absolutely. Brian lost the first floor of his house. We will show pictures here in a couple of minutes. If you have got insurance file a claim contact your agent if you can find the guys or the gal's phone number. That is important. Here is some things. If people have damage, for instance, they got a tree with a -- poke ago hole in their roof. Get the tree off the roof if you can. And then put a tarp on it, right? Try to recket protect yourself? 
>> Absolutely. The first thing you should do is take pictures or video if you can find your cell phone to document it because it makes the claims process go quicker. But, yes. Repair anything that you can do that will cause more damage later on. If you have a hole in your roof, put a tarp on it so if it rains againou have more damage make sure you keep your receipts. You will be reimbursed for those expenses and you want the claims process to go as quickly as possible. 

[01:01:03]


>> Steve: Bob, note to the director, brian kilmeade mass a question for bob. Go ahead and ask him. 
>> Brian: What is the deal, bob? Can you throw out appliances that are clearly damaged or compromised? Can you throw out couches that are a mess and chairs? Furniture? 
>> Yes. But before you do anything, make sure you get your claims adjustor on the site. That claims adjustor will tell you what you can do and can't do. 
>> Brian: So you don't see your claims adjustor don't do ? 
>> You should not do it. However, use common sense, for instance, if your sofa is soaking wet, move it outside or a place where it can dry out. That's fine. Make sure you don't throw it away. Keep pictures of it as well. 
>> Brian: Unfortunately there is looting going on with that. A lot of times if you are not leaving the house gon the next day wil they be understand wble that. 
>> Insurance claim adjustors are pros at this kind of stuff if they can get to the property. That's one of the things that peep have to understand is testimony that times the police or bridges or roads are washed out the adjrs can't get on site. Generally they are very understanding of the situation. They have seen this before and they will work with you. 
>> Steve: Bob, one final point. Brian was lucky enough he did have flood insurance but a lot of people think I have got homeowner's insurance. Surely this is going to cover for that stuff that we are looking at right now. Not necessarily, right? 
>> That's right. Brian is a smart guy. And. 
>> Steve: It was his wife. 
>> Brian: Obviously. 
>> One of the problems is that a lot of homeowners do not take flood insurance. The average flood insurance policy nationwide is just around $600. But, the general homeowner's policy does not include flood damage. So, anybody that had flood damage in your house from sandy, if you don't have it, you are not covered for it so you have got to look at the small business administration, fema, government agencies for low interest loans. 
>> Steve: Just one quit exit questi bob. That is if your car is damaged by the rising floodwaters, are you automatically covered? 

[01:03:09]


>> If you have comprehensive coverage. Remember, there is collision, comprehension and liability. If you have comprehensive coverage, you are covered. 76% of all americans have comprehensive coverage. So most americans will be covered for that damage. 
>> Steve: Bob, we have got lots of questions. Thanks for joining us today. 
>> Good to to be with you, steve. 
>> Steve: The word illegal is illegal. Mayor trying to ban the word when describing illegal immigrants. The president urges revenge against mitt romney. What happened to civility? We'll be right back. Seems they haven't been moving much lately. But things are starting to turn around because of business people like you. And regions is here to help.

>> Gretchen: Welcome back everyone. The presidential election just three days away now. Can you imagine that both candidates are going from town to town to town to town in those swing states. What are they saying? Remember when president obama talked a lot about civility and how we should all be nice to each other and not really say any words that might be negative. 
>> Steve: How is that working out? 
>> Gretchen: Yesterday he used a word that was new to his stump speech. He got boos from the audience when he talked about mitt romney but then he said this. 
>> At the time the republic congress any senate candidate by the name of mitt rom? I. 
[Boos] 
>> no, no, no. Don't boo, vote. Vote. Voting is the best revenge. 
>> Steve: That's a new ad-lib line. Mitt romney responded yesterday in ohio. Listen to this. 
>> About you see what president obama said today? He asked his supporters to vote for revenge. For revenge. Instead, I ask the american people to vote for love of country. It is absolutely essential that the together we lead america to a better place than that we are four days away from a fresh start. Four days away from the first day of a new beginning. My conviction that better days are ahead is not based on promises and hollow rhetoric but on solid plans and proven results. And it's based on unshakeable faith in the american spirit. 
>> Brian: Also talking very optimistical goor romney is doing something else. Sincerely talking about there are good democrats too working across party lines. Talking about bipartisan way. And I think that's a little bit got into president obama's speech. I will work with anybody. I don't care what party you are from. 
>> Gretchen: That's interesting. 
>> Brian: Late to the party on that and four years don't reflect. 
>> Steve: When the president is reelected then I will start working. 
>> Gretchen: Mist romney has that as his track record though when he was governor 83% I believe were on the other side of the fence. He managed to work that together. Let's talk a litigation bit more about the election. When it comes this that close swing state of vnia just three days away from casting the ballots there. Not only is the presidential race a virtual tie, the senate race will come down to the wire as well. Peter doocy in fairfax, virginia wthe latest on the battle ground state. Good morning, peter. >> 

[01:09:37]


>> good morning, gretchen. And just a few minutes ago, the final day of in pn absentee voting started. And there has been a pretty steady stream of people coming in which is impressive because it's pretty early it is very cold this morning. But the voters are out and the candidates are going to be here as well before too long. President obama will in bristow later on this afternoon with former president clinton and mitt romney we expect to see in virginia at least twiceore voters go to the polls on tuesday for the official election day. And a big part of mitt romney's argument has been a big part of his final pitch to voters here in virginia has been to the military. The two biggest cities here in virginia are virginia beach and norfolk and mitt romney has been basically saying that if he is electedresident, he will put an end to the sequester. He won't let those automatic defense cuts go through at the beginning of next year. And he has been getting that message has been received very well out on the trail. Now, there is also a big-time senate race here in virginia between two big names. Former republic governor george allen and former democratic governor tim cane. The twoave raised a combined $30 million. And then outside groups have pumped in another $40 million. Allen has beenetting some help on the trail by mitt romney and a few days ago vice president biden was here telling virginia voters to pick tim cane. Now, where I am here in fairfax county, this is virginia's most populist locality. Since the year 2000 it's been the fourth fastest growing county in the united states. Then senator obama won fairfax county by 109,000 votes in 2008. It helped him carry the state. Which means that the peopl you see walking behind me and the people in that building could beasting the deciding votes in the 2012 presidential election if it comes down to virginia, which it might. Back to you. 
>> Gretchen: All right. Peter doocy live for us in virginia. Anks. 

[01:11:41]


>> Steve: Peter not only our poll watcher but our weather watcher too. Rick reichmuth peter was talking about how cold it is down there. But we worry about how cold it is around here because some people don't have electricity. 
>> You said it you kwefore this storm when we said so many people would be without power that you will will likely be without power for the long term. This is what that means. This is what that feels like when we say that that you might be without power for 5, 6, 10, 14 days in some cases. And it's cold. Take a look at what's going on right. The next five days across parts of the jersey shore are going to be cold. And, in fact, you know, it's been cold the past couple days. Temps will drop more. You will see overnight lows dropping tonight and tomorrow night into the 20's. Talking freezing ranges very cold there go up towards staten island another place obviously where briggs is this morning. Temps getting to around freezing tonight. So very uncomfortable and you see that wednesday, that's a possible storm that we're watching that is not good news either. Go farther out into long island, obviously that -- the other area without power for so many people and again temps dropping toround freezing. Move forward and let's talk about that wednesday storm. Because we are watching a potential nor'easter. Now, this isn't a sandy kind of storm at all. But it a nor'easter. Nor'easter that we get up here that is annoying and a nuisance and rainy and windy. You get that on top of what we have people who are homeless and without power and that's going to cause a problem. Meaive even a little bit of storm surge on that. I want to show you tuesday's first alert forecast. Eastern part of the country only problem for voting is showers down across parts of georgia and north florida. Maybe light shower in wisconsin and out across the west. Everything is looking absolutely perfect. Maybe a little bit of showers across parts of northern washington. All right. Guys. Send it back to you inside. 
>> Gretchen: Thank you. 
>> Brian: Thank you very much. Now let's go to your evidence lines. As people try to overcome the devastation left by sandy, areas in new york are overrun by looters. Dozen have been arrested for breaking into grocery stores, retail stores and gas stations. In queens some victims say robbers close posed as the electrical workers to get inside some people's homes which has happened in my neighborhood. Nypd putting more officers in targeted neighborhoods and some of them have created checkpoints. 

[01:13:57]


>> Steve: No kidding? Meanwhile, a massachusetts town banning the word illegal when describing immigrants. The mayor of summerville outlawed the word after a group of teenagers argued that saying illegal that was hurtful. Instead the group wants people to use the term undocumented. The mayor says he wants summerville, the city of it to be a city of hope for undocumented immigrants around the world. 
>> Gretchen: A hunter in oregon is lucky to be alive after a terrifying encounter with a black bear. He and a friend were hiking on this trail in oregon after encountering a 400-pound bear. After shooting it they shout it was dead but getting closer. The bear jumped up and bit one of them and the two um it bled down a auto foot embankment. 
>> I landed on my back and it landed on top of me actually. Able to get ahold of it and put my arms around its neck and keep it in a chold while by buddy grabbed a rifle to shoot it a second time. 
>> The friend was not injured. Recovering from his injuries in the hospital. And those are your headlines. 
>> Brian: Quicthing if your power is getting back on you don't have any idea what diswg on so you have to find your main breaker or find someone who knows where your main breaker is and shut it off because your house is going to go on fire if any salt water in any of the youth -- youth lets. If you are outlets. Your house is going to go up unless you shut off the main breaker. 
>> Steve: That is if you have had the water come up on the first floor. 
>> Brian: Or even if you think it may have. 
>> Gretchen: More of brian's pictures coming up. Strategy that led to a g.O.P. Takeover of the house back in 2010. What does congressman pete sessions have in store for the elections on tuesday? He is here with his power plan next.

Pete sessions is the fifth ranking house republic on the nrcc chairman and is the strategist behind the successful run two years ago. Well, congressman. You know nancy pelosi wants her job back. Will she get it? 
>> You know, nancy does want it. And she is not going to get it it she is going to be disappointed once again because the voters of this country are going to deny her that chance we are going to hold the house and pick up seats you want to go to new york, long island, were. 
>> Randy, as you may know, lost by just a handful of votes, a little more than 100 votes last time his opponent this time once again had a chance to understand after he had read the healthcare bill he would still be for it it randy understands it's the demise of american business if we do not overturn healthcare randy wins. 
>> Brian: At love the voting places are destroyed. Let's move to somewhere else that you are very interested in. You brought us to the sixth congressional district of massachusetts t.C. Is the republic. 

[01:20:25]


>> Richard do you say due say is the senate majority leader today. He came to washington two years ago. I helped recruit him. We talked about him winning this seat. This seat has turned into a nightmare for the democrats because of ethical problems. For their city and income. But richard has sold himself well. Richard is going to be a winner on tuesday. 
>> Brian: On tuesday, me a love. Up and rising star. She wants to work for the congress and not be a mayor. 
>> This will be a highlighted race. She wants to make sure we get back to what congress, help job creation and families make it during these tough times and turn around this economy with jobs. 
>> Brian: Congressman, you know, there is going to be a big thing on "60 minutes" this weekend talking about how republicans and democrats have not gotten along at the senate or con imrecial level. A lot of people at home not involved in politics say to themselves why can't these guys get along. Do you project more of a bipartisan, let's get something done attitude regardless of who wins or only if governor romney wins? 
>> You know, I think it's obvious to house members that once we went to it a better process than nancy pelosi had, john boehner, for one thing, made sure that we read the bills before we passed them. He made sure every single member had a chance to come to the rules committee that i serve on for a chance to have their amendment be heard. We go to a regular schedule now that I think a lot of people are happy with. We are on this breaking point simply because we are talking about taking away president obama's hethcare bill. We need to do this it cost the country $700 billion in our senior care. Republicans are on the right track to talk about weust safe this country. 2 million jobs are right in the crosshairs. Republicans are going to save those 2 million jobs. Move us forward. And that's what we want to do. 

[01:22:46]


>> Brian: All right. We will see if that means getting something done. Congressman instead of talking past each other. Congressman pete sessions thanks so much. All right. I will take that as a tnk you. No gas, no food, no power, the president promised federal help to those devastated by hurricane sandy so when will had it arrive. Buy a gun and get stacked.

[01:26:42]


>> Gretchen: Welcome back, everyone. In the wake of hurricane sandy, president obama urged the federal l government to take immediate action. 
>> Mease my message to the federal government, no bureaucracy no red tape, get resources where they are needed as fast as possible. And for the duration. 
>> Gretchen: With the death toll rising many without power and panic at the pump has the president delivered on that promise let's ask peter johnson jr. Who has some thoughts this morning. 
>> Good morning, gretchen. I will ask a man who has had a lot of sadness in staten island this morning named michael gaddy, who was interviewed this morning by dave briggs. Let him answer the question. Michael gaddy lost his home in staten island. 
>> Look at all the older people around around seeing the need. Instead of spreading themselves all over the world. There was a bold promise by the president cabinet officials to do a lot for the folks in new jersey and new york. The problem is most of the gas pumps are out according to the a.A.A. Not a matter of supply it's a matter of electricity. Now the hesitate company brought generators in to a lot of their facilities now they have powered like 160 of their facilities in the state of new jersey. At the same time, the federal government says oh, we're going to bring in 22 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel. For motorists in new jersey the problem is there I no capability to pump those because the stations are down. It seems to me that there is a priority problem bring the generators, fema, to the gas stations, so we can pump the gas so people can get to work, so they can take people to the hospital. So they can do all the things that they need to do in the state of new jersey and on long island. So I have spoken to people in breezy p. I have spoken to people in the rock aways and queens where congressman gregory meeks, who is a big democrat and big supporter of president obama says no power, no food, no gas, no nothing, people are having problems. And, in staten island, which unfortunately to a great degreeas been ignored a lot of pain and problems. For all the -- now visits by cabinet officials days later to the new york and new jersey area we are not getting the gas people need and people cannot function. >> 

[01:29:20]


>> Gretchen: Do you hold fema responsible for not being here and coming up with the same ideas that hess came up with to bring in the generators. 
>> It's in the gas lines, looting, dispirited feeling of many people in new jersey and new york who say I'm stung at my home. I can't get to my job. I have a little gas left i want to make sure I stay here in case I need to go somewhere in an emergency. People are paralyzed economically in a huge huge swath of new york and new jersey. And so today we'll see cabinet officials coming to new york coming to new jersey. Catherine sebelius we saw. Janet napoleon yesterday holding press conferences. But what's needed is not press conferences, unfortunately. It's generators. There was no water in katrina. There is no gasoline now in the northeast as a result of sandy. And in spite of the government's promises to deliver gasoline there is no power to pump it someone needs to put on thinking cap today and say get the army corps of engineers. Get the navy folks in. Get licensed electricians, bring generators, thousand or $2,000 generators to gas stations that have the gasoline in the ground in order to pump it it up. So we don't have altercations and perhaps violence and a sense of hopelessness when we should have some hope going forward into the next week as things areetting much much colder. So I don't give high grades because I ha seen what fema has done, and it's not much for a lot of folks here in new york. 
>> Gretchen: Thanks, peter. 
>> Gretchen: Only three days out the candidates are making final push. Mitt romney arriving in new hampshire where is he set to make a speech there moments away. We will take you there live. 

[01:34:22]


>> Good morning, everyone, it's sarday, it's november 3rd, 2012, I'm gretchen carlson, thanks for sharing your time today. It's the final push for votes as we're just three days from the election. These are live pictures out at new hampshire, mitt romney is ected to speak to voters at any moment and carl cameron joins us, wife ann appears to be introducing him. Carl? 
>> Reporter: Forly peace air force base and there you see it, ann romney about to complete her introduction of the republican yom knee, three days and an andful of hours before first polls close on the east coast on tuesday night a little of mitt romney, let's listen. 
>> New hampshire got me the republican nomination and new hampshire is going to get me the white house, thanks, you guys. Thank you to all the people who have come, that's you of course, but some have come long distances, now, senator kelly has come that far and i appreciate her being here and your former governor, john sununu,'s gone everywhere for me, thank you to them. And governor bob jindal from louisiana and senator john thune from south dakota. Congressman marshal blackburn from tennessee and all over new hampshire, so, follow them around and you know, hassle them. Harangue them. Look, I -- I really appreciate your being here and I know most of you probably decided who you're going to vote for already. But i, I know there's some people who are still wondering and the putting aside the demand of daily life and thinking about who they're going to vote for. So you're going to get a chance to talk to them. I need you to spend se time in the next three days to see neighbors and maybe ones with an obama sign in front of their home and go by and say, look, let's talk this through a bit, because you see, see, president obama came into offices with so many promises and fallen so far short and remind things they've forgotten. The post-partisan president, but he's been the the most partisan, dividing and demonizing. He said he was going to cut the deficit in half he's doubled it. He said he would focus on jobs, instead focused on obamacare that kills jobs, he said he'd bring health insurance down $2500 a year, the cost of it for the average family. Anybody here had their insurance go down 2500? As a matter of fact the average is up $3,000 per family. Look, the president said that he would work across the aisle he would meet regularly with leaders in the republican party. Do you know how long it's been since he's met with the republican leader he of the house or the senate on jobs, or teconomy or the deficit? Since july, he hasn't met with them. He just has not been able to deliver on the promises he's made. Talk is cheap, a recd is real and takes hard work and he's not been able to accomplish it and I have a record of accomplishment and that's why I'm running. 

[01:37:36]


(Cheers) 
>> as you know, I started a business, I actually helped turn around another business and help turn around the olympics and you may have heard that I was governor next door in massachusetts. And there are a couple of democrats in massachusetts in my legislature, we have 85% democrats. We had a multi-billion dollar budget g. But we didn't fight each other. We came together and lked for ways to solve the problems. We actually cut spending, we didn't just slow down the rate of growth. We cut spending and cut taxes an made our state more attractive for job creators and at the end of four years, instead of a huge deficit we had a big surplus, instead of losing jobs every month we were gaining jobs every month. Instead of higher taxes, higher take home pay, that kind of partisan has to be brought to washington and i will. Now, the president has more promises. But we know where his promises will lead. The same place as last time. And not the jobs, and not to reducing the deficits. Not for insurance. And actually not have made a promise to make, but I've got five things I'm going to do to make sure we get the economy going and good jobs again, rising take home pay and home values, and one, we're going to take advantage of our oil or number two, we're going to get trade that works for us that means opening upew markets for our goods so we can sell in latin america in particular and crack down on cheaters like china when they cheat on jobs unfairly a the skills they need and training that actually gets them the jobs that they want and finally fix our schools, it's not acceptable that our schools are not the best in the world. I want to make sure we finally put our kids and their parents and the teachers first and the teachers union is going to have to go behind. Number four, we're going to do something that actually has been spoke been for years, but just not done. And that is, we're going to cut federal spending and we're ing to cap it and finally get on track to a balanced budget. And number five, we're going to champion small business, we want to help small business grow and thrive. Look, the president wants to raise taxes on small business, I do not. I want to bring them down. The president has been adding more and more regulation, big companies can handle regulation and they have the lawyers and they can deal with it. Small business gets crushed by it. I want to help small business. Those five things for me to get them done is going to require me to reach across the aisle and to work with good democrats and good republicans who love the country. They're there, I'll do it. I'll accomplish these tngs to make sure america gets back on trac now, you can choose your future, you can tell your neighbors that it's up to them who they-- what they want for their future, this is not a mystery, you see, we both have records, the president and I and by virtue of looking at our records you can get a sense of where we're going, you know if the president were to be reelected, he will not be to work with congress. You're going to see four more years of gridlock. You know the debt ceiling is going to come up again and there will be threats of shutting down the government, or perhaps defaults of one kind or another. And that means that an economy that gets chilled and jobs that are harder to find. The president just can't work with congress, he's proven the and time again. I actually understand what it's like to work across the aisle. I will work on a regular basis with leaders in the house and senate, both democrat and republican and find those people of good heart and good faith willing to put the interests of the people ahead of politics. We can do it, I've done it before. We're going to work in washington to help the people. 

[01:41:56]


(Cheers) 
>> if the president were to be reelected, you're going to continue to see the war on coal and oil and gas. And gasoline prices, and energy prices will higher and higher. If I'm president we're going to take a new course, going to take advantage of the resources we have and finally have north american energy independence. 
(Cheers) 
>> if the president were to be reelected, why, you're going to continue see a government that promotes itself, promotes government and the most business and job creators and business and entrepreneurs. I like job creators, I like entrepreneurs. When I'm president, when I'm president-- 
(cheers) self- 
>> these entrepreneurs-- 
(cheers) 
>> when I'm president, when I'm president it's going to be very clear that we finally have an administration and a president and a government in the united states that actually likes job creators, that wants to help job creators. And this is very personal, and I know there are many stories that can be told right here with you, but I was in richmond, virginia two days ago and I met a woman there named rota elliott. She's been managing the family restaurants for a number of years. Bill's barbecue has been in her family for 82 years. And she closed it down. She said that all the regulations, all the taxation, the cost of obamacare and the cost of the obama economy made it such that after 82 years, they just couldn't keep on going. And this is not a matter of money for her, this was a matter of a future for her family and a future for the families of those who worked in her enterprise. I want to help -- I want to help rota, I want to help small business people across the country and I will, we'll get it done. 

[01:44:10]


(Cheers) 
>> you know, I have watched over the last few months as our campaign has gone from a start to a movement, it's not just the size of the crowds, it's the conviction and compassion in the hearts of the people. It's made me strive to be more worthy of te support that I've received across the country and the to campaign as I would govern, to speak for the aspirations of all americans, not just some americans. And I learned as governor of massachusetts, that the best achievements and accomplishments are shared achievements and I learned that respect and goodwill goes a long way and it's likely to be reciprocated. That's how I conduct myself as president, I won't represent just one party, I'll represent one nation. 
(Cheers) 
>> yesterday the president said something you may have heard by now, that I think surprised a lot of people. Speaking to an audience, he said voting is the best revenge. He told supporters, voting for revenge, vote for-- what I'll tell you, vote for love of country. It is time we lead american to a better place. Now, if there's anybody there who's worried about the last four years and wonder if they're the best we can do, who fears the american dream is fading away if better jobs and take home pay are out there, I've got a clear and unequivocal message for you and that is that america is about to some roaring back. 
(Cheers) 
>> and you saw the differences, you saw the differences between barack obama and me in those debates. I like those debates, I've got to be honest. I mean, he says it has to be this way. I say it can't stay this way. He's offering excuses. Offering a plan. I can't wait to get started. He wants to convince you to settle, but americans don't settle, we dream, we aspire, we reach for greater things and we will achieve greater things with new leadership 

[01:46:42]


(cheers) 
>> on november 6th, we're coming together for a better future. And on november 7th we're going to get started. And by the way, what I need you to do is go across your street to your neighbor that has that other sign in the front yard, and in washington I'm going to go across the aisle to the guys who have been working for the other candidate, we're going to come together. This is a critical time for the nation. We face a such huge challenges, so many people out of work, take home pay declining, home values young around the bottom. China, potential threats from a nuclear iran on the path to become nuclear, that is, we face extraordinaryhallenges and it's time for us to come together as a people. We've journeyed far and wide in this great campaign, we've had some long days and some very short nights, but we are almost there and the door, the door to opportunity, it is open and we're going to walk through it. Come walk with me, walk together to a better place. We have got to takeack this country, we have got to restore the greatness that is america, we come from a nation of great people. I -- I love the american people, I believe in america. I believe in you. I see a gentleman here, u.S. Naval retired, I see armed forces, u.S. Army retired, i appreciate those who have sacrificed for our greatness, for our future, for our freedom. This is a nation that lives for things bigger than ourselves, we have full hearts in this nation. 
(Cheers). I've been- ann and I had the fun some years ago of watching a show on tv with a fictional football team and before they'd go out on the field and face typically high, you know, higher ranked team than themselves, long odds, if you will, they had a sign on the door of their locker room and it said, clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose. And as I look here, I know, we have full hearts, and the people o hampshire, af been arod a while. You looked at politicians and you've got clear eyes, you know how to judge what's what. I' counting on your clear eyes and full hearts to make sure we can't lose on tuesday. Thank you, you guys are the best! Thank you. Great to be with you, thank you! Thank you

>> mitt romney, there you see him live on the tarmac in new hampshire, making the final argument along with his wife and you know, the podium said real change day one and then you heard from the crowd, three more days, three more days. 
>> So mitt romney making that campaign stop in newampshire and going on to other states with three days left. Let's bring in carl cameron. 
>> Reporter: Well, this is a big portion of what has become now, mitt romney's closing argument speech. He debuted it essentially yesterday in onsin. The rhetoric being, stagnation and status quo if president obama is reelected, bold change and prosperity if mitt romney is elected. And one of the new criticisms that mr. Romney says, you heard is the reference to the president's rhetoric on the trail yesterday. Mr. Obama was talking about g.O.P. Policies on the trail and the crowd began to boo. And he said, don't boo, vote, voting is the best revenge. And romney, as you heard there a moment ago picked up on it saying, the president has now reduced his campaign to small things and attacks, whereas what romney argues notwithstanding his own attacks of president obama, is that he's offering hope and change. Borrowed rhetoric from the 2008 obama campaign itself perhaps, but none of less, in that completion of his rhetoric about obama and revenge, he says, what he hopes people do is vote for their love of country. All ab positive close, notwithstanding again, the criticisms implicit and explicit throughout the stump speech in what is now 82 hours before the first polls close on the east coast tuesday night. We'll send it back to you in new york. 
>> Brian: Carl, I know you've got a sense of people on the ground that mccain wouldn't have a shot in ohio, wouldn't have pennsylvania, and a place like new hampshire, is there a sense among the romney camp of optimism that they have a shot at pennsylvania, a place like new hampshire and more than a shot in ohio.

>> Reporter: There's no question that they're optimistic, but they are clear-eyed about it, they know, based upon their own internal polling I got a little peek at yesterday, as well as the public polls, and their reports from the ground, that ohio is going to be exceedingly tough. As romney said, the window is open, come follow me, the opportunity is there, but they know it's not certain. They know it's not certain in ohio and know it's not certain here in new hampshire, and talking to some officials here, running his campaign on the ballot themselves, and for both congress, government, et cetera, they recognize this this state where the independent vote is higher than the registered democrats or independents, the granite state is a bellwether and here it could go either way and they know that. Every single moment accounts. There are thinking that romney could win the populote and edged out in the electoral. And on wednesday, thursday, perhaps looki at absentee ballots coming in after the election itself, have the campaigns very worried. They're organizing their legal representation and airlift to any particular state where there could be a controversy or a problem. We've known for over a year and a half on e trial, watching the candidates, ctor in the republica primaries and now, that this race has essentially been in the margin of error all along, the debates didn't get either candidate outside of 5 to 7% margin, the conventions didn't do that. And it doesn't appear as though the super storm sandy has moved the polls dramatically. While it's clear that mr. Obama has an edge within the margin of error, statistically insignificant edge within the margin of error is all it is, and now comes the issue of ground game. The obama campaign has put more money into it for many more months than the romney campaign simply because romney had to win the republican nomination first. In the last month or so, millions of phone calls have gone out across the country, millions of doors have been knocked on, literally, millions of doors have been knocked on by both campaigns and there's a recent study by the pew research center the number of contacts nationwide is about even. The obama campaign has reached about 11% of likely vote,the romney pain about 10 and battle ground equally close and slightly reversed and the romney camp met about 14% of the electorate and president obama's campaign 13%, they're even in the money, even in the polls, even nationally, even in the battle ground states and potentially even, even in the ground game, with just about 82 hours left. 

[01:54:26]


>> Brian: The real clear average under 2% difference within the margin of error, where are you off to next, carl. 
>> Reporter: We go to ohio-- excuse me, iowa now and then two events in colorado tonight, and then we'll fly back to iowa late, late, late tonight to get up tomorrow and start with events there. And then tomorrow it's virginia and florida, and we've got more events on monday that will have us going from florida back up to new hampshire and manchester a huge crowd and another kid rock concert and 30,000 in ohio. 
>> There's a reason they call him campaign carl. And we're fed exing a case of energy up to you. 
>> Not to have a product endorsement, but ma it red bull. 
>> You're still drinking red bull? 
>> There's still plenty of bull on the campaigns. Breakfast of champions when you're on the campaign trail. 
>> Gretchen: A good job, whatever state you happen to be in during "fox & friends." 
>> Look at that, I think that mitt romney is going to shake every hand in new hampshire if he could, unless he has. 
>> Just like steven hayes when he comes to the new york bureau from washington, steven is next on the show with instant analysis, without the handshaking because you're still in washington. The speech and the spirit of the speech, is it very typical or like you expected mitt romney to close, to close the show? 
>> Yeah, I think this is mitt romney's attempt to be big, to be positive, to close positive. And it's a littwistful and see him talking about the people he's met over the long campaign and some of the experiences he's had, referring to, you know, business people that he's met, just as recently in the past couple of days and then people he's met over the campaign trail, months and months ago, so, I think it's a combination of sort of looking back and reliving the memories and also, trying to be optimistic and upbeat, going into tuesday. 

[01:56:29]


>> Sure, and one of the things you could tell, clearly, mr. Romney, steven was talking to the independents or persuadable people because he was talking about, they really haven't gotten done much in washington under this president in the last couple of years and if you send me to washington, can with the keys to the big 747 as president, i will reach across the aisle, just as I did in massachusetts. 
>> And in the event that any of those four undecided voters in america still were watching this, at this point, he might have persuaded them. No, exactly what he's trying to do. I'm not running to be the head oarty I'm running to be the head of a country and you can count on me to reach across the aisle to do the kinds of tough work that president obama hasn't done over the past four years and exactly the kind of language that would appeal potentially to those voters who haven't yet made up their mind at this late stage in the race. 
>> Steve, to go off of what you were just talking about, and what we heard from carl, the massive travel plan over the next 82 hours, if so many people are left undecided or see few are left undecided right now, is this all about th ground game or is it about all of these trips that the candidates are taking? 
>> Well, it's a little bit about both. I mean, mostly at this point, you know, it's the old cliche and then last week of a presidential campaign or any campaign, all that counts is turnout, all that counts is the ground game and that's really true. I think these are, these are designs to get the last little bit of local news coverage that they might get, something on the ten o'clock hour, and you know, in local news, something in the newspaper, splashed on the front page, th day showing mitt romney or barack obama, you know at a rally right in people's back yards and i think that's what these are designed to do get people to go out and make one last push to get the enthusiasm up for people who are goi to be driving folks to polls and people making last minute phone calls and that's what this is all about at this point. 
>> And steven, I've got to ask you, too, about the two events that happened, and benghazi investigation and the storm where the president gets a chance to roll up his sleeves and cut the redape I'm in charge again. How do both of t play out with three days ago? 

[01:58:35]


>> Well, look, I think the storm actually helped the president, I think this was a guy who, since the debate on october 3rd, had been losing ground in two areas where i think he really needed to hold his ground. One was likability and one was the ability to look presidential and what I think sandy did was give him an opportunity to recover a little bit in both of those areas, he could present himself as more likeable, puttingis arm around people in shelter, trying to reassure that all was not lost and him being president the videos images of him in front of the command center, in front of the amecan red cross sign, is something that the president-hadn't been able to do, he was peevish, nasty, stuff in the debates and i think it' possible now voters going into the polls with them on tuesday the memory of the president and the storm, helping on the storm, rather than thinking about him and the way that he conducted himself during those debates. 
>> Gretchen: Except that's all about optics, and that's what everything has come down to in elections, if you dig deeper you might see stories like in brian's neighborhood and people still suffering and no good and no food and flooding and people dying. So, does it have possibility over the next two days of being a negative for the president? 
>> It sure could. I mean, the question is, how prevalent are those stories and how quickly do people shift, blaming the storm to blaming the lack of respo and in part blaming the president. If that happens quickly the storm coulde almost a boomerang effect. 
>> You've got to wonder why on this saturday morning the president of the united states, steven, I'm sure you heard down in the bureau, the president of the united states went over to fema, you know, here in new york city, it was an embarrassment to the mayor of new york, he said let's run the marathon, let's run it, 11th hour I'm going to pull the plug because it's the wrong thing to do. 
>> Right, right exactly. I think the president is trying, in a sense to have a both ways, trying to be on the campaign trail and make the final campaign arguments, but he also wants to be seen as president, and wants to do the kinds of things that a president would do in the aftermath of a terrible storm. 

[02:00:47]


>> What about the libya situation? I see you've written for next week's column on it and break it down to part one, part two, part three and basically, the thesis being the president needs to provide answers? 
>> Right, yeah, I mean, this, when our readers get our magazine, as we ship it out this week, it will probably be the case that most of them will get it after the presidential election's been decided and ooint simply bass, whether barack obama is reelected or mitt romney is the new president. Benghazi is important because of what happened m benghazi not necessarily because what its impact could be on the presidential election and you have the three-part scandal. You have the fact that security wasn't provided when it was asked beforehand. You have the fact that the assistance wasn't given during the actual attack and then after the fact, you have the fact that the president's stories, the administration's stories changed dramatically over the course of really two months, and they were contradictory the whole time. 
>> I think eventually we are going to find out what happened and it will be interesting at the end of the whole process to see how high up the food chain it went. 
>> It will. 
>> Brian: And steven, I speak for gretchen and steve when i say we enjoyed our time together. 
>> I enjoyed being with you. 
>> Steven hayes, weekly standard. 
>> Thank you. 
>> We just showed you mitt romney's rally in new hampshire, and ed henry is stopping by with what the president is going to do today. "Fox & friends" for saturday. Back in two minutes. Seems they haven't been moving much lately. But things are starting to turn around because of business peike you. And regions is here to help. With the experience and service to keep things rolling. From business loans to cash management, we want to be your partner moving forward. So switch to regions. And let's get going. Together. 

[02:06:09]


>> I'veearned as gernor of massachusetts that the accomplishments are shared achievements and reflect a goodwill goes a long way and is likely to be reciprocated. That's how I'll conduct myself as president, I won't just represent one party, I'll represent just one nation. Yesterday the president said something you may he heard by now, that might have surprise add lot of people. Speak to go an audience, voting is the best revenge. He told the supporters, vote for revenge, vote for revenge? Let me tell you what I'd like to tell you, vote for love of country. 
(Cheers) 
>> and that was mitt romney just moments ago making a final speech to voters in new hampshire. What is president obama doing with three days ago, for that we go to ed henry. It looks like president obama is bringing out the stars for the final push and maybe to boost the crowd size? What can you tell us? 
>> Reporter: That's right, in ohio this morning, this is in the clevelandrea and if you go back to 2008, on the final weekend the president had a rally in cleveland that had 80,000 people back when he was the ew senator and had a lot of energy and enthusiasm behind him. We are in a gymnasium here, a lot less than people than 80,000. Last time it was outside of cleveland browns game. What the campaign is saying, this weekend and other events will bring out a lot of celebrities and believe they will have really big crowds. They are he going to be katy perry, dave mathews, stevie wonder, bruce springsteen and jay-z on pit bull. Performers throughout the country and events at battle ground states trying to boost the crowds. In 2008 the president did an event in the final weekend, in a state he was not winning, but he was trying to expand the map and trying to win republicans over to his column and this side, more on defense, stas he won last time that he wants to keep in his column, wisconsin tlie visit this final weekend. In ohio six visits and the reason they say they're doing that and playing that defense, they think if the president can win wisconsin and ohio, et cetera, it's going to be sort of a midwestern firewall that will be hard fort romney to get to 270 electoral votes to win. 

[02:08:39]


>> Ed henry it sounded like the band had come to conclusion and probably thought you'd be able to do the rest of your sound biting in peace, but no, they're back with another number. 
>> The peace of a lawn mower. 
>> A little bit of revenge. 
>> Good one. 
>> Gretchen: Is it true the president is changing his message? Because we heard the revenge word yesterday. 
>> Reporter: Yeah, we'll play that in full context to understand what he's saying. He's changing his message a little bit and said he'd be more hopeful in the final days and also hitting mitt romney and republicans on capitol hill saying yesterday at a series of rallies, look, I'm not going to surrender to republican policy in terms of cutting taxes and cutting spending and then he had this to say about mitt romney. Take a listen. 
>> The time the republican congress, any senate candidate by the name of mitt romney-- no, no, no, don't boo, vote. Vote. Voting is the best revenge. . 
>> Reporter: So you hear is right there. Was talking back in the days mitt romney was running for senate in massachusetts and president obama says he wants to go back to the clinton days, and after that talked to david axelrod, how is the president feeling. He says never felt hime enthusiastic and feels the stump speech coming from his loins, and the never heard an advisor to use the term loins. 
>> Where are the loins. 
>> Gretchen: Don't ask. 
>> Steve: And carl cameron has red bull for the campaign season, what's fueled you? Be honest. 
>> Reporter: Red bull, boy, coffee. It's been naps on the bus and on the planes. And you know, I was never able before this campaign to sleep wherever I wanted, I had to be in my own bed. Now I can sleep on a bus, a train, anywhere. 

[02:10:51]


>> Grass, sounds like you do a morning show, the same thing, congratulations. 
>> Reporter: We want to see photo proof, ed. 
>> Gretchen: We'll talk to you soon, probably tomorrow. Now the rest of your headlines today. All, but two casinos in atlantic city back in busess now after being shut downor five days because of the hurricane. Governor chris christie ordering all roads there to reopen. Last year the casinos were closed when hurricane irene hit the coast. And that three-day shut down, cost 45 million dollars in lost revenue. Got the police to detain a suspicious man at sikh temple. They found am nation, zip ties, a notebook referencing the colorado movie theater shooting. And he says he was writing a book. The cops determined he was not a threat and released him. Voters could change the constitution to allow them to use a limited amount of marijuana. Some say it will send the wrong message to kids aut drugs. Oregon and washington had similar measures on their ballot. Forget thanksgiving, the white house has eyes on christmas. The annual capitol christmas tree is on the way. This year's tree, 73 foot spruce from white refer national for rest in meeker, colorado and people came from all over the area to watch the tree come down and santa took part in the ceremony and will make many stops from the nearly 4,000 mile journey before ending up in the capital. So many trees down in the east coast, they could have probably used one of those to put up, many, many trees at the white house. 
>> We are going to have to use solar panels to light it. 
>> No doubt. 
>> Steve: After the break, the impact of the new economic numbers on the election and we got them yesterday. Will high unemployment impact the president? Neil cavuto joins us and we hope you do, too. 

[02:12:58]

>> some politicians here in the northeast have been touting the great job they're doing responding to super storm sandy, like this. 
>> Phenomenal job, a great job you do. 
>> The good news the help has been coming. 
>> When you have a good plan. 
>> Well executed. 
>> Let me thank you and your entire team. 
>> A lot of criticism of fema back in the katrina days and now you hear nothing, but go things about fema. 
>> And I want to thank craig, he lives and breathes this stuff. 
[Applause] 
>> the reality, there's still many people without power and long lines at gas stations, flooding, no food. What effect will this have on tuesday's election. The host of your world on fox news channel, neil cavuto. It's interesting, neil, to see all of those different sound bites butt back-to-back to back-to-back because when you're somebody like brian who's actually living this hell right now, you're waiting for the help still. 
>> Yeah, I mean, it's a little presumptuous to start patting each other on the back when a lot of your constituents want to kick new the you know what, because they're still without power and terribly inconvenienced and a lot of locations, there are still a lot of missing folks and houses underwater that have-- and that doesn't include that have been uprooted and moved. Mayor bloomberg himself they'll likely find more bodies. It's interesting in the middle of all of this, they're commending themselves and what a great job they're doing. I think you wait until all of this is over before keeping part staking bows because a lot of those folks affected are scrambling here. 
>> Yeah, and in fact, neil, for instance, I was talking to 
-- you know we saw on craigslist selling gas for $15 a gallon and there are lines and next thing now that station is out of gas. Talking to a mayor in franklin lakes, new jersey not far from where you live and he told me that while people can't get gasoline, neither can the towns. Which means, they don't have the gas to run their police cars, which means they're not going to be patrolling, looking for looters and they don't have the gas for fire trucks, right now they have a two day supply. They're waiting for chris christie, waiting for fema, waiting for somebody to bring the gas. 

[02:18:28]


>> And I think all of these examples you guys are bringing up, I mean, state the obvious here, that there's a lot that has to be done. And so when your constituents and average folks, whether you're in new jersey or new york lately these images we're getting out of staten island and they're hearing what a great job you're doing and help it on the way and the president with chris christie, saying I have a 15 minute rule, 15 minutes we get back to you. Well, that's kind of implies that within 15 minutes you're going to help me. It doesn't mean we'll get back to you. So, I think that frustration is building and I think this is sort of like the sleeper issue this have election, guys. I don't want to compare it to katrina, but I will say the media's treatment of it is very, very different than katrina. 
>> I think it's important to note that most the places have been slammed are firmly in the president's column. 
>> There is that. 
>> Got new jersey, got new york. 
>> It doesn't matter whether you're in the president's column or not. If you can't get gas or you're waiting for eight hours to fill up your tank or you're finding it dealing with your kids off from school, I don't know about your kids, but mine after a few days, you want to walk into that school yourself, with or without power. And I think that that's a level of thafrustration that's not popping up in the economic numbers, the sort of frustration when you see these images, guys, becomes one of these crossover events that will effect, certainly, the mood of the electorate on tuesday. 
>> Absolutely, a lot of these people who have life, white collar life are looking at situations where they're pushing their cars because they're running out of gas lines that are two miles long and scrambling to find out where they're staying the next night or this night. There's no consistency, one thing the politicians are doing, letting their faces shown. I saw senator grill brand on on-- jill brandt. 

[02:20:33]


>> And napolitano. 
>> Who cares, who cares,ou can show your face and I'm in charge and doing this. Unless there is either money or resources or coming out or magically going to get power back online I know easier said than done, your appearing there and make ago great speech and saying you're in my corner isn't going to do squat. 
>> They're now labeled with this, if it's success, like rudyuiliani brought us through a tough time no matter what he does, labeled tt way and now their face will be associated with how it turns out. 
>> I tell you this, brian. You know, george w. Bush got a lot of criticism katrina, doing a heck after job brownie, the idea it appeared everything was going along smoothly. We learned days after the fact that there were bodies being discovered and great discord, and bad communication, help wasn't getting readily available and power outages were much more than we were told. And this idea where they're slapping each other on the back and commending themselves for a great job it's going to come back and bite their hineys. 
>> I think you're right about being a sleeper issue and why the president has been at fema this morning when he's got a busy day. Quickly yesterday on our program we took a look at monthly unemployment number and it actually notchedp one tick to almost 8% it's at 7.9%, is it too late for this to impact the election? 
>> I think it was kind of stating the obvious, if the number been a lot worse than people were thinking or better than people were thinking maybe it would have moved the meter a little bit. I don't know if this one does, I think essentially what we're looking at is, you know, flat employment throughout this tenure of the president, and he could talk about the five million jobs created and he cost, true since the boom he calls it that started you know, around late 2010. The bottom line is that 5 millions jobs gain he often refers to, dsn't keep pace with population gains and if you want to be technical about tthe beginning of his administration, we're down net 2 1/2 million jobs, the question is, things are getting better no doubt about that, but are you confident or happy with this who are do you want to see more? Better doesn't mean good, guys. Better means we're off the mat, but it doesn't mean that we're off to the races and that's what's going to be, i think, the issue on tuesday. 

[02:23:00]


>> Gretchen: It's an interesting psychology is this the new normal with unemployment, same with gas prices are people just going to say we're satisfied? 
>> Well, like gretchen, we should take a look the gains we're looking at now are half what they should be at this stage of recovery and the gains we've seen in jobs don't keep pace with the overall, as I said population growth. It's in the eyes of the beholder, have we gotten used to crappy numbers, and that's the new normal or step back and say, gosh, we could do better. 
>> Neil, I hope crappy is never the new normal and i have a bumper sticker. 
>> You know, I built a career on-- 
>> maybe you're the exception. 
>> The guest st, jack welch, charlie rangel, is this true.

>> They are powerless, literally, and losing patience fast. Nearly 2.5 million people mostly inew jery and new york in the freezing cold this morning in the wake of sandy. 
>> Gretchen: Dave briggs live for us on the ground in staten island where the death toll has risen to 22, dave. 
>> Reporter: Hard to believe, gretchen 22 people in staten island lost their lives and thousands left homeless and many hundreds have lost their businesses as well. Many businesses like toto's restaurant and bar find me a few hundred years from the beach, now sits in a massive hole in the earth. The owner of that bar, john toto joins us thisning and falls into both of those katz, unfortunately. He lost his home in the storm and his business as you can see is in shambles, john, thanks for being with us this morning. So sorry for your loss. What are your emotions as you return home and take a look at all the damage. 
>> You know, the reality finallyetting in. Initially, the morning after the storm of course, you know, you evacuated and went to another location at my sister's home. And you're always hoping, you know, you think, you try to prepare for the worst, but until you actually arrive and see the destruction and the damage, you could never imagine what we saw. It was totally overwhelming. You know, you can explain to people and tell people over the phone and unless you actually see what is here, you could never ever ever in your wildest imagination see the destruction. This is our katrina. You know? Unfortune those poor people went through this x number of years ago and ten years ago and now it's our turn and you don't know where to begin, where to start and fortunately, I've got good friends and good family. Everybody's been coming down and trying to help me out and do whatever we can to move ahead and it's, it's confusing, it's mind-boggling, it's uncertainty, it's-- it's my life. The restaurant was my-- was my 30 years of adult life. My home, I lost everything. 

[02:29:56]


>> And can I ask you, you've been frustrated with what the insurance will and will not overage. You said you had hurricane coverage, but will not take care of the damage. 
>> In 30 years of business I've never had one drop of water, many, many storms, irene pelted us wh 13 inches of water, never had a problem with water. Okay? This wasn't a flood, a flood issue per se, a tsunami issue, how do you prepare for something like this. 
>> I don't know, thankfully w need to get you going because fema is at your house right now and we know you need to run, tell them. 
>> I just want to say one thing. As bad as my situation is and a lot of people in a similar situation, my heart goes out for the people who lost their lives and loved ones associated with them. 
>> We're sorry for your loss, john, we're sorry, we've got to run, thank you, john, thank you so much. We're sorry, back to you, you can see the loss on staten island. 
>> Steve: Great report, illuminating what's going on in staten island, david, thank you. 
>> Brian: All right, we're back in two. And I honestly didn't think I would ever quit.

>>> Today on fox sports, it's world of college football, national championship cntenders take a step forward while the rest will fall into obscurity. The defending champion and number one alabama crimson tide enters death valley in a rematch of last year's title game against the number five lsu tigers. While in manhattan, kansas, the number two wildcats host the oklahoma state cowboys for outright control of the big 12. And today on the fox college saturday prime time game of the week, number four oregon takes their quick fire high powered offense against the number 17 usc trojans. Don't blink. There's going to be a whole lot of scoring, but first up on the fox college saturday double-header, big 12 newcomers tcu take on number 21 west virginia. Questions will be answered today in the biggest weekend of the college football season, and it all starts right now on fox sports! 
>>> Well there's a look at geno smith. He wants to get his team back on track today. West virginia's quarterback lit up college football in his first five games of theseason, mountaineers are hoping geno regains his heisman form as they welcome fellow big 12 newcomers tcu. Welcome to the ford fox college saturday pregame prout to you by the ford fusion of 2013, go further. Today a huge double-header, tcu at west virginia, and then tonight in prime time, deanthony thomas and the number four oregon ducks come to the coliseum to take on number 17 usc trojans led by matt barkley. It's a pac-12 showdown. Hello, I'm erin andrews alongside eddie george and joey harrington. Before we talk about football we send our thoughts and prayers to everyone on the east coast that's dealing with hurricane sandy and all the cleanup there and everybody trying to get back to their normal life, hopefully we can provide you some entertainment with college football. Right now let's dive into our first game here on fox, tcu and west virginia and of course we just said it, west virginia trying to get back after those great first five games and how about this, their first five games they averaged 52 points and the last two games they scored three offensive touchdowns combined. Ugh! 

[00:02:58]


>> I think people didn't realize that west virginia was not playing the class of defenses in the big 12. When they did it against baylor and texas, we thought texas was the same defense we saw last year. They weren't. Turns out they're at the bottom of the big 12 in total defense now and the teams they really needed to do it against texas tech and kansas state made them look inept. We anointed west virginia's offense before they'd even really been challenged and they'll see another challenge in tcu who is number three in total defense in the big 12. 
>> What happened with them, joey, they came up a bowl game, destroyed clemson by 70 points and came into this year, scoring a bunch of touchdowns, 70 points every weekend and having big plays all over the field. They got accustomed to that. They ran into texas tech and kansas state who put together a great defensive game plan it disrupted their entire flow and destroyed their confidence. What they did during the bye week, look at how we got there. We have to be more patient offensively, sustain drives and try to take pressure off of geno smith. I expect to see tonight or today the ball get out quicker to day tavon austin. They'll come out three-step drops, scre passes, quick hitting throws, get the ball into the hands of the playmakers so they can do damage. 
>> What maylp west virginia tcu playing their third road game in three weeks. Garry patterson saying we're injured and tired. That could help out the mountaineers quite a bit. We check in with our crew in morgan town, craig bolerjack and joel klatt. 
>> Thank you, erin, a big welcome to morgantown, cool, cdy and a little windy as well, tcu taking on west virginia. Both struggled the last couple of weeks???? of the month but good news today for tcu. 
>> Joel: Great numbers, their quarterback boykin will start this weekend. He hurt his knee late in the ball game last week. He's ready to go. Garry patterson says he needs tavon to manage the game down the field. For west virginia you heard eddie talk about it, get the ball to the playmakers, tavon austin, leading receiver in the club. 

[00:05:28]


>> Craig: Moments ago we troes papadakis talked with dana holgorsen. 
>> Petros: Coach, how zung you're coming off the bye week and how do you think you'll play? 
>> We focused on the fundamentals last week and had to get back to the grind of preparing tcu team. Two similar teams, we have to worry what we have to do to get better to win the game. 
>> Petros: What challenges do the horned frogs present to your football team here at home? 
>> They're used to winning, coming off a couple of tough losses and same situation that we're in. We're used to winning and comg off a couple of tough losses, reality of the big 12 and like I said, they're a disciplined football team, good on all three sides of ball, we have to play well in order to win. 
>> Petros: We'll see if the mountaineers can get back right in morgantown. Already, boler. 
>> Craig: Thank you, petros. That may depend on geno smith, he's in the house. Tcu and west virginia, erin, coming up on fox sports. 
>> Thanks, guys, we look forward to it. The only other big 12 game the sooners trying to rebound after the big loss to notre dame. Oklahoma and iowa state, joey. 
>> Th's right, andruw jones finds sterlinghepherd for a touchdown, oklahoma up early 7-0. Andrew jones was picked off by gibbons who takes it back 47 yards. This kind of became a little bit of a trend in the first half. Iowa state would turn that into a field local and jones throws another interception, second of the game, that le to another field goal. Iowa state unable to capitalize on the turnovers and turn them in big touchdowns and if you don't do that against oklahoma they'll bite you. Andrew jones finding steels with t touchdown. 
>> People are wondering how oklahoma would respond in that game. It's gh to play iowa state early in the afternoon. While the game is under way the current big 12 standings. Kansas state and oklahoma state control their own destinies. They'll play each other tonight and if the winner can run the table for the rest of their schedule, they'll end the year as the season's big 12 champions. We've seen kansas state a lot on our air and now colin klein the front-runner in the heisman trophy race. What's interesting about him he doesn't get a lot of the hype you saw with rg3 or matt barkley. Why? He's doing everything right. 

[00:08:06]


>> He is but when you look at him there's nothing exciting about him. You don't see him running for touchdowns like braxton miller or throwing the ball all over the field like matt barkley or geno smith. 'S 'methodical. Teams are daring him to beat him with his arm. He doesn't have the prettiest release but he's getting there and making plays. He's a fantastic quarterback but today, I think they're going to run into a problem with oklahoma state, a team playing better defense now and it's going to be a challenge for them this afternoon. 
>> Oklahoma state hasn't gotten a lot of attention because they lost two games in september but this is still the same team that was a top 20 team in the preseason. They threw 400 yards against arizona, joseph randall still the best running back in the big 12 leading by a huge margin in yards per game. This is an oklahoma state team that's really starting to peak at the right time and on pace to have their third straighten-win season but they're running into kansas state tonight, I don't think it will happen. 
>> This is also an oklahoma state program that you just have to applaud, with everything they lost last year, their starting quarterback, starting wide receiver in justin blackmon, it's amazing where they are right now. Looking toward our first game on fox, there's west virginia's mascot, always fun to be around, the mountaineer getting things revved up in morgantown. Let's open up the saturday game plan and see what else is next on fox college saturday. It's a rematch of the national championship, undefeated number one alabama heads to death valley to battle number five lsu, two sev powerhouse programs throwdown that will rock the bcs standings. We'll look ahead to the prime time game of the week where oregon wants to make a statement today at usc. Joey harrington checks in with the ducks to see what makes the oregon's quick fire offense, and the best receiver in the country, marquise lee. "Vince Mahe grew up on two continents... and noticed that wherever you go, ople have their hands full, but their feet free." "The result? A liftgate you operate th your foot." "Code name?" "Open sesame" "The all new twenty thirteen Ford Escape. It's what happens when you Go Further."

[ whistles ] HELLO!

[ Male Announcer ] AT&T. THE NATION'S LARGEST 4g network. Covering 3,000 more 4g cities and towns than verizon. Rethink possible. 
> The ford fox college saturday pregame is sponsored by ford, and to further with north knight and by reese's peanut butter cups, the perfect combination of chocolate and peanut butter. Welcome back. Let's look at the bcs standings now. Lsu makes their first appearance in the top five. The ducks stayed at number four while the fighting irish jumped oregon after a statement win in norman. K state moved to the number two spot after florida's loss last saturday to georgia, and the crimson tide remain again at number one. Speaking of alabama, tonight the tide and the tigers meet for the third time in 12 months. Number one alabama controls their road to the sec and national championship, but an upset for the tiger also rock the bcs standings. Plenty will be decided in death valley tonight but with alabama versus lsu, the stakes are always high. 
>> If you wanted this rematch, you got it. 
>> Which side are you on? 
>> The game between number one and number two. 
>> Kick is clocked, taken by lsu. 
>> Throws, high and wide but it is caught. He throws, intercepted! Marquis is going to throw it. Lsu wins! 44 days to discuss this matchup. The talking ends right here. 
>> The defense was spectacular. 
>> Alabama domination. 10, 5, touchdown! 

[00:13:43]


>> And the alabama crimson tide has won its 14th national championship! 
>> These fans have been gassing up and it's finally here. 
>> They're a ball-hawking big turnover type o defense. 
>> TALK ABOUT A.J. McCARON. 
>> I like what he's doing, keeping down field. 
>> He's thrown 18 touchdowns and no interceptions. 
>> A.J. Plays very, very well for us, makes a lot of good choices. 
>> They're a really, really good team. 
>> Gives us an opportunity to take the lead in the west. 
>> We've got the longest winning streak in the country. 
>> This will be the biggest test for alabama this season. 
>> Alabama may be sitting atop the bcs but lsu has won seven out of the last ten in the series. The tigers can pull off the upset tonight t will be their 23rd straight win at home and tiger stadium is not easy to play in. It's a must see in college football, you got to go there on a saturday night. This matchup tonight starts with both quarterbacks, andage McCARRON HAS BUILT OFF OF THAT Performance we saw in last ar's national championship game. Lsu quarterback play, it's a different guy with zek mentenberger but the quarterback is the key. 
>> The quarterback will be key in determining this ball game. Zach has been inconsistent while A.J. McCARRON PICKED UP WHERE HE Left off last year. A.J. McCARRON IS THE BEST Quarterback in the sec, 18 touchdowns, no interceptions and gone from a game manage we are a great defense to the type of quarterback who can win you a football game. I LOVE WHAT A.J. McCARRON HAS Done. 
>> He's incorporated the vertical passing attack and the reason is the offensive line, the key matchup here tonight is watching their tackle through thf alabama offensive line tackle against the defensive line of lsu with ningo and montgomery who are very active. I would keep an eye on that. If they can get to them it can be a problem for alabama, already given up 16 sacks on A.J. McCARRON SO THEY'VE Problems protecting him up front. In a loud environment it will be interesting to see. 

[00:15:51]


>> This lsu team may need the tiger fans more than they ever have before. 
>> Yes. 
>> Get loud, get chaotic, ache A.J. McCARRON NOT ABLE TO HEAR. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Throw his first interception. 
>> Let's check in on scores and highlights in the sec. How are the gators bouncing back after a bad play in jacksonville last week? 
>> They're bouncing back slowly. James franklin picked off by jaylen watkins. 47-yard field goal will be blocked, not necessarily looking for, having the start they were looking for. Later fumbles, and gaines recovers for the tigers, slow start for florida here after a big loss last week. Later on lawrence with a one-yard touchdown run for missouri putting them on top 7-0 but the gators wake up, heinz in the second half 36-yard touchdown run, hitting around the corner, hitting the edge. 
>> Aaron is happy. He's smiling. 
>> Maybe that pep talk from chad johnson is paying off. 
>> It is. 
>> Text a&m and mississippi state. 
>> Celebrating the 2000 independence snow bowl, ben molina for the one-yard touchdown run, a&m up 7-0, ensuing possession, christian michael, 22 yards, up the gut, a&m up 14-0, and all a&m. I'm going to keep it for myself, ow off my ls, goes in, 37 yards out, a&m up 21-0 in the snowball. It's all a&m. Christian michaels goes in one yard out, score 31-7, a&m. 
>> Love the way the aggies bounced back in the second half of the season building up. 
>>> Coming up next on "fox college saturday" when we return, joey goes back to his alma mater to find out what makes the current oregon offense so lethal and a strong offense means a strong mascot because the duck has to do one-handed pushups. We'll check in on all of this coming up. used Miles for a golf getaway. Double miles you can actually use... But mr.

>>> hi, my name is kelsey. 
>> I'm michelle. 
>> Petros: I'm savannah. 
>> I'm stephanie. And this is my favorite jersey. It's so light and durable. 
>> I really like the black color. 

[00:21:46]


>> This is my favorite jersey because it's a kelly green. 
>> And the silver wing gives a little pizazz there. ???????????? 
>> I don't care how old you are, the oregon ducks make you giggle like a 5-year-old. 
>> You got to love the duck. 
>> Everybody loves the duck. Hey uniforms, how many did you have when you played for the ducks. 
>> Two, home and away. They were both green and white. 
>> You're talking about the old school, we had a green one and a white one, kind of new and fresh but not like this. 
>> Nothing as fresh as this and nothing as fresh as what you'll see today at the coliseum. This is what they're unveiling, this is who wore it best, white on white with the matte white helmet. It's always supposed to make them look quicker, I don't know if that's possible to do. What do you think? 
>> I think when you look good, you play good. So yeah, I think it makes you quicker. 
>> I'll tell you who wore it best in this storm trooper look. 
>> Oh, boy. Hey! 
>> Hey! Is that your body when you played or now? 
>> Easy. I'm not quite sure where we got that picture. It makes me look faster because I was really slow. We couldn't get a number 3 in there on the jersey? 
>> There are some guns in that picture, man. 
>> I wouldn't go that far. So the oregon ducks obviously everybody talks about the great uniforms and their offense. The one thing you don't talk about when you discuss the ducks the defense. This year, more experience and really more talent, yet there are guys on the defense no one knows about. 
>> That's it, you don't have time to talk about the defense, it's the offense and the uniforms, the defense is getting completely overlooked but they are the key to this football team right now. They have players on every single level. Deon jordan, 6'6", 255, the proet typical defensive end, and avery patterson in the secondary, second in the country in pick sixes, had he not gotten tackled on the 2 yard line against arizona state he'd be tied in the country. This team is loaded top to bottom. I think it's the best defense since the '05 defense. This oregon defense shut out arizona, who put up 39 on usc last week. 

[00:24:09]


>> And chip kelly I think he learned from the national championship game when he played against auburn two years ago. His offense was built fast but they weren't able to take on the power. Now he has the power and speed on the defense. About 255 pounds, 260, can handle the power of a power team but also the quickness, to be able to tackle in space, they're a great blend. 
>> Oregon's defense will be a huge key in tonight's matchup at the coliseum. Moving to their offense let's look at these numbers, the ducks quick fire attack is one of the most feared in college football, through eight games there are 290 first half points is the best in sbs. Joey you recently sat down withment so of the guys. Wha did you take away from the advise isn't it. 
>> That's right. I've never been around a team as efficient at everything they do from this year's oregon ducks from the way they practice to the way they play this team is???? truly a reflection of chip kelly and his philosophy. 
>> Touchdown oregon! 
>> How old were you when you first remember seeing the oregon ducks? 10 or 11. 16. 
>> Were the uniforms something that drew you in? 
>> No, definitely not. Uniforms don't win games. If you don't have the players and the coach you can't win game. 
>> How much does the coaching staff have to do with your decision to come to oregon? 
>> I love coach coaly and the biggest thing you want to play for somebody that you'd die for and I think that's how I am. 
>> It's a big statement saying yont to play for somebody who you'd die for. People don't quite know how to think about them. Chel us about coach kelly, chip. 
>> What do we do? 
>> Win! 
>> He's an intense guy but in the film sessions he can be laid back and funny. 

[00:26:09]


>> What makes coach kelly different is his attitude toward not just the game of football but life. Everything is just perfection and that's what separates us from everybody else and coach kelly brought that to this program. 
>> You only played one year of high school football and now played eight games of your freshman year in college. Do you feel you're still developing as a quarterback, learning as you go? 
>> Going through practice every day against our defense i learned a lot but to be able to run and throw and to have that ability to take off every now and then is really fun and i want it to be for this offense because as far as the tempo you're setting trends. ?????? What's the word ?????? ?????? the word is ducky ?????? 
>> do you think you're a brand? 
>> Absolutely. This is our brand, this is my brand, the university of oregon. It's who I am, it's what I am. 
>> What is that brand? 
>> Fast, hard and finishing. 
>> Chrome helmets. 
>> Chrome helmets, flashy jersey, flashy cleats, all the above. 
>> Do you guys, have four games left to possible set up a trip to a national championship game. What is your mind-set? 
>> I call it the cobi bryant instinct. Cobi bryant has that drive and killer in him where he doesn't let up until the last whistle. That's what this team has. 
>> We have a mentality every week is a super bowl, coach kelly and the rest of the coaches have to do a good job making sure we understand that it's on the line every day. 
>> We don't let our foot off the gas until coach kelly pulls us off. 
>> We take it one play at a time, one day at a time. 
>> It's a cliche thing to say but it's the reality. 
>> Yes. 
>> That's the reality of a football season is you need to keep that very short line. Who instills that? 
>> They coach from the top. Coach kelly will relay that message to everybody, and if you look all over the place it's win today and that's just our mentality. 
>> Take care of each game, take one game at a time. You can't be distracted by what's ahead because if you focus on what's ahead you forget to realize what's right in front of but 
>> Petros: What's right in front of you right now? 
>> Usa. . 

[00:28:11]


>> It's not based on gimmicks or fads, it's on a simple play that echoes "win the day" philosophy, oregon's mastered the zone running game better than anyone in college football, made famous by terrell davis in the 1990 broncos. You have two double teams by the offensive linemen and they work to the second level and block anybody that comes into the zone. The running back's job is to press the hole, be patient and wait for it to develop. You'll see oregon run this play 15, 0 times during the course of the game. The way to beat this, take that contained rusher and bring him down to make the play. Well, here comes the zone read. Stead of containing the play the defensive end will get down and try to make a tackle on the running back. They tell marcus read the dn, option him, as he starts to collapse to the running back, pull the ball out and run to the zone that he vacated. Marcus has done a great job of that and his speed has helped him run this play extremely well. Okay you crashed the defensive end to stop the running back, and now I'm going to bring a corner in to tackle marcus on the zone read. Now coach kelly brought back a play, the triple option. You used to see it out of the "i" backs or a wishbone where the tailback becomes the pitchman. Under shotgun you don't really have a tailback so they do it a different way. The defensive end takes the running back. Marcus's job is to attack the leverage of the outside linebacker and force him to make a decision, force him to make a tackle. He find the pitch man who happens to be a quick screen outside for the touchdown. Coach kelly has taken a variation on a play that people had been running for decades and turned it into something current that matches with his offense. Because they score so often people think that oregon's offense is complicated but in reality it's taking a simple concepand doing it very, very well. 
>> Good stuff by joey, looks very comfortable in his old stomping ground. We know about marcus marioda and kenyon barder and deanthony thomas. You look at what chip kelly has, how does he have all of the toys and another one who doesn't get a lot either. 

[00:30:21]


>> He's a beast, my man colt lyurla, a grown n, 6'4", about 255 pounds, plays tight end, he could do so much for you in the passing game, a great vertical leap, so explosive but he's such a great athlete, ear rinne, they say listen we'll put you at running back and come downhill and impose that big 265-pound frame against the defense. I expect to see him do that tonight against usc. 
>> How can chip kelly use that as an advance against the trojans? 
>> I'd like to seeim matchup problems for the undersized linebackers of usc. Is he an athlete, tall, and height advantage and he has speed as well. It would help barter in the back field coming down. Third or fourth quarter he can lean on him and add that power attack. Is he just a freak of nature. 
>> Chip kelly has the fun on offense. You have to be a strong in shape athlete to be the mascot of the oregon ducks because of all the points they score, you got to have some nice upper body strength, don't you, joe? 
>> Like this guy right here. Ready? Go, go, go! Ooh, nice! He's hot! 
>> Joey, get in there. 
>> Let's go! 
>> Come on, joe, beat him. He's doing one-arm pushups. 
>> We'll have much more from the fox college saturday pregame show and get joey off the fox field, don't you worry about it.

>>> Marquis lee! 
>> That's not only a touchdown, he is number one all-time, single game receiving yards. 

[00:34:36]


>> He's in the end zone, touchdown usc! 
>> Welcome back to the "ford fox college saturday pregame. "How about marquis lee despite losing to arizona last week the trojans receiver shattered multiple pac-12 receiving records in a career-making performance. The sophomore wideout makes it so easy when he dominates defenders on the field. For lee, nothing in his life has been easy at all. 
>> He was living in and out of different motels, and he asked my son, could he come and live with us. I told my son, that is going to be the brother that you've always wanted. 
>> I've been against the odds my whole life. 
>> When I got marquis he didn't think he'd make it through high ol. My main thing was to keep the kid off the street and give him the opportunity to make life bet are for himself. 
>> When I was younger, 6 or 7, i was separated from my family, moving from place to place, kicked out of schools, fighting all the time. I had a lot of anger built up. 
>> Also with the older brother getting shot he wanted to get even with people and without being able to get that out of him, he kept it inside and he was going down the wrong direction. 
>> I have two older brothers who kind of went down the wrong path in which I didn't want to go, after seng the stress they put my mom through. 
>> I had told him, he had to learn to control his anger. 
>> It helped me realize that i do not somebody to fight for, my younger sister. If I had went the wrong way she would have went the wrong way. Relax and focus and put the anger into the game. Knock them down on the field and heventually turned all that anger around. 
>> Marqise lee is one of the most unbelievable athletes I've ever seen. 
>> Marqise lee! 
>> When the ball is in his hands he's able to break tackles. 
>> Touchdown trojans! 

[00:36:36]


>> Explosiveness, something I've never seen before. 
>> He's in the end zone, touchdown usc. 
>> It's been a source of motivatio prove he is a better man, growing into his own. 
>> Single game receiving record for marqise lee. 
>> To see all this unfold has been one of the most wonderful experienor our whole family. There's words that can complete what we felt for marqise. 
>> I have to be honest, I try to keep humble just like he kept his anger inside I try to keep that inside but believe me I'm proud as heck. Every time he's on that field he catches the ball, I just think about all the hard work he's put into it. 
>> I treat this team as another part of my family. No matter what goes on, I know I've been through greater things, I can always overcome. 
>> Wow. Nice job on that. 
>> Yeah, very nice job. It's good to see how he's taken th energy, that anger and channeled it in the right way, a positive way on the field and how it's panning out for him right now, really, really cool piece. 
>> Such a good young man. 
>> Easy to cheer for somebody like that and the trojan fans enjoyed what he was able to do with the crazy video game like numbers against the wildcats even though they lost last week. You can't get your hands on him, he's so slippery. 
>> Once he touches the ball and the run after the catch, he's electrifying. He's lethal. Can he take an ordinary play and make it extraordinary. He takes a simple out route, makes one guy miss and it's all she wrote. She runs at least 70 yards for a touchdown. The man is absolutely amazing. He did this all last week against arizona, taking a slant to the house, hitch to the house, running back kickoffs, he is the most explosive player in college football, the best player I've seen in the country this year. 
>> Who does he remind you of? 
>> A former teammate at ohio state terry glenn, similar. You throw the ball in a ten-foot radius he'll catch it. Explosive young man to watch, exciting. . 

[00:38:43]


>> The problem is they have all sorts of talent on this football team, marqise lee, matt woods, barkley, but they've been shooting themselves in the foot, 10 1/2 penalties per game and 20 personal fouls. They're undisciplined. When you play teams like colorado or cal or washington state, you can get away with making penalties and still come back and win the game. Oregon is the type of team that feeds on players that are undisciplined. They are going to grind them all day long and you cannot make those mistakes against an oregon team and still expect to win the game. 
>> Lane kiffin said we want our guys to play with energy and emotion but we have to handle it properly. You said it best, chip kelly and the ducks feed off of this, try to get to you make mistakes. That's all tonight on "fox college saturday" prime time game of the week number four oregon comes to so. Cal to battle number 17 usc in a pivotal pac-12 showdown. Much more on "fox college saturday."

>>> West virginia's dana holgorsen is facing garry patterson. First ever big 12 meeting between these two programs. We welcome you back inside, before we get to our upcoming fox college saturday double header let's check out other action around college football. Two former gator coaches going head to head, temple/louisville. 
>> Here in the first quarter, harris uses the blockers for a five-yard touchdown run putting temple up early 14-7. Bridgewater finds a wide open hubble at midfield for a 72-yard touchdown, getting louisily rolling here starting out slow, 14-14, later in the second quarter, wright takes a handoff and runs it in from three yards out, louisville up 24-17 and cardinals are just starting to get rolling, bridgewater later in the second fires to andrell smith for a 14-yard touchdown pass, putting louisville up 31-17. Right now 45-louisville. >>>Chigan at minnesota, no dennard robinson. 
>> He throws back left, rabb for the touchdown, minnesota on the board 7-0. Later in the second quarter, devon gardner, running around trying to make something happen, flush in the pocket, he finds a wide open drew delano all alone, 45-yard touchdown pass, tied up 7-7. Second half action, gardner again driving, handoff, a terrific catch for the touchdown, michigan up 28-10. 
>> Get you updated on sec, missou at florida gaitors, starting to get it rolling. 
>> There you go, erin, you're getting nervous until driscoll finds gillis. Don't worry, 14-7, florida, we're all right now. 

[00:44:54]


>> All right, joe, get us updated on how the sooners are doing at iowa state? 
>> Oklahoma started a little slow with a couple early interceptions from landry jones, but the ball is tipped, picked off earlier and finds his receiver off the hands of jeremy read to justin brown for a touchdown. Later on, takes it reverse goes 19 yards for the touchdown. Iowa state trying to stay in this thing, cutting the lead 21-13 but brennan clay finds his way to the end zone foran 18-yard touchdown, oklahoma starting to roll 28-13. 
>> I think these were two matchups that everybody wanted to see if they could shake off what happened a week before the sooners and the gators lost last week and get back to business. 
>> I think oklahoma has done a good job, you know, like you said earlier, at ames, , against iowa state early in the morning is a tough place to play. You don't think about that but oklahoma has done a good job of recovering from a couple early turnovers, starting to get the momentum rolling. It's always tough to play on the road early kind of a quiet crowd, no real momentum but they've done a good job recovering. 
>> For florida, I expected this type of ball game, playing a physical game against georgia last week, kind of trying to wake up at home, early kickoff against missouri, they're starting to come alive a little bit. Missouri, they're showing a little feistiness, but florida will win the game. 
>> We'll have a reason to celebrate.

[00:46:58]


>> The gophers, how about this guy, kirkland hit so hard his detail flies off the helmet. Come on equipment staff you got to get that on there. 
>> Gone with the wind. Check this out. October 11, the punter kicks it up and guess what? It goes backwards, the wind was blowing so hard, they won 5 -28, gone with the wind. Eastern washington freshman quarterback vernon adams avoids the hornets. Watch the flags. Everybody's trying to take him down. No, no, no finds herndon in the end zone for a score.

[00:51:20]


>>> Geno smith has had two weeks to get ready fortcu. West virginia looking to avoid their first three-game losing streak since 2004. Wow. I had to take a double take on that one. We welcome you back to the ford fox college saturday pregame. Erin andrews alongside eddie and joey. West virginia needed that time-out. They needed a bye week. The whole offense and the defense needed a minute to simme down and when we talk about their offense it's not just geno smith that needed a time-out. Running game needed some time. 
>> The first four or five games they were effective, andrew buie outstanding job against texas, 200 yards provided balance for the offense. The last two games averaged 3.5 per rush and ineffective. As a running back you have got to make the unblocked defender miss or run through him. You know, it's shocking to see that because the first five games he was very effective, provided balance and now against texas tech, kansas state, very ineffective. They put a lot of pressure on smth snapshot make plays in the passing game and made him one-dimensional. 
>> It puts pressure on the offensive line. If you don't have a balanced offense, you allow the defensive line to pin their ears back and rush knowing you're only going to throw the football. Geno smith was great early in the season when we no pressure against baylor and texas but as the year went on and they haven't been able to run the football the offensiv line has allowed teams to pressure geno smith and when you pressure geno smith they've shown you can get him flustered and then he's not as effective as he was earlier in the season. That's the key for west virginia's offense. 
>> Can tcu get pure onim today? Are they able to do that? 
>> I think they can and I think they will. I think tcu will win the football game doing that, putting pressure on the offense that hasn't been able to run the football the last few weeks. 

[00:53:21]


>> Let's hurry up and go no huddle. Joey, it was said alabama could defeat an nfl team. Do you agree or disagree? 
>> Oh for cryin' out loud go to the next question. Seriously? They couldn't even beat jacksonville. 
>> All right, which will be the next team to lose? 
>> Tonight, kansas state, oklahoma state pulls off the upset. The big 12 is deep. 
>> Joe, biggest surprise of the season so far. 
>> I think it's kansas state. I don't think anybody expected them to be number two in the country. We knew they were good but not this good. 
>> Eddie who would you invite to new york for the heisman trophy presentation? 
>> Colin klein, geno smith, MANTAI TEYO, A.J. McCARRON, Jarvis jones, they've been playing outstanding football this year. 
>> Oregon helmets are going on sale for $1,200 to the public. How much would you spend for one of these? 
>> I'm getting mine for free. 1,200, that's underpriced. Priceless. 
>> I have one at home. Joey, has alabama and lsu become the st rivalry in all of sports? 
>> Seriously, no. In all of sports not even close. Not even close. 
>> What is it? 
>> Red sox/yankees. 
>> Ohio state/mississippi. 
>> Death valley will be rockin' tonight. What is the loudest place you've played? You can say the pros, too. 
>> Madison, wisconsin, and camp randall. 
>> Camp randall but the metrodome was loud, too. 
>> Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. 
>> Not minnesota gophers, minnesota vikings. Let's be honest. 
>> Both of you guys, how much pushups will the oregon duck be doing by the end of the night? 324. 324? 
>> It's all consecutive, seven plus 14 plus 21. 
>> I'll go a little bit lower than that, I'll say 200. 200? 

[00:55:22]


>> I think it will be a low scoring game. 
>> In a few moments geno smith will wash away the memories of the last two games show why west virginia's offense is still one of the best in the country, the big news for the horned frogs, trayvon boykin will start, red shirt freshman quarterback took over for kc. believe? What Mitt Romney's TV ads say about women? Or what Mitt Romney himself says? 
MITT ROMNEY: Do I believe the Supreme Court... should overturn Roe v. Wade? Yes. And it would be my preference that they, that they... reverse Roe v. Wade. Hopefully reverse Roe v. Wade. Overturn Roe v. Wade. Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of that. I'll cut off funding to Planned Parenthood. 
ANNCR: No matter what Mitt Romney's ads say. We know what he'll do. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I'm Barack Obama and... I approve this message. ] president agenda, look at his first. Gutted the work requirement for welfare. Doubled the number of able-bodied adults without children on food stamps. Record unemployment. More women in poverty than ever before. Borrowed from china and increased the debt to over sixteen trillion 

[00:58:34]


-- passing the burden onto the next generation. We may have made it through president obama's first term. It's our children who can't afford a second. 
[ Romney ] I'M MITT ROMNEY AND I APPROVE This message. Won't have the penalties, I think they'll get it done. Erin working hard college football, basketball, whatever.

=======================================================

Bienvenidos a futbol central. ??? ??? Game like this. Let's get a game break, a wild day in college football. Here's patrick o'neil. 
>> It is not over in south bend because the irish are getting back on this one, versus pittsburgh, golston throwing back, jones 11 yards for the touchdown. They missed the extra point, still a one-possession game, 20-12, pitt up on third-ranked notre dame. Craig and joel? 
>> Craig: Thank you, patrick. Here at 31-31, with 24 seconds to play, 38 yard line of tcu and west virginia. Geno smith going back to field, home run ball, left top he throws, incomplete. J.D. Woods was the intended receiver. He had one on one coverage with kevin white. 
>> Joel: Here we go, bitancurt. 
>> Craig: He had a 52-yarder, 1 of 3 in this game. 
>> Joel: They'll line this up, he'll be kicking it right from the 45 yard line, 55-yard field goal for the game. 
>> Ccareer long made earlier, a 52. 
>> Joel: Here we go. 
>> Craig: Good snap, kicks away. No. Never had a chance, as he hooked it to the left. And 13 seconds to go. 31-31 in morgantown. 
>> Joel: I'm surprised the offensive play calls weren't trying to help out bitancurt getting him closer than 55. The 52-yarder he made earlier barely got over the cross bar, a couple of runs there rather than the passes that were incomplete as dana holgorsen and shannon dawson look on, patterson's reaction. 

[00:02:05]


>> Craig: New life. 
>> Joel: He's got new life. I thought they should have run the ball, gotten closer. 
>> Joel: Boykin 13 seconds on the clock overtime, flush from the pocket, inside to throw the ball as he's down on the knee, incomplete is the call and coming with pressure was francis, the buck, number 4. 
>> Joel: It might be time t take a knee and play for overtime. The amount of mistakes we've seen on both sides of the ball, geno smith a couple of snaps before they tried the field goal, he threw it right into the arms of the safety from tcu and that's exactly what garry patterson will choose to do, take the knee and play for overtime. 
>> Craig: And that's what they'll do. What looked to be a west virginia victory didn't turn out that way, at least to this point. Here's what, this is how they got to overtime, as josh boyce just kind of floats around, he's open and gone, 94 yards. 
>> Joel: And truns everybody. West virginia, they had, and their defense played so good, even against the past they were LAST, 120th IN THE COUNTRY Coming in, 362 yards a game given up a played so well, gotten to the quarterback, trevone boykin. joe DeForest his game plan, the sense of urgency, the passion with which the defensive players were playing was tremendous. So to have it happen like that is frustrating. Both of the clubs with the momentum clearly on tcu's side going into overtime. 
>> Craig: Captain also make a walk to the 50 yard line, we'll get the coin toss. 

[00:04:08]


>> Referee: Tcu, will you call the toss. The winner of the toss chooses offense, defense or which end of the stadium we're going to play on. Each team has one time-out per overtime period and if we get to the third overtime if you score a touchdown, you need to go for a two-point conversion. What is your choice? Choice is tails. It's heads. Defense. What end of the stadium? Okay, west virginia will have the ball at the 25 yard line, we will play on the south end of the stadium. 
>> Craig: So here we go. Boykin's on the phone. Tcu, west virginia, set for overtime on fox. First rule of taking the world by surprise? Do something the world will actually notice. Introducing the entirely new Ford Fusion. With turbo-charged EcoBoost engine and a hybrid that doubles the fuel economy of the average vehicle.

[ Male Announcer ] Bud Light. The official beer of nfl fans who do whatever it takes. Here we go. ] yet? Yeah, I'm walking in right now. CHILEAN GRANITE... Chilean granite... So, how's it in person? I should send you a picture. Floor to ceiling bookshelves... Floor to ceiling bookshelves... Original windows... Riginal and this... Is that a... Fireplace face -- yes, yes it is. Fireplace shaped like a face. I know right! 

[00:06:53]


[ Male Announcer ] ONLY AT&T'S NETWORK Lets you talk and surf at the same time on your iphone 5. Rethink possible. 
>>> The overtime rules simple, teams alternate possessions, start on the 25 yard line, two-point conversions must be tried in the beginning of overtime and first to lead after a completed round wins. Both teams desperate to break out of a two-game losing slump. Boykin, catalon, part of the west virginia defense. 
>> Joel: That defensive front has been so stout. They had success in the early half, tcu picking up the ball but in the last four or five possessions they've none of it. The defensive front has played really well up front. Will clarke number 98, jorge wright number 99, those guys played really hard. 
>> Craig: Second down and eight. Boykin, wants the home run, on top, man coverage and out of bounds. Cam white number 88 the intended receiver and pat miller has provided great coverage on the edge. Karl joseph comes up limping a bit, number 8. There's a flag out. 

[00:09:10]


>> Joel: It's goi to be on tcu, discussing what they want to do. 
>> Referee: Ineligible receiver illegally down the field number offense 87, penalty is declined, third down. 
>> Joel: The end of the play, not very close. Great defense being played by west virginia. That was number 8, the true freshman karl joseph. 
>> Craig: Five wide receivers, third down today, 4 of 16. Quick slant, not much, carter, taken down at the 20. 
>> Joel: Putting the game on the true freshman's, jaden oberkrom, has missed a big one here for tcu. 
>> Craig: From 26, his numbers this year 15 of 19. They'll mark this down at the 27, this will be a 37-yard attempt. No. So now it will be west virginia's turn. 
>> Joel: And you'll probably see some very safe play calls. Jaden oberkrom now 50% ov the day. Good snap, good hold. Just came out of the kick too soon. Wanted to see it and hooks it left. 

[00:11:12]


>> Craig: It's geno smith and west virginia in overtime their first possession, 25 yard line, first and ten. Quick throw, trying to break out of the tackle is travares copeland, five-yard pickup. 
>> Joel: As an offense the entire offense as a quarterback the leader you got to just tell everybody, ball security, ball security, be safe with the football at this point. 
>> Craig: Second down, shawne alston in the back field, geno smith flips it out, the ball batted down incomplete. That brings up third down. 
>> Joel: John koontz got his hands on that ball, I think, number 97, batted it down and you can tell geno was hesitant to go down the field on that one. He wants to make sure if they're going to put the ball in his hands and he puts it down the field he's got a completion, doesn't want to put this all at risk and with shawne alston you might see a run and a field goal attempt. 
>> Craig: Third down and four, quick throw, far side, a little pitch and catch,copeland again, and maybe a yard to the 19 yard line. Now remember, bitancurt of 4 on field goal tries and dana holgorsen does not look like a happy head coach. 
>> Joel: Tcu's defense did what they needed to do, force a long field goal attempt. Bet an kurt made from 52, long misses, and then the 55-yarder at the end of regulation. 
>> Craig: They'll mark it at the 26, from 36 yards and the win for west virginia, the kick is up! Verrett, terrific day for tcu defensively, and he comes flat in on special teams, and what we will do here will go to a second overtime. 

[00:13:17]


>> Joel: He had an interception today. He leads the big 12 in passes defended, he's got five interceptions on the year, and now a couple of missed field goals and we're going to overtime number two. right? Yeah. Which house is yours? The one with the silverado out front. So, what do you do? Well, ahhh... NICE! [ clown horn ] ?????? AND BINGO WAS HIS NAME ?????? [ shouting ] 
[ child crying ] ?????? ?????? i...Ahh. 
[ Male Announcer ] THE CHEVY SILVERADO. The most dependable, longest-lasting full-size piups on the road. From worksite to home front. Chevy runs deep. swenson today. So, I'm happy. Sales go up... I'm happy. It went out today... I'm happy. What if she's not home? 
(Together) she won't be happy. Use ups! She can get a text alert, reroute... Even reschedule her package. It's ups my choice. Are you happy? I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. 
(Together) happy. I love logistics. 
>>> So the second overtime here in morgantown, they flip-flop on offense so again west virginia with the football at the 25 yard line. Both teams missing field goals in the first overtime period. Geno smith dancing in, it's up, oh, touchdown! And a flag down. Stedman bailey and let's see what this flag is about. 
>> Referee: Pass interference on defense number two, penalty is declined, touchdown. 
>> Joel: Jason verrett has had such a good game against stedman bailey and geno smith goes right to him, the first play of overtime number two. Verrett has him locked up, has good coverage but never turns back around. Great execution from a quarterback and wide recever. 

[00:15:40]


>> Craig: Third catch of the day for stedman bailey to put west virginia over the top in second overtime. That stop and go move was very impressive by bailey. 
>> Joel: It was but verrett still had the coverage. It didn't allow verrett to defend the ball which was the key to the whole route is he was in catch-up mode and couldn't turn back and defend the ball. 15th touchdown catch this year for stedman bailey, first in the country, his 31st in his career. He's the west virginia all-time leader and because verrett was in recovery mode, that's why he couldn't look back and actually get to that ball and bat it down, and bailey did a nice job I thought of not extending his arms and pushing off. It felt like there was an opportunity late. He had his hands up and pulls it back and receivethe ball. That's a pretty savvy play by a veteran wide receiver. 
>> Craig:25 yards away, one time-out in each overtime possession, that's what you into ed to push a third. Boykin, now the pass, my, oh, my, fuller tight in, trickery, touchdown. Playground, you just ride it up from the dirt. 
>> Joel: Gardner with the touchdown pass, unbelievable! Petros, the resiliency of this team unbelievable with an important p.A.T. To come. 
>> Petros: For such a young team you can't imagine how they keep on bouncing back in the football game. What can you say about coach patterson and his team and the way they keep on rising from the dead so to speak here on the road. 
>> Joel: Brandon carter on the left-hand side, the ball is handed off to catalon the true freshman, back to brandon carer it the sophomore, drops it over the top to corey fuer, the senior. 

[00:17:48]


>> Craig: First touchdown of the year for corey fuller, only his third reception. 
>> Joel: Unbelievable. You got to credit the offensive play call. They haven't done anything offensively except for the complete blown coverage at the end of the game by west virginia, and then now some trickery, a creative play call, takes basically the game out of your offensive lines because they've been dominated in the second half and the fourth quarter more specifically and taken out of their hands and creative play, a tremendous job. 
>> Craig: We ran that play when I was in seventh grade and how about this. Garry patterson rolling the dice. Here is the second overtime. Boykin, fling shots it low, did he catch it? Yes! Josh boyce! And it's double overtime, the gamble pays off. Tcu on the road beats west virginia! Hold it. The celebration, they may bring this back. Review. Joel, I wanted to wait, the official right on the spot put his hands up, and now the review is under way. Did it take a bounce 
>> Joel: Let's take a look. Boykin rolling to his right, throwing to josh boyce, the ball is low, tovgh to see. Looks like it shifts in his hand in that right hand, it would have been tough for him to catch it in his biceps. This will be a better look. 

[00:19:51]


>> Craig: That's tough. 
>> Joel: Boy, that's tough to see. Craig there's not enough to overturn that. 
>> Craig: How about this angle? Did he trap it? Looks like it hit off the forearm. 
>> Joel: On that angle, that's tough. Petros, did you have a good angle down there? 
>> Petros: You know, I saw -- i definitely saw the ball bounce. Now whether or not it bounced off his forearms or the ground, it's tough to say, like you said. With the way his body was blockihe ball. It might not be enough. There is such confusion down here right now and it's a good job by the official. 
>> Referee: After review the ruling on the field stands as a completed catch, a two-point conversion. The game is over. 
>> Joel: There wasn't enough to overturn that call and tcu wins the football game. 
>> Craig: Here is another look one more time, you feel heartbreak for west virginia, but elation for tcu, and here it is. Maybe only josh boyce knows for se if that ball took a skip on the turf or not. What a wild one. Tcu double overtime 39-38 over west virginia. For jo klatt, petros papadakis and fox crew, craig bolerjack saying so long. We take to you erin andrews for the at&t fox college saturday game break show.

Welcome back inside, erin andrews, eddie george, joey harrington, guys, let's get straight to probably the biggest upset of the night. Pitt at notre dame, a lot of people wanted to see how they would do after beating oklahoma last week. 
>> We got an upset in the making, t.J. Jones cuts ine to take it to the end zone but notre dame would have missed a p.A.T. Down 20-12. Driving again, the end zone and it is intercepted by williams. Pitt holding on 20-12 late in the fourth quarter. 
>> What's going on here? They did bring tommy rees in who threw a pick and they put gholson back in. 
>> He was struggling early in the ball game, erin, and that's why they brought in tommy rees. Now we're seeing the effects of two quarterbacks not feeling the rhythm of the game. You have to say you figured it would be a trap game after the big win at oklahoma. Emotional and a lot of energy they put into that ball game. Pitt comes in and scrappy enough to pull off the upset and it appears they're doing it right now.

MITT ROMNEY: Do I believe the Supreme Court... should overturn Roe v. Wade? Ye And it would be my preference that they, that they... reverse Roe v. Wade. Hopefully reverse Roe v. Wade. Overturn Roe v. Wade. Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of that. I'll cut off funding to Planned Parenthood.

It will be interesting to see and you mentioned it yesterday, oregon has gotten off to a fast start and now we'll have to see the guys play both -- 
>> a full game, that's the thing. They've got so much talent on offense we haven't had achance to see kenjon barner play a full football game, he's tenth in the country in rushing and 17 yards coming in the first half. They'll play usc, stanford, oregon state, big games and a national tv audience and he's going to make his push for the heisman trophy right now, I'm telling you he's the best running back in the country. 
>> On the offensive side of the football they got all the hype and headlines and the defense is playing outstanding with deon grant at the linebacker position, michael clay, dion jordan and this is a great blend of power and speed. Chip kelly learned something from the auburn loss in the championship game, he had to get more athletic and power up front, I think he does it tonight with the defense. 
>> And we'll see how usc can recover after the loss last week to arizona, they'll have to play smart and no more turnovers and not as many penalties.

=======================================================

Media franken storm. Was the coverage done right. >>. 
>> They got the spotlht giving uates and assessments but did some take advantage of the situation to politicize the probnd did the media help them do it? Election day just days away. Did hurricane sandy cause a media distraction taking the heat off the president on key issues? Most in the media still in a blackout over the terror attacks in benghazi, ignoring new details about what happened and helping the white house cover up the real story. And do the tv shows you watch 6 any influence who you will puck as president? 
>> I marry bessy and dee. 
>> Judy miller, richard grenell. Jim pinkerton, contributing editor and alan colmes, thanks the liberals for saving ameca. She host of alan colmes show. I'm jon scott. Fox news watch is on right now. 
>> Were on the southern tip of manhattan, the area known as the battery, named the cannons that were defending it back in the 17th century. But nothing could protect the city when the water of water came crashing on shore. 
>> A huge portion of the eastern seaboard is crippled tonight. Millions of viewers cannot see this broadcast because they are heading into another night of the dark. 
>> Millions are trying to recover super storm sandy. 
>> It was billed the biggest storm to the atlantic coast delivered a crippling storm to the northeast. 

[00:02:08]


>> Jon: Hurricane sandy. The media often get criticized for hyping or overhyping these things. How did they do this time? 
>> Howard kurtz, this is the rare storm that lived up to its hype. This is everything the forecasters would said it would be and maybe worse. I think the coverage, the elections were uncertain and talking about the storm. I think rightly so it's a bigger story. 
>> Jon: Did the media approach it with an agenda or just to tell the stories? 
>> I think there is kind desire on the part of the media to make it a big story. There was a little of that before the actual event but i thinkhe social media were ahead of the mainstream media because before it was a storm, it was a hash tag which was franken storm. We were already anticipating what happened. In this case, if anything you can say the media didn't warn people enough. 
>> Jon: But the problem with social media sometimes bad information gets out there and moves faster than the hurricane itself. 
>> The hash tag before the storm 
[ laughter ] 
>> you pick your sources carefully because it's important to get the right information. 
>> Jon: It didn't take long for liberal media to trot out climate change as the reason for behind the storm? 
>> That is silly. Hype of the storm before hand is somebody who doesn't live on the east coast. I live in los angeles. Most people are saying yet again there is a big hype about an on doing storm. We weren't paying attention until we start to see the twitter photos and firsthand accounts. Then to start immediately seeing the liberal media talk about it. 

[00:04:09]


>> The governor cuomo of new york, let's not blame the media. 50 years, we've only had a storm like this. 
>> He is not the media, he is a governor looking out for people of the state. 
>> The global warming things, there were news figures and people were eager to bring that angle up. I want to hight the worst coverage of this whole thing, brian williams on rock center doing a segment on alec baldwin which you know is an nbc employee, so talking about an nbc employee, visiting volunteering on behalf of him. He doesn't want to be on camera and he was on camera. Total pufr job from nbc. Beside from the product placement. There are other aspects of his personality. 
>> How dare do they show that. 
>> Jim brought in a copy of the "new york times" from friday, but I just want to highlight. I don't know if you were going to highlight this. It did manage to include the storm propelled bloomberg in obama's corner. They managed to find room for that. 
>> This was clrly an important endorsement. Mayor bloomberg had been very critical of his performance. 
>> As they are still cleaning up this storm there are a lot of people pretty critical of mayoral's performance. 
>> Shouldn't be front page news that the new york mayor endorsed the president of united states. 
>> With mayor bloomberg it's alws unexpected. 
>> He was not at the republican convention. He didn't speak. There is the point. He is not a republican why are we excited that he is supported a democratic. 

[00:06:14]


>> I like what david riegle said maybe he should get bloomberg to not run the new york city marathon in the middle of the tragedy. We'll see if other people make the link between bloomberg and obama on that score. 
>> Jon: That is the thick. He is getting more and more criticism on staten island and elsewhere you are pulling police resources to run the marathon and that sort of thing. This could become a real problem for him politically? 
>> There is no question. At first I think the whole media narrative was this storm was going to help president obama. He ran out there with a bomber jacket. The images of him being in charge were something that we all, I guess wanted to see in the media and the media wanted to tell. At the end of the day, it didn't go that well. We're seeing new yorkers still without electricity and still without heat. Yet, obama is off doing something else. This whole bomber jacket is a perfect symbol for a sha shallow. 
>> You wanted to blame it on chris christie who also had a bomber jacket. 
>> Let's look at the jacket and see that as a symbol. 
>> Bush 43 campaign for reelection and staten island looking for their power. 
>> And considering where storm hit and the media's attention span, how long is sandy going to get coverage? 
>> In the new york metropolitan area it's ing to get a lot of coverage because we are still or some of us are still so devastat. I think overall the media is going to move on to the election. There is going to be a second day story on mayor bloomberg's decision not to cancel the marathon. It's a big debate this weekend. 
>> I just have to give a shout out our fox forecasters who on thursday before the storm was going to hit how bad it could be. Eric whimple apparently slammed her and said, given what we know about the storm, as it makes its way to land fall is it too vindicate dean and her employer. No way. More whimple you are not a meteorologist and janice did a great job. 

[00:08:44]


>> Next on news watch, hurricane sandy spins over the east coast and the media spin and the coverage. 
>> Hurricane sandy pounds the east coast. Did the wl to wall coverage of the devastation drown out coverage of t campaign? And the media turned a spotlight on obama post storm efforts but what did the media give governor romney. Answers next on news watch. Ring. Progresso. In what world do potatoes, bacon and cheese add up to 100 calories? Your world. ?????? ??? 
[ whispers ] Real bacon... Creamy cheese... 
[ whispers ] 100 calories... [ Chef ] Ma'am 
[ Male Announcer ] Progresso. You gottate this soup. Hahahaha! Hooohooo, hahaha! This is awesome! Folks who save hundreds of dollars switching to GEICO sure are happy. I'd say Happier than a Slinky on an escalator. Get happy. Get GEICO. Melons!!! Oh yeah!! Well that was uncalled for. Folks who save hundreds of dollars switching to GEICO sure are happy. How happy, Ronny? Happier than Gallagher at a Farmers' Market. Get happy. Get GEICO. ?????? ?????? 
[ Male Announcer ] IT'S TIME FOR MEDICARE Open enrollment. Are you ready? Time to compare plans and see what's new. You don't have to make changes, but it's good to look.

Visit medicare.Gov or call 1-800-medicare. ?????? ?????? 

[00:12:21]


>> I don't give a damn about election day. It doesn't matter to me at the moment. I got much bigger fish to fry than that. So do the people in the state of new jersey, let the people worry about it. It's not my problem, I'm not dealing with it at the moment. 
>> Jon: Chris christie asking about his conrns. He had bigger issues to deal with at that point. Judy, the media opinion of christie took a turn this week. Can you summarize? 
>> It's called doing well by ing the right thing or the non-political thing which turns to be out very political. McCHRYSTAL STI AMAZING BUT I Think you saw the way which political winds are blowing. He also understood the devastation required him to do the right thing. He responded well and president obama owes him a very big thank you. 
>> Last year. He took one when he said get the had hell off the beach. This time he didn't get so much flack. 
>> This thing, this irene thing were seen as a lighter storm. I would agree with judy that christie was focusing on being go governor of the state. There is a phrase, when a republican endorses democrats, they get strange new respect from the "washington post". 
>> And alan, there is strange new respect. 
>> That was a flak jacket that we saw. 
>> He was caring about the people of the state. The president was on the phone with him three times a day. It's not praising a commander in chief who is in charge of is a storm ultimately. 
>> I actually totally agree except for the fact that maureen dowd jumped to the conclusion he has moved left? That is the problem with the media. You cannot define critz at this is doing the right thing and evil before that simply by doing his job. We need to put pressure on the media to put them on be more substantive. 

[00:14:47]


>> Jon: The advice the that it he made and christie is arm to arm along with the president in the boardwalk and looking presidential. It gave him the opportunity. That is worth all times of media exposure. 
>> Coverage to coverage of these stories. Let's say christie did a good job as governor. He is an impressive figure. He knows his geography. He says there is a dam at xyz place and he said that is actually a berm. On narrative issue, liberal mainstream media that christie is no longer this right wing hack. He is now a guy who embraces our hero. That shaped the coverage a gre deal. 
>> I don't think he was ever looked at at right wing hack. Not taking the position of his ideological brothers or sisters in the republican party. I don't think anybody would regard him as a hack. 
>> Jon: What about the treatment of governor romney and his reaction to the storm. There were replays of his comments about federal funding. There were comparisons to john McCAIN PULLING OUT OF THE CAMPAIGN IN 2008 When the financial crisis hit. 
>> Before he even spoke, you had a buzz feed reporter getting caught on audio saying, I'm hear to listen to governor romney because there is a 40% chance he will say something really stupid. This is jump before governor romney spoke. That tells you everything about the press corps following governor romney. They were never going to let him -- 
>> give him as the example. 

[00:16:50]


>> Tim graham rattle off a bunch of reporters, a whole slew sounding like that. 
>> Msnbc criticized him for collecting donations? 
>> First of all this guy goes to walmart and spends 5 to give to people and you have ryan telling people, workers at shelter where ryan is going, pack the stuff slower so ryan could get there in time for the photo op. 
>> We need to send allen into staten island so he can tell them all the people. It's merely a photo op. In terms of the coverage. 
>> Staten island residents are furious at the red cross. 
>> They should have taken romney's donations. 
>> They are looking for nothing but coverage and photo-ops for this storm. 
>> Shame on them. Too bad they didn't take the donation. 
>> It was fair game to hold him to cut the fema budget by 40%. That is fair game. 
>> That is not what he said. 
>> He cut domestic spending and reluctant think tanks said that he would cut 40%. 
>> He would privatize it. Yes, he did. 
>> In one of debates he said the best options would be privatize it. 
>> It's always better to get the money back from the state and better option would be. This is talking about relief for people. What we're sneak new jersey is becoming true. Fema and red cross and others are doing a terrible job. 
>> Jon: All right. We have to leave it there. More news watch ahead. First if you see something that shows evidence of media bias, tweet us. Up next the media gears up for tuesday's big election. 

[00:19:02]


>> Election day looms as candidates make a last ditch effort to reach voters and the media make a last ditch effort to prop up their man. That is next on news watch. running hard, try running four. Fortunately we've got ink. It gives us 5x the rewards on our internet, phone charges and cable, plus at office supply stores. Rewards we put right back into our business. This is hing we've ever wanted to do and ink helps us do it. Make your mark with ink from chase.

>>> You elected me in 2008, that is why I'm running for a second term for president of the united states of america. 
[ Applause ] 
>> there is no question in my view that we really can't have four more years like the last four years. I know that the obama folks are chanting four more years. But our chant is this, five more days, five more days. 
>> Jon: It sounded like three more days before the election. Candidates pulling out the stops doing everything we can to win support and get their niojt voters and competing for media attention. I'm guessing who you want to win this race. 
>> I do. I wanted to single out u.S.A. Today on friday for calling out what I think has been the worst ad of this campaign season which is the ad that the obama campaign ran against romney, not one of us, unquote. That is completed loaded language. It's fair to say if romney used that on obama he would have been destroyed by the media so obama uses it on romney and u.S.A. D did flag it. 

[00:23:57]


>> You see basically a white media or white blib. A bck guy is not one of us didn't feel about a white guy? 
>> They are clearly trying to say romney is not one of us. You can't have it both ways. 
>> It's a different concept. 
>> What became of the colorblind society. 
>> We have seen so much racism we don't have a colorblind society. A lot of racists came out of the woodwork. 
>> She muslim. He is not one of us. So what can we expect from the media leading up to tuesday? 
>> I think they have their guy they are pushing for. What are the excuses going to be. If obama wins, what are the excuses that the media is going to come up with or how did he win? Is it going to be a weak romney or obama so great or vice versa I think we're seeing one. Chuck todd on the today show when asked, why is romney beginning to spend money in wisconsin and pennsylvania and minnesota rather than say, romney is extending the map. Chuck todd said the obama talking point he is run out of options. If we decided six days out and start spending in pennsylvania because we given up in ohio that is ridiculous. 
>> Why is it ridiculous? He can't win ohio and can't make up the difference in a couple of days. 
>> You don't started over. 
>> On this weekend, how do you know that romney can't win ohio. 
>> He can't win ohio because he can't close a gap in such a period of time. He has got obama at 80% as of yesterday as of friday. 

[00:25:59]


>> Nate sill investigator and alan colmes are trying to make a game that obama. 
>> Real clear politics. 
>> They lean right. 
>> I think obama is so confident in ohio, one has to ask a question, why are they deploying 600 lawyers in a county to make sure that the people who are voting get moved along fast enough. I think they are worried that it's very risky to predict the outcome. 
>> Why are the republicans are going after four states in swing states claiming the votes are going to obama and should be going to romney. 
>> Because they know they are losing. 
>> Jon: Let's get back to the coverage. If president obama loses what is the media theme going to be? 
>> I think a lot of people, andrew sullivan, if you only voted, daily beast. If you only voted obama once you have to vote for him twice. I think some version of obviously the american people and alan is ready with that script. They bubbled up and he lost. Think that is what he'll say. 
>> Jon: If romney loses? 
>> It's going to be further indication that the republican party is dying, it's been taken over by tea party extremists. That the party is out of touch and demographically ill-suited. 
>> The problem with that. 
>> The rob with that, last year the religious right had taken over had taken over the republican party. Now, it's the tea party but before that was the religious right. That has imploded because you don't see governor romney using abortion or gay marriage decisively. 

[00:28:07]


>> They became moderate, the religious right haven't taken over governor romney. 
>> Are the media guilty aidin in the cover-up in the attacks in benghazi. 
>> The major news blackout over the details surrounding the deadly terror attacks roll on. And some navy seals talk about the benghazi disaster but their views got censored. Who did that and why? All next on news watch. fail, through. Introducing the new Droid Razr Maxx HD by Motorola. Now more than ever DROID DOES. 

[00:31:53]


>>> Live from america's news headquarters. President obama and governor romney making closing arguments. Romney visiting threeattled ground states, new hampshire, colorado and ohio. Ohio west virginia and virginia. Voters are heading to the polls in the swing state of florida. Today is the last day for early voting and some people waited in lines up to four hour's long. 
>> Recovery efforts underway in the wake of hurricane sandy. Some 2.7 million people across 15 states and d.C. Remain bought power. Gas shortages are major problem for folks across new york, new jersey and connecticut. New jersey I rationing gasoline in 12 counties. I'm rick folbaum. Now back to news watch. 
>>> Don't ask, don't tell is back. It's president obama's questions about libya. Don't ask and don't tell. 
>> Jon: Jay leno taking a shot at president obama over the growing concerns about a cover-up by him and his administration over details surrounding the terror attacks at consulate in benghazi, libya. There wasn't a whole lot of coverage of this story before the hurricane hit. What about after? 
>> It was obliterated, blown away by thi storm. It disappeared except for fox news and a couple of other reporters eli lake, a few other people pursuing the story and continuing to produce uncomfortable facts for the white house. David ignacious someone i respect enormously said there was no evidence that the white house or the c.I.A. Leadership deliberately delayed or impeded the rescue efforts. But that is not the issue here. There is so many questions here. Why did the senior counterterrorism security group never meet when it was supposed to? Why did these explanations continue shifting? If the president said deploy whatever you have to do, protect our people, why did the seetary of defense leon panetta not get the memo and say we're not fire department. There are so many issues that the mainstream totally failed in a major story. 

[00:34:26]


>> I agree they failed but failed from the other side. C.I.A. Officials gave us the time line within 24 minutes and it was outraged that th right wing media tried to play this card to hurt this president and play a game with lives of four americans. It's an outrage this is continued as a narrative. 
>> It's an outrage that those americans have died if in fact they could have been saved. 
>> They could have been saved. 
>> Lime glad you know that. 
>> The administration -- 
>> let me finist 

[00:38:22]


>> I said last week there was canalbalism but this is more. Whatever happens this election, they have to sort on the to get the blame. David petraeus has made it sure that it is not them. 
>> Jon: We're going to answer more questions on this the next segment. The polls show what americans think but are the media paying attention? 
>> Polls show americans care more about the economy and jobs. Polls show voters think romney can fix the economy and create jobs. But the media aren't connecting the dots. Why not? Find out next on news watch. rosa chant when the doctor told me that I could smoke for the first week... I'm like...Yeah, ok... Little did I know that one week later I wasn't smoking.

[00:42:40]


>> Jon: Kolg continuing our discussion of benghazi attacks. San diego times asked this, why won't the main stream media treat the evidence of incompetence like the ugly scandal it obviously is? Then there was a this. They said a facebook page asking this question or making this statement. Obama called the seals and they got bin laden. When the seals called obama, they got denied. Facebook then took that page down and said it violated its terms of agreement. Agreement usage terms. Facebook later apologized and said all of that was an error. What do you make of this. 
>> Coo sheryl sandberg, ex-clinton official, I am mystified. I can't guess why. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> I think information did not want to be fre 
>> Jon: My good friend rick, it's the san diego union tribune. My mistake. 
>> I'm glad that they apologized. I think that is important. They recognized. I think they should try to work to fix it why somebody was too jumpy on this. Clearly somebody on the first level is censoring when they shouldn't. 
>> Somebody felt they thought they were doing the right thing and facebook did the right thing by apologizing. It's a shame it did happen. 
>> Jon: Let's transition to the election. Election comes tuesday. According to the latest fox news poll, economic issues are most important to voters. Based on the fox news poll, likely voters believe that governor romney will do the best job to fix those issues. "Washington post" abc news poll americans think governor romney is best suited for fixing the economy. Are those concerns and capabilities reflected in the media coverage of this race? Alan, let's start with you. 

[00:44:48]


>> Why don't you started with me. I think it has been reflected. We keep hearing economy and economy and romney is a business guy and he ran this bain capital and he was a job creator which he really wasn't. We've heard in the media all along. I know there is paranoia that the left wing media is in the tank for obama and never tells the truth about romney. Romney, I don't know what he stands for but I could understand why those polls b around the media narrative. 
>> All those folks that work at staples, their jobs were not created by mitt romney? 
>> Mitt romney was a flipper. He was a venture capitalist. He would buy companies and get rid of them. 
>> Media's focus on the economy led the washington post to do a huge article on the alleged bullying in 1965 while ignoring president obama's policies he wrote about himself. The laser focus has him. 
>> "New york times" writing a whole piece on women binders. 
>> I haven't heard anything but about the economy. 
>> Mitt romney holding a gay down and cutting off his hair. 
>> Because it was 30 years ago or 50 years ago. 
>> And bring up making fun of a blind teacher and having him walk in door and thinking that was funny. 
>> The economic issues are front and center on friday we got another jobs report. The unemployment rate ticked up to 7.9%. If the labor force participation rate were the same as it was four years ago it would be closer to 10%. Are the media paying attention. I think it is job numbers. They definitely are paying attention. 
>> Lately the economic numbers have been going for the president. You have been reading that and seeing tt on the air. That also contradicts the theme of the romney campaign which is governor romney is better able to deal with our economic problems than the president. 

[00:47:02]


>> If this low job growth were s good news, we're in trouble. It might be better than we experienced but we are still at anemic growth. We're not creating as many jobs as the birth rate. 
>> It's the coverage. If this were the bush economy and I think dan gainer had a piece on this. When the unemployment was 5% under bush it was depression and 8% and things at an, things are getting better. 
>> Jon: Talk aut covering the coverage, pew did a story of the coverage from august 27th to OCTOBER 21st. 71% of nbc's coverage of the romney's campaign, 3% was positive. Fox news coverage of the obama campaign during the same period came in at 46% negative with 6 am positive. So the negative to positive ratio was 23 to 1 and fox news was 8 to 1. 
>> Which candidate was more FODDER FOR THE MEDIA. New pink lemonade 5-hour ENERGY? 5-hour ENERGY supports the avon Foundation for Women Breast Cancer Crusade.

>> Jon: A study released for media and public affairs, since the con vehicles in september. Jay leno, fallon and kimmel have more jokes about romney than all the other candidates combined. Governor romney was the target of 148 jokes. David letterman, 290 jokes made about republicans including arnold schwarzenegger, paul lieian and chris christie, 138 about democrats. Only two others were the top ten bill clinton and joe biden. Do you have an explanation. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> the romney jokesrite themselves. Thank you, good night. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> I think look, it's media bias. I remember saturday night live, when chevy chase doing gerald ford I think that made a difference in the nation. Humor does that. 
>> Ford was a football player and a skier, downhill skier, most athletic president was portrayed as a bunglar that could hardly walk. 
>> You can't changes the numbers but I would like to point out that jon stewart and steven col bevtd who demographic skew is a little bit younger but very good about making fun of both candidates. Pretty equally. 
>> The excuse is the writers live in los angeles and new york city. They are part of those communities. They are the two most liberal cities in the united states. 
>> When clinton it was president it was about monica lewinsky. 
>> Bu except mitt romney is not president. It happened four years before romney was running. 

[00:53:41]


>> Take a random example, joe biden is good source but he doesn't get the attention that ford or reagan. 
>> Would you say biden was biggest targets. 
>> Among democrats. 
>> Jon: Do people take these impressions of the late night comedians they make? 
>> I think they must, why would president obama spend so much time on those shows. 
>> He spent more time talking to jay len than he has talking to the press. 
>> Romney has done no national press two weeks before the election. 
>> Except us weekly and rolling stone. 
>> If he knew he would get coverage he would do it, too. 
>> Where is romney. 
>> Obama is all over the place. 
>> The president hasn't had a press conference or press corps at the white house in months. President of the united states is not answering questions on benghazi. 
>> Obama is in charge of our middle policy, for example. We'll see what happens if romney wins but we know for sure obama does not want to answer any questions, anything about libya. 
>> Jon: Next on news watch comparing the tv shows you watch to the presidential candidates t watch and create a next-gen s.U.V.

Direction.

>> The final sprint to the white house. Hitting key swing states before the election day. Latest polls show these men locked in a dead heat. Fox report on the intense push to win points.

At one point they were in debuke,t we'll check in on team obama in a moment and begin with governor romney stopping in new hampshire and iowa. And at this hour colorado to make sure supporters are fired up. The choice between the last four years and a different path. 
>> The same path means 20 trillion in debt and crippling unemployment and stagnant wage owth. We have to change course because unless we do we'll look at another recession. Do you want more of the same or real change? 

[00:02:05]


>> Chief political corpondant carl cameron on the move with the romney campaign. He used the president's own rhetoric against him. That's right,s, since yesterday when he had 20,000 people or more in a major rally in ohio, mr. Romney is using president obama's own rhetoric about voting against him. The president suggested that his supporters should vote for revenge mitt romney in colcalifornia spring and dubuque threw that back at the president. 
>> Today president obama it was yesterday, you probably heard about he asked supporters to vote for revenge. I ask the american people to vote for love of country. >>Romny -- mr. Romney said that over and over and over again in an attempt to cast mr. Obama and his presidency as one of division and suggest he will unite the country and reach across the aisle in a bipartisan way. The romney complaint is that president obama made promiseless of hope and change and couldn't deliver. He couldn't because of grid lock that he caused. He simply doesn't have an administration to get things done. 
>> Analyst said it is it like a courtroom where attorneys make the closing arguments. It is getting last, but we are hearing new lineups. That's right. And when you have the campaigns packing their calendars as busy as they have in 73 hours and change. Every change of rhetoric balk becomes significant and today governor romney made the argument over the four years of obama era, the country's confidence and attitude of americans are degraded by ongoing great recession and conflict in washington and inability to find political resolution . Mr. Romney is promising restored confid. 

[00:04:33]


>> Three more days . More days we can get to work rebuilding our country. And our confidence becomes resphored and our conviction is stronger and confidence that we are on a solid path of steady improvement and college graduates coming out of school and getting good jobs and confidence that single moms working two jobs will have a job and better shot. November 6th, tuesday, we come together for a better future and november 7th we will go to work.

He jabbed governor romney's plans for the white house. 
>> Governor romney, now is a very talented salsman, and so in this campaign he's trying hard as he can to repackage the same old ideas that didn't work and offer them up as change. 
>> Chief white hou correspondant ed henry is in dubuque, they have met both candidates today. 

[00:06:41]


>> And that's right. It gives you the outside influence of iowa here. Romney came here to a small town in a small state and the president just wrapped up his rally and trying to turn out the vote. Only six electoral votes in this state and you an idea how in the top of the ticket. They are fighting for every electorial vote each one has to get to 270 and a state like iowa could change. But the president realizes in 2008 it started here in iowa as the change agent and the new flavor and now incumbent and romney is saying he change trying to knock the president out. And the president trying to stease - seize the mantel back. If he can win iowa and ohio in the midwest and he will be hitting all weekend, they believe he can build a midwestern fire wall that will prevent romney from getting to 270 electoral votes. 
>> A few moments ago. We could see this is it a relatively small one and what kinds of crowds is it the president drawing in the last couple of days? 
>> It is it 5,000 people in fairness dubuque. And in the last top in milwaukee he had 20,000. And showing enthusiasm in wisconsin and the democrats hoped to locked down and they have not because paul ryan is on the republican ticket. In the milwaukee, he had katie pery and that turned out to get a bigger crowd this weekend, he will do that to bring out stevey wonder and jay z and hollywood celebrities andrs and et cetera to make sure he can build the crowds and show enthusiam.

>> The governor knows how to put things said paper ballots will be made available in poling stations that do not have electricity. Storm is forcing other to handle the voting challenges after the storm on the list. Washington dc and north carolina, we'll keep you post. Recovery from sandy is a slow one from people in the northeast and power is finally coming back on for some. A long way to g.

Staten island hardest hit and in addition to the physical recovery there is an emotional recovery. We talk tod rob who lived 200 yards from the ocean. His home was badly damaged and he lived here 11 years and he described to me behatook place in the height of the storm, even though five days ago, he was brought to they're tears.

>> New concerns about potential voters registration fraud in arguably the most critical of all swing states, ohio. The field works is accused of happeneding in new voters registration as some plagas fraudulent. Eric shawn has more on this. It was something obvious to tip them off? 
>> Really so. They looked at the list of 200 names that waslaged as potentially fraud lept and one stood out. That name. Adalve hitler 666 hells street, believe it or not. It was submitted to the hamimenton county board of election and they went through it and what they believe is forgeries and fraudulent names and dupplicates. It was first plaged by cum tired to collect them. Field works it is a washington dc van vassing. It is for progressive causes chairman of the republican party that is a member of the county's voters election. Said that damages our democracy. 

[00:18:10]


>> Any person that would engauge in that is serious to our democracy voting is highly irresponsible and potentially criminal. 
>> Just last month here in ohio, this man pled not guilty and 28 year old field worker tim zirick. Harris, his plea not guilty by reason of insanity. As for the other case, those names were referred to the prosecutor in cincinnati. 
>> Thank you, at ing on the store tore for us. And harris. Let me, are you still there?

>> New information on the deadly attack in benghazi, lib yampt fooks news reviewed a classified diplomatic cable that shows the state department was warned about security concerns in libya. That came one before before the attack that killed embassy stevens. That cable shows the security situation was so bad they were talking about suspending concerns they are calling on a creation of a congressional committee to investigate up the events that led up to the mores of four americans. What are the chances of the committee coming together. 
>> It would take bipartisan support. They are in the minority part in the city. Senator mccane hopes that they will put pressure on law makers top convene this committee. In part, we believe that the complexity and gravity of the warrants the establishment of a committee that conducts a interview of the national security involved. It is a select committee. It is more investigative power than a regular committee. 
>> People watching this store store may be wondering. Now the obama team is asking for patience on the libya investigation. Republicans are short on patience, what can you tell us? Senator graham said there is a reason why the obama administration is not providing more details and answers on the libya attack. 
>> They don't want the truth to come out about benghazi, libya because if it comes out and crystal clear to the american people. It would show a failure of leadership by president obama. 

[00:25:40]


>> The obama campaign said they want to wait until the review board 99s the investigation before making assessment about the attack. The president is clear and our record showed it and as information became available we made it available to the american people it is it a tragedy and it is not time for politicizing the tragedy. 
>> The state department reports that it will be finished in december. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> It is it an all out sprint to election day. Governor romney can vancing the state that could decoid the winner. Nominees are pulling out stop to sway undecided voters.

[00:30:19]


>> I am harris faulkner and this is the fox reportment it is the bottom of the hour. Time for the news. President obama and governor romney hard at work. Both men trying to lay claim to the swing state that will decide the winner. That is 72 hours from now. We'll see the polls close. We are entering those hours now for his own take is anchor of special report bret baier. 
>> We are all working together as we move ahead for tuesday. 
>> Hard to believe that we are finally here. 
>> We don't see surprises coming from the president and the stump speeches. But something from president obama is really getting a lot of reaction in the last 24 hours . People are wondering if it was written or ad-lib. 
>> At the time the republican congress and senate candidate by the name of romney. No, no. No. Don't boo, vote. Vote. Vote is the best revenge. 
>> The president said something you may have heard by now that surprised a lot of people. Voting is the best revenge. He told supporters voting for revenge. Vote for revenge? Let me actul what I would like to tell you. Vote for love of country. 
>> And now obviously you are already seeing response from governor romney. He responded again. What did the president mean for the revenge line. 
>> He was responding to commercials that are run in ohio, and saying that the romney campaign is saying things that are not true and that's what he was saying and saying that people need to get out and express themselves with their vote. The romney campaign is saying in the final days, they want to focus on optimism and positivivity and focus on closing with a positive message. They used that line today that romney used on the stump in an ad already the fact they turned that around that quickly. They show you a powerful closing message for them. 

[00:32:41]


>> I likened it earlier to a closing argument in the courtroom x. Both sides put that off. And what 10s to resonate with voters at that point. 
>> That defends. Sometimes you think that people think that big ticket upon items and big ideas and the romney campaign is it thinking that the electorate is right focused on the economy. And that all of this is it about the pocket book and all of it is what poem feel about the economy and how they look about the next four years and about the next, how, how the next four years will go and working with the other party. If you listen to governor romney he talks about bipartisanship and working with democrats and that is coming across in the final 24 hours. 
>> Stow much criticism for the current president for not doing that. And not enough reaching across the aisle. And you would think that the next person who would take office would do a better job and do it differently. Talking about focusing on the economy. Karl rove said today in an article or interview with washington post. He feels super storm hurricane sandy may have taken them off message. 
>> Karl doesn't say that unless the numbers prove it out. Karl is a numbers guy. He's looking at numbers some place that have stalled for the romney campaign. 
>> Do we know which he's look at. 
>> He made a bold prediction for the romny. Three or four points and i think that he's scaled back on that a little bit. He's still predicting a romny win but say that will be short of three or four points and i think you are looking at something that hurricane sandy stalled that momentum a bit. What that means in karl's mind, we'll have to ask him on tuesday night. 

[00:34:52]


>> It is it a coupem of days now. Besides the presidential race, what are the hotly contested races. We'll look at senate and house races. There are a couple to pay attention tompt >> there are a lot of senate races that are hot race to watch. Kane/alen race that is tight and it will decide the presidential race, it is it neck and neck george allen and tim kanehow the presidential race plays decide how it will play out. And in indiana, it should have been a republican win. Murdoch race with joe donley, the democrat. It could go either way. Right now the polls are very close and this one,ou know, the senate balance of power could hang inne o these races. 
>> I want to go back to the presidential race before I let you g. You pointed out states and made me think of pennsylvania and how that is in play. You talked about indiana going red. And many people thought it would go blue for the democrats and what has changed on the ground in the spring states. 
>> Enthusasm seems to go toward the republicans in some of the places. Pennsylvania, republicans tell a store store how enthusiasm changed odds of the suburbs of milwaukee. It is it still a democratic place. If you talk to analyst it is it a place where it is charlie and the public. And republicans come in and the public is it pulled away. And the it is congress. It seems that pennsylvania is stull in the game pennsylvania and minnesota and michigan possibly. They are possibly inlet game. 

[00:36:53]


>> Yeah, you saw former president clinton in minnesota. Filmthey say maybe they are worried about that for the president. 
>> Yes, where the campaigns are going and where they spend money. It is not just a head fake. It is usually defense. We know that in ohio. But something that makes him so a trend. 
>> If we see florida that is tight, and that will b a sign. Virginia closes at 7:00. If that is going, I think we should see how the race is shaping up on tuesday night by seveno'clock. 
>> That is early. 
>> But that will tell us how the rest of the night is starting to shape up. It could be a late, late night on tuesday and into wednesday morning. 
>> That's what I am hearing 
THE ANALYST >> Brian: >> I closed my show, when I go back to dc, I will know who the president will be. I should have said I should know who the president should be. 
>> Unless you delay your trip home. 
>> And we would love to have you. 
>> Thank you for stopping by. 
>> Ahead of tuesday, remember to tune in texas american special hosted by megan kelly and bret baier. We look forward to that. And now we want to go live to the swing state of ohio which I talk tod bret about. The intense ground game both are playing to get out the vote eric shawn told us fresh concerns about voters fraud. As you know, no republican ever won the white house without winning ohio. Steve drown is live in the north central stave mansfield. Steve, is it a begin that president obama will have a lead going election day there? 

[00:39:03]


>> Everyone I talked to both sides of the fence, obama should win the early vote. But how much? The obama campaign made early voting a strategy all over the country to get early votes in. If there is a couple of real good reasons why. Early vots don't. Once they are cast, there can't be convincing of that vote. And it shrinks the universe of votes that you are talking. You can concentrate them on the votes and every campaign event in ohio mentions early voting and in every speech without fail. 
>> Approximate no matter what you look like or started out. You can achieve the american dream. That's what we are fighting for. That's why I need your vote. And if you are willing to knock on doors with me and make phone calls with me early vote for me. And turn around on tuesday for me. We'll win ohio. 
>> Early voting continues for four hours and monday for another six and half time, with the second half coming up on election day. Harris. 
>> Early voting and the advantage you are talk being with the president and more or less four years ago in 2008? 
>> It is looking like less. Ap did an analysis 23 percent of run. And 29 percent are democrats and fren percent on the unaffiliated. They don't reg 
mr.2: Er by party here and they guess you participate in the primeras. And the republicans know that ohio has the early vote ther also out there trying to prompt supporters to go after the coaxable voters . Everybody we knew who voted for obama four years ago because of hope and change and now know it didn't happen. Let's make sure we did everything in our power to convince them to go to the polls to vote and look back as a time we got our country on the right track. 

[00:41:27]


>> Conditions believe that the ace in their pocket is election day. They will win election day. Emphasis to try to blun the early vote and win election day and when ohio, and maybe win the white house. 
>> Can you believe 7:42 on the east coast, we'll see polls close. Steve brown is almost here. Good to see you. 
>> Thank you. 
>> And in another battle ground state. People coming out in droves and. Look at it is it the final day of early voting here. Long lines leading to waits in cases for hours. No one getting out of line and calls to extend the dead line because there are more people in line part of one neighborhood reduce tod charred rubble in hurricane hurricane sandy. 
>> We are in the scene of the heartbreaking devastation. 
>> In breezy point, new york. When a congressman becomes a constitient and loses it all, are sandy victims getting the help they need? If not why not? New york congressman bob turner and his own s coming up. ignore savings, not in this economy. We also have zero free time, and my dad moving in. So we went to fidelity.

History. It h families have laos loved one, entires communities have been wiped away. Today I ask everyone to keep them in your prayers. 
>> This was truly a crisis, and this is one of the worst storms that has hit this metropolitan area in generations. So, it really is a situation that requires patience and requires the spring the resilience that new yorkers are famous for. 
>> I want the people of new jersey to know that we have a LONG ROAD AHEAD OF US TO GETt% Over the storm. And -- but it doesn't mean that we have to do it alone. We work on it together. 
>> This is a fox news alert, I'm her -- geraldo rivera recording. The northeast, storm of the century, hurricane sandy, and the savage weather systems that conspired with sandy to create the monster frankenstorm that killed well over 100 americans, 40 of them in new york city. And while an army of federal, state, and local workers, and many volunteers, have joined t massive relief and recovery effort, 2-1/2 million remain without power, four days after losing it monday evening. Tens of thousands are displaced. Their homes broken or destroyed. 5500 remain in new york city shelters. Gaslines stretch for hours and tempers flair. And as life returns to normal for many millions, from north carolina to maine, with folks living in the most severely area, on the new jersey shore, or the new york city burrows of brooklyn, queens and stat ten island, it's doubtful the scars will ever fully heal. The shocking loss of life in and around the nation's largest and commercially most important city. The epic extent and depth of the damage. And the struggle to find essentials like food, water, power, shelter, continue to preoccupy and stress out millions who thought that katrina could never happen here. But it has happened. And as they pump the tunnels and open the subways, iconic landmarks are twisted and broken, and still we find bodies, and revise upward the count of the dead. And now frustration and fear of the future haunt many, as homeowners scramble to salvage whatever is left and ask when the pain and suffering will stop. And to the long gaslines and impassable roads, broken infrastructure, and lost hours of work and schools, add this weather alert. To those living without power in those houses comes word that the temperatures are cooling. DOWN TO THE LOW 30s FOR Tonight, and for the next several nights. And much worse than the cold. Another nor easter, another wet and windy storm this way comes. 

[00:03:00]


>> And bad weather, ladies and gentlemen, the last thing the battered burrough of stat ten eileen need. Let's fine out what else mother now has in store. Meteorologist justin poric, what's going on? 
>> Well, geraldo, this is the last thing that residents of in the northeast want to think abt, a potential storm. This will not be sandy. Will not be a big ball of wind encompassing hundreds and thousands of miles in span. But it is a storm system. If sandy was not on the plate last week, this would be your typical nor'easter but the circumstances for the northeast have changed. We have seen huge impacts as the storm system initiates, it will be off the coast. Some change in track. We could see variation. All the parameters have not come together and we still have energy that has yet to come into the united states of america. So we're still looking at 72 to 96 hours' worth of time before we get into the meat of the storm situation. As we go ahead into tuesday and wednesday, worst-case scenario, the storm system hugs the coast and we see a storm surge of two to four feet along the jersey coastline. With the inundation of storm surge and we have lost a lot of our sand dunes and this wi be a huge threat. Winds on the order of 40-50 miles-per-hour possible, and gusts -- the storm system will not come from the southeast, so a huge threat here as we go into wednesday and thursday, election day we'll be clear. Over the southeast, showers and thunderstorms. Geraldo? 
>> Justin poe ovic, thank you very much. Just the news we needed. With the dead still being discovered here and the living really joust coming to grips with all they lost, the outside world is trying to alleviate the pain and ease some of the suffering. This is a heartwarming scene on this frigid night behind me here, volunteers who have come together, really, these aren't fema people. These aren't state or local people. These are volunteers, people from stat ten -- staten island and the surrounding boroughs. This is michael grille. 

[00:05:42]


>> If there's enough back-slapping and glad-handing to do it's these volunteers. They're unbelievable. In spite of everything. I do mean that. Unfortunately, in spite of the government, this community has come together like you can never imagine. 250 volunteers in tottenville went basement to basement, cleaned people's stuff out and just unbelievable things. Organizing crews to take elderly people's sheet rock out so they don't get mold. All citizen volunteers. I'm so proud of my community. It's just amazing. 
>> Is it true they're still finding bodies? 
>> Unfortunately, yes. And this is what I was afraid of. Self days ago I said, based on my experience, you're going to have those that neighbors thought they evacuated, neighbors thought they were rescued, and you get that elderly couple that doesn't make it out, and no one knows it until, unfortunately, you start going door-to-door. The waters have subsided, and whether it's the fire department or building department, someone has to get in to certify whether the house is structurally sound or not and you find bodies, and the number is going to go up. 
>> Tell me what you think. We have seen this heart-warming scene. Keny, they're giving out food. They're sorting it. Donations of food and clothing items coming in from really everywhere. How do you think -- like people marks how have they done? How he these other agencies -- fema, mention their name and people wrinkle their nose. 
>> I think everyone here has the greatest of intentions, but organization has been lacking from the beginning, and there is support. Fema comes in to support. Unfortunately I think expectations of what fema does put them at an unfair advantage. They say, fema is here, w're safe. We're going to be able to deal with this. Then they come give you an 8 hundred number. They want to do the most they can but community relations people can't toouch for you other than answer questions and give you an 800 number. 

[00:07:49]


>> It's amazing. I get that. There are a lot of people who can't get out or their homes homes and these volunteers, these citizen volunteers, whatever the failing of the government agencies, fema or the rest, these are people who are really doing the lord's work and knocking on the door, grandma, are you okay? Grandma, are you hungry? I've seep it with my own eyes. 
>> It's unbelievable. That's why the local official comes in. A local councilman organized volunteers. I was in several different areas organizing small groups, going door-to-door, making sure people have food. If they need medical attention, their medication, whatever they need, we make sure they're going to get. 
>> Now, who are you and tell me your story. 
>> My name is de s-h-h-h a and this is my mother. We come down here from midland, and we got hit really, really bad. My house is flooded with over nine, ten feet of water, and everything that we had, all our belongings are gone. And right now my siblings and i and my father are -- mother and I are separated. So we're struggling to find a place to be to be together and to have clothes and have all this food and all this stuff given to us is -- it means a lot to us. Means a lot to our community. So many people on our block, down the block from us, who are devastated. Lived there for 30 years. Don't know what to make of it. It's horrendous. 
>> What are you going to do, mom? 
>> I don't know. 
>> So sorry. 
>> That's a big part of what my team was doing today. We're going to help find -- that's where fema is very help. We appreciate all they're trying to do. Someone like this, displaced, we need to get them into an apartment as soon as possible. We d.

>> It's over four feet deep. We're lucky to make it out. 
>> The first time we have been able to walk through the streets, and it is just -- this my home. This is my home. And I see things like this and walk by people's houses and they're filled with mud and diesel and everything else imaginable. This is our home. 
>> My dad was laying on the couch. 
>> What happened with your brother and sister? 
>> I saw everything go away, and I saw my sister and my brother cry and my mom cry, and when i saw the tears in my dad's eyes, I knew there was a problem. 
>> What do you remember? What's your name? 
>> Joseph. 
>> How old are you? 
>> Seven. 
>> I have a seven-year-old, too. She was squared, too. What happened in your house? 
>> Well, we were just sitting down, watching tv, when my mom went outside and there was a big wave coming. We didn't know what to do. So we were looking, and then they got so high, it went in and out of our house. We were in our attic for 13 hours. They had -- the water was so high, they had to come and rescue us on a boat. I didn't know what has happening, so I was really scared. 
>> How do you feel now? Do you need stuff? What do you need? Do you have anything left? 
>> A house. 
>> What? 
>> We need a house. There's nothing left of it. 
>> Three cars floated away. 
>> So sorry. I really am so sorry. You know, we'll tell more of these sad stories and also t about -- are you getting help? 
>> Yeah, we are. My parents are doing their best to find shelter. We're staying with me grandma right now? 
>> Thank god for that. 
>> We were going shopping for fruit -- 

[00:15:31]


>> family fod. 
>> They saw us -- they're giving us food and stuff. This guy came up to us, and wants to give us money. He wants to give money to my mom. And my mom started crying because -- hysterically. 
>> Okay. What a brave young man, and his sister. Really. 
>> Thanks to -- we're on the battered bur borough. To stars like bruce springsteen and jon bon jovi we have a better idea of the absolute enorm of losses of the jersey shoreslandmarks, and that's where what's left of hold board walk, and asbury park, new jersey, and congressmann palone, thank you for being with us. Can you -- I don't know. Can you in a -- 
>> thank you. 
>> Can you give us an idea how bad it is? 
>> It's very bad. I mean, you know the bay shore area, union beach, highland, those towns along the bay shore are really hit hard. And so many people are displaced. We're trying to get as much as we can into them, though. I think in the last couple days, fema and the red cross and the other agencies have come through and there's been a lot of volunteer donations as well. So, a lot is coming to the people now. But there's just so many scenes of destruction. We're here in asbury park now, and as you can see, the convention hall behind us is still pretty good. But a lot of the boardwalk is damaged and the pavilions, but I've been focusing on the people that have been displaced, and trying to get them food and clothing and shelter. 
>> And that is -- in terms of dealing with that emergency, congressman, how are you fairing? 

[00:17:40]


>> Well, it's been good. I mean, just -- I was listening to what you were saying to my colleague, and the fact is that the community has really come together. Today in a place across from staten island we had a community cleanup that went really well. Hundreds of students doing the cleanup. I went to keensburg tonight, and I never saw such an outpouring. Clothes and toad being donated. So people are getting food and clothing and temporary shelter, but the next phase, of course, a lot of people need temporary housing. In other words they can't go back to their homes. In a place like highland, probably the majority of the homes have been undermined in some way and people just can't go back, and we have towns where the people aren't allowed to go back for at least another week. So there's a humanitarian crisis but we're addressing it right now. Over the next few weeks we'll need a lot of things from people half. For example, we need building inspectors -- 
>> congressman, let me put that as pause and take a break. I have to take a break. And we have that satellite delay, but I'll take the break. I want to talk more with congressman frank pallone, and michael grimm here on staten island, and talk about the other bur -- boroughs. Many of the lights are on up and down broadway, but out here in staten island, the stricken areas in queens, and th much of jersey, many peoe's lives are really being hurt, really badly.

>> 22 years I'm at my home, and I lost it. 
>> I don't have anything -- anywhere to go. I adopt have no clothes, all the clothes I have on, they gave to me at the evacuation center. 
>> We feel lucky we left monday. We feel so lucky. And my friends convinced m we were actually going to stay, and now knowing how bad it was and how high the water was and there was a fire next door, it would have been crazy. We feel very lucky, actually. 
>> On a cold and wind night in staten island, there's an army of volunteers trying to get the generosity of millions of you al into the hands of the tens of thousands who have literally lost everything. Speaking with congressman frank pallon in asbury park. You're saying the next phase of this recovery and relief effort has to be getting people in temporary housing. What else do we need? 
>> Well, one of the things we have to find out is whether or not the houses they live in are habitable, for example, when i was in keensburg tonight they need building inspectors because they have to find out if the foundations and the as of the homes are safe enough for people to go back. There's so many things like that. Of course residents still have no power, and that's the immediate problem, lack of power. If power came back, a lot of people would be able to stay and feel more comfortable, but we need temporary housing. Over the next few months, and the people that can't go back to their homes, and I've been trying to see if we can get trailers, if we can find, for example, what monmouth baracks can be used. We're looking at these different possibilities because there are thousands of people with no place to go. 
>> Congressman frank pallone. Congressman grimm you have a ware shouse you want to mention. 

[00:24:53]


>> Absolutely. We're realizing things are coming from all over the country and we can't leave it outdoors. It's not sorted so at 300 western avenue, new york container terminal, 12:00 tomorrow afternoon, we'll be opening up the warehouse. It will be fully staffed and be able to keep everything dry, organized, sorted out, and be able to distribute from there as well. 
>> You're a combat veteran and this is war. 
>> No doubt. And let me tell you something. We have to not only get people in their homes we got to get power on. Still areas don't have power and he definitely, definitely, definitely, have to remember we did lose lives here. We have to keep the families that are grieving in our prayers because we lost 22 and probably more, and they're going through hell. They really are. 22 just on staten island. 
>> Just on staten island. 42 citywide, well over 100 nationwide, coming up, j.R. Martinez, you remember him from "dancing with the stars." He was going to run in the marathon.

>>> Live in america's news headquarters, I'm lauren green. It's down the wire for president barack obama and mitt romney. With only three days left before the presidential election, both candidates are blitzing the crucial swing stes. Eight events in six states now. 
>> Gnor romney is a very talented salesman, so in this campaign he's trying as hard as he can to repackage the same old ideas that didn't work and offer them up as change. 
>> The question of this election comes down to this. Do you want more of the same or do you want real change? 
>> And a quick reminder, set your clocks back one hour before you go to bed tonight. Standard time kicks in at 2:00 a.M. So enjoy the extra hour of sleep. Now back to "geraldo at large." 
>> Explain what happened between early friday when the marathon was on and later friday when it was cancelled. 
>> What simply happened was that it became a source of dissense and we don't need that right now. And hefully next year we'll have a great event where people can come to the city and enjoy what the city has to offer and compete and participate, and the spirit of the race is to bring people together. When it became a divisive issue, I just made the decision that it should not go on. 
>> Thank god he cancelled the marathon. You know why? It's not fair. You have people in staten island whose homes are flooded out. 
>> If the bridge is cleared and the streets are clear, I don't think it will wreak anymore havoc. 
>> Part of me is very disappoint but totally understand what and why. It was really kind of a -- wondering if we should be here to begin with. Now that we're here, would have loved to have this announcement happen a couple days ago when it would have made more sense. 

[00:31:44]


>> Do you think that the marathon should have been run or was it good it was cancelled? The marathon? 
>> Cancel, cancel. 
>> Tell us why. 
>> Because new yorkers need it. And the people who come here for one week, for the marathon? Let them stay an extra week. Put their money into new york city and let new york city take care of its own. 
>> Want to talk to all of you al. But let me first -- craig, spoke to j.R. Martinez, the guy who won "dancing with the stars" last year. Well, he was going to run in that marathon, and he talked now to j.-Martinez, and about the mayor who marrily makes a misstep. Mayor bloomberg but got plenty of heat. Here's craig. 
>> Some people said you shouldn't run the marathon. There's an awful lot of small businesses that depend on these people. 
>> As thousands suffered without heat and electricity, new york city mayor michael bloomberg defied criticism to allow the 434th new york city marathon to go on, despite a backdrop of devastation. Bloomberg is pulling the cops off for the marathon which the rest of us don't understand why. 
>> We have communities in need, and to turn around and show disrespect, like running a marathon, this is the reality of what's going on in new york city right now. 
>> The mayor finally releapt but not before the new york post-published pictures of marathon generators with the power to run 400 homes sitting idle as storm victims went without. The mayor said, quote, we cannot allow a controversy over an athletic event even one as meaningful as this to distract attention from the critically important work being done to recover from the storm and get our city back on track. And well he should have. 

[00:33:45]


>> What you guys looking for? 
>> Anything. Anything. She wants anything. That's our daughter and her husband. 
>> Digging through the trash and debris, trying to find any remnant, jewelry, anything piled up like trash, people say this is new york's katrina. They really weren't kidding. 
>> Nearly half the fatilities from hurricane sandy happened on staten island. With near total devastation in some neighborhoods, residents could not begin to understand how the 43rd running of the marathon would still go on. 
>> Found our dad's wallet. 
>> You dad passed away? 
>> Yeah, he perished in the home with my sister. 
>> That's pretty devastating. 
>> New york city councilman. 
>> I appreciate the resiliency and new york city, but people can run 26 miles on another day. Right now we're on bended knee. 
>> The decision was not easy. With 330 million viewers, the race brings in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue to new york city. 
>> After the 9/11 attack in 2001, then new york city mayor rudy giuliani went ahead with the race, despite criticism. For the first anytime 43 years, runners will not be making their way through new york's five boroughs. Wounded warrior j.R. Martinez would have been one of the runners. 
>> I looked at new york city are. This is a city that picks it up and says we have to move forward and we have to continue to remind people that this is one of the greatest cities on the earth. 
>> But having gone through hell and high water, residents near staten island are thinking survival rather than triumph of spirit. 
>> I know there's a lot of plans and a lot of things involved, but there's people here that lost their lives. 
>> We are in desperate need. These are people's lives. Everything we're picking up here, it's not debris. It's remnants of people's lives. 

[00:35:47]


>> You think those 47,000 people who came for the marathon can turn it around or come here to help you? 
>> That would be the ideal. Not only me but so many people in need. 
>> While some runners pledged to help. J.R. Martinez feels new yorkers will also come out stronger as they overcome yet another difficult challenge. 
>> Is there a parallel between -- you have your obvious scars, your personality shines through. You're an incredible person and an inspiration. How does that transfer into this situation? 
>> Challenges are a good thing. Make a choice for yourself. Make a choice and commit yourself to saying I'm going to try to believe. I'm not going to quit and try to be as positive as I can can be and if you implement those things into your life you can do the two things I learned how to do adapt and overcome. 
>> All right. Craig, j.R. Was inspiring. Also disappointed. You've been here, though, -- enough about the marathon. Everybody agrees -- I was tremendously relieved. I was very angry when it was scheduled. I was tremendously relieved as these ladies were. What of all the vignette you have seen, what touched you the most? 
>> The area in tottenville, one family was completely wiped out. They decided to ride out the storm because during hurricane irene they left their home and their home was looted when they came back. So decided to ride it out. A 13-year-old girl was washed away with her dad and her mom, mom's critically injured, the father -- his body was just recently found so awful, awful scene. Terrible. 
>> That's awful. That's awful. I don't know what his problem is. 
>> All righ really, that was very rude. Very, very rude. Let me take a break. We'll be right back. ?????? like ?????? ?????? ooh baby, can I do for you today? ??????

[00:41:58]


>> Hoy -- how did you gather this amazing team of volunteers? 
>> The amazing team of volunteers gathered themselves as a result of anthony and all of these people. The community of staten island, they're an amazing group of condition, no hardship could ever keep them down. 
>> Where did you come from? 
>> From queens. 
>> From queens. Why on a cold night? 
>> We thought since this morning we prepared hot food and went to rockaway and came here and found this. It's like god brought us here. 
>> All from queens? 
>> Brooklyn. 
>> Where are you from? 
>> Staten island. 
>> Who are you. 
>> Anthony. 
>> What role? You're kind of a supervisor here. 
>> Me, ron and nick put everything together. We shipped out over 300 cars with food, water, and everything, and all the people got everything down into the -- 
>> kenny, show that stuff there. Where did this stuff come from? 
>> Donations all day long. Donations all day. We got skids of water on the other side. We've been getting clothes. The whole tank over there filled with clothes from donations. And we got two buses filled on the opposite side of us that are ready to go to the rockaways in the morning. So we got a lot of stuff here, and we're just trying to get it down to the people. 
>> This is an american red cross -- I'm sorry, your name? 
>> Patricia ballinger. 
>> You're work with the red cross. 
>> Just in town from denver just visiting, visiting on deployment. We have lots of people from out of up to helping out. 
>> What's the red cross doing big picture, regionwide? 
>> Well, disaster this size requires more than any one agency can handle. Citizens like this have to come together and help out. And he red cross, our role is we're focusing on feeding and outside new york city we're focusing on sheltering. Since this disaster started we have had over 72,000 overnight stays at red cross and community shelters, and we served 398,000 meals up and down the eastern seaboard. Today we were driving up and down the communities and all the five boroughs in new york. There was a woman I talked to who -- she burst into tears because she didn't think she could eat that day because she was out of gas, out of food, and couldn't get out to food. So just that hot meal was a nice little thing. So we're driving up and down to deliver the food. 

[00:44:35]


>> People want to donate cash to the red cross, how do they do at? 
>> You can go to red cross.Org or call 1-800-red cross and we sure do appreciate it. All these efforts aree possible by the volunteer spirit of everyday people. Over 4,000 people volunteering their time and the donations and generosity of everyday people. 1-800-red cross. 
>> Or redcross.Org. 
>> Congratulations on all you do. So, as a city man, how do you feel about this citizen outpouring of compassion and concern? 
>> This is what makes the city, and by them coming out here tonight, families -- some of them lost their homes, and they're here to help others. That shows you the spirit of new york city. That ex-emme identifies what -- exemplifies what this city is about and what these people are about. 
>> I noticed there was a girl here before that lost her home, and she is here. She is in her car getting warm. My goodness. Where is she going to stay tonight? 
>> Staying at herother's house and she's going through a lot. All her kids are staying with different people, and just -- I'm glad I have helped out. My husband is a detective. Been working every day for 14 to 16 hours and he is right here helping the community. 
>> Let's run the anna coyman did a piece. One of the most wide spread -- the shortage of gasoline. Here's a report. 
>> In new york and new jersey, lines for gas are absolutely insane. The crisis is crippling. Many stations have run out of fuel and those that do have gas, many of those don't have the power in order to pump it. During the height of the storm, the pipeline, refinery, shut down so production is low. Now in new jersey, governor chris christie has imposed an odd-even. 

[00:46:44]


>>> If you're license plate ends in an odd number you can get gas on an odd day. If it ends in an even number, you get gas on an even day. We reported tempers flairing at the pump. Fights breaking out over folks trying to cut in line. Here in new york, the governor, andrew cuomo, but together five emergency mobile fueling stations. This is one of them. Folks can come out here and get ten gallons of gas for free, but if you see behind me, it's miles and miles. It doesn't matter if you're walking, with a can, or if you rearview mirror got your car. We ran into one guy who has to push his car. He has been in line for four hours. 
>> What's going on, out of already? 
>> Yeah. I've been here since quarter to ten this morning. They said the truck was at 1:00. I decided to wait on line. I don't know what time it is now. But I've been here ever since. 
>> This is the light at the end of the tunnel. The oasis in the sun, the armory where national guardsmen are filling tanks. The man in charge, captain ryan abbott. How is everybody behavin this liven is two and a half miles long? 
>> They're quite civil today. Actually. We're quite happy to help everybody out. 
>> Ten goal -- ten gals of gas is not joust for vehicles, it's generators. 
>> People are coming in with jerry cans, gas cans, anything thatting can hold fuel in. I turn those away without the right container, and depending on the type of generator they have, should run the night if not two. 
>> Lounge -- how long do you plan to be here. 
>> We were cast seven to ten days. The current force, from syracuse, new york, we're looking to be here until the job is done-honestly. So that or else somebody comes to relieve us. 
>> Thank you so much and you're helping the people out so much. We tip our hats to you, captain abbott. Thank you. Back to you. 

[00:48:47]


>> Thank you very much. Crazy lines, though, later in the day formed. People wanting to take advantage of the free ten gallons of gas. The governor's office announced the ten gallons is going to the first responders first, but gas we're told by everybody is on the way. So, hopefully by tomorrow, the day after, at the latest, they can alleve yet that's very, very long line.

[00:53:48]


>> You made me feel good already. We know how the storm is affecting those who lived and died in its wake. There's also the financial toll. Let me go to professor peter maurice, professor at the university of maryland, well-known economics blogger. Professor, what's the total bill they figure right now -- I mean obviously you can't be precise -- in terms of what super storm sandy is going to cost the u.S. Economy. 
>> In the beginning $20 billion, now I'd say it's closer to 40 and probably looking at another $30 billion in lost commerce. The new york city economy is not functioning, nor is the broader away, people aren't earning a living so at it quite a bi toll. 
>> Probably talking about something close to 70, $80 billion, not as big as katrina but getting in that league. 
>> So, if it's in that range, professor, you're suggesting this is one of the most expensive storms in american history? 
>> Yeah. It's note the biggest. However, look at where it hit. Right smack into the financial center, and then I'm a native new yorker, well familiar with long beach, rockaway beach, long island, the shoreline of new jersey, spending summers there, and those places are vulnerable to this kind of storm, and they're not built for it, and we're seeing communities completely devastated and it's going to be a long process of rebuilding. 
>> Is there an economic stimulus impact, dr., From that activity? The rebuilding. 
>> Absolutely. It's kind of paradoxical. Although we're poor because we lost this property, we are going to get a boost to gdp because people will start spending money again they didn't spend this week, but all the rebuilding, we use lots of folks that are unemployed in the construction sector, and we'll use industrial capacity to make generators and what have you. Manufacturing capacity that is not adequately utilized right now. So it will be a stimulus. It's just like putting up a bridge. I it's not say we should knock down buildings in a hurricane to stimulate the economy. There are more constructive ways, but that wil happen over the next two years. 

[00:56:17]


>> So as new york rebuilds, as new jersey rebuilds, perhaps a meager silver lining, dr., Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, that's all we have time for on this cold and mel mel mel lan kole -- mellon collie but in a way inspiring night. The compassion and commitment of the volunteers should warm every heart. These folks are not republicans and democrats, not government employee, not first responders.

Day he threw by partisanship viciously attacked his opponent at three separate campaign events in the swing state of ohio. As usual he lied about governor romney's record about where he stands on issues and what a romney administration would mean for the middle class and women and every other voting group. These are desperate times for team obama. He is trailing in the polls and is being forced to spend resources in states that he won easily in 2008. As a result, the lying will no doubt continue into tuesday. What makes matters worse this just as temperatures begin to reach the freezing point in new york, new jersey, long island and connecticut over the weekend and famed families without food and power, electricity and heat compassionate leader will be campaigning alongside who else, bruce string seen, former are drug dealer j-zed former rapper who once shot his brother and uses the. In word. The rhetoric flowing from supporters even more disgraceful. Ohio governor ted strickland attacked governor romney for sending his campaign bus to deliver disaster relief supplies this week. Watch. 
>> And then there is mitt romney who tries to fake compassion by asking people to bring food to a rally and when they don't do it they take $5,000 and go out to wal-mart and by food to pass out to the people coming to the rally so that he can get his picture taken loading boxes on a truck. 
>> Sean: Excuse me, governor but he has given more money to charity than barack obama and that cheap skate joe biden combined. Faking compassion? I'm sorry are but the man who truly fakes compassion is the one that you are supporting in this race. President barack obama went to bed on september 11th this year without convening his national security team even as americans were being massacred in benghazi. President obama got up the morning on september 12 and went to vegas instead of focusing on a terrorist attack that killed the u.S. Ambassador and three other americans including two navy seals. It was president barack obama he was the one who met with the families of victims on september 14 and despite the fact that we now know he knew this was an act of terror he continued to blame about a video both before and after the somber home coming that you are seeing on your screen. Apparently not fell the truth and worrying about an election while americans is are suffering barack obama's ideas of real compassion. Unfortunately for residents tonight in new jersey, new york, connecticut and elsewhere, well, you don't live in swing states. If the main street media had any sem ambulance of courage they would be covering this like it was obama's katrina, which it is. The jobs report is up. We will check in with karl rove and look at predictions from others as the outcome of tuesday is now pretty much at hand. Joining me with reaction to all of this, radio talk show host willie billy cunningham. His radio show is heard nationally across the country on sunday nights. Sir, welcome back. Ju you are a great american. 

[00:03:30]


>> Sean hannity, how are you? 
>> Sean: After the photo op,. Billy cunningham where does president obama fly? To vegas. Meanwhile, it it is beginning to freeze in the northeast. People don't have heat, electricity. The gas stations that are open people are waiting six hours or long are to be able to get gas. He comes to town. He hugs chris christie, photo op and then heads off to vegas. Your reaction? 
>> I would say a few things. Number one, I think this is obam katrina in which he is showing a complete lack of compassion. I can recall a speech he gave in denver in front of 70,000 fans in which heid if you elect me the winds will stop blowing and the oceans will not rise. What happened to the anointed one and messiah who could control natural events. This dropped out of the friendly skies for a quick photo op and back into the friendly skies and out to las vegas where he said no one should ever go again raise money. I would say this right now to you, sean hannity, right now in butler county, the most critical county in ohio, 30,000 attended rallies wrapping up that carl cameron talked about two and a half, three hours ago which is the larg crowd. Let me give you a little bit of ohio perspective. Four years ago. 
>> Sean: I want to stay on this point and then I want your full analysis of ohio because you know ohio better than anybody. Let me show you how bad things are getting in the northeast. Besides the lines and devastation and suffering and cold weather and lack of electricity. Five days into this janet napolitano says well, we will get resources to you as soon as possible. If this was george bush the media would be screaming bloody murder. Listen to the people suffering in the northeast tonight. 
>> Fed up. Fed up. This line. That line. What are we? Is this america? 
>> We are here for you. And we will not forget. We will follow up to make sure that you get all of the help that you need until you have rebuilt. 

[00:05:36]


>> We have no food. 
>> People trapped in here still. 
>> We pledge to h help those whose lives have been turned upside down. 
>> Don't have anything, anywhere to go. I don't have no clothes. 
>> People here are still woing. Ey are still looking for people. It's craze. 
>> We look out for one another and we don't leave anybody behind. 
>> Nothing has been done here. 
>> Where are you going go? You have no gas and no nothing. 22 years in my home and i lost it. 
>> And you have people saying I'm going to die. I'm going to guy. I wish I had the audio but i don't. 
>> Sean hannity I would say that the same federal government that controls fema that can't preposition gasoline trucks near service station and PREPOSITION BOTTLES AND MREs Is the same federal government that wants to control your healthcare. If they can't hand out water bottles on time and properly how do they handle hip replacement surgery? We are watching the incompetentence of the federal government on display. 
>> Sean: You know ohio. I there was with you in 2000 and 2004 and 2006 you have predicted with pinpoint accuracy what has happened in that state. A month ago, maybe it was two months ago you told me barack obama was going to win, ohio. You said that things have now changed dramatically in the swing state of ohio. Where do you stand tonight, sir? 
>> Sean hannity, this state has flipped from the blue column not red column for three reasons. Number one, secretary of state john houston in columbus would tell you that there is 220,000 fewer he democratic votes in early voting and 30,000 more republican votes. That means there is a 250,000 vote flip which is the margin by which obama won ohio in 2008. Secondly, ohio is a republican state. 20 of the last 24 years we had republican governors. The legislature is overwhelmingly republican. Every elected member of the supreme court of ohio is republican. 75% of elected officials in 88 counties are republicans. And thirdly, by inpendent voting measures, 10% to 15% of independent voters in ohio are going to vote for mitt romney. And also the catholic church when I go to saint sin vent in kenwood in since is national the minister is telling us vote for religious freedom. Vote for the biblical definition of marriage. Vote for life. There is half a million catholics energized in south, ohio, to pull the lever for mitt romney. Mitt romney will win, ohio, and is going to win ohio easily. 

[00:08:20]


>> Sean: Wisconsin? 
>> Wisconsin will go for romney because what walker did and what ryan did made it possible for miomney to win wisconsin. Let's face it, tonight in westchester, 30,000 people came to butler county, ohio, the most important county and the most important state in the the union and last -- and the last cycle four years ago, we couldn't get 300 people to WATCH john McCain. 30,000 stood in a grass field to hear the words tonight of mitt romney and paul ryan and it was a turned on moment for this state. 
>> Sean: Billy cunningham you have never been block cincinnati. I'm taking it to the bank. You are a great american. God bless you. 
>> So are you. God bless america. 
>> Sean: Karl rove shares his predictions for tuesday's election. Unemployment numbers come in today and unemployment numbers rise yet again. How much more proof do you need that this president is not up to this job? 
>> A quick programming vote a live edition of hannity 9:00 eastern sunday night. used jobs. And I took on all the bigger, tougher ones. But with mr. Clean's new select-a-size magic eraser, he can take on any size job. At least we don't go near rex's mobile home as often. What are you, scared?

>>> He is saying he is the candidate of change. Now, now, don't boo vote. Vote. But let me tell you, colorado, we know what change looks like. We know what is going to help the middle class. We know what is going to grow jobs. We know what is going to reduce the deficit. 

[00:13:28]


>> Sean: Really? If you know he how to do all these things why haven't you done them the past four years? Is that the best you have got, mr. President? We see what your hopey changey thing brought us all. Today the unemployment rate rose yet again. Higher than when you took office four years ago and now stands at 7.9%. At this point in your presidency you predictd that by october of 2012 the unemployment rate would be, let's see, 5.2% at this stage. Earlier, congressman paul ryan talked about the long list of obama's broken promises. There is no end to it. Watch this. 
>>> Remember when said he would cut the deficit in half? I don't even have to follow up that one, do i? What we are seeing today is that 23 million americans are struggling to find work today. What we see today s that 15% of our fellow country men and women are living in poverty. This is the highest poverty rate in a generation. The economy is growing at less than half the rate the president said it would be growing at if only he could borrow a bunch of money and spend it on his cronies in the stimulus package. We are 9 million jobs short of what he said he would accomplish. 
>> Sean: The simple truth is the obama administration has done nothing to move this country forward, only backwards. And haar to respond to the president's chances on tuesday, his handling of the storm and much more, former alaska governor and fox news contributor sarah palin. Governor, this is simple for me. One in six americans in poverty. 6 trillion debt. 17 million, 17 million more americans on food stamps, bringing the total to 49 million. For every one job obama created 75 more people got on food stamps during his psidency and there is 25 million unemployed americans. Does that person deserve reelection? 

[00:15:28]


>> And don't forget our deflated currency and the oncoming inflation that will be a result of that. Sean, just a few examples that you gave in the previous minutes of your commentary certainly show that all of that hopey changey stuff of this obama administration straiks is isnding in a big messy loud bloody train wreck and four more days, it can't come soon enough. 
>> Sean: I agree with you. Why do I believe -- I wonder if hurricane sandy hit ohio or virginia harder or any of the important swing states president comes in and photo op, big hug with governor chris christie and patting each other on the back and a lot of we are all doing great and every politician's name is named, let's see, we have got four days, we he have no electricity for millions. We have one in three gas stations open. Six hour waiting lines. We haveot people suffering, freezing, starving. No water. No gas. Homes destroyed. And no government. You can't see any fema help here. Nothing. 
>> Well, it is quite a shame that, you know he, obama got what he wanted out of that and that was the photo ops with a republican governor so that he and the mainstream media could kind of fake that bipartisanship that in no way, shape or form does president obama represent. He is the most partisan president I think that we have ever had. So he got his photo ops out of that unfortunately because then he got to jet off and you know, here he goes again. 
>> Sean: Back to vegas. 
>> Party in vegas with jay-z and quite unfortunate because as you say, be sean, people are truly suffering and this isn't for politics and I think it is quite a shame that president obama chose to seize the opportunity along with the complicit lap dogs in the media to make it a political statement. 

[00:17:34]


>> Sean: I got to tell you something and when you hear people saying they are dying, when you hear people saying they have no food, when you hear people saying they are freezing, when you hear -- the president is just out campaigning. And the media in this country is so complicit, so wanting this guy to win it is unbelievable. What do you predict for tuesday night? What is your prediction? 
>> First, sean, the media is so corrupt that is what the bottom line is, the lamestream media. People through the example of the storm they cannot put their hope and their faith in government. They can't put their faith in some politician. They have to be self-sufficient and dependent on something greater than some politician in washington, d.C. That s a lesson learned in this. Tuesday night, you know, i think that many, many people across am who perhaps before wanted to put their hope and their faith in obama's false promises have awakened and we may be up late tuesday NIGHT AS SENATOR john McCain said earlier on a fox program, I agree with that. I do believe that enough americans have awakened and understand that it is time for a shift, a funmental transformation not of our country but a transformation of what we perhaps had previously believed in in the name of politics so we can get america back on the right drag. 
>> I notice even on your sweatshirt you have is an american flag. 
>> Amen. 
>> Thanks for being with us. A lot more coming up tonight. The architect karl rove is here. We will get his predictions and go swing state by swing state for tuesday night. Also lin yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?

>>> four more days! Four more days jet four more days! Four more days! Four more days! 
>> Thank you so much. You got that one right by the way. You got absolutely right. Four more days. 
>> Sean: As that rowdy romney crowd pointed out today, forget about four more years. We are four short days away from the most important election in your lifetime. Who better to ask for predictions, form resorb senior advisor, fox news contributor karl rove. I'm actually with you. I got this romney three points and with the backlash that is now evolving on the east coast, six hour lines, violence, electricitnd the president goes in for a photo op and janet napolitano says today oh, we'll get it there as soon as possible be, I think there is going to be a big backlash in the course of this weekend. Your reaction? 
>> Look, I think sandy helped him early on because it stopped the conversation about the election and turned it to this gigantic storm but I think you are right the images we are now starting to see coming out of new york the film of the woman on staten island confronting senator schumer, these are not good things to happen. While the state is are generally in charge of disaster relief, the president the advantage of having been there air early and the disadvantage of anything that happens. Fe distributed a very small number of generators and seems to think that it is going okay. 
>> Sean: I think the idea that the president comes in and photo ops and then just like in benghazi wham on a plane right off to vegas is not serving well because the people have not been served here. Literally one this three gas stations are closed. It is getting very cold now in the northeast even tonight and it is going to get colder by next week. Electricity out for millions. If you get gas or a gas station open it is a six hour wait. Generators that were set to be used in the marathon that was canceled because of public pressure could have literally helped 400 homes get power so people can get some heat and electricity. Here we are, we are four days out. Polls probably don't mean anything at this point. Be maybe a little tightening. But where do you see the race as of this moment? 

[00:25:18]


>> Well, I see it -- I see it tight. It is a point or two race. The question is going be what moves the dynamic this weekend. People are going to -- the people that are up for grabs are going to be listening to the final arguments. The final arguments were in clear view today. President obama saying things are going good and they are ing in the right direction. All we need to do is keep doing what we are are doing and in four more years everything will be fine. Governor romney's argument is the country is going in the wrong direction and we need to have change and somebody to create jobs and do something about the debt and put the country in the right place. When you have two out of every three americans thinking the country is going in the wrong direction, it is hard to make a tatous quo argument like the president made today. We will see the various ground games come into play here. We are already seeing it in the early vote. The early news s not good for the the president and is good for governor romney. 
>> Look at ohiur years ago. 230,000, 40,000 fewer democrats have voted, nearly -- 
>> no, I have it as of last night. 547,000 democrats have voted early or cast an absentee ballot or requested an absentee ballot, 470,000 republicans. That compares to 712,000 712,000 democrats four years ago. 
>> Sean: Is this ohio? 
>> This hio. 165,000 fewer democrats have voted. 98,000 more republicans have voted than four years ago. That is a swing. As of last night of 263,000 out of the democratic column and into the republican column. And remember, president obama won the state by 262,000 votes. He cleaned up in the the early vote. He won by over 300,000 votes in the early vote and then lost on ELECTION DAY TO john McCain and the people who showed up at the polls. That is traditionat happens. Democrats do well in early voting and republicans do well in the election day voting. For the president to have already wiped out by poor performance in the early voting and the republicans take election day bodes well for election day in ohio. I think it will be a squeaker but I think the republicans are likely to take it. This pattern has been here for over ten days. I have been monitoring this watching it closely. As the republican total does up you take that with the democrats who haven't shown up and the republicans who have shown up in excess of the number and this number has been growing. It was like 240,000 late last week, 250,000 early this week and now 263. 

[00:28:13]


>> Sean: Let's then go to florida. By all accountsemocrats are even pulling out of there right now because they didn't do well in early voting. What do you make of virginia? What do you make of wisconsjn? What do you make of colorado, nevada, iowa, new hampshire? Well, look, the easiest way to look at this is even if you look at the real clear politics average which includes a lot of the goofy quinnipiac poles and marist polls. The republicans are winning, indiana,, north carolina, virginia and florida. In fact, if you take a look at THAT ALL OF the McCain states PLUS 30s THAT THEY ARE WANING And I do think they are going to win, republicans are going to win all four of these states. Is they are at 248. Then you look at ohio which i think the early vote numbers are clear indication of of what is going to happen in ohio. That s another 18 electoral votes. And then colorado which is, you know, is in the rcp average just under water, 9/10 of a percent. But that is largely because of a couple of outliar polls that have huge numbers more democrats than republicans. I think we are going to win colorado and that gets you 275. And we are going to pick up out of ohio, new hampshire, nevada or minnesota, pennsylvania or wisconsin we are going to pick up something else as well, i think. 
>> Sean: So you are predicting it will be a good night for mitt romney and the country on tuesday? 
>> Well, it is not going be at night. It is going to be in the morning because this is going to be very close and could go either way. This is where I think it is going as of now. Assuming that romney has a good weekend and frantic activity in the right places with the right messages and then sometime after the cock crows a said on the morning of wednesday morning we are likely to have him be the 45th president of the united states. A long, long night with a lot of very close states. 
>> Sean: I will be looking for fox news projects that is what I'm waiting for. It's coming soon. Stay right there. We will continue with karl rove. And then when will this administration start answering questions about libya and benghazi? With four dead and daily discoveries proving this is COVERU ALL WEHahahaha! Hooohooo, hahaha! This is awesome! Folks who save hundreds of dollars switching to GEICO sure are happy. I'd say Happier than a Slinky on an escalator. Get happy. Get GEICO. Melons!!! Oh yeah!!

[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. It put me at ease that y could smoke on the first week. 
[ Male Announcer ] SOME PEOPLE HAD CHANGES In behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these p taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history heart or blood vsel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. With chantix and with the support system it worked. It worked for me. 
[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. 
>>> If there is any one wore relationshipped that the last four years are the best we can do, if there is any one who fears that the american dream is fading, if there is any one who wonders whether better jobs and better pay checks are things of e past I have a clear message, with the right leadership america will come roaring back. 
>> Sean: That was republican presidential nominee mitt romney today giving what the campaign is now calling his closing arguments before voters head to the polls on tuesday. And back with more as we look at our predictions for tuesday the architect karl rove. I want to go back to ohio because as you pointed out we went through all of the numbers, very, very important. Then we have got the coal factor in eastern, ohio. You have obviously this election is usually won or host hamilton county, the cincinnati, dayton surrounding areas. A lot of catholic voters out there that are not happy about the mandate. Are these type of things maybe that are not picked up by polls? 

[00:35:34]


>> Yeah, and look I don't think they are necessarily picked up by the early vote. I have been looking at what are called the ohio river counties. Coal country in southeastern ohio and you look at those and they are okay in terms of the turnout with you look at the sentiment in that area and you recognize and realize there are probably people who are nominal democrats who voted early and ain't voting for obama and then you take a look at hamilton. Cincinnati down in the southwest corner of the state is really critical. You also have the counties like claremont and warren slightly to the east of there and you take a look at their early vote totals and they are up enorm ms.Ly over 2008 and well above what they we in 2004. Another interesting thing is in the central part of the state there are two counties, delaware and liking which are suburban exurban counties around columbus. These are counties where they have got soft republicans in there, people who sometimes vote for democrats, sometimes vote for republicans. If yook at the turnout among, for example, 0.37% more republicans than democrats voted early in 2008 and now it is like 30 some odd percent more republicans than democrats voting. That is a sure sign that romney is bringing out michael barone talked about this sort of the aflew wet republicans, moderate voters in the suburbs coming out toe for romney. One of the reasons why pennsylvania is in play. Take a look at bucks, montgomery, belle and chester counties in the -- delaware and chester counties in the southeastern part of the state and romney is going to run better than republicans have run in recent years. 
>> Sean: And the philly suburbs might not be as strong for dem democrats and pittsburgh and other places I would expect big turnout there, too. Let's go to virginia. In every scenario it is ki of assumed that governor romney will take virginia. Up two points on average in the polls that I'm fwing closely. Three poin in some. Why are you so confident in virginia? What are the signs there that you are looking at? 

[00:37:41]


>> First of all, I'm looking at the polls in which he is behind like the washington post poll and governor romney is ahead among independents, strong among republicans and losing the state? I don't think so. Look at ratio of republicans to democrats and find out they have a higher number of democrats to republicans than they had in 2008. I think virginia is returning to its original course its historic role of being a republican state. I'm a little worried about the snow in far southwestern, virginia. You do down in the appalachia coal country region and you got a lot of democrats who are going to be voting for romney because of coal. There is a lot of snow down there. I think it will probably be cleared by tuesday but again en you have a lot of snow and an unseasonably early snow you got a little bit of a problem. Romney is doing well, everywhere. He is is really hitting hard defense spending in southeastern, virginia. The tidewater area where you have a lot of defense contractors and a lot of military families. Hitting on all of the cylinders in virginia right now. 
>> Sean: Last quick question, does romney ryan take wisconsin? 
>> I think they have a good shot at doing so. The numbers are looking good. President obama is spending a lot of time there which shows he is deeply worried about it. Wouldn't be spending time if he were getting away with a state easily. One other thing, too, the president is going to make a stop in superior wisconsin in the northwestern part of the state. I'm convinced he thinks minnesota is at play. That is a place you go in order to affect duluth, minnesota. I think it is a very smart play on the president's part. Not only a part of wisconsin that is important but also saying I need to g there because I may be seeing minnesota slip away from me well. 
>> Sean: I'm ready for game day. Let's get it on. Thanks for being with us. 
>> Let's do it.

[00:43:57]


>> Sean: And another day, another twist in the white e coverup of the benghazi terrorist attack. According to-mails provided to fox news, during the attack on the consulate there was a communication breakdown and as a result senior counter terrorism officials felt "out of the loop" and from cables obtained by fox news we are also learning that the u.S. Mission in benghazi drafted a contingency plan to suspend operations and move to the cia annex which was about a mile away. But that is not all. We now know that officials at the state department decided not to send what s called a foreign emergency survivors you port team, a unit designed specifically to respond to incidents such as this. Earlier todayed during a briefing the state department was asked to respond. Watch this. 
>> Again, I am going to leave it to the arb to do a full review of what went on before, during and after. I'm not going to get into any of the details. 
>> So as soon as you stand down you will go on the record and say something? 
>> I'm not planning on speaking on this issue at all. 
>> Joining me, fox news contributor liz cheney. They have contradicted themselves. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Sean: They have ducked. They have dodged, obfuscated and we have four dead amerans and they even died. And they are just trying to crawl to election day. Is it working, that strategy? 
>> Every single day sean as more information comes out it is becoming clearer and clearer that the president is more interested in protecting this follows image that he has defeated terrori than he apparently was in protecting our people. And if you ask yourself what is the most important test for a ander in chief? It is whether or not he s willing to do the right thing regardless of the impact on his political fortunes or on his image, whether he is willing to do the right thing to protect the nation and protect our people and it is absolutely clear that president obama faild that test. 
>> Sean: Two weeks after this we know that he was still denying it was terrorism. 

[00:46:02]


>> Yes. 
>> Sean: We know that the ambassador himself, multiple, multiple requests for extra security that was denied. We know that we have these brave navy seals, ty woods is one of them, told to stand down. He disobeyed orders and risked his career and gave his life and saved some, what, 30 lives in the process. 
>> Right. 
>> Sean: And we don't know what the president knew, when the president knew it because the president won't tell us. 
>> Right. 
>> Sean: And we know there is videos that exist. Go ahead. 
>> And we know from the cia timeline that was released yesterday that the cia knew it was ans ral-sharia within hours of the attack. Within four hours of the attack the cia knew you that. We also know that the state department has said on the record they did not believe this was because of a video at all ever. Theynew there was no mob embassy, protesting before it began. The president of the united states failed to provide the security that the people requested at the connecticut. The president of the united states failed to provide the kind of reenforcements that perhaps could have saved lives and defended those facilities and people and after the fact misled the american people. For the state department spokesperson to be saying I'm not going to talk about it, frankly, it is way above her pay grade. The presidenof the united states needs to talk about this. 
>> Sean: This is before mistakes, during mistakes, after lies and coverup. That is what this has now become. But you use the term earlier, you know, we get images of the president when they killed bin laden. He is sitting there in the situation room. We get images when they are talking about hurricane sandy which by the way the president gets his photo op and leaves leave town. It is a disaster out here in the the northeast. It is getting cold. Pele are freezing. There is no gasoline. There is no electricity. There is no food in some places. And he is gone. He is out back to vegas. He seems but not a photo op of what he did with benghazi. Was he in the situation room? Was he aware that the state department was watching this in real time? That our intelligence officials knew within hours what this is? I can't believe this has gone on six weeks or seven weeks and we haven't gotten any basic answers out of them. 

[00:48:33]


>> If you think about what did the situation room look like in the aftermath of this attack you have to emergency to yourself a dark room with cricket the chirping in it. The president was on his way to spend time with jay-z and beyonce. Americans deserve answers before they cast a vote on tuesday. 
>> Sean: And I think the american people have a right to hear the tape that caused ty woods, my sources tell me available, drone video and video of the compound and audio of cries for help that caused ty woods to disobey orders and not stand down as told. Why not play that for the american people before the election? 
>> That bravely exhibited by those men in benghazi they deserve a commander in chief who is up to that standard of leadership and frankly right now they don't have one. 
>> Sean: Coming up, you know things are looking bad for the president when the new york times says that a state like, pennsylvania, could be in play on tuesdsdsdsdsdsdsd begin. Tomato, obviously. Haha. There's more than that though, there's a kick to it. Wahlalalalallala! Smooth, but crisp. It's kind of like drinking a food that's a drink, or a drink that's a food, woooooh!

>>> let me tell you something. I may be the only person in america but I am far more enthusiastic about president obama this time than I was four years ago. 
>> Sean: That was is former president bill clinton at a campaign stop in florida earlier today. Seems like president obama's most high profile supporter is finally coming to terms with the dwindling excitement surrounding the anonned one and he is certainly not alone. Even the new york times cannot ignore governor romney's forward momentum and is admitting that pennsylvania s is in play. So itennsylvania support of the bishops jet a possibility? Here to talk with us is fox news contributor charles krauthammer. You and I were talking off air. What a b compliment of bill clinton. Seems like the president goes and gives christie a hug and promises he will be acting all presidential and then flies off again to of all places las vegas. And since then one in three gas stations are closed. Six hours people are waiting in line for gasoline. Tempers are flaring. Electricity is scarce. And people aren't getting the help they need. Janet napolitano says well, we will get it to you as soon as possible. This is five days into this. And I'm thinking that whatever goodwill the president had is backfiring big time as arica sees government's income pa 5- tense on display. 

[00:55:11]


>> Obama in my mind is the luckiest politician I have ever seen. Part of his rise in the senate race a long history of that sort of unusual things happening that pave the way for him. Here he is -- I go back to monday of this week. Romney is on the roll, increasing slightly every day his lead in the national polls, catchingp in the swing states and then sandy hits. First of all, it freezes the race. Second of all monopolies the news so nothing else comes out and inevitably you you get to play the commander in chief and get to be in the situation room. Of course, he wasn't on libya but that is another issue. Then he gets to stand out there with the governor of new jersey a republican so he can now play the bipartisan whereas he has run the most partisan administration probably in the last 50 years. He gets all of those images that are priceless stuff that you couldn't possibly get in advertising. And then the is sub limbal thing. In a disaster the party of government has the upper hand. If there is anything that we need government for, it is war, national emergencies, domestic and foreign. Gives this aura government perhaps it is the thing we need. Then you are right the first three days of the disaster is the solidarity phase and t phase when everybody is looking really good and then he takes off and, of course, now is the pain phase. This is inevitable. Huge disaster. The government cannot do everything it promises. But the question is will this be local coverage which i suspect it will. And will the national media fly off to vegas with the president, which I think they are going to do. 
>> Sean: Look, I don't know the answer to that. I suspect like brit hume said that I guess it is on our shoulders to tell the country that we have been lied to about benghazi. That things that we were told are not true, they knew it wasn't true, they were watching this in real time. So maybe that I our role. But I think it is deeper than that because this anger, this pain, t is his katrina as i say because it is imploding. Charles, there are people, the temperatures are going down fast. There are people freezing. There are people dumpster diving, waiting six hours for gasoline out there. There is no help in sight. And then we got crews from alabama that are being turned away by unions and call scabs and scumbags after they come up to new york to help restore power for people that need power? Those are the supporters of obama? That story is not going to be ablestay under wraps for four days, it is impossible. 

[00:58:01]


>> A question of under wraps getting the publicity that all of the comparable stories got in katrina. The difference, caucuses tree that you had george bush as president and here you have barack obama as president. The national media are so invested in this guy they will do everything they can to drag him over the finish line and if it they have to ignore this, they will ignore it the way they ignored benghazi. You can't ignore it completely but it is not going to get the blank coat coverage that the feel good got last week and that is why I think it helped obama to slightly recover in the national polls. 
>> Sean: Last question I have for you. Who is going to win this election, charles krauthammer, your best prediction? 
>> Romney. Very close. But he will win the popular by I think about half a point, electoral college probably a very narrow margin. 
>> Sean: Charles krauthammer. Going to be a long night on tuesday, maybe even into wednesday morning. But if you are right I will take a half a point. I'm predicting three. I have got a friendly gentlemen's bet, dinner with you and I will be more than happy to pay. Thanks for being with us. 
>> Pleasure.

=======================================================

Chief s back to playing politics. Today he threw by partisanship out the wiow and viciously attacked his opponent at three separate campaign ents in the swing state of ohio. As usual he lied about governor romney's record about where he stands on issues and what a romney administration would mean for the middle class and women and every other voting group. These are desperate times for team obama. He is trailing in the polls and is being forced to spend resources in states that he won easily in 2008. As a result, the lying will no doubt continue into tuesday. What makes matters worse this just as temperatures begin to reach the freezing point in new york, new jersey, long island and connecticut over the weekend and famed families without food and power, electricity and heat our compassionate leader will be campaigning alongside who else, bruce string seen, former are drug dealer jay-zed former rapper who once shot his brother and uses the. In word. The rhetoric flowing from supporters even more disgraceful. Ohio governor ted strickland attacked governor romney for sending his campaign bus to deliver disaster relief supplies this week. Watch. 
>> And then there is mitt romney who tries to fake compassion by asking people to bring food to a rally and when they don't do it they take $5,000 and go out to wal-mart and by food to pass out to the people coming to the rally so that he can get his picture taken loading boxes on a truck. 
>> Sean: Excuse me, governor but he has given more money to charity than barack obama and that cheap skate joe biden combined. Faking compassion? I'm sorry are but the man who truly fakes compassion is the one that you are supporting in this race. President barack obama went to bed on september 11th this year without convening his national security team even as americans were being massacred in benghazi. President obama got up the morning on september 12 and went to vegas instead of focusing on a terrorist attack that killed the u.S. Ambassador and three other americans including two navy seals. It was president barack obama he was the one who met with the families of victims on september 14 and despite the fact that we now know he knew this was an act of terror he continued to blame about a video both before and after the somber home coming that you are seeing on your screen. Apparently not fell the truth and worrying about an election while americans is are suffering barack obama's ideas of real compassion. Unfortunately for residents tonight in new jersey, new york, connecticut and elsewhere, well, you don't live in swing states. If the main street media had any sem ambulance of courage they would be covering this like it was obama's katrina, which it is. The jobs report is up. We will check in with kl rove and look at predictions from others as the outcome of tuesday is now pretty much at hand joining me with reaction to all of this, radio talk show host willie billy cunningham. His radio show is heard nationally across the country on sunday nights. Sir, welcome back. Ju you are a great american. 

[00:03:33]


>> Sean hannity, how are you? 
>> Sean: After the photo op,. Billy cunningham where does president obama fly? To vegas. Meanwhile, it it is beginning to freeze in the northeast. People don't have heat, electricity. The gas stations that are open people are waiting six hours or long are to be able to get gas. He comes to town. He hugs chris christie, photo op and then heads off to vegas. Your reaction? 
>> I would say a few things. Number one, I think this is obama's katrina in which he is showing a complete lack of compassion. I can recall a speech he gave in denver in front of 70,000 fans I which he said if you elect me the windsill stop blowing and the oceans will not rise. What happened to the anointed one and messiah who could control natural events. This dropped out of the friendly skies for a quick photo op and back into the friendly skies and out to las vegas where he said no one should ever go again to raise money. I would say this right now to you, sean hannity, right now in butler county, the most critical county in ohio, 30,000 attended rallies wrapping up that carl cameron talked about two and a half, three hours ago which is the largest crowd. Let me give you a little bit of ohio perspective. Four years ago. 
>> Sean: I want to stay on this point and then I want your full analysis of ohio because you know ohio better than anybody. Let me show you how bad things are getting in the northeast. Besides the lines and devastation and suffering and cold weather and lack of electricity. Five days into this janet napolitano says well, we will get reces to you as soon as possible. If this was george bush the media would be screaming bloody murder. Listen to the people suffering in the northeast tonight. 
>> Fed up. Fed up. This line. That line. What are we? Is this america? 
>> We are here for you. And we will not forget. We will follow up to make sure that you get all of the help that you need until you have rebuilt. 

[00:05:39]


>> We have no food. 
>> People trapped in here still. 
>> We pledge to h help those whose lives have been turned upside down. 
>> Don't have anything, anywhere to go. I don'tave no clothes. 
>> People here are still working. They are still looking for people. It's craze. 
>> We look out for one another and we don't leave anybody behind. 
>> Nothing has been done here. 
>> Where are you going go? You have no gas and no nothing. 22 years in my home and i lost it. 
>> And you have people saying I'm going to die. I'm going to guy. I wish I had the audio but i don't. 
>> Sean hannity I would say that the same federal government that controls fema that can't preposition gasoline trucks near service station and PREPOSITION BOTTLES AND MREs Is the same federal government that wants to control your healthcare. If they can't hand out water bottles on time and properly how do they handle hip replacement surgery? We are watching the incompetentence of the federal government on display. 
>> Sean: You know ohio. I there was with you in 2000 and 2004 and 2006 you have predicted with pinpoint accuracy what has happened in that state. A month ago, maybe it was two months ago you told me barack obama was going to win, ohio. You said that things have now changed dramatically in the swing state of ohio. Where do you stand tonight, sir? 
>> Sean hannity, this state has flipped from the blue column not red column for three reasons. Number one, secretary of state john houston in columbus would tell you that there is 220,000 fewer he democratic votes in early voting and 30,000 more republican votes. That means there is a 250,000 vote flip which is the margin by which obama won ohio in 2008. Secondly, ohio is a republican state. 20 of the last 24 years wed republican governors. The legislature is overwhelmingly republican. Every elected member of the supreme court of ohio is republican. 75% of elected officials in 88 counties are republicans. And thirdly, by independent voting measures, 10% to 15% of independent voters in ohio are going to vote for mitt romney. And also the catholic church when I go to saint sin vent in kenwood in since is national the minister is telling us vote for religious freedom. Vote for the biblical definition of marriage. Vote for life. There is half a million catholics energized in south, ohio, to pull the lever for mitt romney. Mitt romney will win, ohio, and is going to win ohio easily. 

[00:08:23]


>> Sean: Wisconsin? 
>> Wisconsin will go for romney because what walker did and what ryan did made it possible for mitt romney to win wisconsin. Let's face it, tonight in westchester, 30,000 people came to butlerounty, ohio, the most important county and the most important state in the the union and last -- and the last cycle four years ago, we couldn't get 300 people to WATCH john McCain. 30,000 stood in a grass field to hear the words tonight of mitt romney and paul ryan and it was a turned on moment for this state. 
>> Sean: Billy cunningham you have never been block cincinnati. I'm taking it to the bank. You are a great american. God bless you. 
>> So are you. God bless america. 
>> Sean: Karl rove shares his predictions for tuesday's election. Unemployment numbers come in today and unemployment numbers rise yet again. How much more proof do you need that this president is not up to this job?

>>> He is saying he is the candidate of change. Now, now, don't boo, vote. Vote. But let me tell you, colorado, we know what change looks like. We know what is going to help the middle class. We know what is going to grow jobs. We know whats going to reduce the deficit. 
>> Sean: Really? If you know he how to do all these things why haven't you done them the past four years? Is that the best you have got, mr. President? We see what your hopey changey thing brought us all. Today the unemployment rate rose yet again. Higher than when you took office four years ago and now stands at 7.9%. At this point in your presidency you predictd that by october of 2012 the unemployment rate would be, let's see, 5.2% at this stage. Earlier, congressman paul ryan talked about the long list of obama's broken promises. There is no end to it. Watch this. 
>>> Remember when said he would cut the deficit in half? I don't even have to follow up that one, do i? What we are seeing today is that 23 milln americans are struggling to find work today. What we see today s that 15% of our fellow country men and women are living in poverty. This is the highest poverty rate in a generation. The economy is growing at less than half the rate the president said it would be growing at if only he could borrow a bunch of money and spend it on his cronies in the stimulus package. We are 9 millionobs short of what he said he would accomplish. 
>> Sean: The simple truth is the obama administration has done nothing to move this country forward, only backwards. And haar to respond to the president's chances on tuesday, his handling of the storm and much more, former alaska governor and fox news contributor sarah palin. Governor, this is simple for me. One in six americans in poverty. 6 trillion debt. 17 million, 17 million more americans on food stamps, bringing the total to 49 million. For every one job obama created 75 more people got on food stamps during his presidency and there is 25 million unemployed! Americans. Does that person deserve reelection? 

[00:15:31]


>> And don't forget our deflated currency and the oncoming inflation that will be a result of that. Sean, just a few examples that you gave in the previous minutes of your commentary certainly show that all of that hopey changey stuff of this obama administration straiks is is ending in a big messy loud bloody train wreck and four more days, it can't come soon enough. 
>> Sean: I agree with you. Why do I believe -- I wonder if hurricane sandy hit ohio or virginia harder or any of the important swing states president comes in and photo op, big hug with governor chris christie and patting each other on the back and a lot of we are all doing great and every politician's name is named, let's see, we have got four days, we he have no electricity for millions. We have one in three gas stations open. Six hour waiting lines. We have got people suffering, freezing, starving. No water. No gas. Homes destroyed. And no government. You can't see any fema help here. Nothing. 
>> Well, it is quite a shame that, you knowe, obama got what he wanted out that and that was the photo ops with a republican governor so that he and the mainstream media could kind of fake that bipartisanship that in no way, shape or form does president obama represent. He is the most partisan president I think that we have ever had. So he got his photo ops out of that unfortunately because he got to jet off and you know, here he goes again. 
>> Sean: Back to vegas. 
>> Party in vegas with jay-z and quite unfortunate because as you say, be sean, people are truly suffering and this isn't a time for politics and I think it is quite a shame that president obama chose to seize the opportunity along with the complicit lap dogs in the media to make it a political statement. 

[00:17:37]


>> Sean: I got to tell you something and when you hear people saying they are dying, when you hear people saying they have no food, when you hear people saying they are freezing, when you hear -- the president is just out campaigning. And the media in this country is so complicit, so wanting this guy to win it is unbelievable. What do you predict for tuesday night? What is your prediction? 
>> First, sean, the media is so corrupt that is what the bottom line is, the lamestream media. People through the example of the storm they cannot put their hope and their faith in government. They can't put their faith in some politician. They have to be self-sufficient and dependent on something greater than some politiciann washington, d.C. That s a lesson learned in this. Tuesday night, you know, i think that many, many people across am who perhaps before wanted to put their hope and their faith in obama's false promises have awakened and we may be up late tuesday NIGHT AS SENATOR john McCain said earlier on a fox program, I agree with that. I do believe that enough americans have awakened and understand that it is time for a shift, a fundamental transformation not of our country but a transformation of what we perhaps had previously believed in in the name of politics so we can get america back on the right drag. 
>> I notice even on your sweatshirt you have is an american flag. 
>> Amen.

>> Thank you so much. You got that one right by the way. You got absolutely right. Four more days. 
>> Sean: As that rowdy romney crowd pointed out today, forget about four more years. We are four short days away from the most important election in your lifetime. Who better to ask for predictions, form resorb senior advisor, fox news contributor karl rove. I'm actually with you. I got this romney three points and the backlash that is now evolving on the east coast, six hour lines, violence, electricity, and the president goes in for a photo op and janet napolitano says today oh, we'll get it there as soon as possible be, I think there is ing to be a big backlash in the course of this weekend. Your reaction? 

[00:23:57]


>> Look, I think sandy helped him early on because it stopped the conversation about the election and turned it to this gigantic storm but I think you are right the images we are now starting to see coming out of new york the film of the woman on staten island confronting senator schumer, these are not good things to happen. While the state is are generally in charge of disaster relief, the president the advantage of having been there air early and the disadvantage of anything that happens. Femaistributed a very small number of generators and seems to think that it is going okay. 
>> Sean: I think the idea that the president comes in and photo ops and then just like in benghazi wham on a plane right off to vegas is not serving well because the people have not been servedere. Literally one this three gas stions are closed. It is getting very cold now in the northeast even tonight and it is going to get colder by next week. Electricity out for millions. If you get gas or a gas station open it is a six hour wait. Generators that were set to be used in the marathon that was canceled because of public pressure could have literally helped 400 homes get power so peopan get some heat and electricity. Here we are, we are four days out. Polls probably don't mean anything at this point. Be maybe a little tightening. But where do you see the race as of this moment? 
>> Well, I see it -- I see it tight. It is a point or two race. The question is going be what moves the dynamic this weekend. People are going to -- the people that are up for grabs are going to be listening to the final arguments. The final arguments were in clear view today. President obama saying things are going good and they are going in the right direction. All we need to do is keep doing what we are are doing and in four more years everything will be fine. Governor romney's argument is the country is going in the wrong direction and we need to have change and somebody to create jobs and do something about the debt and put the country in the right place. When you have two out of every three americans thinking the country is going in the wrong direction, it is hard to make a tatous quo argument like the president made today. We will see the various ground games come into play here. We are already seeing it in the early vote. The early news s not good for the the president and is good for governor romney. 

[00:26:25]


>> Look at ohio four years ago. 230,000, 40,000 fewer democrats have voted, nearly -- 
>> no, I have it as of last night. 547,000 democrats have voted early or cast an absentee ballot or requested an absentee ballot, 470,000 republicans. That compares to 712,000 712,000 democrats four years ago. 
>> Sean: Is this ohio? 
>> This is ohio. 165,000 fewer democrats have voted. 98,000 more republicans have voted than four years ago. That is a swing. As of last night of 263,000 out of the democratic column and into the republican column. And remember, president obama won the state by 262,000 votes. He cleaned up in the the early vote. Heon by over 300,000 votes in the early vote and then lost on ELECTION DAY TO john McCain and the people who showed up at the polls. That is traditionally t happens. Democrats do well in early voting and republicans do well in the election day voting. For the president to have already wiped out by poor performance in the early voting and the republicans take election day bodes well for election day in ohio. I think it will be a squeaker but I think the republicans are likely to take it. This pattern has been here for over ten days. I have been monitoring this watching it closely. As the republican total does up you take that with the democrats who haven't shown up and the republicans who have shown up in excess of the number and this number has been growing. It was like 240,000 late last week, 250,000 early this week and now 263. 
>> Sean: Let's then go to florida. By all accounts democrats are even pulling out of there right now because they didn't do well in early voting. What do you make of virginia? What do you make of wisconsin? What do you make of colorado, nevada, iowa, new hampshire? 

[00:28:30]


>> Well, look, the easiest way to look at this is even if you look at the real clear politics average which in a lot of the goofy quinnipiac poles and marist polls. The republicans are winning, indiana,, north carolina, virginia and florida. In fact, if you take a look at THAT ALL OF the McCain states PLUS 30s THAT THEY ARE WANING And I do think they are going to win, republicans are going to win all four of these states. Is they are at 248. Then you look at ohio which i think the early vote numbers are clear indication of of what is going to happen in ohio. That s another 18 electoral votes. And then colorado which is, u know, is in the rcp average just under water, 9/10 of a percent. But that is largely because of a couple of outliar polls that have huge numbers more democrats than republicans. I think we are going to win colorado and that gets you 275. And we are going to pick up out of ohio, new hampshire, nevada or minnesota, pennsylvania or wisconsin we are going to pick up something else as well, i think. 
>> Sean: So you are predicting it will be a good night for mitt romney and the country on tuesday? 
>> Well, it is not going be at night. It is going to be in the morning because this is going to be very close and could go ei way. This is where I think it is going as of no assuming that romney has a good weekend and frantic activity in the right places with the right messages and then sometime after the cock crows as I said on the morning ofednesday morning we are likely to have him be the 45th president of the united states. A long, long night with a lot of very close stat.

[00:34:55]


>> Sean: That was republican presidential nominee mitt romney today giving what the campaign is now calling his closing arguments before voters head to the polls on tuesday. And back with more as we look at our predictions for tuesday the architect karl rove. I want to go back to ohio because as you pointed out we went through all of the numbers, very, very important. Then we have got the coal factor in eastern, ohio. You have obviously this election is usually won or host hami county, the cincinnati, dayton surrounding areas. A lot of catholic voters out there that are not happy about the mandate. Are these type of things maybe that are not picked up by polls? 
>> Yeah, and look I don't think they are necessarily picked up by the early vote. I have been looking at what are call the ohio river counties. Coal country in southeastern ohio and you look at those and they are okay in terms of the turnout with you look at the sentiment in that area and you recognize and realize there are probably people who are nominal democrats who voted early and ain't voting for obama and then you take a look at hamilton. Cincinnati down in the southwest corner of the state is really critical. You also have the counties like claremont and warren slightly to the east of there and you take a look at their early vote totals and they are up enorm ms.Ly over 2008 and well above what they were in 2004. Another interesting thing is in the central part of the state there are two counties, delaware and liking which are suburban exurban counties around columbus. These are counties where they have got soft republicans in there, people who sometimes vote for democrats, sometimes vote for republicans. If you look at the turnout among, for example, 0.37% more republicans than democrats voted early in 2008 and now it is like 30 some odd percent more republicans than democrats voting. That is a sure sign that romney is bringing out michael barone talked about this sort of the aflew went soft republicans, moderate voters in the suburbs coming out to vote for romney. One of the reasons why pennsylvania is in play. Take a look at bucks, montgomery, belle and chester counties in the -- delaware and chester counties in the southeastern part of the state and romney is going to run better than republicans have run in recent years. 

[00:37:18]


>> Sean: And the philly suburbs might not be as strong for dem democrats and pittsburgh and other places I would expect big turnout there, too. Let's go to virginia. In every scenario it is kind of assumed that governor romney will take virginia. Up two points on average in the polls that I'm following closely. Three points in some. Why are you so confident in virginia? What are thens there that you are looking at? 
>> First of all, I'm looking at the polls in which he is behind like the washington post poll and governor romney is ahead among independents, strong among republicans and losing the state? I don't think so. Look at ratio of republicans to ats and find out they have a higher number of democrats to republicans than they had in 2008. I think virginia is returning to its original course its historic role of being a republican state. I'm a little worried about the snow in far southwestern, virginia. You do down in the appalachia coal country region and you got a lot of democrats who are going to be voting for romney because of coal. There is a lot of snow down there. I think it will probably be cleared by tuesday but again when you have a lot of snow and an unseasonably early snow you got a little bit of a problem. Romney is doing well, everywhere. He is is really hitting hard defense spending in southeastern, virginia. The tidewater area where you have a lot of defense contractors and a lot of military families. Hitting on all of the cylinders in virginia right now. 
>> Sean: Last quick question, does romney ryan take wisconsin? 
>> I think they have a good shot at doing so. The numbers are looking good. President obama is spending a lot of time there which shows he is deeply worried about it. Wouldn't be spending time if he were getting away with a state easily. One other thing, too, the president is going to make a stop in superior wisconsin in the northwestern part of the state. I'm convinced he thinks minnesota is at play. That is a place you go in order to affect duluth, minnesota. I think it is a very smart play on the president's part. Not only a part of wisconsin that is important but also saying I need to get there because I may be seeing minnesota slip away from me as well. 

[00:39:31]


>> Sean: I'm ready for game day. Let's get it on. Thanks for being with us. 
>> Let's do it. 
>> Sean: We now know that while four americans were dying and our consulate was under fire our administration did not convene its terrorism task exists solely for a crisis like what happened in 

[00:44:00]


>> Sean: And another day, another twist in the white house coverup of the benghazi terrorist attack. According to e-mails provided to fox news, during the attack on the consulate there was a communication breakdown and as a result seniorounter terrorism officials felt "out of the loop" and from cables obtained bfox news we are also learning that the u.S. Mission in benghazi drafted a contingency plan to suspend operations and move to the cia annex which was about a mile away. But that is not all. We now know that officials at the state department decided not to send what s called a foreign emergency survivors you port team, a unit designed specifically to respond to incidents such as this. Earlier todayed during a briefing the state department was asked to respond. Watch this. 
>> Again, I am going to leave it to the arb to do a full review of what went on before, during and after. I'm not going to get into any of the details. 
>> So as soon as you stand down you will go on the record and say something? 
>> I'm not planning on speaking on this issue at all. 
>> Joining me, fox news contributor liz cheney. They have contradicted themselves. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Sean: They have ducked. They have dodged, obfuscated and we have four dead americans and they even died. And they are just trying to crawl to election day. Is it working, that strategy? 
>> Every single day sean as more information comes out it is becoming clearer and clearer that the president is more interested in protecting this follows image that he has defeated terrorism than he apparently was in protecting our people. And if you ask yourself what is the most important test for a commander in chief? It is whether or not he s willing to do the right thing regardless of the impact on his political fortunes or on his image, whether he is willing to do the right thing to protect the nation and protect our people and it is absolutely clear that president obama faild that test. 
>> Sean: Two weeks after this we know that he was still denying it was terrorism. 

[00:46:04]


>> Yes. 
>> Sean: We know that the ambassador himself, multiple, multiple requests for extra security that was denied. We know that we have these brave navy seals, ty woods is one of them, told to stand down. He disobeyed orders and risked his career and gave his life and saved some, what, 30 lives in the process. 
>> Right. 
>> Sean: And we don't know what the president knew, when the president knew it because the president won't tell us. 
>> Right. 
>> Sean: And we know there is videos that exist. Go ahead. 
>> And we know from the cia timeline that was released yesterday that the cia knew it was ans ral-sharia within hours of the attack. Within four hours of the attack the cia knew you that. We also know that the state department has said on the record they did not believe this was because of a video at all ever. They knew there was no mob embassy, protesting before it began. The president of the united states failed to provide the security that the people requested at the connecticut. The president of the united states failed to provide the kind of reenforcements that perhaps could have saved lives and defended those facilities and people and after the fact misled the american people. For the state department spokesperson to be saying I'm not going to talk about it, frankly, it is way above her pay grade. The president of the united states needs to talk about this. 
>> Sean: This is before mistakes, during mistakes, after lies and coverup. That is what this has now become. But you use the term earlier, you know, we get images of the president when they killed bin laden. He is sitting there in the situation room. We get images when they are talking about hurricane sandy which by the way the president gets his photo op andeaves leave town. It is a disaster out here in the the northeast. It is getting cold. People are freezing. There is no gasoline. There is no electricity. There is no food in some places. And he is gone. He is out back to vegas. He seems but not a photo op of what he did with benghazi. Was he in the situation room? Was he aware that the state department was watching this in real time? That our intelligence officials knew within hours what this is? I can't believe this has gone six weeks or seven weeks and we haven't gotten any basic answers out of them. 

[00:48:36]


>> If you think about what did the situation room look like in the aftermath of this attack you have to emergency to yourself a dark room with cricket the chirping in it. The president was on his way to spend time with jay-z and beyonce. Americans deserve answers before they cast a vote on tuesday. 
>> Sean: And I think the american people have a right to hear the tape that caused ty woods, my sources tell me available, drone video and video of the compound and audio of cries for help that caused ty woods to disobey orders and not stand down as told. Why not play that for the american people before the election? 
>> That bravely exhibited by those men in benghazi they deserve a commander in chief who is up to that standard of leadership and frankly right now they don't have one. 
>> Sean: Coming up, you know things are looking bad for the president when the new york times says that a state like, pennsylvania, could be in play on tuesdsdsdsdsd doesn't happen. It takes some doing. Some coordinating. And a trip to the one place with the new ideas that help us pull it all together. From the things that hang and shine... ...to the things that sparkle and jingle. All while saving the things that go in our wallet. More saving. More doing. That's the power of The Home Depot. Trade in any light string and get up to five bucks off the latest holiday LEDs. 

[00:53:23]


>>> Let me tell you something. I may be the only person in america but I am far more enthusiastic about president obama this time than I was four years ago. 
>> Sean: That was is former president bill clinton at a campaign stop in florida earlier today. Seems like president obama's most high profile supporter is finally coming to terms with the dwindling excitement surrounding the anonned one and he is certainly not alone. Even the new york times cannot ignore governor romney's forward momentum and is admitting that pennsylvania s is in play. So it pennsylvania support of the bishops jet a possibility? Here to talk with us is fox news contributor charles krauthammer. You and I were talking off air. What a b compliment of bill clinton. Seems like the president goes and gives christie a hug and promises he will be acting all presidential and then flies off again to of all places las vegas. And since then one in three gas stations are closed. Six hours people are waiting in line for gasoline. Tempers are flaring. Electricity is scarce. And people aren't getting the help they need. Janet napolitano says well, we will get it to you as soon as possible. This is five days into this. And I'm thinking that whatever goodwill the president had is backfiring big time as america sees government's income pa tense on display. 
>> Obama in my mind is the luckiest politician I have ever seen. Part of his rise in the senate race a long history of that sort of unusual things happening that pave the way for him. Here he is -- I go back to monday of this week. Romney is on the roll, increasing slightly every day his lead in the national polls, catching up in the swing states and then sandy hits. First of all, it freezes the race. Second of all monopolies the news so nothing else comes out and inevitably you you get to play the commander in chief and get to be in the situation room. Of course, he wasn't on libya but that is another issue. Then he gets to stand out there with the governor of new jersey a republican so he can now play the bipartisan whereas he has run the most partisan administration probably in the last 50 years. He gets all of those images that are priceless stuff that you couldn't possibly get in advertising. And then the is sub limbal thing. In a disaster the party of government has the upper hand. If there is anything that we need government for, it is war, national emergencies, domestic and foreign. Gives this aura government perhaps it is the thing we need. Then you are right the first three days of the disaster is the solidarity phase and the phase when everybody is looking really good and then he takes off and, of course, now is the pain phase. This is inevitable. Huge disaster. The government cannot do everything it promises. But the question is will this be local coverage which i suspect it will. And will the national media fly off to vegas with the president, which I think they are going to do. 

[00:57:00]


>> Sean: Look, I don't know the answer to that. I suspect like brit hume said that I guess it is on our shoulders to tell the country that we have been lied to about benghazi. That things that we were told are not true, they knew it wasn't true, they were watching this in real time. So maybe that is our role. But I think it is deeper than that because this anger, this pain, this is his katrina as i say because it is imploding. Charles, there are people, the temperatures are going down fast. There are people freezing. There are people dumpster diving, waiting six hours for gasoline out there. There is no help in sight. And then we got crews from alabama that are being turned away by unions and called scabs and scumbags after they come up to new york to help restore power for people that need power? Those are the supporters of obama? That story is not going to be able to stay under wraps for four days, it is impossible. 
>> A question of under wraps getting the publicity that all of the comparable stories got in katrina. The difference, caucuses tree that you had george bush as president and here you have barack obama as president. The national media are so invested in this guy they will do everything they can to drag him over the finish line and if it they have to ignore this, they will ignore it the way they ignored benghazi. You can't ignore it completely but it is not going to get the blank coat coverage that the feel good got last week and that is why I think it helped obama to slightly recover in the national polls. 
>> Sean: Last question I have for you. Who is going to win this election, charles krauthammer, your best prediction? 
>> Romney. Very close. But he will win the popular by I think about half a point, electoral college probably a very narrow margin. 

[00:59:00]


>> Sean: Charles krauthammer. Going to be a long night on tuesday, maybe even into wednesday morning. But ifre right I will take a half a point. I'm predicting three. I have got a friendly gentlemen's bet, dinner with you and I will be more than happy to pay. Thanks for being with us. 
>> Pleasure. 
>> Sean: That is all the time we have left. Thank you for being with us. This sunday night, special edition, "hannity" 9:00 p.M. Eastern. And back monday as well. Four days to election day. Thanks for being with us. The best election c c c c c c

He's out there in ohio fighting the good fight. I only make predictions when people make me make them, but the trajectory, the momentum, now seems pro-obama. Pennsylvania will hold, ohio looks good but close, and all the battlegrounds look winnable for the president. The huge question is turnout, that and rational self-interest. The young who believe in science,omen who believe in protecting their rights, latinos who can see a brighter future with a supportive president all need to get out, show up, and vote. There's no reward for a failure. In a free society, a democratic society is a failure, deeply personal, you blew it if you don't vote. Let's see where it stands. I'm joined by mother jones washington bureau chief david corn and joy reid. Do you think I'm a little strong? 
>> No. 
>> I don't want to talk to anybody after this election if they haven't bothered to vote. With four days to go, president obama and mitt romney made their closing arguments today at multiple stops in ohio and wisconsin. Take a look at some of the sights and sounds from this day of campaigning. ???????????? 
>> in this campaign he's tried as hard as he can to repackage, to repackage these same policies and offer them up as change. 
>> Do you want more of the same or do you want real change? 
>> Giving more power back to the biggest banks, that's not change. 
>> And we need real change. 
>> Another $5 trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy, that's not change. 
>> President obama has tried to convince folks that these last four years have been a success. 
>> By the way, when you try to change the facts just because they're inconvennt to your campaign, that's definitely not change. 
>> He wants to take all the ideas from the first term, you knowthe stimulus, the borrowing, obama care, all the rest, and then go back and do it all over again. 
>> You may be frustrated sometimes at the pace of change, but you know what I believe. 
>> We're four days away from a fresh start, four days away from the first day of a new beginning. 

[00:02:02]


>> You know that I'll fight for you and your family every single day as hard as I know how. You know that. 
>> We've got joy. 
>> I was going to answer that. 
>> Joy reid. My new friend and my old friend. Thank you both for joining us. Everybody knows the stakes are enormous. It is how people react over the weekend. That's signals aren't just where they're at, they're being radiated on the nightly news, this program, everywhere. Aren't you impressed by romney who is often very stiff and overdressed, never unbuttons his tie, more dressed up than ever. Obama wearing the grandfather cardigan or whatever he's got on. I love that kind of sweater, my wife hates it. 
>> Fdr. 
>> Romney looks like he's going to a board meeting, and he doesn't exactly sound like a guy giving a rousing rally. He sounds like somebody -- 
>> what's with the president of the united states with that costume on today? 
>> He's doing cool obama. He needs the young vote. 
>> Is that what it is? 
>> I think right now I'd rather be barack obama than mitt romney. If you look at the polls, his campaign feels pretty good about where they are, and so he's sort of enjoying this. 
>> I get up this morning and started clocking it around 8:00. I started clocking minute to minute to minute to get the jobless number. Then I go, I did say this before, I said if it's underrated it's okay for obama. If it's up a tick it's okay. But I didn't think the good news would be 171,000 new jobs, which is way above the 125,000 predicted, and now we have three months of 170,000-plus. 
>> You notice -- 
>> so it is starting to go up substantially. 
>> If you compare it to what happened when -- four years ago, I think they lost 400,000 jobs or so this month, it is change for the better. I notice -- 
>> I'd say. 
>> I notice today therwas a lot less arguing about these jobs numbers than there have been the last -- 
>> you spoke too soon. Someone who wasn't pleased with the jobs report was mitt romney. Here he is with his statement. The candidate said, quote, this is a statement, today's increase in the unemployment rate is a sad remainder that the economy is at a virtual standstill. Creating 171,000 jobs a month. That's not the strongest knock. 

[00:04:06]


>> Ronald reagan proved it's about trajectory. The trajectory of the jobs numbers. Do people feel like the economy is getting better? Are things looking better? If you look in states that matter, places like ohio where the economy has gotten substantially better and they can pinpoint why. They can point to that auto bailout. If you're in michigan or ohio you can point to that reason why, and that reason why has barack obama's name on it. 
>> If you listen to the little clips we played, it seems as though barack obama is energized -- 
>> that's apparent. 
>> Mitt romney is going through the motions. 
>> Let's go to the facts here we have on the table. I love the atmospherics. That's why I wanted to start with this. Let's go to this peaking question. Dick nixon, richard nixon, he was a smart politician as they go, and he used to believe -- he didn't want to the run all out. You're exhausted by election day. He said you have to peak at the right time. He almost caught kennedy. He was three days late. Three more days he might have caught him. Humphrey almost caught nixon in '68. These elections go through rhythms. 
>> Mitt romney peaked exactly where john kerry peaked in 2004, the first debate. They both had a first great debate, got a great bounce, and it dissipated -- 
>> slowly dissipated. 
>> -- Over the course of the mpaign, and they couldn't get the wind back. 
>> I'm not sure obama is peaking at the best ment, but the campaign, particularly in ohio, seems to have reached a plateau, this small -- 
>> why do you come with this debbie downer -- 
>> let me finish. 
>> Are you irish? 
>> I'm jewish, close. 
>> Dim scenario. 
>> If you look at ohio, it has narrowed in the last couple weeks, but it's hit this 4% mark and it hasn't chged -- 
>> let's go to -- 
>> obama steady -- 
>> let's go by what obama thinks 
-- not obama, romney thinks. I think he has done morehan we know. Here is romney with eric fern strom. If he thinks he's winning, why is he throwing these mud balls like this guy is hanging around with chavez? Why he throwing mud balls about jeeps going to china when it's not true? Why is he heading to pennsylvania? I just checked with neil, one of the top consultants in pennsylvania, he said four points to six points. He says they will only lose -- 

[00:06:13]


>> why are they going to minnesota? Why are they going to -- 
>> he's suggesting he's desperate. 
>> I think it is. They have had -- their overarching strategy has been kitchen sink. Everything at all times, keep throwing things at the wall and we'll hope because the economy is not good, people will vote for mitt romney even though they don't like him. 
>> Here is -- 
>> at the end of the game when they're looking at the numbers and they see they can't close that gap in ohio no matter what they've done and I think last week might have hurt them in ohio -- 
>> might have? 
>> They're going -- 
>> an older refee to the nba, when you're behind by seven or eight points, you start fouling. 
>> You start fouling. 
>> The reason you foul, you have got to get the ball back. The other guy gets the foul shot, nobody likes the looks of it. 
>> They built their entire game plan, the romney campaign, on that over 8% unemployment. Once they lost that, and that nd was really what mitt romney was running on, once you lose that argument, they didn't have any place else to go. They went to welfare reform and extraneous things where they're basically like let's get your voters angry, uncomfortable, get them to come up because they hate the guy. The problem is not enough americans hate barack obama -- 
>> I'll tell you what I'm impressed by is obama bringing in the cavalry. He brought in colin powell. I bumped into him about a month ago and said, are you going to endorse him or not? He want tell me. Just at the right time. He got bloomberg coming out -- and by the way -- 
>> now the biggest endorsement you can get, the best surrogate on this planet is bill clinton. The former president has been all over the country for obama. He's lost his voice he's working so hard. Here he was in florida today. Let's take a look. Five stops down there. 
>> What president obama is saying, look at me, I'm always willing to work with republicans, I work with governor christie in new jersey on sandy. I tried to work with him on the budget. I tried to work with him on health care. And what they say is we'll work with the democrats if you put us in charge. Now, that's the message, you just have to decide whether you think that's a good message. 

[00:08:21]


>> There's bill out there. Getting all the attention, but it's great. 
>> There is no better surrogate for anybody than bill clinton. He's very popular in florida. I'll tell what you else, bloomberg, he might as well also be the mayor of broward county. There are so many new yorkers who are dual residents. 
>> They still read "the new york post" because they think it's liberal. 
>> They still read "the new york post." Florida has 22% independents, people who listen to bloomberg and clinton, and that fema thing I think is also going to hurt romney. 
>> Author think shift used to be, when she would delair the victory, it was over. 
>> Florida may be too far a bridge for barack obama, but by putting bill clinton and all the things you mentioned, it means the romney campaign has to pay attention tontt. 
>> Let's talk about "the washington post" editorial today because it gets to the question of fouling. Of breaking the rules and going 
-- basically saying things that even the totally independent people say is dishonest. Here it is, quote, "washington post," through all the flip-flops there's been one consistency in the campaign of republican presidential nominee mitt romney. A contempt for the electorate. How else to explain his refusal to disclose essential information, how other than an assumption that voters are too dim to remember what mr. Romney has said across the years and months, to account for his breathtaking ideological shifts. Within limits all candidates say and do what they have to say and do to win. Mr. Romney by contrast seems to be betting voters have no memories, poor arithmetic skills, and a general inability to look behind the curtain. 
>>> Here is some breaking news from new york. Wnbc reports that the new york mbrathon cancelled. By the way, the big problem, i believe, was staten island. Thatas going to be the starting point. They didn't want all those people coming out there from all around the world. Thank you, david corn. Thank joy read. 
>>> Coming up, all eyes are on ohio. Both candidates are focusing on the buckeye state. Senator brown is fighting to hold his seat out there. We are going to talk to him about the situation in ohio. 

[00:10:33]


>>> Control of the united states senate is on the line. We all know that. Missouri, senator claire mkill, the most closely run race. And her opponent, carl aiken 
>>> the president's response to the devastation caused by sandy earned from governor chris christie and other east coast leaders, including mayor bloomberg. A recent poll those that 78% of americans also think he did a good or excellent josh dealing with the storm. Could the storm be the pivotal moment, the black swan in the race? 
>>> Let me finish with the bottom line on this election eve, and I ask this to everybody, fair question, is obama a good president? Think about it. This is "hardball," the place for politics. doesn't happen. It takes some doing. Some coordinatg. And a trip to the one place with the new ideas that help us pull it all together. From the things that hang and shine... ...to the things that sparkle and jingle. All while saving the things that go in our wallet. More saving. More doing. That's the power of The Home Depot. Trade in any light string and get up to five bucks off thlatest holiday LEDs. 

[00:14:37]


>>> We have got to the point where we count hours, not days. Take a look at their travel schedules, for the president, colorado, iowa, wisconsin, ohio, new hampshire, virginia, and florida, of course. For governor romney, those seven state plus husband newly contested addition. He is going to virginia. Zero in on today and you can see what matters most, ohio, ohio, ohio as the late tim russert would say. Three stops for the president and two for mitt romney who began his morning in wisconsin, another key rust belt battleground. Congressman sherrod brown knows a little about buckeye state politics, and joan walsh is managing editor of salon.Com and a political analyst. Senator brown, sir, you know that state. I think you look like ohio. I think you are ohio. You're the labor guy. You're a blue collar kind of guy. You look like a senator from out there. You remind me of thee pete williams of new jersey, but you never had his problems. This is the question, why are you having a tough race? I don't get this guy running against you, this kid. Is it all this money being pumped in there? What's made this even interesting, not for you. It's been nervous for you. Why is it interesting to watch? 
>> Well, it's $31 million, they spent more money against me than any senate race in the country. We figure it's oil company money and wall street money. 
>> Is this americans for prosperity, the koch brothers? 
>> It's all different groups. It's not a super pac, it's not disclosed money. It's directed by karl rove. He's directing the choir and this group comes in -- 
>> crossroads gps. I know it well. 
>> It's 45,000 ads so far. There are eight groups right now he state together running -- eight individual groups running ads. The only way you fight that is grassroots, and we've got a great grassroots operation. Sherrodbrown.Com, people can join us. We've got lots of people that have done everything from small contributions to knocking on doors and doing phone banks, and that's how you beat this kind of money. It's the only way a progressive populist democrat in a state as tough as ohio wins. You fight back that way. 

[00:16:53]


>> There's some things I keep worrying about. Ohio is one I worry about. I wonder about the secretary of state out there. I wonder about the stumble we had st time, the people kept questioning -- I'm talking about 2004, real questions about the count out in ohio. What do you see? What do you see -- we have 650 obama lawyers in cuyahoga coun being on the lookout for any kind of monkey business out there. What do you hear? What's coming? 
>> Well, I think -- 
>> in terms of trouble. 
>> There may be trouble. I think we are all worried about voter suppression. We're somewhat worried about diebold, about getting the ground game out, but the ground game is excellent, chris. I feel optimistic. It's not a slam dunk, but you're right, senator brown's race should not be close. He's amazing, he's excellent, but they've thrown a lot of money at it and got very cocky after john kasich won the governorship, but the optimistic and positive thing is a year and a half ago the white house -- the campaign was looking for a way to win back the white house without ohio. They were very concerned about ohio. They were looking at the sunbelt as being better than the rust belt. Now the rust belt is coming through for the president, and it really is white working class voters who are doing much better for the president, much more behind the president than they are in most other places in the country, and I think senator brown can talk to that. 
>> Let's go back to senator brown. I forgot the intellectuals around the president about a year ago were talking we're going to run a new democratic party. I said why are you guys doing that? You have to dance with the one that brung you. The democratic party is based on the industrial people, the part of the country that built this country. Your thoughts about this, senator brown, how does it affect the race, the fact they're back fighting it out for ohio, not thinking these other things out in the country. 
>> Joan's comments were exactly right as yours were, chris, except it's not the rust belt, it's the tech belt now, and there are a lot of great things going on. Our unemployment rate around the time of the auto rescue before it took hold in the recovery act, the unemployment rate in this state was 10.6%. Now it's 7%. Not good enough, still too many unemployed people that want jobs, but you can see the auto rescue. You can see what's happening with the president's emphasis on trade enforcement, on community colleges, on small business, and this state's coming back and 

[00:19:17]


>> thank you, sherrod brown, share you, joan walsh. 
>>> President obama won the endorsement of mayor michael bloomberg, and today mitt romney won the endorsement of another one-percenter. I can't wait to see what that is. 
>>> This sunday join me for a special edition of "hardball" at 7:00 eastern. We have special guests on sunday, just us, vice president joe biden is going to join us on "hardball" sunday night at 5:00 and 7:00. This is "hardball," the place for politics. doesn't happen. It takes some doing. Some coordinating. And a trip to the one place with the new ideas that help us pull it all together. From the things that hang and shin ...to the things that sparkle and jingle. All while saving the things that go in our wallet. More saving. More doing. That's the power of The Home Depot. Trade in any light string and get up to five bucks off the latest holiday LEDs. 

[00:23:03]


>>> I saw a campaign ad today. You tell me what this means. 
>> America is facing problems of historic proportions, and your vote could mean the difference between prosperity and ruin, but who will you choose? Will you vote for the elite, multimillionaire, hardard-educated lawyer who overhauled the health care system or the elite, multimillionaire lawyer who overhauled the health care system? Choose wisely, america. 
>> Back to "hardball." First a plug for mitt romney from "the simpsons." Here is mr. Burns, the fictional and highly unpopular owner of springfield's nuclear plant, in pre-election panic mode. 
>> I have to say, despite those unimaginably horrible good job numbers, we're feeling pretty confident. There's only one thing that might deny us the presidency that is the god-given property of the republican party. 
>> The 47% tape? 
>> Nope. 
>> The empty chair? 
>> Nope. 
>> Cayman islands? 
>> Not a problem. 
>> Swiss bank accounts? 10,000 bet? I like to fire people? 
>> No. It's a shaggy dog story about an actual shaggy dog. Apparently while on vacation old mitt strapped his mutt to the roof of his car for a brief 650-mile jaunt. So tonight we will explain what truly happened. Now, sheamus, what did you think of being strapped to the roof of your dada's car? What's that? You liked being tied to the roof of the car? Because it allowed you to see more of this great land of ours and it's wonderful natural resources? Ripe for drilling and mining and exploiting. Anyway. 
>> Wow. That's one way to commemorate the low lights of the campaign by romney. 
>>> Also it's officially crunch time for get out to vote initiatives. Here is actor steve carell's final pitch to encourage his fans to head to the polls. 
>> Why are you taking such an attitude with me? Why are you yelling at me? I don't think you should be yelled at to vote. You should want to vote. Well, I actually have billions of young fans, not millions. And why do I think they should all vote? Without putting too fine a point on it, it is a responsibility. Click here. Click here. Click here. Click here. No, wait, click here. 

[00:25:15]


>> Wow. Got to love that deadpan delivery, but his point is a serious one obviously. 
>>> Finally, total blackout. Last month I told you a few days before the election gege w. Bush would give the keynote speech at a conference in the cayman islands, one of the offshore tax havens where mitt romney has invested millions of dollars. Not ideal timing for the campaign of romney. The event went on as planned yesterday, but don't expect any kind of review of w.'S speech. According to nbc, quote, the keynote speech by the former president was totally closed to all journalists, and conjerence organizers were banned from discussing any aspect of it. An event spokesman said the restrictions were imposed by the former president's own staff. There you have it. Any advice the former president had for investing money in offshore tax havens was reserved for the people who paid $4,000 to attend the conference. By the way, "the miami herald" posted the ap's account of w's speech on their website. There's no mention of mitt romney in the piece, but check out the similar stories bar next to the piece. Topics like mitt romney's tax return fails to quiet critics and mitt romney and the 47%. I guess it could have been worse. That's "hardball" for now. Coming up next, your business with j.J. Ramberg. Take your campaign back to chicago and let us get about reuniting america. shared sharon, who emailed it to emily, who sent it to cindy, who wondered why her soup wasn't quite the same. The recipe's not the recipe... Ohhh. 

[00:28:24]


[ Female Announcer ] ...WITHOUT SWANSON. The broth cooks trust most when making soup. Mmmm! 
[ Female Announcer ] THE SECRET IS SWANSON.

>> He wants to take all the ideas from the first term, you know, the stimulus, the borrowing, obama care, all the rest, and then go back and do it all over again. 
>> You may be frustrated sometimes at the pace of change, but you know what I believe. 
>> We're four days away from a fresh start, four days away from the first day of a new beginning. 

[00:02:02]


>> You know that I'll fight for you and your family every single day as hard as I know how. You know that. 
>> We've got joy. 
>> I was going to answer that. 
>> Joy reid. Thank you both for joining us. Everybody knows the stakes are enormous. That's signals aren't just where they're at, they're being radiated on the nightly news, this program, everywhere. Aren't you impressed by romney who is often very stiff and overdressed, never unbuttons his tie, more dressed up than ever. Obama wearing the grandfather cardigan or whatever he's got on. I love that kind of sweater, my wife hates it. 
>> Fdr. 
>> Romney looks like he's going to a board meeting, and he doesn't exactly sound like a guy giving a rousing rally. He sounds like somebody -- 
>> what's with the president of the united states with that costume on today? 
>> He's doing cool obama. He needs the young vote. >>That what it is? 
>> I think right now I'd rather be barack obama than mitt romney. If you look at the polls, his campaign feels pretty good about where they are, and so he's sort of enjoying this. 
>> I get up this morning and started clocking it around 8:00. I started clocking minute to minute to minute to get the jobless number. Then I go, I did say this before, I said if it's underrated it's okay for obama. If it's up a tick it's okay. But I didn't think the good news would be 171,000 new jobs, which is way above the 125,000 predicted, and now we have three months of 170,000-plus. 
>> You notice -- 
>> so it is starting to go up substantially. 
>> If you compare it to what happened when -- four years ago, I think they lost 400,000 jobs or so this month, it is change for the better. I notice -- 
>> I'd say. 
>> I notice today there was a lot less arguing about these jobs numbers than there have been the last -- 
>> you spoke too soon. Someone who wasn't pleased with the jobs report was mitt romney. Here he is with his statement. The candidate said, quote, this is a statement, today's increase in the unemployment rate is a sad remainder that the economy is at a virtual standstill. Creating 171,000 jobs a month. 

[00:04:03]


>> Ronald reagan proved it's about trajectory. The trajectory of the jobs numbers. Do people feel like the econom is getting better? Is getting better? Are things looking better? If you look in states that matter, places like ohio where the economy has gotten substantially better and they can pinpoint why. If you're in michigan or ohio you can point to that reason why, and that reason why has barack obama's name on it. 
>> If you listen to the little clips we played, it seems as though barack obama is energized -- 
>> that's apparent. 
>> Mitt romney is going through the motions. 
>> Let's go to the facts here we have on the table. I love the atmospherics. Let's go to this peaking question. Dick nixon, richard nixon, he was a smart politician as they go, and he used to believe -- he didn't want to the run all out. He said you have to peak at the right time. He almost caught kennedy. He was three days late. Three more days he might have caught him. Humphrey almost caught nixon in '68. These eltions go through rhythms. 
>> Mitt romney peaked exactly where john kerry pked in 2004, the first debate. They both had a first great debate, got a great bounce, and it dissipated -- 
>> slowly dissipated. 
>> -- Over the course of the aign, and they couldn't get the wind back. 
>> I'm not sure obama is peaking at the best moment, but the campaign, particularly in ohio, seems to have reached a plateau, this small -- 
>> why do you comeh this debbie downer -- 
>> let me finish. 
>> Are you irish? 
>> I'm jewish, close. 
>> Dim scenario. 
>> If you look in ohio, it has narrowed in the last couple weeks, but it's hit this 4% mark and it hasn't changed -- 
>> let's go to -- 
>> obama steady -- 
>> let's go by what obama thinks 
-- not obama, romney thinks. If he thinks he's winning, why is he throwing these mud balls like this guy is hanging around with chavez? Why he throwing mud balls about jeeps going to china when it's not true? Why is he heading to pennsylvania? I just checked with neil, one of the top consultants in nnsylvania, he said four points to six points. He says they will only lose -- 

[00:06:10]


>> why are they going to nnesota? 
>> He's suggesting he's desperate. 
>> I think it is. They have had -- their marching strategy has been kitchen sink. Everythit altimes, keep throwing things at the wall and we'll hope because the economy is not good, people will vote for mitt romney even though they don't like him. 
>> Here is -- 
>> at the end of the game when they're looking at the numbers and they see they can't close that gap in ohio no matter what they've done and I think last week might have hurt them in ohio -- 
>> might have? 
>> They're going -- 
>> an older reference to the nba, when you're behind by seven or eight points, you start fouling. You have to get the ball back. The other guy gets the foul shot, nobody likes the looks o it. 
>> They ilt their entire game plan, the romney campaign, on that over 8% unemployment. Once they lost that, and that was really what mitt romney was running on, once you lose that argument, they didn't have any place else to go. They went to welfare reform and extraneous things where they're basically like let's get your voters angry, uncomfortable, get them to come up because they hate the guy. The problem is not enough americans hate barack obama -- 
>> I'll tell you what I'm impressed by is obama bringing in the cavalry. He brought in colin powell. Said are you going to endorse not, and he wouldn't tell me. Just at the right time. He got bloomberg coming out -- 
>> and by the way -- 
>> now the biggest endorsement you can get, the best surrogate on this planet is bill clinton. The former president has been all over the country for obama. He's lost his voice he's working so hard. Here he was in florida today. Let's take a look. Five stops down there. 
>> What president obama is saying, look at me, I'm always willing to work with republicans, I work with governor christie in new jersey on sandy. I tried to work with him on the budget. I tried to work with him on health care. And what they say is we'll work with the democrats if you put us in charge. Now, that's the message, and you just have to decwhether you think that's a good message. 
>> There's bilout there. Getting all the attention, but it's great. 

[00:08:12]


>> He's very popular in florida. I'll tell what you else, bloomberg, he might as well also be the mayor of broward coty. There are so many new yorkers who are dual residents. 
>> They still read "the new york post" because they think it's liberal. 
>> They still read "new york post." Florida has 22% independents, people who listen to bloomberg and clinton, and that fema thing I think is also going to hurt romney. 
>> When she was declared the victor, it was over. 
>> Florida may be too bridge for barack obama, but by putting bill clinton and all the things you mentioned, it means the romney campaign has to pay attention to it. 
>> Let's talk abt "the washington post" editorial today because it gets to the question of fouling. Of breaking the rules and going 
-- basically saying things tha even the totally independent people say is dishest. Here it is, quote, "washington post," through all the flip-flops there's been one consistency in the campaign of republican presidential nominee mitt romney. A contempt for the electorate. How else to explain his refusal to disclose essential information, how other than an assumption that voters are too dim to remember what mr. Romney has said across the years and months, to account for his breathtaking ideological shifts. Within limits all candidates say and do what they have to say and do to win. Mr. Romney by contrast seems to be betting vothave no memories, poor arithmetic skills, and a general inability to look behind the curtain. A "wizard of oz" reference. 
>> He's counting on those things. It's almost like he's in "men in black" and he thinks he has a flashy thing whee can say something and reverse himself and count on not being called for it. Between fouling and the way that mitt romney has run, in a lot of ways if this is the way you can win a presidency, if he can win this way, I think it says horrible thiabout our policies. 

[00:10:14]


>> Using the word lie. If you're willing to completely fool your base -- 
>> your own base. 
>> You mightool everybody. 
>> He's lying to the base or lying to the middle. I think one of the essential questions that will be settled on tuesday is does bs work? Can you put out the jeep ads when you have most newspapers in ohio on the front page calling you out and you still stick to it come hell or high water. Neil newhouse, the poster for mitt romney, put it best when he said we wiot be dictated to by fact checkers. Will find out on tuesday if this can work. 
>> Let me put another stake in this guy's heart, and this is bipartisan, npartisan. Jimmy carter's problem in the presidency, and I worked for him, came down to this. In the primaries he ran as an outsider against four or five liberals and won. When he got the nomination, he became eleanor roosevelt. He became a classic liberal, mondale, humphrey. When he got into office, nobody in the white house knew who he was. He had certain people who thought he was a liberal, some who thought he was a conservative, and he never got it together. That's what happens when you do the two-faced number in sequence. Here is some breaking newsm new york. Wnbc reports the new york marathon scheduled for sunday has been canceled. This is a big decision by bloomberg. Mayor bloomberg repeatedly insisted it would be held despite criticism they pulled police and other resources away from the recovery effort. The big problem I believe was staten island. This was going to be the starting point. They didn't want all those people coming out there from all around the world at the moment when they're trying to deal with a real problem like water. Thank you, david corn and joy reid. 
>>> Coming up, all eyes are on ohio. Both candidates are focusing most of their ntion in the final days on the buckeye state. Sherrod brown is also fighting to hold his seat. We'll talk to him about the situation in ohio. Busy in here. Yeah. Progressive mobile is...

>>> We've got some new polls as we enter the final week of the campaign. In ohio a brand new cnn poll shows president obama with a 3-point lead over mitt romney, but it is the all-important 50% marker, so it's 50%/47%. Good for obama. In new hampshire a new poll from new england college finds president obama with a 6-point lead. That's solid. 50%/44%. In wisconsin a newoll from st. Norbert college has the president up 9, 52%/43%. That's a surprise. Here is a poll from that hot senate race in indiana. I love this one. Joe donnelly of notre dame has an 11-point lead over richard mourdock with the libertarian candidate at 6%. Speaking for the democrats, of course. We'll be right back.???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????? 

[00:16:54]


>>> welcome back to "hardball." We've gotten to the point in this cign where you count hours, not days, and in this remaining precious time, you can tell where barack obama and mitt romney think this race will be won or lost. Just take a look at theitravel schedules through election day. For the president, colorado, iowa, wisconsin, ohio, new hampshire, virginia, and florida, of course. For governor romney, those same seven states plus his newly contested edition. He's going to pennsylvania. But zero in on today, and you can see what matters most, ohio, ohio, ohio as the late tim russert would say. Three stops for the president and two for mitt romney who began his morning in wisconsin, another key rust belt battleground. Congressman sherrod brown knows a little about buckeye state politics, and joan walsh is managing editor of salon.Com and a political analyst. Senator brown, sir, you know that state. I think you look like ohio. I think you are ohio. You're the labor guy. You're a blue collar kind of guy. You look like a senator from out there. You remind me of the late pete williams of new jersey, but you never had his problems. This is the question, why are you having a tough race? I don't get this guy running against you, this kid. Is it all this money being pumped in there? What's made this even interesting, not for you. 
>> Well, it's $31 million, they spent more money against me than any senate race in the country. We figure it's oil company money and wall street money. 
>> Is this americans for prosperity, the koch brothers? 
>> It's all different groups. It's not a super pac, it's not disclosed money. It's directed by karl rove. He's directing the choir and this group comes in -- 
>> crossroads gps. I know it well. 
>> It's 45,000 ads so far. There are eight groups right now in the state together running -- eight individual groups running ads. The only way you fight that is grassroots, and we've got a great grassroots operation. Sherrodbrown.Com, people can join us. We've got lots of people that have done everything from small contributions to knocking on doors and doing phone banks, and that's how you beat this kind of money. It's the only way a progressive populist democrat in a state like ohio wins. 

[00:19:13]


>> There's some things I keep worrying about. Ohio is one rry about. I wonder about the secretary of state out there. I wonder about the stumble we had last time, the people kept questioning -- I'm talking about 2004, real questions about the count out in ohio. What do you see? What do you see -- we have 650 oblawyers in cuyahoga county being on the lookout for any kind of monkey business out there. What do you hear? What's coming? 
>> Well, I think -- 
>> in terms of trouble. 
>> I think the obama campaign -- there may be trouble. You know, I think we're all worried about voter suppression. We're somewhat worried about diebold, about getting the ground game out, but the ground game is excellent, chris. I feel optimistic. It's not a slam dunku're right, senator brown's race should not be close. He's amazing, he's excellent, but they've thrown a lot of money at it and got very cocky after john kasich won the governorship, but the optimistic and positive thing is a year and a half ago the white house -- the campaign was looking for a way to win back the white house without ohio. They were very concerned about ohio. They were looking at the sunbelt as being better than the rust belt. Now the rust belt is coming through for the president, and it really is white working class voters who are doing much better for the president, much more behind the president than they are in most other places in the country, and I think senator brown can talk to that. 
>> Let's go back to senator brown. I forgot the intellectuals around the president were talking we're going to run a new democratic party. I said why are you guys doing that? You have to dance with the one that brung you. The democratic party is based on the industrial people, the part of the country that built this country. Your thoughts about this, senator brown. How does it affect the race, the fact they're back fighting it out for ohio, not thinking these other things out in the untry. 

[00:21:16]


>> Joan's comments were exactly right as yours were, chris, except it's not the rust belt, it's the tech belt now, and there are a lot great things going on. Our unemployment rate around the time of the auto rescue before it took e recovery act, the unemployment rate in this stateas 10.6%. Now it's 7%. Not good enough, still tany unemployed people that want jobs, but you can see the auto rescue. You can see what's happening with the president's emphasis on trade enforcement, on community colleges, on small business, and this state's coming back and we're seeing huge numbers of jobs being -- growth and manufacturing, 500,000 new manufacturing jobs in this country over the last two years. We hadn't seen that in ten years. So -- 
>> why do you think romney, who has a brain, bet against the auto industry? Why do you think he did -- he told them basically forget about it? Why did he say go bankrupt? Why would he do that? What's the politics of that? Is that just ideology playing to the hard right? 
>> I would never try to ascribe any motives or judgment with mitt romney because his position changes so frequently. But I think that's the right question. And part of the answer to that is how desperate this toledo jeep ad looked when it's clear the auto rescue has worked here. Everybody believes it worked. People forget it a hard political call three y ago, wasn't a hard call in terms of substance, but a hard political call for congress and the president, but we did the right thing. It was several things. It was bipartisanship back then with senator voinovich and president bush and president obama. It was a partnership between the federal government and local communities and businesses, and we always pt a focus on how do you get manufacturing jobs back and focus on the middle class? That's why it's been a success. That's why it's working politically, and that's, frankly, why governor romney is so desperate in ohio right now. 
>> One thing I have learned is my jeep me from toledo. I never knew where it came from. Now I have to thank the people of toledo tonight for making my jeep. I love it. I haven't had a single problem with it. Ank you, sherrod brown, thank you, joan walsh. 

[00:23:24]


>>> Up next, president obama won the endorsement of mayor michael bloomberg, and todayitt romney won the endorsement of another one-percenter. I can't wait to see what that is. 
>>> This sunday join me for a special edition of "hardball" at 7:00 eastern. We have special guests on sunday, just us, vice president joe bideis going to join us on "hardball" sunday night at 5:00 and 7:00. This is "hardball," the place for politics. 

[00:26:51]


>>> I saw a campaign ad today. You tell me what this means. 
>> America is facing problems of historic proportions, and your vote could mean the difference between prosperity and ruin, but who will you choose? Will you vote for the elite, harvard educated lawyer who overhauled the health care system or the elite, multimillionaire lawyer who overhauled the health care system? Choose wisely, america. 
>> Back to "hardball." First a plug for mitt romney from "the simpsons." Here is mr. Burns, the fictional and highly unpopular owner of springfield's nuclear plant, in pre-election panic mode. 
>> I have to say, despite those unimaginably horrible good job numbers, we're feeling pretty confident. There's only one thing that might deny us the presidency that is the god-given property of the republican party. 
>> The 47% tape? 
>> Nope. 
>> The empty chair? 
>> Nope. 
>> Cayman islands? 
>> Not a problem. 
>> Swiss bank accounts? 10,000 bet? I like to fire people? 
>> No. It's a shaggy dog story about an actual shaggy dog. Apparently while on vacation old mitt strapped his mutt to the roof of his car for a brief 650-mile jaunt. So tonight we will explain what truly happened. Now, seamus, what did you think of being strapped to the roof of your dada's car? What's that? You liked being tied to the roof of the car? Because it allowed you to see more of this great land of ours and it's wonderful natural resources? Ripe for drilling and mining and exploiting. Anyway. 
>> Wow. That's one way to commemorate the low lights of the campaign by romney. 
>>> Also, it's officially crunch time for get out the vote initiatives. Here is actor steve carell's final pitch to encourage his fans to head to the polls. 
>> Why are you taking such an attitude with me? Why are you yelling at me? I don't think you should be yelled at to vote. You should want to vote. Well, I actually have billions of young fans, not millions. And why do I think they should all vote? Without putting too fine a point on it, it is a responsiby. Click here. Click here. Click here. Click here. No, wait, click here. 

[00:29:12]


>> Wow. Got to love that deadpan delivery, but his point is a serious one obviously. 
>>> Finally, total blackout. Last month I told you a few days before the election george w. Bush would give the keynote speech at a conference in the cayman islands, one of the offshore tax havens where mitt romney has investens of llars. Not ideal timing for the campaign of romney. The event went on as planned yesterday, but don't expect any kind of review of w.'S speech. According to nbc, quote, the keynote speech by the former president was totally closed to all journalists, and conference organizers were banned from discussing any aspect of it. The restrictions were imposed by the former president's own staff. There you have it. Any advice the former president had for investing money in offshore tax havens was reserved for the people who paid $4,000 to attend the conference. By the way, "the miami herald" posted the ap's account of w's speech on their website. There's no mention of mitt romney in the piece, but check out the similar stories bar next to the piece. Topics like mitt romney's tax return fails to quiet critics and mitt romney and the 47%. I guess it could have been worse. 
>>> Up next, we'll delve into some of the hottest senate races around the country, and senator claire McCaskill will be here with her closing arguments against todd akin. 
>>> Coming up at 8:00 eastern, coming together, a benefit telethon to aid victims of hurricane sandy featuring the great bruce springsteen and jon bon jovi. You're watching "hardball," the place for politics. Back to "hardball." 

[00:34:46]


>>> Welcome back to "hardball." The fight for the u.S. Senate can be as significant as the fight for president. Right now looks advantage democrats. The latest analysis is it appears more likely than not democrats will hold the majority, perhaps by only the slimmest of margins. There you have it. And the catch up is the massachusetts senate race een republican scott brown and democratic challenger elizabeth warren, and right now the clear politics poll average has warren up by 4.5. Politico is up there in boston covering the race. Dave, thanks for joining us from politico. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Let me ask you about that race. It seems like something happened a couple weeks ago. Was it the mayor's endorsement and putting all the troops? But that's only 8% of the electorate. Wh got her on top of the race? 
>> I think it's women voters that were in brown's camp, still sort of flirting with him this summer in polls, moving towards warren, and I talked to some pollsters and voters on the ground today, and that's all you hear about on the airwaves, in the messaging. It's all designed to court women voters. Some of them declaring themselves independents, although democrats have a big registration advantage up here 3 to 1, but I think if you look inside the polls, that's what's given warren the lead. Brown still beats her among independents overall, but he's losing female voters. She has widened the gender gap. 
>> You're going to have a big turnout. Not like january of 2010 when he won that first time. Here are the closing ads from warren and brown. First up, rren's. Let's listen. 
>> For all the families still struggling, all the people who deserve a decent job and the women who deserve equal pay, for our kids crushed by student debt and our parents worried about medicare, know this. My fight is for you. 
>> Well, here is the part of scott brown's ad called people over a party that includes a shot of brown th president obama. Let's watch. 

[00:36:50]


>> Let me tell you, things would be a lot better in this country if more people in washington were willing to think of themselves and work with each other for the good of america. 
>> I wouldn't have thought he would be a flash in the pan, but if he loses, I don't know what's up for him in the future. Let's go down e east coast. Connecticut, I thought murphy has a real challenge on his HANDS with McMahon, but he seems to be up now. 
>> Right, right. It looks like he's solidified a small lead there. LOOK, linda McMahon lost in the best republican year ever in connecticut. While she had tons of resources republicans love and she's able to spend a ton of money, put it on the air, it just seems like connecticut is not being sold, so it looked like murphy is going back and that's going to be a safe democratic hold. 
>> We live in washington here. The virginia senate race is neck and neck. The clear politics average in this race has kaine up by a point. The most recent quinnipiac poll had him leading by four. Which direction is that headed? 
>> I think it's headed toward kaine, but a lot of it is dependent on the presidential win. It's predicted to end up in the democratic column. You're talking about margins of error and especially in northern virginia. That's going to be obviously a more diverse part of the state. That's where kaine needs people to come out, and I think he's been the better candidate. 
>> Did you see how close allen was trying to grab himself close to romney? Trying to mate with him, trying to hold so close to him. It wasn't clear romney wanted to be all close to him. It was interesting to watch that nonmating game going on the other night, and that backs up -- let's go to ohio. We just had sherrod brown. We got his numbers, by the way, a lead over josh mandel, the very young opponent of five points. I think that should be so much higher. What's going on out there? 
>> Again, I think you have some presidential headwinds. You have so much money -- sherrod brown has told you i think numerous times he's had more outside money spent against him than any other democratic senator, so that has taken its toll, but josh mandel has had some missteps. There's some perceptn that he's a little too young, not really ready for prime time, and that's what's given brown an edge there. I think brown ends up winning that race. 

[00:39:17]


>> I thought he was perfect for that state, sherrod brown. Thanks, david catanese, from politico. In missouri incumbent democratic SENATOR claire McCaskill leads todd akin by five points. The campaign just dropped a devastating ad. LET'S WATCH THE latest McCaskill ad. Here it is. 
>> Is todd akin fit to serve in the nate? Mitt romney doesn't think so. 
>> What he said was indefensible, was wrong. It was offensive, and he should step out of the race. 
>> And he's not alone. 
>> Todd akin is not at that convention, told by his own party to stay home. 
>> Even republican senators from missouri called todd akin totally unacceptable. 
>> Frankly, he would not be welcomed by republicans in t united states senate. 
>> It was offensive, and he should step out of the race. 
>> I'M claire McCaskill, and i approve this message. 
>> Was that you playing the piano in that one, senator? 
>> No. 
>> That was a pretty devastating ad. You have all the republicans who had basically ran scared from the guy. Are they all still scared of him or have they regrouped since that ad -- since those pictures were taken? 
>> Some of them have kind of lukewarm endorsed him, but here the biggest news in missouri this week is that the national republicans have snuck in the back door after trying to reassure women all over america that they understood why everyone was offended at todd akin's beliefs. They have now piled in, you know, yesterday I think they dropped a million and half dollars on tv for todd akin in the closing days of this campaign. So we're having to work hard, but that's the only speed i know, and it's -- you know, there's some headwinds in missouri this time, but we have really -- have a strong ground game. We need everybody to come out and vote. It's very important that people stay engaged, and we hope that people go on our website and help us with some virtual phone banking or maybe 5 bucks over the weekend so we can get all of our -- we had to add to our media this week just because of all the money that snuck in in the last 48 hours. 

[00:41:24]


>> Well, this question might help. I will put it to you pretty strongly. Anybody that would accuse someone of rape which carried a sentence would believe that they were raped and they would have the personal experiencef having been raped. Who islking about when he suggests this category of women who accuse someone of rape, which is -- used to be a capital crime but it's close to it. Who are these women that he's talking about? Where does he get that thing about legitimate as opposed to these other cases? Who are these people -- where does he get this memory bank from -- of women who have charged men with rape? Where does this happen? 
>> Chris, I t many years as a courtroom prosecutor and prosecuted hundreds of rape cases and worked with many of the rape victims on a personal basis, and I don't think people realize what women go through when they seek justice in this area. I think what congressman akin was trying to do was in his mind stify his beliefs, and that is that somehow a rape victim should not be allowed to access emergency contraception, and in order to justify that belief, i think he's trying to, you know, hold on to some mythical power that a woman has to not get pregnant if she has been raped, and clearly that's wrong, and that's why so many republicans have distanced themselves fr todd akin. It's not just what he said, chris, it's what he believes on a number of subjects. This is sody who wants to abolish the minimum wage, who believes that employers, that the boss, has the freedom to discriminate against people based on their gender. This is somebody who is on the fringe. He is going to be part of that -- you know, he's very close with michele -- I make the joke he makes michele bachmann look like a hippie. 
>> That's a hell of a push. Thank you for coming on, senator McCASKILL. Good luck in your race. We've had you on our show so many years. Hope to have you on next year. 
>> Thanks. 
>>> President obama has garnered praise and endorsements following his handling of hurricane sandy. Could it win him the election? This is "hardball," the place for politics. 

[00:45:05]


>>> One thing is for sure, both campaigns for president aren't ending on a high note by any means. Candor media looked back at the last week of campaign ads, and the obama campaign commercials have been 85% negative. You think that sounds bad until you look at the what the romney campaign has done in the last week. The romney ads have been 99% negative. 99%. And most of the 1% of positive ads were some lingering ads in spanish. So all the english language stuff is utterly awful. We'll be right back. 

[00:47:54]


>>> No matter how bad the storm hits, no matter how tough times are, we're all in this together. We rise or fall as one nation and as one people. 
>> We're back now on the campaign trail in ohio reflecting on the damage hurricane sandy wreaked on the east coast. The response has been seen as overwhngly positive. Supporting the role of government, a central issue in this campaign. From the "new york times," a big storm requires big government. Usa today, sandy clarifying federal government's role. Praise for barack obama, chris christie. And in the "lando sentinal," hurricane sandy proves case for obama. Joining me is the district along the jersey coast down to asbury park and cynthia tucker is from the university of georgia and a syndicated columnist. Cynthia, I want to talk to the congressman about your district. Would you describe verbally what is the condition of the jersey coast where you represent? 
>> It's really catastrophic, chris. I've spent the last few days going to the various sections and you see houses completely destroyed, washed away. Businesses destroyed, the boardwalk, the beach club. And so many people displaced. I mean, today I was mainly concerned in trying to get food and water and shelter for people because it's getting colder out. So this is really catastrophic. I've never seen anything like it. 
>> How do you grade the effort of the governor up there, you guys in congress, have you all been able to do this together? It's going to get worse because these things tend to get worse. When people are out of electricity for five days, it's worse than three days. 
>> The fact that everyone is working together, both the president and the governor and others is very important. I mean, obviously we want this to be bipartisan and it has been. We're trying to get fema in there. I spent most of the day trying to get fema in to the vas towns and setting up headquarters and going door to door to help people. But we've been getting total cooperation from the white house and from governor christie. 

[00:50:00]


>> Let me bring in cynthia tucker here. This whole question here, let me look at some of these numbers. 78% think the president handled it pretty well. I want to show you this picture of the president with this woman at the airport. Let's take a look at this. I think people are going to remember this. 
>> We're going to help you get it all together. I promise. I promise. You're going to be okay. Everybody's safe. That's the most important thing and then we're going to get this whole thing set up. 
>> You know, cynthia, one thing that I liked about this, and this isn't politics, when the president said the other night, I'll return your call in 15 minutes. That has been a critique of this white house, that it has been a bit isolated, a bit in a bubble. You know what I'm talking about. Hard for politicians to get to this president. 
>> Yes. But this was a crisis, chris. What you've heard mostly from politicians is that the president isn't a schmoozer. He's not a back slapper. And I think that's probably true but I haven't heard anybody say that the president isn't available at the important moments and I think it was critically important that the president said to the governors, to mayor bloomberg, you can have my number at the white house because they were in a better position to tell the preside what was going on on the ground. He was also, of course, hearing from fema. But sometimes it's just good for christie, for bloomberg, for andrew cuomo, governor of new york, to know that they can call the president to vent if they need to. So I don't think it's any great surprise that in a crisis the president was immediately available in his role as commander in chief. 

[00:52:02]


>> You know, I want to get into politics now with congressman pallone. You saw the president how he didn't respond very well in the first debate. This he subjected very well. Think blunt here in terms of reaction time, focus, connection, schmoozing a little bit. That's part of politics. 
>> Well, as cynthia said, this is a crisis and I think the president has been totally up to this crisis. I mean, they set up -- fema set up a headquarters in trenton today where they had about 100 people and now 700 people being sent out to the various communities to help and this is a direct result, I think, of president obama's statement that we're going to be there and we're going to be there quickly. 
>> Are people going to be able to vote this tuesday in jersey? 
>> Well, we're going to do whatever we can. It is a concern because most of my town does not have power, which means that the voting places at this point don't have electricity. So we're working with the white house and with the state and also with our county clerk to try to make sure that every voting place is available. We're talking aboubringing in generators. That may be necessary because of the fact that we don't have electric in most of these towns. So I'm hoping that the electric -- the power is up. If it's not, we're going to bring in generators and do whatever we can to make sure people vote and get the word about where they vote. 
>> Cynthia, last thought about what you're watching here. We have a picture of the president hugging this woman in jersey and governor chris christie is behind him there. He's hanging with this woman. I have to tell you, I'm affected by this. I think this is what people should be doing in politics more often than they do. 
>> Absolutely most people would be. The president may not be a schmoozer, but he is a real man who relates to the problems of ordinary people. And it shows up very much in his contact with that woman. These are people, in some cases, who have lost everything. They don't have houses. You know, they don't have furniture or clothes. She is distraught. And the president connects with her very, very easily. And I think that people across the country seeing that footage will remember that and understand that this is a president who can connect with ordinary americans. 

[00:54:31]


>> Well, thank you very much. U.S. Congressman frank and thanks for coming on "hardball" and cynthia tucker, thanks as always. By the way, politics is always a learning profen. I think the president has learned a lot from this thing. We all have. Tonight ateastern, join msnbc for a special telethon, of course, for the victims of the hurricane featuring the boss, bruce springsteen and bon jovi. When we return, it's a simple question. You're watching "hardball," the place for politics.@?? 

[00:58:39]


>>> let me finish tonight with this. The good president. Isn't that the question? Is he a good president? If he is, keep him there. If not, look elsewhere. Are you personally proud that barack obama is our president? Does he measure up to the mystery books? Ended our rely generals on the emergency room for people's health care, ended up unpopular and wise war in iraq, cut the jobless rate from 10% where w. Had it skyrocketing and doubled the stock market and your 401(k). Is he a good president? He brought us through clean four yeof scandalless government. You have the weekend to think about it and then vote like your country depends on it, because it does. And that's "hardball" for now. Join me sunday night at 5:00 and 7:00 for a special "hardball" with vice president joe biden. Coming up next, "the ed show"

Hometime and that's installing a grill on our side porch. >>Miriam: The first thing was the base. And we built a frame with steel studs, covered it with concrete backerboard, then laid up some nice veneer stone to match the home's foundation. Now once we top it off with some granite, we'll be ready for the grill itself. >>Dean: We're also going to get some good advice on how to size up the last piece of furniture going in the great room. And show you an amazing hands-free system that can literally fill a house with live music. I can't wait to see that in operation. >>Miriam: Yeah, it should be pretty cool. So you better stick around. 
  ??????
>> got a new guy. >> Well it's about time. >> Where's the gig? >> Gmc. Proud to lend a helping hand to hometime. 
  ??????
>>miriam: There you go dan. >>Dan: Awesome. Thank you. >>Miriam: Yep. Last time we got a very good start at setting the stone along the sides of our grill here on the side porch. And before we finished that, we want to talk a little bit about what we're going to put on top. The stone's a little bit rough for plates so we're going to be going with something a little bit smoother. And since we only need a little bit, we thought let's see if tony thill has some scrap materials that might do the trick. He's a countertop fabricator and installer that we've worked with many times before, and it didn't take too long to find something that will work very well on the grill. >>Tony thill: Basically, this is going to be a surround for an outdoor grill in an outdoor kitchen. And what we'll do is we certainly like to use the forklift anytime that we can being that the granite is rather heavy. Unfortunately, can't bring it into the house for some of those larger pieces. That certainly would be nice. This is called "nettuno" and it is a granite very similar to a typhoon bordeaux granite which is real popular today. You know the pieces really weren't all that intricate. So what I used is what's known as a "bridge saw" and it spins a 14" diamond 

[00:02:03]


blade on there. And it sprays water on there to keep not only the diamond's cool but to also remove the sludge that is created by the saw blade. And they just wanted a simple standard polished edge. An 8th inch radius on the top.8th inch radius on the bottom. You know it works really good. It stands up really good. It's actually polished rock. Really tough. We're going to put a sealer on there that'll help keep the moisture off of it, beaded up on it and not only that, but provide a nice outdoor place around the grill. >>Miriam: I got to hand it to tony. He had a gorgeous piece of stone left over from another job. Cut it into 3 pieces and got it to fit perfectly right over the top of our base. And with the edges rounded on the top and the bottom, we are all set to go. You ready buck? >>Bucky: Yep. >>Miriam; you take that end and I'll take this one. >>Bucky: Sure. >>Dean: Okay, so we've got all of the stone now on the front of our grill and all the sides. Our liner's in position. We are ready to set the grill. Okay guys. You want to help me out here? Now again, this is a built-in grill. I'll get this out of way here. So the cover, the grill, all the controls and everything are self contained in this unit. Of course, this is our cabinetry over here. All right guys, go ahead and lift it up. Let me ... I will get the center here. Setting the grill in place is pretty straightforward. With this liner, we know exactly where we're going. We have electrical connection. Have a gas connection. So we'll have to make those. But, boy after all the work constructing this stuff, it's just fun to see the thing settle into position. >>Miriam: With getting the grill set is a good start but we do have a couple other things that we want to install. One is our trash can holder. First thing we need to do is take out the drawer out of its cabinet. We'll set it into the opening. Make sure its level & plumb. >>Dan: When we were actually putting in the stone, we were very c panels, making sure that the stone was flat. So when we put everything in, they laid pretty flat. Nice and even across the 

[00:04:03]


bottom so it looks well- thought out. Looks like we actually thought 10 minutes ahead before we put them in. >>Miriam: Then we'll secure it right into the metal studs with a few screws. Now we want to make sure that this drawer works absolutely perfectly. So it takes a little bit of time, a little bit of fussing to make sure that with the stone and the steel studs that everything works right. That it's all plumb. And it comes in and out perfectly. >>Dan: You know, you have to aware of how it's going to turn out before you start it. >>Miriam: The last thing we have to go in is a set of double doors that's going to enclose the cabinet that we have down below. These will get installed the same way as our trash drawer except that we'll be going through some tile this time. >>Dan: We're actually going to be fastening through the tile and stone that we ran through. So it's basically, put the doors in. Get it where you want it. Mark the holes. Drill out the holes with a concrete bit. Put an anchor in. And then attach the doors. I think the most important thing is making sure that they work and they're not racked. If you put them in racked and they don't close properly, it looks like you screwed up. So get 'em really close to where you want 'em, then make sure that everything's not racked. Everything works. Closes/shuts easily. And then you put it in. >>Miriam: All right. We have our grill, our doors and our trash bin in place here. Now we're all set to set the countertops that tony worked so hard on for us. >>Dean: Okay. We're attaching our countertops now that tony prepared for us. We're using basically 3 pieces. One on each side and then one in the back. We're attaching these to our grill using the same mortar that we used for the stonre. So the whole technique here is dan's put down a couple globs of some of the mortar and then I'm just going to set the countertop in place. And then we'll just slowly but surely kind of tap this into the position. Now what we're gng to be doing is we want this countertop to end up at exactly the same level all the way around the entire grill. So what we're doing is we've cut a shim so we know the exact 

[00:06:03]


width that we want off of that top. >>Dan: I've never done this before: Set granite on it's top. It's different because you really can't shim it because you have to use concrete so it's almost like setting tile - but they're bigger. >>Dean: We watched tony do this many times so we know that we want this piece to match that piece exactly. And what he does, he takes a razor knife and he runs it across the top of the seam. You about ready to do the ol' razor blade test? >>Dan: Aaah ... Not yet. >>Dean: Not yet. Not yet he says. The trick here is getting everything so that the 3 pieces are on the same plane. We don't want, you know, the outside piece going like this and the middle piece kinda going like this. Everything's got to be just perfectly flat. >>Dan: There is. Yep. >>Dean: Woof. >>Dan: There it is. Nice job. >>Dean: All it takes. >>Dan: The magic touch. >>Dean: Now we introduce the razor blade. Give it the test. Look at that. >>Dan: Sweet. >>Dean: Tony goes right across the seam like this and any little edge, of course, will be caught by that side of the razor knife. You know, it's not quite as perfect as tony would like it, but I would say for our pay- grade, lenny, that's looking pretty good. Okay, so now we are already to fill the seam. Tony gave me some color epoxy here. It's a 2-part mixture. One color of each we tested and this is the hardener right here. So what I did is i actually took a little bit of each of these, mixed it into the center. Added a little bit of hardener. And this is the color that we came up with. You can see right over here that it matches ... I think it matches the stone pretty darn well. So this is what's going on the seam. Okay lenny, ready? >>Dean: Basically for a seam you spread the material. Ooze the stuff in it. Squeeze it back. Get a little purge through. Strike it off. And then hopefully dean can do his magic with the colors. >>Dean: It really is a good idea to dry-fit these especially for us when we're not used to doing this all the time. You really want to kinda test to make sure that all your systems are working before you commit yourself with a bunch of concrete underneath. Okay. That 

[00:08:05]


looks pretty good there, lenny. >>Dan: What do you think? >>Miriam: Now for the base itself, it's the same niagara dolomite that we have on the foundation here. It's a limestone from chilton, wisconsin. The only difference is they cut it much thinner at the factory so you get the look of a full piece of stone without all of that extra weight. Another thing that adds to the illusion is how they cut these corner pieces for you. You can see how they slice away some of the middle here. But after you install it, it looks like a full piece of stone. >>Dan: Setting these countertops on an uneven surface to make itt perfectly flat and even, you definitely have to be a little patient. You can't just hope it's going to work. You got to make sure it's going to work. And by doing your mud the right consistency, spreading it out so you have room to move and sliding that piece around, it's like setting tile to kinda build it down and flush it out. It's kind of tricky. We're just putting mud on the perimeter of this stuff and the more mud we put on, the more mud we fight setting it. So you want to put it in, have some room for the mud to go some place when you put the piece in. Basically, mud can spread out. And then if it's hollow underneath, it's a short span to granite's inch and quarter. We're fine. >>Dean: Okay. Well things look pretty darn good here. Again, tony did a beautiful job on this. We have a little tuckpointing. We used some of our concrete underneath here. But other than that, we're just about ready to fire things up and test out the grill. >>Dan: So what are cooking by the way? Anything good? >>Dean: I don't know. We'll have to figure that out lenny. >>Dan: Okay. >>Dean: Well the last piece of furniture going into the great room is a grand piano. So the question always comes up "what size is the right size grand piano?". So we thought we'd talk with duane norton. How do you go about recommending the right size piano to people? How do that whole process go about? >>Duane norton: You know, first of all, every piano is about 5' wide. So now we're really just talking about the depth of the piano. A baby grand by 

[00:10:06]


definition... And these are all loose definitions...Is about 5' long. And then we go to the next size which is a mid-size grand which is about 6'. >>Dean: And that's about the size of this piano. >>: That's about the size of this one here. And then the concert grand's really go from 7' to 9'. And of course, that 9' piano has the power to cut through an 80-piece orchestra and be heard in the cheap seats without a mic. >>Dean: What else do you do to help people kind of dial in on exactly what size they should get? >>: We have a really great tool for this that we can send pele home with. >>Dean: I've seen the paper ones before. >>: Yeah, this is a real nice one that go into the home and you can lay this out and, of course, the floor mat goes all the way up to a 7'6" piano. >>Dean: Okay. >>: So what most of our customers do is when they lay this out in the house, they realize you know I probably can't fit that or that or that but you know, maybe I can get that 5'10" or that 6'1". And you can kind of tuck it in over here and get a little better feel for how that's going to work. And of course, because it's a rounded edge, we can tuck these into corners and, again, performance level, the bigger sizes will play better. >>Dean: So get the biggest piano you can get. >>: Get the biggest piano you can get in your room and that you can afford. >>Dean: Say, I was playing with this before. Again, what do you call this a fallboard? >>: It's a slow-fall fallboard. This is a great feature on pianos. The piano we have at our house is 25 years old. Doesn't have one of these on it. Of course, my kids dropped the fallboard on their fingers when they were little. >>Dean: That's a lot of weight coming down. >>: They did it once though, so I mean they're smart enough not to ... But it is a great feature especially if you have grandkids or if you do a lot of entertaining you know, sometimes things happen and that'll never hurt anybody. >>Dean: So now being kind of a construction guy, I'm curious what kind of woods go into building these? I've always wondered that. >>: Well there's a lot of 

[00:12:07]


different types of woods. The main structural wood is maple. You'll see a lot of maple in the pin block which these tuning pins are driven into. >>Dean: Where you have a lot of pressure that you have to maintain over time. >>: A lot of torque. They say these pianos have like 22, 23, 24,000 lbs. Of pressure and so that maple is really holding that stringing in place. >>Dean: How about the sound board? Isn't that kind of like the key thing that everybody worries about? >>: Yeah. That's the speaker. That's where it all starts. The better quality pianos use solid spruce sound boards. Basically, they're solid planks, tongue & grooved together across the sound board. Also, the better quality pianos are going to be tight-grained spruce, because sound travels along the grain lines. >>Dean: Well I've got to tell ya, this is all good information. I do appreciate you spending the time. There's just a lot of things to consider ..... Now anybody that's watched this show knows we like using pre- mixed pre-packaged concrete. It's very easy for the do-it- yourselfers. Also, many pros will use it if the job isn't too large. For example, here is a great mix we've used many times. It's a perfect formulation of concrete & sand to give us a type s mortar. It's a very strong type of mortar that can be used for structural walls above & below ground. And the masons actually used it when we set the foundation stone, as well as the stone floor, for the screen porch. They're dealing in fairly large quantities on the job so they use a mixer to blend up with water to the proper consistency. Again, it's what they refer to as type s. The alternative for non-structural applications above ground would be a type n mortar mix. Now this is a mix a lot of people will end up using around their house. It's a perfect formulation of cement, aggregate and sand to be used on things like sidewalks, landings and footings. For smaller jobs like the footings we put in under the deck in judd's backyard, you can easily mix it by hand with a mud tub or wheelbarrow and a shovel or a hoe to blend it together some water. Just dump it in the 

[00:14:07]


hole and by the next day it's rock-hard and you're ready to build. For some applications, it's nice to have a concrete that sets up a little bit faster. This is a formulation called "fast-setting concrete mix". For this stuff, we just grab the red bags. And this is what we used setting the lamp post in the yard a couple of shows ago. The beauty is that once you've dug a hole, you just pour the mix in, filling it up to within a few inches of the top. Then you add the water. Kind of soaking the mix and within 20 to 40 minutes, it's hard enough to hold the post firmly in place. Now you can see where this would be a real time saver if you're doing something like a fence. If you're able to set rails an hour after you do the post, it's going to save you a lot of time. We have an application coming up like that. We're going to be doing a post for a mail box. Don't know if we'll get to it today though or not. Okay, with all the mortar set now, we're ready to unveil the grill. Of course, underneath this is all stainless steel except of course, for our glass right here. This allows us to watch the food cook. We don't have to worry about lifting up the hood here and releasing all the heat. Another thing that helps to take a look at your cooking when it's dark out, is these halogen lights turn on. It's a nice way to be able to view your cooking. >>Miriam: We have 3 main burners which can be separated with these dividers here so you can cook different temperatures on different burners. They're also set kind of low in the grill and that's going to prevent any food from getting burned during any possible flare-ups. We also have 2 back burners here which will come in handy when we're using our rotisserie. >>Dean: Then we have these flavor grids that get placed over each one of the burners. Now what these do is they help to kind of even the heat out across the whole area. And then the juices of your meat drip down on top of those and they just really help to flavor the entire meal. Once these are in, then we can pop in our cooking grids. Now these have sort of a burnished surface which creates sort of a non-stick surface without having to apply a non- stick surface and of course, with these high heats, could 

[00:16:08]


flake off over time. With a burner surface you don't have to worry about it. Pop the last one in, and then okay miriam, you got that little tool there? >>Miriam: Yep. >>Dean: And if you've ever worked with these and want to take a burner out when it's nice and hot, they have a little tool here. You just pop this guy in like so. Lift it up. And you can pull it right out - no problem. Very nice, huh? >>Miriam: Mmm-hmm. Now each burner has it's own control knob including the one in the back. This knob is for the smoker. It has it's own 3000 btu burner and iou can put wood chips or charcoal in here. Of course, it works best if you get that wet with some water, beer or wine. And then any drips that might happen, are caught in this drawer which has a disposable lining which makes cleanup nice & easy. >>Dean: Now this also comes with rotisserie. I mounted that on the side. The rod just slides in here like so. Very easy to hook up. And then if you're doing something like a chicken, they also have a holder you put right on the rotisserie. These I guess kind of go in here to hold that chicken in place. And if you're doing something bigger like a turkey, not a problem. They also have turkey holders. So I'll tell ya, there's a lot of great meals that are going to be made on a grill like this. >>Miriam: What should we do first? >>Dean: I don't know. I know the boys are waiting to try it out. >>Miriam: Ahh-ahhh. Me too. >>Dean: We're probably start with hot dogs and work our way up from there. Well, we're all kind of wondering how did we do sizing up the piano for the great room here. They always move these things with the legs off to get them through the doors and everything. So there is a little bit of assembly required once they get it inside. >>: Realistically, when we get into a house, all we're really doing is assembling the legs and putting it in the spot that the owner of the piano wants it in. You know, sometimes we're using mallet hammers and things like that to pound some of the leg pieces together and sometimes there's a little gasp and things like that when that occurs. But that's a normal process with assembling a product that weights 700 - 800 pounds in the house and getting all those parts to fit just right. >>Miriam: A traffic flow could 

[00:18:08]


be an issue if you have this in a central location, but it is only 5' wide and 5'10" long so this one actually worked out perfectly for us. Now one thing we haven't mentioned is that we had a computerized player system put into this one and john sagissor is here to get us up to speed on that. >>Dean: Now john, when you take a look at this piano you have no idea that there's any player function attached to this. I mean, you don't see it at all. >>John sagissor: Dean, that's correct. Everything is housed underneath the piano so it's built-in, embedded and invisible. All the key solenoids are housed in this rail cover. >>Dean: This guy right here. >>: Right. And then we have a cpu, speakers and the iq controller which is actually connecting to the ipad. >>Dean: So how does it work that the system actually plays the piano keys? How does that whole thing? >>: Well the 88 key solenoids are actually assembled in that rail cover that we saw under there. >>Dean: The big black box down there. >>: Right. And the key is much longer than what we see on the keyboard bed here. It's about a foot long and it pivots on a fulcrum. So like a teeter- totter, the solenoid pushes the tail end of the key upward causing a forward motion which you see here on the piano. >>Dean: I think one question a lot of people have is when you install something like this on a nice piano, does it kind of dampen the overall performance of the piano? Does it kind of slow it down or does it just impinge it a little bit? >>: No. Matter of fact, because when it's in resting position as it is right now, I could play the piano. I wouldn't even know there's a player system in it. You play the piano normally, it functions just like your piano always would. >>Dean: So the solenoids are underneath the keys so nothing is touching it. >>: Nothing touching it. And when it's actually being played, it's better for the instrument because it's like our bodies, we need to exercise. And when you have a player system in it, it's good for the piano because it's going to hold it's tune longer. It's going to hold up. >>Dean: You don't want one of these just sitting around in the living room for long periods of time. >>: No. >>Dean: Now when you think of the old player pianos, they have the paper roll coming down and that would play all the keys at exactly the same volume. But with this system, this system allows the possibility of striking the keys at different levels, right? >>: Levels of expression. Matter 

[00:20:09]


of fact, this is a high-res system which offers us 1,024 levels of expression per note, which is quite a gamut. And that means, we can actually replicate the original artist performance faithfully. >>Dean: And again, you're controlling and picking all of your songs using the ipad? >>: Right. In using itunes, we can actually store, categorize all of our music and then select whatever song we want. >>Dean: So like a james taylor? >>: James taylor. We cue up james taylor,and then select our song choice and it starts playing. >>Dean: How about a classical one? >>: Sure. We just go back here, and we can select clair de lune. >>Dean: All right. And then this also allows you to put vocals in along with the piano playing. >>: Right. Because we have the powered speakers under there. If we have a particular song that has orchestration or live vocals, we can enjoy that along with the piano. >>Dean: How about frank sinatra? >>: Yep, we can do that. Here we go. A little "my way". >>Dean: Okay, so here he's playing piano and singing. How about like a rock band like the eagles or something like that. So there you get guitars and ... >>: Now we're getting into my favorite stuff, so yeah, we can listen to the eagles and then we have a live accompaniment going along with the eagles "hotel california". >>Dean: Okay. Well john, it really is an amazing system. Thanks for stopping by. I can't believe the capabilities ... >>Miriam: A couple of other things about theiano. We have cellulose keys for the keyboard. Very similar to ivory, but they're not going to crack as much and they're not going to absorb the oil from your fingers so they're going to look good a lot longer. And we have carbon filled abs plastic parts for the action. That's going to make it a lot more stable than wood and therefore, less maintenance. Now we've had a chance to use the grill a couple of times. It's awfully nice. And one thing that we found is these blue lights around our knobs here. There's also a dot on the knob that glows blue when it's off and red when it's on. So you 

[00:22:09]


always know when the gas is on. >>Dean: And of course, you want to heat up the grill real well before you throw any meat on it. It keeps things from sticking. >>Miriam: Like we said before, the grill is divided into 3 separate zones so you can cook something like burgers or steaks on a high heat on one side and something like salmon on a lower heat on the other. >>Dean: Now we're going to go ahead and make burgers for the guys here today. Now we mentioned before, there are 3 main burners running across here.99,000 btu's between the 3 burners. And there's also an indirect burner along the backside and that is used primarily for the rotisserie. Although you can also +'e it for indirect heat. >>Miriam: Now one thing you don't want to be doing is opening and closing the lid. Letting out all your heat while you're checking on your meat. So one thing that comes in handy is this window. You can just see everything right there and you know exactly where it's all at. >>Dean: Now one thing if you ever opened up a door on a grill and all that smoke and grease comes out on your face, this has an air wash system so it constantly keeps moving the smoke through the back of the grill and out the back. So you don't have that happen when you open up the top. >>Miriam: Flip 'em? >>Dean: Yep. >>Miri: Nice. Now of course, the nice feature about this is this warming tray on top. I'm just going to put the buns up there to get those just slightly toasted. We're using natural gas, but you can also use propane if you don't have access to a natural gas line. And these guys of course, make charcoal grills which is how it all got started way back in the 1930's. All right, another masterpiece from dean. >>Dean: Well, I'll tell ya what, we're going to take a little break now and then we'll see you all next time on hometime. Until then, I'm dean johnson. >>Miriam: And I'm miriam johnson. Thanks for watching.

Ver ohiw for romney. 
>> And former secretary of state ken blackll that could force americans to wait 10 days to find out whohe next president is. And high said it will not be close. Michael baron's build prediction of a land slide on election day. Live from columbus, mike huckabee. 
>> Welcome to huckabee. We'll come to you fm columbus, thitate with a big role in the presidential election. Both candidates fighting for every last vote that would give them 18 electorial votes to put them past 270. And we'll talk about that in a few machines. Meanwhile in the home base in new york city and all over the northeast coast, there is pure devastation in the after math of hurricane sandy. ?????? ?????? they are talk being surges we have not seen before. 
>> With each hour the full scope of sandy's detruction is becoming clearer. 
>> The level of destruction on the jersey shore is unthinkable. 
>> Nothing. I done have anything or anywhere to go. I don't have clothes. 
>> We have water or electricity all of the food was thrown out. 
>> I didn't expect it to be that bad and not to see homes off of thation. 
>> Witnesses said the clouds gloge red can as the fire tore through the hope necessary breezy point. 
>> My parents lived here 40 years and it is unbelievable. Sorry. 
>> Look at >> I meany so many sights are plind bogling. 
>> Folks had to wait to fill up in many cases in lines that stretch for miles that is hard to watch. Our hearts, our thoughnd our prayers go to all of those people in the northeast who are adversely affected by hurricane sandy. And we are within hours, of election dape. Record numbers have early voted including me. I voted wednesday and so there is nothing that a cand date can do to my vote. But the campaign will continue until the polls close tuesday night. We are told that the election is it about jobs and the economy. I don't diswith that. It is it what the election will be about probably. But this ought to be the dramatic difference between two parties and world views and futures. You believe tax more and spend more and government more of your life is working for us. Then you will want to vote for barak obama and higher taxes gives government money that could have funded your job, romney is more likely to b your choice. This much I do know. I sense something very strong movingver this country. On august 1st people waited for line to buy a chicken sandwich. I believe those people are going to be willing to wait in line for hours to cast a vote so america will feel their votes. This is not just an election about our pay checks. This is it an election of our principlings. I believe that everyone's life has value and I don't accept the notion someone is dedisposable or expendible. I believe this election ought to be l about america's place in the world. I am not satisfied we are begin straight and honest answers of the murder of our ambassador and thry other american necessary benghazi. The lack of trance parency and the everchanging store stores from the administration are troubling. It is one thing for a politician to embellish or stretch the truth but for the government to knowingly and willingly deceive the citizens for political stelve preservation, that is not a political failure, that is it a moral failure. Maybe you are willing to overlook that. I am not. We sawhe horror of the suddens alandoned in the rath of hurricane sandy. For some of them to wait days for rescue in the flooded homes and others to go days without food and water in the most resourceful city on earth is unknowledgeable to think they went hours without help and under a weapon's attack. That is it unimaginable. 

[00:05:00]


>> We are not just voting for a personality but the trustworthiness of the poem we effect. I have feet in those who believe in god and don't think he is out of style or disengauged. If they stay home they will be abandoned their children and grand children to a government they can't trust and future they don't want. If you stood in line for a chicken sandwich, please stand in line for your country. That's my view. Well, three days until election day and it could come down to the battle ground state of ohio. My first guess is that if it comes down to ohio, we may not know who the next president until 10 days after the election . Joining me is former ohio secretary of state and served as cincinnati mayor ken blackwell you talked about a nightmare scenario. We are here in ohio, political center of the universe. What is the danger and the nightmare scenario. 1976, carter beat ford by 11,163 votes that was less than one vote per pesinct. 2004 bush bet kerry by 118,000 and turned 60,000 and we would have president kerry. And in ohio, we have a situation where every voters was mail would an absentee ballot application and they sent that in and a week ago, we had as many as 800,000 who had sent for an absentee ballot that had not turn today in. If they decide to vote the old-fashioned way. Once they go to poling place, they wouldn't be allowed to vote. They would have to vote a provisional ballot because we don't want them voting twice. Provisional ballots are not counted until november 17th. What we would have is ape situation where we would have to wait if we had a close race on the traditional balolt. Michael barone is right, you know, it is a scenario that we can all laugh and joke about. If it is it a tight race, it would be a long wait. 

[00:07:27]


>> You are ohio's chief election official in the capacity of secretary of state how likely is it that people might deliberately or accidentally voting absentee and I better go down there and vote. How do you protect that from happening? 
>> We have a excellent system and competent secretary of state and 88 boards of lecs and made up with democrats and republicans and they have a double lock security system and a lot of transparency. I don't think that is going to happen. What is going to potentially happen is that we have a close race on election night, and provisional ballots and overseas ballots will be the determining factor. 10 sleepless nights waiting to find out who won ohio and perhaps who won the presidency. 
>> There are reports of problems with voting machines and how wide spread do you think that is? Is that something that both camps should be worried about? 
>> Look, we don't have any perfect systems any time you have electronic voting system you have cal voting problems. But the ohio system, what i love, we have transparency and a lot of back up systems to make sure that the sort of things that people are wringing their hands about will nothe outcome of our election ask we'll have a result whether we get it election night or two weeks from election night. That hommeds the confidence of voten ohio. 
>> It is good to know that you are confident of the integrit of the election. What are the issues that will move them for president obama or romney in >> they are going to be economic issues in the main. But the religious arbitrate - electricity - liberty is impacting the category of voters that the president thought he had in his hip pocket. Women and blue collar workers and the like. The catholic church going on the offensive to protect religious liberty is a potential force that can change the result in ohio. 

[00:09:50]


>> Your prediction. Romny or obama? 
>> I think romney will narrowly eck it out. I just hope we know what is going on on november 6th or seventh. 
>> Great to see you. Coming up michael barone with numbers that he said will decide the election in a land slide. But for whom, stay with us. To find out. I would like it hear fru.

Call humana at 1-800-808-4003. Or go twalmart.Com forails. He's making a bold prediction saying that the election is not going to be close. He came up with a scenario that might stur - surprise you. Michael baron. You had a bomb shelve an article in the washington examiner and you are predicting a land slide and who wips and why? 

[00:14:01]


>> I would predicting romney winning the electorial vote with 315 and that's not a land slide in popular vote and neither of the candidates will get 53% barak obama had last time and he had 365 electorial votes and so when you get up to the numbers you carry a lot of states. Obama carried 28. I tried to look at what i think are the fundmentals in this election and see how they played out in the target state. Most vers don't like barak obama and like the slulish economy that resulted from them and likely to center a less democratic electorate thap is shown in 2008 exit polls and most polls, they are tending to show nationally and independent voters going for romney. That means each party's side is relatively eating and nen partisan vote for cappedidates and independent voters break the tie. 
>> We have a map that is it on the screen it shows solid red as the states for romney and blue for obama and light likely obama and the pink states are light red for romney. Pennsylvania, wisconsin and you say those are likely to tilt romny's way. 
>> Wisconsin tep electorial votes is a battle ground with governor scott walker reforms affecting the bargaining terms and there was a june recall election on governor walker and he won it with 53% of the vote and his side got well organized from that. And I think that balance of enthusiasm that seems to favor republicans this year, that might enable romney to get over the line there. And pennsylvania, a couple of trends and that is not a targetitate in the romny campaign and people supporting romny put money in there. Western pennsylvania, where barak obama did not run well but had low turn out in 2008, voters were cross pressured and traditional democrats didn't want to vote for obama. You will see more 18-obama and it is coal company. And alsolet pennsylvania polls tightened up after the first debate and that is only have happened in the philadelphia suburbs. And afluent areas in the north which are trending democratic were moving back some distance to romney and I understand it romney has a speaking date tomorrow night in buck's county outside of philadelphia. And stow romny has put real money in pennsylvania it is it not cheap to campaign obama responded with some. Those factors could put it over the line that would be a real shock and it is it out on the limb. I will not be utterly surprised to be brong. 

[00:17:30]


>> And you have been right more awn than wrong when i read the article I said this is it stunning. You also looked at ohio and where I am tonight. And this is ground zero for the election, how important is it ohio and who wins that tuesy? 
>> I think ohio is it hugely important and it has 18 electoral vote. That is it a significant number. Bark bumum carried it by four poigns in 2008 and he put a barage of anti-ads and bain capital and autobail out and obama is doing better with white blue collar voters in ohio than other state. He's leading in most polls. And a lot of the polls are showing a democratic party identification edge in the respondants that is greater than the exit poll. And that just doesn't make sense to me and causes me to question them. We have problems with pollingly technology now because of so many cell phone only people there is it a lot of questioning going on in the polling profession. And I think we may see something like in 2004, which was quietly unreported by the press who don't mix in those stirkles saw evangelical voterss anmaul town voters turn out much enhanced numbers that enable would george bush to carry the statine though kerry did a job of turning out the vote in central city neighborhoods and on areas. And I am picking romny to narrowly win. And I think we may like ken blackwell may wait until november 17th to see what happens to the provisional ballots this is it a provision that leaves me uneasy, but that's the direction I move in. 

[00:19:31]


>> Michael, we'll be following closely and we may bring you back to stee how well you did. >> If I wear a paper bag over my head, you will know i didn't do well. 
>> People suggested I should do that every week on the show and can come and join me and we'll both be bagged. Thank you for being here. 
>> Thank you. Who should get credit for ohio's economic improvement? Should president obama or john csack and waiting for romney, who is speaking in colorado at a campaign stop and when he does, you will hear his comments live right here. ] humans -- even when we cross OUR t's AND DOT OUR I's, We still run into problems. Namely, other humans. Which is why, at liberty mutual insurance, auto policies come with new car replacement and accident forgiveness if you qualify. See what else mes standard at libertymutual.Com. Liberty mutual insurance. Responsibility. What'syour policy? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????? 

[00:23:41]


>> ohio is experiencing a economic recovery president obama will take credit for that as he campaigning here. My next guest says the prize aught to go to someone closer to home. Governor, it is it great to center you here. Unemployment rate in ohio was 9 percent and dropped to 7 percent x. One of the few places in the country where that is it happened. Why is that happened. 
>> We are making it job friendly again business friendly again. We balanced our budget whole and did it without raising taxes and we cut taxings. Businesses in ohio understand that we are open for business and we are creating an economic environment where they can be successful. 
>> The president is here and said that ohio is one of those states that prove his economic policiless are working. How do you respond to the president if he makes those claims? 
>> I would say it is it just the opposite. They are hurting. We can gobetter if we had a real partner in washington who understood what it takes to create jobs. Through our effort and initiative. We are reforming our regulations and at the same time the federal government is pushing more regulations and obamacare and the affect that is it going to have on government spending and more tax dollars spent on medicaid after it is it implement the impact it will center on ohio. 
>> I loved csi. Common sense initiate itch. Because it is it a name that is trendy, but I loved that we will assem pel the top business people and ask them. If you can set government policy to cause you to create jobs whampt is it going to be. And so what did they tell you specifically would help them create jobs in ohio? Obviously it has worked. 

[00:25:47]


>> We have been meeting and thank you for menging - mentioning. I talk to many, many small business round tables and talking to thempt we have a advisory council that meets. Lower taxes and regulatory environment and understanding that your government is financially responsible after we balanced our budget and our credit outlook was upgraded. That is it important to a business that is making a decision to invest a lot of money to suggest which states they are doing that in. And what is it going to look like? 
>> Governor, the big claim of the obama administration is that his saving and rescuing the automobile industry is one of the key reasons that ohio is doing better. I s numbers that didn't match that up. And what is the true store store of how many jobs are auto-related jobs. 
>> We'll go troughlet numbers. We created 112,000 in ohio. Since we took office. Of that 112,000, 400, of those jobs are associated with the auto. 4400-- four hundred out of 112,000? 
>> Yes. We have a diverse economy and focusing on making it technical and food production and manufacturing. And medical. We are growing in many different industry segments and that is it partly contributed to ohio's success. 
>> It is it a fascinating store store and I think you and governor casack deserves credit. I can do that. And we are expecting governor romney to spheek soon out of englewood, colorado.

[ Applause ]

[ Applause we're getting closer and closer and this is getting very exciting. 
[ Applause ] this is what -- three more days. 
(Chanting) 
>> it is. It is only three more days! 
[ Applause ] this is so exciting for us. It is a thrill to be here. What a great country this is what an honor it has been to go across the nation and meet people like you that are here standing up today for america. 
[ Applause ] 
(chanting three more days) 
>> you got it. You got it 
>> we have such a thrill to be able to go across the country and now that journey is coming to a close and a new journey is about to begin! 
[ Applause ] and what a thrill it is going to be for me because I know something about mitt. Does not fail! 

[00:31:21]


[ Applause ] in our marriage, he has stood by me in my darkest hour. As you know, I had difficulties in my life a where is mitt been? Standing by my side! 
[ Applause ] as a father, I have seen him show exemptulary courage and devotion to his family and sons. He raised the most extraordinary sons! 
[ Applause ] I have seen him in business be everything and most exceptional business leadership and turn thippings around and now what I am excited about is the next turn around in his chapter and career. And it is going to start next tuesday with your help. Thank you very much! 
[ Applause ] 
>> tonight, tonight we are entering the final weekend of the campaign, and you are right at the obama rallies they are shouting more years and we are shouting three more days. And we are so very grateful to you and the people across the country, for all that you have given of yourselves to this campaign. This is not just about paul ryan and me, it is it about america. 
[ Applause ] it is it about the future that we are going to leave our children. We thank you we ask you to stay at it until we win on tuesday night. 

[00:33:23]


[ Applause ] now the closing hours of a campaign have a dynamic all their own and many voters have made up their mind who they will vote for. Yeah, I figured you know what you will do, but there is it a lot of others are putting aside the demands of daily living and considering who they will vote for and how that will affect their lives and children and counselry. We ask them to look beyond the speeches and the attacks and the adlook to the record, accomplishments and failures and the judgment, because words are cheap and a record is it real and it is it earned with effort. 
[ Applause ] you so, change can't be measured in speeches it is it measured in achievements and four years ago, four years ago, candidate obama promise tod do soy much, but he's fallen soy short. I mean, you recall. He promised to be a post partisan president he's been most partisan and dividing and attacking and blaming. He was going to focus on creating jobs and instead he focused on obamacare that killed jobs. He said he was going to cut the federal deficit in half and then he doubled it. And then he said he would bringlet unemployment rate down to 5.25 percent and we learned on friday 7.9 nine million jobs short of what he promised and unemployment. And unemployment today is higher than when barak obama took office and by the way, he promised to propose a plan to save social security and medicare. He did not. Rather he raided $716 billion from medicare to pay for obamacare. The list goes on. And he said he would low are health prem yups by $2000. And instead went up $3000 a family. And average american family pays $2000 more for gasoline than when president obama was elected. And I mention one more thing. He said he would work across the aisle on the most important issues. He's not met on the economy or on the budget or on jobs with either the republican leader of the house and senate since july so he's made the divide wider. People wonder how is it he fell so short of what he promised? He never led. Or worked across the aisle and never truly understood how jobs are created in this economy by the way, he's making new promiseless. Promises he will not be able to keep, because he admits he's stayog the same path. And same course we are on will not lead to a better destination. That means 20 trillion in debt in the end of the second term that he will not have and crippling unemployment and stagnant take home pay and depressed home values and devastated military and by the way, unless we change course, we may look at another recession . And so the question of this election comes down to this, do you want more of the same? Or do you want real change? 

[00:37:21]


[ Applause ] president obama -- president obama promised change but could not deliver change. Now, I promise change and i have a record of achieving ree. 
[ Applause ] 
>> I built a business. I helped turn around another. And helped to put the low pressures back -mpics back on track and turn happened my state from deficit to surplus and job losses to job growth and higher tax home pay. 
-- Take home pay this is why i am running for president. I know how to change the course of the naption and balance the budget and get rising take home pay. 
[ Applause ] this is it accomplish and change is not something I talk about. It is something that I have done. And it is it what I will do when I am president of the united states with your help. 
[ Applause ] 
(chanting) 
>> now if you believe we can do better and believe that america should be on a better course and tired of being tired. I ask you for vote for real change. Paul ryan and I will bring you real change from day one. When I am elected, the economy and american jobs will beinant. I will not waste time complaining about my predecessor. 
[ Applause ] and I won't spend my time trying to pass partisan legislation that is it unrelated to jobs. Day one, I will help americans get back to work. 

[00:39:34]


[ Applause ] now, you know as well as I do, people are responding to the five-part plan to create jobbings. You know part one, taking full advantage of our energy resources. Day one. I am going to act to increase leases and permit to drill on federal lands and I will act to speed the approval of the key stone pipe line from canada. Secondly, I will boost trade with latin america and finally desigate china as a currency manipulator and it is time that trade works for america. Now, third, I want to send to congress retrain asking reform act to make sure workers have the skims for good paying job and fourth move to tackle out of control spend spend to congress. Down payment on fiscal sanity act. 
[ Applause ] and in this act we'll not just slow down the rate of government and its spending, but I will cut spending. 
[ Applause ] you see, I am not going to just take office on january 20th. I will take responsibility for that office as well applause ] and number 5, number 5, I will act to boost small business and all business and I will issue executive orders aimed straight at the problem that are holding back the economy and the first of those will grant state waivers from obamacare to begin instant repeal. 

[00:41:47]


[ Applause ] and the second, the second is going to launch a sweeping review of all of the obama era regulation eliminate or repair those that are killing american jobs . 
[ Applause ] and for the first time in four years, every entrepreneur, every small business person, every job creator, will know that the president of the united states likes them and loves the jobs that they hire for americans. 
[ Applause ] we've almost forgot what a real recovery looks like and what americans can achieve when we limit government instead of the limiting of the of fellow americans and that's about to change. Now the people who will be voting are going to choose the future they want. You know what you need to know, you can stay on the path of last four years or choose real change. You know that if the president is reelected he will benable to work with the people in congress. He's ignored them and blamed them and attacked them. The debt ceiling will come up again and shut down and default will be threatened and a chill in the economy. The president was right when he can't change washington in the inside. In this case. We can take him at his word. He's going to be on the outside. 
[ Applause ] you see, when I am elected, and when I am elected. 
[ Applause ] I am going to work with republicans and democrats in congress and meet with their leaders and endevor to find good men and women on both sides of the aisle who care more about the country than they do politics. Now you also know if the president were to be reelected he would continue his war on coal, oil and natural gas. And all of that would guarantee higher energy prices at the pump and fewer jobs as well. When I am elected, we'll change course on energy and i know how much it mean to middle class families struggling to get by. We can help to hold down price necessary the pump and energy, and nuclear and coal and renewables and oil. You know, you know that if the president were to be reelected he would promote government and demote business. He chose his own job's council you know. Made up of leaders, business leaders and he wanted advice on the issue of the time creating jobs and a stronger economy. Do you know how long since he met with them? Nine months. Nine months. Look, look, I see free enterprizes as a means for people to fulfill their and so, by the way, you know the other day, i was in richmond, virginia a couple of days ago, and met with ronda eliot. She's been running her family restaurant for a few years and it is called bill's queue - barbeque and been in her mily years. And she just closed it down. She told me obama era regulations and taxs and obama economy put her out of business and teared up. This was not about money, it was about the future for her family and for the family of employees that she cares about. I want to help the hundreds of thousands of dreamers like roda and I will. 

[00:46:11]


[ Applause ] now you know, if the president were to be reelected he will say good things about education but in the final analysis he will do what his largest campaign are contributors tell them. That means your kids will have the same schools with the stame results. When im president, I will be a voice of the children and parents, because they don't have a union! 
[ Applause ] I want to make sure the parents have the information they need to know to find out if their school is succeeding or fail I want to make they have the choice to pick the school with a child with the best chance of success. Now one more thing. Under barak obama, a reed obama. There would be devastatingly cuts that jeopardize our national security and kill jobs. When I am president, I will not cut our commitment to national defense. 
[ Applause ] a strong america is the best allied peace and I will keep it strong. 
[ Applause ] now I have watched over the last few months as the campaign gathered the strength of a movement. Not only the size of the crowds. This is it an extraordinary crowd tonight. 
[ Applause ] it is also the depth of our shared conviction. It made me strive more to be worthy of your support and campaign as I would govern. And to speak for the aspirations of all americans. I learned as governor of the state of massachusetts best achievements are shared achievements and respect and good will go along way and return in kind. That's how I conduct myself as. Doing things for the common good. I will not only represent one party. I will represent one nation. 

[00:48:50]


[ Applause ] 
(chanting three more days) 
(chanting usa) 
>> now as you know, as you know, throughout the campaign. President obama has tried to convince you last four years have been a success. He's floating a plan for the next four years. He wants to take all of the first term, stim tim and borrowing and obamacare and all of the rift and try them all over again. Look, our big will not be satisfied with a small agenda that has already failed and yesterday, I imagine you already heard this. Yesterday president obama asked his voters to vote for revenge. For revenge. Instead, I ask the american people to vote for love of country. 
[ Applause ] 
(chanting usa) together we have got to lead america to a better place. Now we are three days away from a fresh start. Three days away from the first day of a new beginning. My conviction is it based on unshakable faith of the american spirit. Is anyone worried that the last four years is the best we can do. If anybody fears the american dream is fading away. Is there better jobs or pay checks are things of the past. I have a clear message. With the right leadership, america is about to come roaring back. 

[00:50:52]


[ Applause ] 
(chanting usa) 
>> we are americans and we can do anything. The only thing. The only thing that stands between us and some of the best years we have known is lack of leadership and that is why we have election. You saw the differe between president obama and myself when we were side by side in our debates. He said it has to be this way. I said it stand this way. He offers excuses. I have a plan. 
[ Applause ] I can't wait to get going. He's hoping we'll settle. But americans don't settle. We build. We aspire. We listen to the voice inside that said we can do better. A better job and better life for our kids and bigger and better country that is it coming soon. 
[ Applause ] 
>> three more days and we can get to work and rebuilding our country and restoring our confidence and renewing conviction and confident of a solid path and steady impresumement and graduates -- college graduates will find a better job. Confident that the single moms who are working two jobs will have a shot at a better job as well. 
[ Applause ] now my confidence in america and in our future stems from what I have seen in the heart of the american people. We are a people who are given to give ourselves to things larger than ourselves. It said a hero is not someone who is larger than life. Just larger than himself . Several years I served as a boy scout leader for the boy scouts of america. 

[00:53:06]


[ Applause ] and I was in a court of honor, that's where they get the eagle scout and other award and there was a long formica table next to an american flag and the person who was speaking in the podium was a scout master we flew in from monument, colorado to tell the store store, I just through there. He said his boy scout troupee wanted a? American flag and had one flown above the capt capt building and the boys said I would like to have nasa take it up in the space shuttle and they contacted nasa and nasa agreed. You can imagine the pride of our boys sitting in the rooms at school and watching the tv sets and saw the space challenger shuttle launch in the air and saw it explode in front of their eyes he said he called nasa and said have you found any remnant much our flag. They have not. Week after week month after month. Still no remnant of the flag from the terrible disaster and then he was reading an article in the paper and described the debris from the challenger disast yer mentioned a flag. He call would nasa again. And in fact we have a presentation to make to your boys. Nasa came together and they presented the boys with a plastic container and they opened tup. It was a american flag in perfect condition. 
[ Applause ] he said, then he said that's next to mr. Romney and i reached over and I grabbed that flag and held it out. And it was as electricity ran through my arm. Because I thought of all of the men and women in our space program who put themselves in path out of a desire for learn knowledge. For us. It is it the american way. Think of all of the servicemen and women who put themselves in harm's way for freedom. 

[00:55:24]


[ Applause ] 
>> I haven't seen that flag want. 15 or 20 years from the scout master, but monument, colorado is not far. Would you welcome that scout master and that flag? 
[ Applause ] 
[ applause ] >>, come out here. Thank you. Now did I get that store store right. 
>> You did, sir. 
>> That is it a great flag. Represented the greatest naption in the history of the earth. It is it a flag of hope. 
>> Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
[ Applause ] 
[ applause ] you see, I see a troupe of scouts right here. Thanks, young men for your service to the community. It is it in the american sphirit. This where of giving to others and some extraordinary and remarkable ways and others in remarkable ways in their own homes. My sister is one of my life heros in her cents now and eight children and seven've them are raised with children of their own. And the youngest had down's syndrome. Jeffrey is 43. My sister is a single mom as her husband passed away she devoted her life to jeffrey and making sure he has a full and abundant life. She is a hero to me. 
[ Applause ] think of all of the single moms, I think of all of the single moms struggling to make sure they have what is necessary to put a good meal on the table in the end of the day all . Moms and dads who are working two jobs or perhaps one working night shift and the other day shift hardly see each other. And want to make sure the kids have the other clothes that kids have and don't stand out. Think of all of the coupems at christmas time and stay, let's not exchange but make sure our kids have christmas. This is it a nation to people who give of themselves and on november 6th. I want us to come together to draw on that greatness. 

[00:58:10]


[ Applause ] and then on november 7th, on november 7th we'll go to work. Reach across the street to the neighbor, you know on the other side of the street that has the yard sign for the other guy, and I want you to know I will reach across the aisle to washington in people of good faith and work for the common good of the nation. This is it, this is much more than our moment. It is it america's moment of renewal and purpose and optimism. We journeyed far and wide for america's future and we are now almost there. One final push will get us we know a lot of short nights and long days and now we are close the door to a brighter future is it open and waiting for us. I need your vote. And I need your work and help and walk wit. Let's walk together and start anew. Thank you so very much, colorado. You guys are the best. Thank you soy very much. Thank you. 
[ Applause ] all right that is governor mitt romney in engle wood, colorado having an incredible rally and a strong finish joining me now is ohio senator. Than ann romney who has spent more time on the campaign trail with mitt romney than you. He was at the top of his game ear tonight. 
>> He sure was. A great message. Positive. Upliftg.

...But says instead she got a shady deal. 
Judge Alex: If you're running it as a business, why is she writing the check to you personally? 
Byrne: It's not -- when you cash a check that's a personal check, it sometimes cashes faster. When you cash a check into the business, it takes longer. 
Announcer: Today, judge alex gets all worked up at what he sees. 
Welch: I started researching mr. Byon the internet. Then I found out that there was a lot of unhappy people with him. Judge Alex: You do this search beforeyou give the guy a check for $5,000, not afteryou give the guy a check for $5,000. 
Welch: You're right. 
Announcer: As a cop, he stood up for the law. As a tri lawyer, he fought for the truth. And as a criminal court judge, he commanded authority. Now he returns to preside over america's courtroom. 
--Captions by VITAC-- www.vitac.com Becky welch is suing her contractor, shawn byrne, for $5,000 because she claims he never started the patio job she hired him to do. She's suing to have her deposit refunded. Joining her in court today is her mother and witness, tamila brill. Shawn byrne says he doesn't owe becky a full refund because he claims he spent money on labor and materials for becky's backyard patio. 
Mason: All rise! This court is now in session. The honorable judge alex ferrer presiding. 
Judge : Okay, thank you. Please be seated. Ms. Welch, you're suing the defendant, mr. Byrne, because you say that you hired him to do me-improvement project and he never started it and you want your y back. 
Welch: Yes, sir. Judge Alex: Okay, and, mr. Byrne, you say she fired you prematurely, so she's not entitled to a full refund like she's demanding. 
Byrne: Yes, sir. That's correct. 
Judge Alex: All right, ms. Welch, what's going on? 
Welch: I first came in contact with mr. Byrne after contacting him ON APRIL 13th, Which was a friday. I was telling him that I was interested in building a patio covering on my back -- I have a concrete slab behind my house, and I -- 

[00:02:00]


Judge Alex: Did you learn of him through a friend, or was it an advertisement or what? 
Welch: It was vertisement in a circular. 
Judge Alex: Okay. Tell me about your business, mr. Byrne. 
Byrne: I build patios, fireplaces, and barbecues, been in business for a little w I take care of a lot of people in the dalth area. Judge Alex: Are you a contractor? 
-Byrne: I'm a contractor, yes. 
-Judge Alex: Okay. And how long have you been a licensed contractor? 
Byrne: In the state of texas, you're not required to be a licensed contractor. I've been a contractor for almost 20 years, though. 
Judge Alex: So, basically, you become a contractor because you call yourself a contractor? 
Byrne: You have to file paperwork with the state to become a contractor. But in the state of texas, they do not require you to have a license. Most home builders out there are not licensed contractors. Judge Alex: So, you said how many years? 
Byrne: I've beenng it for almost 20 years. Judge Alex:20 years, okay. Did you think he was a licensed contractor? Welch: Th what I assumed. From the advertisement that I saw, I thought it was, you know, a big-name company with contractors underneath him that worked under the company name. When he came out to my home on that monday, you know, I just assumed that was the case. You know, I took him out to my back where I showed him what I was wanting. 
Judge Alex: Mm-hmm. 
Welch: He didn't even have a tape measure. He looked at it and said, "OH, 20x14." I told him, "all I want is something simple -- a patio as, like, a shade covering." Judge Alex: Did you measure the space? 
Byrne: I don't have to. I've done enough houses in the neighborhood to know -- in the area to know the size of the house. IT WAS ACTUALLY 40'x14'. So, I said, "i don't need a tape measure. "Once you get me a land survey, "i can give you a bid precise to your square footage that we're talking about." 
Judge Alex: Okay. Go on. 
Welch: Okay. So, after we were out there for about five minutes, we went back inside. I had two pictures of patios that I was kind of looking at -- you know, simple, where it kind of felt like an extra room but was still open as a patio so we could be out there with the kids. He said, "no problem." He said it would probably run around $8,000. And he said, "no problem. "I'll come out to your house tomorrow. "We can sign a contract. It'll take about three days to construct." That was when it -- he was always very friendly, very nice, very cordial. He was asking me kind of, you know, why I was in the area. Explained I just moved back from fort knox, kentucky, with my two kids, explained the situation about my husband being killed overseas in afghanistan. 

[00:04:15]


Judge Alex: Your husband was in the military? 
-Welch: Yes, sir. 
-Judge Alex: And he was killed? 
-Welch: Yes, sir. 
-Judge Alex: How long ago? 
Welch: April 3rd of 2011. Judge Alex: I'm sorry to hear that. 
Welch: Thank you. 
Judge Alex: And how old are your children? 
Welch: I have a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old. 
Judge Alex: Is it hard explaining to the 4-year-old? 
Welch: I had a chaplain -- a chaplain's help. Judge Alex: Okay, that's good. Okay, you guys agreed on this price for this patio. So, what happens next? 
Byrne: How it started when I came in -- and she's like -- she showed me two pictures. "I'd like to do this patio maybe, and something like this." She wanted a shade patio cover built with high wing walls 'cause she gets really bad wind out there. So, we went out in the backyard, and she showed me what she was talking about. And I said, "you know, your price is gonna be about $8,000." And becky's like, "that's great. I'll give you money right now." And I was like, "mrs. Welch, no, let me" -- 
Welch: Well, I never offered to give you any money. 
Byrne: "Let me come back with the contract, and then we will sign and go from there." 
Judge Alex: Okay, so, you went and you did come back with a contract when? 
Byrne: The next day. 
Judge Alex: Okay. Do you have the contract? 
Welch: Yes, sir. 
Judge ex: All right, let me see it, please. 
Welch: He came out like he promised at 11:00 that next morning with this contract that we went over. 
Judge Alex: Okay. 
Byrne: Most of the time, I don't start any projects until the funds have cleared. I've been burnt before in the past by homeowners -- not saying that she would ever do it 'cause I really, truly think she's a sweet lady. But I've been burnt before in the past where I'll sign a contract with a homeowner, and they'll say, "okay, go ahead and start the project, and we'll pay you on friday." Well, friday never comes, so we're out this much money. So, it becomes tedious. So, now -- 
Judge Alex: Okay, so, you collected what? Byrne:5,000. 
-Judge Alex: Up front. 
-Byrne: Yes. 
Announcer: Coming up, who needs a permit anyway? 
Byrne: On the contract, there's nowhere for the permit. She said she w familiar with the office. I said I would get her all the information she needed for her to take -- Judge Alex What did you want do? 
-Pull it a owner-builder? 
-Byrne: Owner-builder. 
Judge Alex: But she's not building -- you are. 
Announcer: And later, what has judge alex feeling uneasy? 
Judge Alex: Something about this is just not sitting right. ????@?? Announcer: back welch, who's suing her contractor, shawn byrne, for $5,000 because she claims he misled her into believing he was a licensed contractor but instead took her money and never started the work building her patio. But shawn asserts he did begin the work on becky's patio and red him prematurely without allowing his team to complete it, and therefore, he does not owe becky a full refund. Judge Alex: So, what happens after that? 

[00:08:55]


Welch: I gave him the check, and I asked him about permits. I asked him with the city of wylie -- and then we have an h.O.A. In our neighborhood. And asking -- he said that if I got him the home plot -- which I have here if you need to see it -- that he would draw up what I needed and I just needed to take it to the city and then he would make sure it was all good. But when I showed up to the city, the lady looked at me like I was an idiot because what I showed her -- she's like, "you're gonna have to do a lot more than this. "He's not registered with the city, so he needs to fill out --" and I have all the documents she gave me. So, I got the necessary documents, and I e-mailed him and said, "i've got these documents. "You need to do this, this, and this. You need to pay." He said he got it, "okay, we're all good." Judge Alex: You're not registered with the town of wylie. 
Byrne: I don't do a lot of work in the town of wylie, and that's why I told her in the beginning. An look on the contract -- whenever I p a city permit for anybody, it's on the contract. I charge a fee for that because it takes a full day's time. On the contract, there's nowhere for the permit. She said she was familiar with the office. I said I would get her all the information she needed. Judge Alex: What did you want her to do? 
-Pull it as an owner-builder? 
-Byrne: Owner-builder. 
Judge Alex: But she's not building -- you are. 
Byrne: A lot of my customers pull their own permits. A lot of my customers pull their own permits. 
Judge Alex: I don't care what your customers do. 
Byrne: Well, I understand you don't care. 
Judge Alex: The problem is that there's a reason why the city requires contractors to be registered, and in texas, you know, a lot of different cities havehose requirements. So, wylie has a requirement that you register, and I'm pretty sure that if you don't register and you do your business there, it's a misdemeanor in wylie. 
Byrne: But when she told me that the city needs me to come in to pull the permit and register, I agreed to. That's fine. I will go to the city of wylie. It's $100. It's not that big of a deal. I give them my insurance, and it lasts for year. Then we had an issue with the check not funding. So, I told her. She wanted to start on thursday. I said, "i cannot start thursday unless the funds are available." Judge Alex: Okay. So, tell me about that. Now, you go to the city, and they tell you, "he's not registered with the city," and you call him. So, what happe next? Welch: I've never done this before. He said, "don't worry about it. "We'll be all legit before they come out to do the... 

[00:10:57]


Judge Alex: Inspection? 
Welch: ...Insption. 
-Judge Alex: Okay, all right. 
-Welch: I know, I'm sorry. Judge Alex: We're a little backwards here. 
Byrne: Well, hold on. When you -- Judge Alex: No, no, no, you hold on. We're a little backwards here. Byrne: When you build a patio -- 
Judge Alex: You're supposed to pull the permit before you commence the work -- not do the work and say, "now let me go back and fix the permit situation so that when they inspect, I'm legal." 
Byrne: A patio-cover job -- you can get an over-the-counter permit which means you take all your documents -- Judge Alex: Did you ever pull a permit? Byrne: I've pulled many permits. Judge Alex: No, no, on this job. 
Byrne: We were fired off the job, so we couldn't pull the permit. We were fired off friday. Judge Alex: Tell me what happens. 
Welch: Okay, so, this is what happened -- I sent this e-mail and told him everything that needed to be done. You know, I said, "i know this makes sense to you." And, so, he said, "i've got it. It's all handled." I was under the assumption, now I know what the actual procedure is, that he never -- and I did call the city after all of this went down, found out he never went into the city to register. 
Announcer: Coming up, does shawn and his team have one heck of a meal break at becky's expense? 
Welch: They had all left. So, then I pick up my phone and I call mr. Byrne and I said, "where are you guys?" He's like, "well, we had to have lunch. "We hadn't eaten yet, and we needed to go to lunch. I have to feed my guys." I said, "well, what the heck have you been doing all morning?" 
Judge Alex: Okay. Stop, stop, stop. So, did they ever come back that day? 
Welch: No, sir. 
Judge Alex: It's time for america to vote today's case. Who do you think I'm going to rule for -- the plaintiff... 
Welch: Found out he never went into the city to register. Judge Alex: ...Or the defendant? 
Byrne: We were fired off the job, so we couldn't pull the permit.

Announcer: "Judge alex" returns with the case of becky welch, who hired contractor shawn byrne to build a patio for a little shade in her backyard. But now becky is suing shawn for the $5,000 deposit she gave him because she claims he did little to no work at all. But shawn byrne counters that he spent the deposit becky gave him on labor for his team and the cost of materials an therefore, does not owe her a full refund. 
Judge Alex: So, at this point, you verified the money is cleared and you're gonna be out there with your workers on thursday, and what happens? 
Welch: Yes, and I will say that when I asked him who I should write the check out to -- I asked him should I make it out to his company or make it -- and he said no, when they do the smaller jobs, they make it out to shawn byrne. 
Judge Alex: If you're running it as a business, why is she writing the check to you personally? 
Byrne: When you cash a check that's a personal check, sometimes it cashes faster. When you cash a check into the business, it takes longer. 
Judge Alex: Yeah, but don't you have business expenses that you want to write off? 
Byrne: Yes, I ill do. I still do. I still do under my name. I write them off as a dba. 
Judge Alex: Okay. So, something about this is just not sitting right. So, now the work is gonna start. Welch: The work is gonna start. At one point, you know, I'm watching out my window. At one point, I look out and they are behind my fence, and I was like -- I found it odd they were back there. Mr. Byrne was back there working with shovels. And so, I said, "well, what are y'all doing back" -- 
Byrne: I was at lowe's. I was not back there. 
-Welch: Anyways, it was -- 
-Judge Alex: Was he there? 
Welch: He was back there. He said that he -- that they had a bunch of extra dirt, and so they needed to put it back there. I said, "okay." You know, I was thinking, "dirt?" So, anyways -- 
Judge Alex: This is not anything to do with your project? 
Welch: No, sir. 
Judge Alex: Is this the picture of the dirt? 
Welch: That's what I was gonna explain to you in just a minute. I go upstairs to help the boys with cleaning their rooms. And at one point, my mom is there and she's like, "where did they all go?" I said, "what do you mean? They're back there working on my patio." She's like, "no, they're not." They had all left. So, then I pick up my e and I call mr. Byrne and I said, "where are you guys?" He's like, "well, we had to have lunch. "We hadn't eaten yet, and we needed to go to lunch. I have to feed my guys." I said, "well, what the heck have you been doing all morning?" 

[00:18:00]


Judge Alex: Okay. Stop, stop, stop. So, did they ever come back that day? 
Welch: No, sir. 
Judge Alex: They dropped off the materials and a load of dirt. 
Welch: They dropped off the materials. Well, that's the pictures -- that last picture you were looking at. When I went around -- because I was curious to see what was happening back there, what it was they were doing. They had been dumping materials from another jobsite back there. 
Announcer: Coming up, is this all just a matr of a small computer glitch? 
Judge Alex: One thing that jumps out at me on this contract is, the one she submitted has on the top, "licensed and bonded r.O.C. Number," and it has a number there as if you're licensed and bonded. 
Byrne: That's the generic stamp that comes off of my computer. 
Judge Alex: It's time for america to vote on today's case. Who do you think I'm going to rule for -- the plaintiff... 
Welch: Found out he never went into the city to register. Judge Alex: ...Or the defendant? 
Byrne: We were fired off the job, so we couldn't pull the permit.

She's suing him for the $5,000 deposit she gave him to start building her patio. But shawn byrne says he does not owe becky welch $5,000 because he claims he did start the bayard patio job but becky fired him after he purchased material and hired men for the labor. 

[00:22:21]


Judge Alex: What is this? 
-Byrne: I -- can I see it? 
-Judge Alex: Yeah. You may as well see it. You probably saw it before when you were there. Welch: You can see a drain cover. There is brokecks. 
Judge Alex: What is that? It looks like dirt from -- 
Byrne: It is dirt that my guys dumped on the back of her prop-- on the back of the h.O.A. Property back there. 
Judge Alex: From another job, you brought dirt, and you just spread it out on her yard? 
Byrne: Not on her yard -- on the h.O.A. Yard. 
Judge Alex: Well, outside the fence of her yard so she can gaze out over your pile of dirt? 
Byrne: My guys did that, yes. I can't control my -- 
-Judge Alex: Was he there? 
-Welch: Yes, sir. 
Byrne: We were fired that same day. We were fired that same night. Judge Alex: Was this ever cleaned up? 
-Welch: No, sir. 
-Judge Alex: Never cleaned up. 
Byrne: We were told not to come back she let uso that night. 
-Judge Alex: I wonder why. 
-Byrne: No -- 
Welch: Can I just explain that rest of that afternoon? Judge Alex: Okay, go ahead, yes. 
Welch: I started researching mr. Byrne on the internet. Then I found out that there was a lot of unhappy people with him. One person said that there was gas leak in the house after a project. One, I just spoke to the other day -- 
Judge Alex: Hold on. I like this charge -- "dumping within 300 feet of a public highway." 
Welch: That's the collin county government website that I went to. 
Judge Alex: Do you realize all these complaints you have from other people you've done work for? "Takes your money and then you never hear from him again. Avoid this person and his company like the plague." 
Byrne: Okaverything you read on the internet, you can't -- okay, I have 900 people that I have serviced. 
-Judge Alex: These are -- 
-Byrne: Hold on. Wait. 
Judge Alex: No, you hold on. This is not people -- this is not people who just posted a facebook posting, okay? This is not one of those social networks. This is people who took the time to write long descriptions of their dealings with you paragrapafter paragraph. Byrne: So, what do I give you? Do I give you a paperwork of 700 people that love my work? 
Judge Alex: If you have it, I'd love to see it. 
Byrne: I don't have it, but should I e-mail it to you? Can I bombard your e-mail with 700 people that love our work? You never see anything online about good people. You know, my last four customers that I had -- 
Judge Alex: You do see stuff online about good le. I get references all the time. 
Byrne: My last four people that I contracted with -- 
Mason: [ Laughs ] 
Byrne: My last four -- 
Judge Alex: Look at the pattern I'm looking at, okay? See it from my perspective, 'cause I don't know you, okay? 
-I don know you at all. 
-Byrne: I understand that. 

[00:24:21]


Judge Alex: Number one -- you're trying to do business in a city you're not registered to do business with, so you send her as owner-builder when she's not the owner-builder. You're doing an end run around the rules. Number two -- yoorkers -- they're dumping dirt from another job you did in her backyard, not within the fence there as if that makes a difference to me. 
Byrne: Which they should have never did that. 
Judge Alex: But spreading it out there -- right. Number three -- she does a check on you, and all she can find are complaints. All of those 700 people who love you and never posted anything, parently, on the internet. 
Byrne: Why didn't she run a check on me in the beginning? 
Judge Alex: That's one thing that I do agree with you on. One thing I agree with you on is, you do this search before you give the guy a check for $5,000, not after you give the guy a check for $5,000. 
Welch: You're right. 
Judge Alex: So, you came to court today to give her a check for $5,000. 
Byrne: I will give her a check for the -- well, no. I will give her money minus the materials that were bought and my men's labor, but -- Judge Alex: What was your men's labor -- unloading it from the truck and putting it back on? 'Cause the rest of it was spreading junk on her backyard. 
Welch: And, sir, I will tell you that I did get a cost of fixing that 'cause I'm having that corrected, and I have a bill from the new contractor, who I have researched -- I have done all of my research on him and looked up recommendations. And he has given me a bill of around $1,700 to correct all that damage that mr. Byrne and his men -- 
Judge Alex: Okay, ma'am, who is your witness? 
Welch: I apologize. This is my mother. She was at the house through all of this. 
Judge Alex: Okay. What do you have to add to this? 
Brill: I think she's learned a good lesson -- her father and I hope so. 
Judge Alex: Hold on one second. Mr. Byrne, you submitted, as part of your evidence, 
-an invoice. 
-Byrne: That's the contract. 
Judge Alex: The contract -- not an invoice, a contract. She submitted a contract. The one thing that jumps out at me on this contract is, the one she submitted has on the top, "licensed and bonded r.O.C. Number," and it has a number there as if you're licensed and bonded. Byrne: That's the generic stamp that comes off of my computer when I do it. I use a certain database, and that's the generic stamp that comes off it. 
Judge Alex: So, when you went to see her and you signed a contract with her, your generic stamp represents to her that you are licensed and bonded. 

[00:26:27]


Byrne: Yes, sir. 
Judge Alex: But then when you submitted it to the court, you took off the "licensed and bonded" because you know you're not. 
Byrne: I just printed it out, and it didn't put it on there. I'm sorry. I've taken -- Judge Alex: It put on there for her? 
Byrne: No, no, no, it printed it on there for quite a few people. 
-Judge Alex: But not for me? 
-Byrne: Apparently not. 
Judge Alex: I can't tell you how slighted I feel. Give the woman her money back -- $5,000. 
Mason: All rise! 
Announcer: Judge alex has ruled in favor of the plaintiff and has ordered the defendant to pay her $5,000. 
Byrne: As soon as he found out that she was a widowed military person, his eyes wouldn't even look at me except to, basically, scold me. 
Welch: I want to caution anybody out there, along with -- I have lots of family and friends that have deployed spouses. If he's willing to take advantage of me, then I'm sure he's willing to take advantage of a lot more. ????@?? She, um, met another man, ended up cheating on me and having another baby by, uh, byhis man. Announcer: She's the judge who gives rules on the law and life. She's intense with common sense. She's Judge Lynn Toler. OnDivorce Court, where real couples deal with real life.

=======================================================

Th country. I think people really appriate that. 
>> Mike: He is not attacking the president. He is not talking so much about what is wrong with barack obama. He brings up the contrast but like the close with the boy scouts and the flag what are you seeing on the campaign trail? You are with him almost every day. Have the moods that you have seen among the crowds changed over the last couple of weeks? 
>> Actually they have, governor. I think they changed partl because of the debate. Our side got a lot more energized and as I told you earlier I have been to five mini rallies around ohio. I have never seen crowds like this and the kind of enthusiasm and energy on our side. Last night we haded a rally with mitt romney and paul ryan and 30,000 people showed up and they are as boisterous as the crowd tonight. They were excited about a fresh start and excited about what he is talking about. 
>> I was amazed at his energy level 86 was thinking and you and I were talking I think we are both more tired than he seems to be. He is out the campaigning every day. 
>> He has a passion for it and the adrenaline now in the last few days. 
>> He has the view that america is on the wrong track and he can turn it around. Has a strong following here in ohio and I think we will win the election because of it. 
>> Mike: Ohio is critical to the election. You traveled all over the state and you know it as well as anybody. You have been a congressman and a united states senator for ohio. This is your home state. How do you see this coming down tuesday? 
>> Well, ohio s a purple state. We are neither red nor are blue. Barack obama won the state last time by five points. George bush won it twice and bill clinton won it twice. We have a little advantage and it is that energy and enthusiasm that I talked about earlier that we see on the campaign trail. I think we have a good ground game in place. Ultimately it is about the passion and heart of the volunteers. I spent a lot of time with them this year. I think we will win this. I think it will be close but i think at the end of the day there will be a victory in ohio and so goes ohio more than likely so goes the country. 

[00:02:12]


>> Mike: Certainly it has been that way time and time again. It is tight but tipping one or the other is it the issue or emotion of the voters and just the intensity that will put, ohio, in the romney column? 
>> The concern here in ohio is although we are doing a little better than the national average as mary talked about earlier, things are still rough here in ohio. We are still on the wrong track. We still have a lot more potential we can achieve with leadership from washington. And people understand that. I was with a bunch of voters today who aren't republicans or democrats. Folks showing up for the first time ever to make calls and go to a victor arery center. They are saying we can't afford another four years like the last four. They are looking for some opportunity for themselves and really for their kids and that s what I see throughout and mitt romney has offered again a positive plan for the future. The president has offered more of the same. And so these voters in ohio who are are undecided, who are more independent voters are looking the two candidates and see mitt romney offering a fresh approach to get the country back on track and barack obama offer oinging what has gotten us into this mess in the fir place here in the the last four years. 
>> Mike: So much controversy about what happened in benghazi. We still don't really know. You are are a senator and you a right to ask for information but you and your colleagues aren't getting many answers. It hasn't seemed to capture the attention of the news media as far as this election is concerned. Are you troubled that we he don't know what h in benghazien't getting clear concise and consistent answers from the state department, from the white house and other elements of the administration? 
>> Very troubled. And governor, you and I have talked a little about this. A shocking operational breakdown not to have the security in place after what we have now found were explicit requests for more security. And then during this 7-hour fire fight that terrible night in benghazi not to come to the aid of fellow americans including an ambassador, the first one assassinated since 1979 we -- I'm on the armed services committee as you know. I sent a letter to secretary panetta asking about what the d.O.D., The department of defense had done. I didn't get an answer back. I sent another oney john McCAIN MORE RECENTLY. The american people have a right to know. We'll see what happens. I think just in the last couple of days I have seen a little more interest among the media in looking that the issue because it truly is a shocking breakdown on the operational side but also after the fact misleading the american people about what happened. I think you will start to see more interest in this and i hope we can get to the bottom of it very quickly. 

[00:04:59]


>> Mike: S there a reason that governor romney has not made that a bigger issue in the waning days of the campaign? 
>> Well, he has talked about it some. But I think is has allowed surrogates like you and me to talk about it more. Folks on the armed services COMMITTEE LIKE senator McCain and se graham have done a job of racing issues like what the answers are we are looking for. There is something very wrong when you have americans in harm's way and folks not respondingoming to their aid despite their pleas. I also think what happened in benghazi unfortunately is an example of the spread of islamic extremism around north africa. The horn of africa. The middle east which runs contrary to what the president is saying including on the campaign trail just yesterday i heard him say that al-qaeda is on the run. They are on the ropes. That we have taken care of this problem in essence. Unfortunately, that is not true. The reality is we still face a lot of dangers around the world which is why we need a military second to none and one of the issues that governor romney does talk about a lot it the fact that if he is elected he will not cut the military. If president obama is reelected he snead his own budget he wants to cut the mill tare arery a half trillion dollars and then in the sequestration another half trillion dollars. That is one of the big distinctions in the race. 
>> Because you have spent more time with him on the campaign trail was there a moment during the campaign that you saw the switch go on and mitt romney become the candidate we are are seeing tonight where all of the cylinders are firing? 
>> I think he loved the debates because the debates were an opportunity for him to frankly go around the attack ads and tell the american people directly who he is and what stands for and that is when did well. I think that was the moment. It was is perhapses a little more confidence on his part because he had that opportunity but it was mostly going around the media and what people were hearing about who he was and being able to tell the american people directly. Here in ohio we were being outspent all summer and into the fall about three to one on the campaign ads and the obama campaign ads were pretty effective and very negative. So the image of governor romney was not the an accurate one. He was able to get around the mischaracteristics and misperceptions about what his policies were and do it directly and that has made a difference. 

[00:07:28]


e: FOR YOU TO BE HERE Tonight means a lot. 
>> I met a bunch of your fans and they all appreciate what you do with this show and what you are doing around the country for so many candidates. 
>> Mike: If I have fans, may their tribe increase. 
>> Less than two months after terrorists killed americans in benghazi, libya, president is saying al-qaeda hass been decimated. My reaction to the the president's claims and othert notable quotables when wery return. I like to eat a lot of fruits. Love them all. The seal I get with the super poligrip free keeps the seeds from getting up underneath. Even well-fitting dentures let in food particles. Super poligrip is zinc free. With just a few dabs, it's clinically proven to seal out more food particles so you're more comfortable and confident while you eat. A lot of things going on in my life and the last thing I want to be thinking about is my dentures. 
[ Charlie ] TRY ZINC FREE SUPER POLIGRIP. If we want to improve our schools... ... what should we invest in? Maybe new buildings? What about updated equipment? They can help, but recent research shows... ... nothing transforms schools like investing in advanced teacher education. Let's build a strong foundation. Let's invest in our teachers so they can inspire our students. Let's solve this. Well, with three days left, both candidates have been flying all over the country trying to fit in as many campaign stops as humanly possible. But the speeches are to different audiences in is swing states to you might expect them to repeat their talking points in each and every speech. One of the president's favorite lines kicks off our quotes of the week. 

[00:11:35]


>> The war in afghanistan is winding down. Al-qaeda has been decimated. 
>> Al-qaeda has been decimate. 
>> Al-qaeda has been decimated. 
>> Mike: We have been hearing that a lot. You know, the president and vice president joe biden has been telling us that okay osama bin laden is dead and gn is alive. Maybe the real theme ought to be more like al-qaeda is alive and a u.S. Ambassador is dead. This narrative that al-qaeda has been decimated is obviously a little premature for the president to announce. It is evident al-qaeda was behind the attack in benghazi, libya. It was not just one person. We are all glad and I salute the president for calling the order to get rid of osama bin laden and we give them credit for that. But the idea that somehow we no longer have an issue with islamic jiaive. They will be around as long as there is any one willing to carry the torch and believe you me there is something will willing to do it. 
>> We will not tolerate red tape. We will not tolerate bureaucracy. Ugh tough times but we bounce back and the reason we bounce back is because we look out for one another and we don't believe anybody behind. 
>> Mike: That it the way it is supposed to be. We don't leave any one behind. You might have a hard time convincing some folks in staten island or long island or some folks on the jersey shore that no one has been left behind. Some of them haven't seen food or water or electricity, either gasoline or fuel for their homes new in freezing conditions since the initial hit of hurricane sandy. But they are not the only ones who feel left behind. I have a feeling that some of those folks in consulate in benghazi on the night of september 11th they felt left behind for nine hours as a heavy assault happened. Carefully orchestrated and planned. And then felt left behind for 17 days afterwards when the only real explanation the administration had for that incredible attack was that someone had been offended because they watched something on youtube. We should never leave an american behind whether they are on our shores, struggling from the aftermath of a hurricane, or trying to get out from under the guns of terrorists determined to kill every last one of us. Finally, here is how the president tried to motivate people to vote while campaigning in ohio just yesterday. 

[00:14:22]


>> At the time the republican congress and a senate candidate by the name of mitt romney -- no, no, no, don't boo, vote. Vote. Voting is is the best revenge. 
>> Well, I understand the president may have been usin that as rhetorical device. This is not about revenge. That is what is wrong with american politics it is about people winning and other people losing. When can it not be just simply a matter of every american winning because we are a country that recognizes that we may have sharp and stark differences but after all we are americansnd each of us have to respect the other and give a little, take little and learn to live as one nation under god, not a nation looking to get evenge at the other side. We have a remarkable story when we come back. We'll continue our show with a closing and powerful story of a couple who know mitt romney in a way that, well, you might not have heard before. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [ Mom ] WE ALREADY HAVE A tv. Would you like to know more abo it? Yeah, but let me put my wife on speaker. Hi! Hi. It's led and it has great picture quality. I don't know...

Which provided for their every financial need. And then, in one blinding blink of an eye, their tree had given its last. But with their Raymond James financial advisor, they had prepared for even the unthinkable. And they danced. See what a Raymond James advisor can do for you. One of the criticisms leveled at governor mitt romney is he a just a ruthless cold calculating businessman and didn't have compassion for people. That story got exploded during the republican convention. You may remember ts remarkable couple who came to the podium to tell a different side of mitt romney. 

[00:19:06]


>> The true measure of a man is revealed in his actions during times of trouble. The quiet hospital room of a dying boy with no cameras and no reporters. 
>> Mike: Joining me now from burlington, vermont, ted and patricia operkowski. Your story was pow youerful. I'm not sure there was a dry eye in the house and this is a pretty big house and no dry eyes. Ted, how did you first meet governor romney? What was the reason for your encounter with him? 
>> Well, the governor was church oriented. We met him at church the first time, him and his wife. And then from there we interacted a little and I was involved with the republican party in the city that I lived in and I asked him to speak. That was years ago and when his father was still a person of note. And then he spoke and he spoke about -- the is subject he spoke was his fa who he had a high regard for and -- 
>> and patricia -- go ahead, ted. Patricia, I wanted to ask about your son. He was 14, diagnosed with hodgkins disease. Terminally ill. 
>> Nonhodgkins. 
>> Mike: Nonhodgkins. 
>> During that time that is when mitt romney ministered to your family in a personal way. Tell us about that. 
>> Well, he used to come and visit us at our home and david ended up in and out of the hospital a lot because of treatments and infections and we discovered that mit would go to the hospital and visit david. We didn't really know that for awhile. But he did. And I think he must have done that early in the morning because we never saw him. Ted bumped into him one time but I never saw him there and i was with david at the hospital most of the time. 

[00:21:28]


>> Mike: And there was a remarkable story about david who knew that mitt romney was a harvard law graduate and asked him about making a will which is stuning that a 14-year-old boy would even think of such a thing. What did mitt romney do when david asked him to help him? 
>> Well, that is -- his mother knows more about that. But really what happened is knowing mitt that -- was a -- went to law school and he was a lawyer even though not practicing, david asked him because david at that time knew he was dying. He knew that a few weeks before and he was preparing as a 14-year-old boy in his way which is makes him a bigger man than many other people I know. 
>> Mike: We have lost them. And, you know, patricia and ted, I want to say thank you. You know, your story, how mitt romney came and helped them put together a will so that he could give away some of hi possessions to his friends. It does show a different side of him than we have ever heard before and patricia and ted, thank you for coming. I know it has been a long evening for you. We appreciate your being here tonight from vermont. 
>> Well, it is our pleasure, governor. 
>> Thank you so very much. 
>> Mike: I want to thank all of you for joining us here tonight on this special edition of huckabee. And with the romney speech we have extended a little bit. But more importantly, we want to close tonight by asking you to consider not only praying for those folks along our northeastern shore are who have been devastated by hurricane sandy, but do something more than just think about them or pray for them. Make a contribution to a charity that will reach out and help them and there are a number of people who have lost everything. Everything. And they just need something from each of us. Certainly we can give them our prayers but something tangible in the way of a contribution is most appropriate. That is what americans do. It is who we are. Now, that we are approaching an election and we think the most important thing in the world is the next president, for some people the most important thing in their world is the next meal or being able to get new the next night without heat or a way to get to work. For all of those folks, we say may god be with you and thanks for joining us tonight. From columbus, ohio, this is mike huckabee. Until next week, good night and god bless.

[ Male Announcer ] E PILL EACHMORNING. 24 Hours. Zero heartbur 
>>> the first order of government is the protection of its citizens. The first order of the military is to march to the sound of the gun and leave no one behind. This week our commander in chief reaffirmed his pledge to support and protect all americans. 
>> We are here for you. D we will not forget. We will follow up to make sure that you get all of the help that you need. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Unless, of course, you are in benghazi. Hello and welcome to "justice." I'm judge jeanine pirro. This week cables continue to prove that the obama administration lied, denied, and people died. Those cables reveal more of what the white house knew and when they knew it. It wasn't 48 hours after the attack when the white house knew that ansar al-sharia attacked the consulate but less than four hours that they knew who was responsible and yet mr. President you continued to say "the view" and letterman that you were investigating and you talked about the video and you continued to apologize to the arab world. Not only do we know that ambassador stevens was afraid for his safety and he wasn't sure that he would even live through 9/11, but he sent a cable at 6:43 a.M. On september 11th that morning saying that libyans who were part of the police mission were photographing the mission inside. And hillary even before that cables notified you on august 16 that security was trending negatively and that there was a concern that the libyan militia, charged with protecting the consulate, had been compromised. Even infiltrated by extremists and that approximately 10 islamist militias and al-qaeda training camps were known to operate around benghazi. And yet you, hillary, continued to talk about a video that no one besides you ever heard of. 

[00:29:31]


>> The united states government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its content and message. 
>> Judge Jeanine: And now we know that not only had notice, warn and individual pleas for help from the ambassador, which you refused, buat you watched the savegeing of four american -- savegeing of four americans in real time. Those in the white house situation room watched it as it happened. But I guess pictures of the white house situation room are only released when they benefit you. But oh, I foregot, what is to watch? Al-qaeda is on its heels. It has been destroyed. In fact, the president told us that this very week. 
>> Al-qaeda has been decimated. Osama bin laden is dead. 
>> Now, I know the old geiser who watched porno films in that hut is dead but I'm not so sure al-qaeda is. Let's not politicize this. 
>> This is something that the american people can take to the bank is that my administration plays this stuff straight. We don't play politics when it comes to american national security. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Take it to the bank? Mr. President, your check just bounced. Here is one person determined to find the truth about benghazi. SENATOR john McCain joins me now on the phone. Good evening, senator. 
>> Good evening, judge. I'm sorry that I'm not there to be looked at. We are in virginia and we are campaigning for mitt romney and so I'm glad to talk to you on the phone. By the way, I think your depiction of events as they have transpired everything i know is totally accurate and i want to me to you that in traveling around virginia today I was in o yesterday, I was in montana before that, north dakota, I can tell you our veterans and our active duty military are angry. They have lost any trust in this commander in chief that they might have once had and I'm telling you I have never seen them so angry as they are and with good reason. 

[00:32:02]


>> Judge Jeanine: And, of course, senator, none of us can blame them. But senator, you are asking for a new committee to be created an immediate creation of a temporary select committee possibly encompassing members of both the senate and the house to conduct an investigation into the death of these four americans. and oversight committee looking at it and we have other committees. Thing of the greatest interest is that hillary clinton is investigating her own state department. Are you requesting this select committee not trusting the findings of the state department? 
>> You can't trust their findings. You can't trust the timeline that was just put out by the cia. Fox already reported in the last few hours that there are peop on the ground in libya that will directly refute their sequence of events. It is a coverup, judge. Let's call it what it is, it is a coverup. And one of our veterans by the way pointed out to me that in watergate nobody died. And the fact is that we -- in order for the american people to get the full story they would have to be a bipartisan select committee like watergate and like severaller whos that we have had like iran contra and the facts need to be known and the facts can only come out that way. And any conclusions that the state department or any other government organization might have have to be discounted completely. And finally, you c have a situation like this continue to fester, it now turned into a centipede. Another shoe just dropped a couple of hours ago and believe me, there are more. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Senator, a lot of people are saying that the august 16 cable that serves as basically a smoking gun that al-qaeda had training camps and they were worried about them in benghazi. Do you think it was a smoking gun? 

[00:34:06]


>> I think it is one of the smoking guns. I think that one of the other smoking guns is, of course, the attacks on the consulate that took place in april and june. The fact that the british ambassador -- there was an assassination attempt and the fact that they closed their consulate. The red cross left. There were many repeated warnings. You just talked about ambahris stevens. He s multitude of cables back demanding that there be a better security or warning of the deterioration. You know, foreign policy magazine people went in to the consulate there and found some other messages. I mean isn't that stunning that months later that they should be coming in? Where was the fbi? But I think the major point is that the president of the united states wanted to say that osama bin laden is gone and al-qaeda is on the run. Al-qaeda is not on the run. They are all over iraq. They are pouring in to syria. They have taken over northern mali. I'm telling you it is because the weak and feckless leadership by this president that al-qaeda is not only not on the run or decimated they are far, far stronger than they were four years ago. 
>> Judge Jeanine: And senator, I think events of of the past month or so have made that clear. Senator, you been in politics for many years around all of us be our government. We want to believe our government leaders. Have you lost faith, have you lost faith like so many people have in the word of the white house and what clearly are lies? They knew they were li at the time? How does it make you feel? 
>> Makes me feel terrible. Makes me even feel worse that i lost. But when t president of the united states says things that are patently false, when goes to the united nations even and says that it was still a spontaneous demonstration caused by a hateful video, when -- I was on "face the nation" the sunday that susan rice was out there and immediately after susan rice gave thaessage, the hateful video they had the president of the libyan national assembly come on right after that and said no, this is an al-qaeda operation. An al-qaeda operation. He said it unequivocally. Let for days and weeks afterwards they kept up this facade. I guess they think they are running out the clock. Just yesterday the state department had a news conference and their spokesperson refused to answer a single question about benghazi. Somehow that? 

[00:36:57]


>> Judge Jeanine: And you know what, senator, I think when you can say you are investigating and it is all about beat the clock. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Judge Jeanine: The election is three days away and the biggest concern I think of some especially the military is will we ever get to the bottom of this. Will we ever know or get the administration to admit what they knew. 
>> The only way we are going to know is a bipartisan committee. A select committee such as we had with iran contra and water gate and others that has credibility with the american people. By the way, I wonder when the mainstream moodia is going to -- media is going start carrying this story? 
>> Judge Jeanine: Certainly a disappointment to all of us. Senator, we very much appreciate your time and we will take a rain check on your being here this evening. Thank you so much, senator john McCAIN. 
>> And could I just finally say thank you you for your staying on this store arery, judge. I appreciate it. 
>> Judge Jeanine: My pleasure. 
>> And so do the families of the people who died. Thank you. 
>> Judge Jeanine: Thank you, senator. Coming up, did the obama administration sit on its hands and watch as four americans were killed when help was just minutes away? running hard, try running four. Fortunately we've got ink. It gives us 5x the rewards on our internet, phone charges and cable, plus at office supply stores. Rewards we put right back into our business. This is the only thing we've ever wanted to do and ink helps us do it. Make your mark with ink from chase. 

[00:41:56]


>> Retired u.S. Army colonel and fox military analyst, and former cia operative mike baker in new york city. Thanks for being with us this evening. The first thing I want to talk about, now that we know there was this cabling on august AUGUST 16th, BASICALLY SAYING al QAEDA IS IN THE REGION, We're squared scared, we need more security. We now no the white house situation room was watching real time as this unfolded. I want to look at who was in the white house situation, who would have been able to see what was going on in benghazi. 
>> You have department of state security office on the phone, to the department of state operations there. That goes directly to the situation room. He had a drone up. Ran out of gas. Another drone up. You had cia operations guys in benghazi talking, and then guys -- 
>> so we have audio, visual, and calls at that point in real-time and satellite and the drones, so who is watching. 
>> This is unfolding before their eyes and as the colonel said, as soon as this balloon goes up, you've got langly, for the cia, state department, the white house situation room. They're all screaming for information. And so you have the chief of base in benghazi, to the degree he can, the chief of station in tripoli. They're all sending information back. They positioned a drone overhead to provide -- the clarity is quite good -- to provide information on their terminal so they can watch. 
>> So anyone who had access to that computer could see this real-time. 
>> The third embassy in 24 hours going up in smoke. A lot of trouble in the middle east. Everybody is watching and listening. 
>> Let's talk about, the question should be, who didn't know? What was going on? Everybody knew. Let's talk about the military assets in the area that could have gotten to benghazi. 

[00:43:58]


>> There's an important point to lead this off with. As we talk about this. Which is that in very short order the white house knew that we were not getting a counterassault support from the libyans themselves. So we knew, as this thing was beginning to unfold, the libyans, our friends, were doing nothing to provide support. 
>> Because we knew at 6:43 in the morning that -- and from the cable a month before, that it was being infiltrated. So, this libyan militia, they said they called for him, they're almost the enemy. 
>> Whave been at war for 11 years. What the united states military and intelligence community know how to do is react to a fire fight in another country. We had jets, and ability on the ground from the cia to call them in, and to pinpoint -- 
>> all right. What's an f-16. 
>> A very fast moving jet. 
>> What'on it? 
>> Guns, bombs, ve -- and they can go very specific targeted if they have somebody pointing at it. The point is it's very fast and very available. Within 25 minutes. 
>> You have the resources. You have seen on the graphic in the region. The important thing is we've got -- this attack is unfolding, this agency, the cia has personnel on te ground, global response guys, they are not there to provide long-term defensive capability. They there are t hold off the hostiles until the cavalry shows up, and the covenant is that the cavalry will show up. 
>> It didn't. The cia guys did a phenomenal job. 
>> They're heroes. 
>> They reacted with side arms against 125 guys, and actually rescued some people. The problem is the military is supposed to back them up. 
>> Let's talk about the f-16. With the bomber capability we know there were some in northern italy and we say it would take 25 minutes, from the base or -- 

[00:45:59]


>> if they move the aircraft, which they did, down to siganala, they're 25 minutes from the target. 
>> The first attack its 9:40. They know about it immediately. Yes in. 
>> Yes. 25 minutes later, the fight goes on how late? 
>> The fight goes on for -- 
>> for nine hours. But there's two waves. The first wave is when you lose stevens, and the other -- and smith. The second wave, seven hours later -- 
>> doesn't matter. We know that once the attack starts, we know that we've got a very short period of time for the -- on the ground 0, cia people to have some type of counterassault effort to try to hold off until the military shows, and we know again the libyans aren't providing support. So at that point immediately you have to try. 
>> But we had the f-16s and could have gotten 0 to benghazi long before the second wave, if not the first wave. 
>> Yeah. All they needed was the order to go, and they weren't given it. 
>> They kept asking for it. Let's go to an ac-130. What its that? 
>> Ac-130 is a c-130 with a 105-millimeter canyon, a good good gattlin x and we had agencies on the group that could have called it. I. 
>> That's is what woods kept calling for. 
>> Yes, we had two of our guys the ron rooftop. Identified hostile positions, they were anticipating, hoping -- it's not just the two guys on the rooftop we're talk about trying to save. It's the 30 plus from the consulate that our guys rescued, all those people that apparentl the white house said, I don't know, maybe you'll be taken hostage or you'll die inhe attack but we're not going to try. 
>> Moving people under fire to their face and need this military cover, which is available. It was moved to help them and didn't get the order to go. 

[00:48:01]


>> Let's give some of the benefit of the doubt. I don't like giving liars the benefit of the doubt. Let's assume they were worried about collateral damage. They could have lowered the f-16s to make a lot of noise and disburse the crowd? 
>> They could a have done a flyover, and again, this is the part that is so frustrating and disingenuous, and honestly i don't know how anybody who has been in the military or intel community, how they can understand or process what the white house is saying. We didn't have enough information. 
>> We had visual and audio information. Again, we've been fighting for 11 years in iraq and afghan. We know how to do this. 
>> Let's pull up the next screen we heard about delta force being moved from central europe to ciganela. 
>> Special force operations, they're the best we have in the army. Again, people would recognize it because of the seal team 6. Same type of organization, counterterrorism. They were training in europe in 
-- and they got the call with two and a half hours to get to benghazi, and the special forces group, a marine forward area support team. These are trained marines to do exactly what they were not allowed to do. 
>> They could have made it but no one gave them permission to go. 
>> Piniella said, who I have a great deal of respect for, very good at the agency, about he has come out and is carrying water for the administration and is saying that we didn't have enough information, we can't deploy the troops into harm's way. That's what they train for. That what they expect to be dropped into harm's way. 
>> They don't need to pack a bag for 24 hours later. They just hit. 
>> They're ready to go. 
>> If you wait for all the information, bad things happen. 
>> Of course, of course, and WHAT senator McCain just said, the military is worried now. While the cavalry come? Thank you so much for being with us explain this. We're going to do more of this in the future. Coming up, the president says, al QAEDA IS DECIMATED AND ON Its heels. Is he even telling the truth and later, will we ever see justice for the four americans killed in benghazi? fail, through. Introducing the new Droid Razr Maxx HD by Motorola. Now more than ever DROID DOES. U:U:U:U:Uk 

[00:53:44]


>>> President obama is REPEATEDLY CLAIMED THAT al Qaeda is on the run. On its heels, and keeps bringing up that osama bin laden's death has occurred. But is he telling the truth? IS al QAEDA REALLY Desdecimated? With me is former reagan defense official and frank gaffney, a pleasure to have you with us this evening. 
>> Good evening. Good to be with you. 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT al QAEDA, Is it decimateed, on the run, on its heels? 
>> I believe the president is knowingly misleading the american people, putting it gently. Lying to them about this -- there's every reason to believe THAT al QAEDA IS STRONGER Today than it was when he took office. It certainly is operating with impunity in more places, a is more aggressive as a result, i believe, of his policies. So far from them being on the path to defeat or decimated, as he likes to say, apart from some people in the leadership who clearly have been taken out, the organization and particularly the franchises of the organization, the wanna-bes, those affiliated with it that are now rung, in some cases effectively, countries. For example, the size of france. 
>> Frank, let me ask you this. Where are they getting the arms from? 
>> It's some of it, I believe, they're getting from places that are -- happy to supply them. I think the saudis, the turks are providing some of the arms. Some of the arms I think almost certainly have emanated from the caches of moammar gadhafi, and some reason to believe those were made available through a pipeline from our own efforts to gather up those weapons in libarch sent on to turkey, by shipment, as fox news reported, and sent across the border to syria. Unfortunately the people getting the weapons in syria are the muslim brotherhood. 

[00:56:09]


>> I'm coming up against a hard break. Frank, muslim brotherhood, are we in a better position with them? Charge? Who are they? Very quickly, frank. 
>> The muslim brotherhood is an organization that is it -- islamist to its core. Seeks our destruction. They're not our friends. We should not be trying to do business with them, period. 
>> Frank gaffney, I want to have you back on this. That's it for us tonight, folks, thanks for joining us. We'll see you next week. Yeah, but let me put my wife on speaker. Hi! Hi.

but once y've got your meat, you're not going back, and they know it. Message! Maybe it's that guy trying to call his parole officer again. Or it could be that SUV's owner thanking me for the note suggesting they learn to park better. And the mystery caller is... Just play the dang message. Cotton: Of course you're not there! (disgusted groan): Oh, Cotton. But you bett be tomorrow, 'cause I'm finally getting rid of my vehicle. I'll arrive at 1200 hours to turn ovekeys. That is all. I'll be darned. Dad's finally letting go of his Cadillac. That car's taken me to some of the greatest events of my childhood. Football games, baseball games, basketball games. It's been like a member of the family. Except that Cotton loved it. Huh. Yeah. Yep, my dad should be here with the car any minute now. I still remember the day he brought that car home. It was on my birthday. After that it became known as the car's birthday. Now we'll finally be able to celebrate together. Remember how we'd ride back from Boy Scouts and I'd talk too much, and Cotton would throw me in the trunk? Yeah, man, talkin' about them old good times, man. (car hwrn plays "La Cucaracha") Here he comes! It's in perfect tune. Good noon, Colonel! Yeah, Dad, thanks for coming. I appreciate the chance to buy a piece of our family history. Buy it?! The only thing you get is the chance to wash it. Do a good job for once. I don't want your cousin Dusty finding any dog dirt on the pedals. Dusty? Well, what's he got to do with it? He called and made me an offer, right out of the blue. You're selling it to him? Nah. I'm giving it to him. I couldn't take money from my brother's boy. Dusty's always been like a son to me. I'm your son! I suppose. But Dusty's already got more cars than he knows 

[00:02:00]


what to do with. He sure as heck doesn't deserve this one. You can keep the bucket, but give these to Dusty. And that's how I get to the grocery store. No. I swear to you Hank isn't here. Now, as I was saying... (door closes) Oh, Hank just walked in. It's Dusty. My mistake. It was just a bird caught in the curtains. Okay, bye. What did hewa Dusty is coming in from Houston tomorrow to pick up the car. (groans): Oh, great. While he's here, he can take some other things I care about. It was nice being married to you, Peggy. Come on, Hank. So you and Dusty don't get along. That makes this a great opportunity to patch things up. Patch things up? Don't you rememberur wedding? How he and his buddies got up on stage with the band? "Just one song, Hank." Which is all he ayed-- one song. Yeah, "Radar Love," with a got-dang 20-minute bass solo. (sighs): I'd better go tell Bobby the truth about Dusty. It was crazy for mout. HANK (sighs): Uh, son, every family has its secrets. (groans) Now... I'm gonna play this tape, and you're gonna see some things that, uh... (groans): This is harder than I thought. Just watch, if you can. (playing intro to "Sharp-Dressed Man") You see, Bobby, I have a cousin named Dusty. He's the one with the beard. The-the one on t left. We're related to ZZ Top?! Not so loud, son. See, rock stars have different morals and values and... Sthat! Now, Dusty's coming by the house tomorrow. Do not ask him what time it is. He always says, "It's time to rock." I bet the first thing Dusty does with this car 

[00:04:01]


is put flames on the front of it like he did with his go-cart. Yeah, like thatmade it go faster. Wait, it didn't? Dusty's always been about flash. Have you ever looked at our high school yearbook? Many, many times. He and his idiot friends snuck into every activities picture. Remember how they tricked you into thinking that Tom Landry died? Yeah, and then when he finally did die, I didn't believe it, and I went to work anyway. I'm still mortified. They were always pulling those practical jokes on me. (intro to "Legs" playing) (all laughing) 
?????? She got legs   ??????
So I-I'm getting a propane award, huh? Wow, this is such an honor. I-Is Commissioner Hogarth here? Dusty: Hey, everyone, we've hired a new dancer! What?! (cheering) (all laughing) (crying) (all laughing) (sighs): Idiots. Kahn: Say... nice Caddy. Cotton gave it to Hank's cousin Dusty. Bit ofe point. Your cousin, eh? Isn't that hillbilly term for wife? Th-There's a taxi coming! I bet it's Dusty. There they are! Hey, Hank. Dale. Bill. Boomhauer. Dusty Hill?! Hank Hill?! Why didn't you say you were related to the man whose band helped launch the story-driven music video? Well, you just answered your own question. I got to get Minh! "Tush" is her favorite song! Say, the old gal looks pretty snazzy. Yeah, well, anyway, uh, you'll probably want to be getting back to Houston and your current wife. You know, while I was out there touring and making records and whatnot, let some things slip by that really matter to me. nds, 

[00:06:02]


family. I guess what I'm trying to say is, it's be nice spending a couple of days hanging out with you, just catching up. Well, uh, I don't know, uh... (Bobby squeals) Is this him?! Are you him? Oh, my God! Can I speak at him, please? Looks like your dad's raising you right. Uh, I guess so. Well, you know, Dusty, it's a long trip from Houston. Why don't you come in and have some iced tea and...? Man: Cut! We need to reset from "I let some things slip that mattered to me." We're getting too much glare from the skinny guy's sunglasses. What the heck's going on? I'm the star of my own reality show. You and I won't be just hanging out, we'll be doing it on TV. Finally! Hahahaha! Hooohooo, hahaha! This is awesome! Folks who save hundreds of dollars itching to GEICO sure are happy. I'd say Happier than a Slinky on an escalator. Get happy. Get GEICO. Melons!!! Oh yeah!! Well that was uncalled for. Folks who save hundreds of dollars switching to GEICO sure are happy. How happy, Ronny? Happier than Gallagher at a Farmers' Market. Get happy. Get GEICO. captioning sponsored in part by... up chocolate. Don't forget about that payroll meeting. Rolo.Get your smooth on. Also in minis. 

[00:09:26]


They are shooting a freakin' reality show! Did you get that? That was me discovering you're shooting a rey show. This could be my big break! Bobby, get inside. Good lord, Dusty, did you run out of ways to embarrass yourself? No, this is going to be great, Hank. America wants reality, and I'm the guy to give it to 'em. Buh! You sure are, Dust. Paul Portis, ImPORTant Productions. He's the best. Check out the title for our show: Behind The Beard. You're welcome. You think everything's fun and games, Dusty. Well, it's not. Yeah, well, you might change your mind after you see your dog. Okay, that tears it! I am sick of you messing with me. (sighs) Boy, I actually thought Dusty might have changed, but he's just the same flashyn in my neck he used to be. What a joke. Joke? Did you see the way Bobby lit up when he saw those cameras? I walked into his room this morning and he was... he was singing into a hairbrush. Uh-huh, uh-huh! Go on! You know, sometimes when things went wrong with Cotton, I just thought, "Well, at least I'm getting that car one day." And now he just swoops in and takes it. Your joke made me sad. Portis: This is not interesting at all. We need something else! (laughing): You should check this out! This guy doesn't get angry. He becomesanger. It really pops. I'm gonna punch u silly, you... Gonna knock your teeth in, I tell you... That tears it! Ah, watch the vein in his head. You could add jungle drums each time it throbs. (drums playing) There's your act break, people, and your bus-side, your gro separator and your cover of TVfrickin' Guide. This is our new job-- 

[00:11:26]


pissing off Hank Hill. (drums beating) Hank: I'm gonna tear your beard off! People really respond to your interacting with Hank. By "interacting" you mean messing with him, right? Sometimes I think it's too easy, but it's just so much dang fun. It's not just fun for you, it's fun for Ame. And most importantly, it's fun for Hank. Well, damn, if that's the case, I know just the guys to help. How about we try that new soup place? Because it sure is soup weather. (doorbell rings) All: Hey, Hank. (sighs): No. Don't worry, Hank. We're just here selling buttfors. What'sutt...? No. (all laugh) I just want to apologize for any hard feelings about the show, Hank, so we brought over one of our gold records... and buried it somewhere in your lawn. What the hell? (sputters) Wait for us! We're in! Dang it, Dusty, I'm gonna take that gold record and shove your face through the little hole! (whistle blows?? DALE: Let's go! (sputters) (gunshot) No! Dale: Let's dig and dig deep. My lawn! Hey, man. (grunts) Run! Hillbilly! (snoring softly) (laughing quietly) Shh. (snoring continues) (laughter continues) Shh. Shh. Shh. Queen Bee Barbecue. (loud guitar chord plays) Now serving shrimps. What the...?! (rock music playing) PEGGY: Although Hank's urethra isn't technically blocked, it's just narrow. Peggy! Get them out of here! My house is off limits! Where's Bobby? He's fine. He's in the Truth Booth. Oh, God! Let me through. I need to get in there. Hey, I'm next! Dale, move aside unless 

[00:13:26]


you want me to kick your ass. Yes, do it! That's how I'll get on TV! No, kick mine! I want to be on camera, please! I believe I'm the one who deserves the kicking. I slept with his best friend's wife for 13 years. Yeah, Bill's wife was a tramp. Big deal. Now shut up and let Hank kick the ass he started on! So Jerry Lee, Jimmy Swaggart and me are ready for action when who should appear but... Bobby: Whee! Do it again! Do it again! Stop spinning my son! All right, that does it. I want everybody out. You with the camera, everyone. But not me, right? Get! So you kicked 'em all out? I guess they deserved it. Dang right they deserved it. I can't believe you gave this car to Dusty, Dad. After all the times I've detailed it and all the tune-ups I've given it. I guess I didn't realize how much Marlena meant to you. Well, how could you not know that? Well, sometimes I don't think, boy. Aw, Dad. Oh, got-dang it, you're in on this, too? (laughs): Just having some fun, Hank! Something you don't know nothing about. While you were wasting time having a family and buying a house and having a career, Dusty was busy making something out of his life. Why didn't you join a band, boy? (laughing) This footage is great, but we need to push the envelope with him. Think, think, think. He really hates code violations. We could make fun of propane. Propane? Whoa, you can only push a man so far. We've been riding Hank pretty hard. let's lay off him and do something else fun. I've said it once, I'll say it again. Me and the guys could always get naked. Uh, sure, sure. All good ideas. I'll confab with the team here 

[00:15:28]


to see if we can find something golden. We can't lay Hank. He's our bread and butter. You find anything? Oh, yeah. hs) I can't believe you gave ts car to Dusty, Dad. After all the times I've detailed it, and all the tune-ups I've given it... We hurt the Caddy, we hurt Hank. Go! Do a cross-promotion thing with Burger King and crash it into a replica of the Eiffel Tower made out of Whoppers. We could set it on fire. On Mommy Versus Nanny anytime we burned things, weot an instant ten share. The 18-34 crowd really loves a good explosion. I got a better idea. We'll do all three. So Dusty took the car back to Houston already, huh? No. The car's at the shop. They're reinforcing the gas tank and removing the radiator. Well, that is idiotic. These old V-8s run hot. It'll seize up in a few hundred miles. Doesn't need to last that long. Dusty's driving it in a demolition derby. Demolition derby?! No! King of the Hill is brought to you in part by... part by... New pink lemonade 5-hour ENERGY? 5-hour ENERGY supports the avon Foundation for Women Breast Cancer Crusade. So I can get the energized feeling I need and support a great cause? I'm sold. Pink lemonade 5-hour ENERGY? Yeah and a portion of every sale goes to the Avon Foundation for Women Breast Cancer Crusade. I'm sold. New pink lemonade 5-hour ENERGY. Get the alert, energized feeling you need and support breast cancer research and access to care. 

[00:19:32]


We gotta stop this. I will not let Dusty demolish the car I grew up in. And the trunk I grew up in! My God, I've always dreamed of driving somewhere to stop something bad from happening and now I'm doing it! (indistinct voice over P.A.) (engines revving) DUSTY (over loudspeaker): Hello, Arlen! Are you ready to derby?! (crowd cheering) Hey! Hey there, baby! Hey, we're gonna go scout the talent in the crowd. This is it, people! Here comes our gorgeous, angry monkey. Camera one, I want you close on his neck vein. Camera two, you're on his shaking fists and spittle. If something inside his brain pops, I want to see it! Oh, good, Dusty's not out there yet. Maybe I can still save the car (car horn playing "La Cucaracha") Good Lord. Ugh. It looks like a giant toilet seat cover. So soft... yet so powerful. Hey, Hank! It's like he doesn't even care that those tires are whitewalls. (engines revving) (growling) (metal crashing) (cheering) (engine not starting) (engine not starting) (whimpers) (grunts) Dusty! Quick, you gotta get out of there! Come on! 

[00:21:34]


(grunting) He's trapped. Someone's gotta get him out of there before the car explodes. The car that you love ng destroyed. How does that make you feel? And could you please repeat the question in your answer? Put those got-dang cameras down and help him! Come on! (coughing): Help! I'm all tangled up! Get me outta here. "Get me outta here"? Somebody give Dusty a better line! "Don't let this car be my coffin"? Uh, "Gimme all your helpin'!" "I've got legs, but I don't know if I can use them!" (coughing) Hang in there, Dusty. I'll get you outta there. (grunts) (sighs) Everything's gonna be okay. (coughing) You all right, Dusty? Nuh... Uh... Oh, I guess not. Oh, my God. You know what, Dusty? I'm glad you're okay, but I don't ever want to see you again. I'm tired of your stupid pranks, and I'm tired of your got-dang rock 'n' roll, anything-goes lifestyle. Why are you mad? I'm the one with the injured beard. You call that angry? This is supposed to be our promo moment. Look at that car! You loved that car! Doesn't it make you want to punch Dusty with your upstage hand?! Hank, wait! Did that Caddy really mean that much to you?! As mucas your beard means to you. Oh! Oh! I'm sorry, Hank. I assumed when Cotton gave the Caddy to me so quickly, and for free, you didn't want it. Yeah, well, Cotton... he's a jackass. And you knew about this? After I told you to lay off Hank, you set up this whole thing? That does it, Portis-- your show is canceled. You don't tell me when the show is canceled. 

[00:23:35]


The network does. I've got contracts with you. Paper can be ripped... like your head. We're at a demolition derby in Texas. You want me to tell these folks you're from Hollywood? You've seen what we've done to Hank, and we likehim. You best watch your back, son. Fine, do what you want. VH-1 Classics is swarming with bands who'll eat anything I ask them to. I'm sorry about the car. Well, I'm sorry about the beard. Ah, she'll grow back. Your beard's a girl? Well, thanks for fixing her up for me. It's the least I could do, cuz. So, Dusty, I was wondering... when you guys are ready to go on tour, do you think maybe I could go with you? We'd love to have you, Bobby, but if you want to succeed in show business, you gotta stay in school. Rock 'n' roll takes a lot of hard work and smarts. You gotta know a lot of stuff, like, umm, umm... arithmetic. And earth science. And the presidents. Man, I thought being a rock star would be more fun than that. Nuh-uh. (metallic clanging) (glass shatters)

L that. But especially when you eat it, it speaks of goodness. A plateful of delicious ravioli. Everybody loves them. Once you make them, they'll love you, too. 
[ Theme music playing ] 
[ lidia squeals ] 
>> Man: You feel the crack? 
>> Lidia: Yeah, I feel the crack and the pinch. Ah, feels good. Say "chioggia." 
>> Chioggia. 
>> Ah, there you go, you're italian. Can I just get into it? Come and join me! america" by... Grana padano cheese, versatile and very italian. colavita, an italian family brand. foods, preserving the culinary heritage of authentic italian foods by offering over 100 specialty italian products for the american kitchen. Cento. ???????????? 
>> buon giorno, benvenuti! Benvenutito "lidia's italy," "lidia's italy in america." And today we could be anywhere in america and just about anywhere in italy, because we are making ravioli. Ravioli, it's a stuffed pasta, and what it is, it's, I mean, it means home, it means love, it means deliciousness, but really, it's an ingenious way to use everything that you have -- some leftovers, some vegetables, whatever you have. Ravioli can be stuffed with anything. In this case, I have some sausages out of the casing going. That's kind of rendering. Let's make the dough. The dough is very simple. It's some simple egg dough. Some flour, then olive oil, two eggs -- they go right in here -- and a little bit of water -- oh, let's see. One, two, three. Always underestimate the liquid. You can always add some. Just whisk that. Pinch of salt. 

[00:02:27]


[ Whirring ]okay, once the dough begins to collect, it is ready. We will finish rolling it on the table. It's nice and soft. You don't want the dough for the ravioli overly tight, because you want to roll it. You want it to be silky. Perfect, beautiful. You see how it's silky. It goes, it just, you know, the dough feel. We'll put it in some plastic wrap, and just let it rest for, oh, half an hour. Room temperature. Just chill it a little bit is fine also. Just keep in mind, if the dough is chilled, you're going to have to work in stretching it out a little more, but on the other hand, it doesn't just stick. Because if it's at room temperature, you have to work it quick. So we'll put that in the refrigerator. I'll clean up, and we'll continue with the filling. So let's finish the stuffing for the ravioli. The sausages are getting nice and crisp. We need a pistata,vegetables. Carrots, celery, and onions. Pistatais for everything. The base, really, all the vegetables. But it just brings, you know, a lot of sensibility to this stuffing. So we'll get all of this cooking, deglaze it with some wine. Add just a little bit of salt for the vegetables. The sausages are flavored. And we'll cook it down, and we'll let it cool. And we'll make the stuffing, add some ricotta to it, and it's going to be delicious. ???????????? in america, ravioli is surely the most popular pasta. But during my travels in italy, I found that pasta popularity ries from region to region and even town to town. And some of my most treasured memories are the times I spent with the local women, gathering around the time-worn wooden table, making their local pastas by hand. In basilicata, I spent a day with a group of women who made an array of beautiful fresh pastas. 

[00:05:11]


[ Conversing in italian ] with the correct tool in hand, I learned how to form beautiful spirals of fusilli. And in puglia, I spent an afternoon with the lovely anna, who patiently taught me the sleight of hand necessary to make her specialty, orecchiette, the "little ears" that are so delicious with broccoli di rape and sausage. 
[ Conversing in italian ] grazie, grazie, grazie. I had a great teacher here. I know how to make orecchiette. Memories I will cherish forever. So does this look complicated? Yes, there's a lot of things here, but it gets done 1, 2, 3. So let's finish the stuffing, and then we'll actually roll out the dough. So we have here the sausage and the vegetables, ricotta -- the omnipresent ricotta in italians' fillings. Some grated cheese. Prezzelo,chopped parsley. Yes, yes, parsley is always good for you. And mix that well. Now, you see here, we have just the meat, the ricotta, and again, if you have sometimes like leftover roasted chicken, turkey, or any braised meat, you just cut it up, freshen it up a little bit in the pan with the vegetables, and you've got yourself a great filling. So a little macchinettalike this is ideal. You like the size, because, just like that, flip it over, and you've got yourself ravioli. You start at the wider openings and you kind of work it up a little bit. Make it a little smaller, and i think, you know, you take three rollings. Thinner one. Okay. Let's go. So what we did is, you know, the dough that we made, I cut it in four parts. And you get four strips, like this. And out of each, you can make six, seven ravioli. You don't want to put flour on it, because it won't seal. Let me just cut a little bit the corners off, so that we can work. All right. Little bit of water, just to make sure that it sticks, so that they don't open up on you. And gently just take it over. Fold it over. Press it a little down. Don't be afraid to handle the dough. You know, people say, "oh, the dough, the dough." No, no, no, the dough is perfectly fine. It will survive. It survives boiling water, so it will be just fine. Just a little bit, press it down, just like that. And get yourself a cutter. And you cut off here. Some people press it all around. I don't. I just press it where I cut it, so it seals. I like it puffy, because if you press the dough, it's a double dough, and then this one is the thinner part, and it cooks and it breaks, and the end are kind of very chewy. So you don't want to do that. Okay. Here we are. I made some before, because i didn't want to hold you up so much. On a clean kitchen towel, and they're ready to be cooked. Salted water, plenty of water. When you're doing fresh pasta, you know, you need a little extra water, because of the flour. Okay, let's just plop them right in. Let me put a little more here. Here I have just some simple marinara sauce, but you certainly can have bolognese sauce or butter and sage. But with these, since we have the meat in there, just a little tomato sauce. A little bit of oil. Mm, mm. And a little vino. Nero d'avola. Nero d'avola, it's like a zinfandel, but it's a great fruity wine. Now southern italy is producing some real great wines, and at good prices. So I have my little vino set here. And I think I'm ready. Oh, I have all these little garlic cloves in here. Marinara, I love my garlic, so let me pick them out. And ravioli don't require a lot of sauce. Just enough to kind of lubricate them, to make them float in your mouth. Okay, give them one boil, and they don't have to boil like regular dried pasta, certainly. Okay, I think we are ready just to slide them right in. And, you know, for the ravioli, as I tell you for regular pasta, save a little bit of the pasta water. Okay. Shake that pan. You don't want to go in there, poking with a fork. Mm, mm. So they're all dressed. Okay. That looks pretty good. Maybe just a little bit more sauce. What do you think? Okay. Little bit of formaggio. Ah, a little fresh basil, just, you know, when there's tomatoes, there's basil. Just like that. Okay, I am ready. Mm, mm, mm. That wasn't hard or difficult or took a long time. Let me take mine. I'll take this one. Oh, so.Okay, I'll take some basil, and put a little formaggio for you. All you need is just like that. And fantastico. So I think the time has come. Look at this. You come to the table with this, I mean, it speaks, it speaks. It speaks italian, it speaks of love, it speaks of family, it speaks of all of that. But especially when you eat it, it speaks of goodness. Let me taste that for you. Mm! Delicious. Boston's north end is a lovely italian neighborhood with italian businesses of every variety lining its streets. of my favorite pastry shops are just steps away from each other and offer two different looks at the immigrant experience. Modern pastry, on hanover street, is run by a third-generation italian american family. I stopped in to chat with johnny picariello, one of the owners. Modern pastry shop has been here for how long? Modern pastry has been here since 1930 in this one location. 

[00:13:28]


>> Wow, 1930, so that's a lot of years, but even before that, no? Yeah, we go back about 150 years, back to my father's town. And we're five generations of pastry chefs. 
>> You're five generations of pastry chefs? So here you are, you're american born. Certainly you could have been anything in amer but you chose to continue this profession -- why? 
>> It's in your blood. You're born into this business, and as a little kid, I used to come to work with my father, and right from the start, you know you're going to be a baker. 
>> Lidia: So what are some of the old favorites, and what are some of the favorites that people ask for and that you still make? 
>> We make our own torrone. Very hard to come by in the united states. You know, very big in europe. We make a large line of torrone. I mean, our ricotta pie, we've been making it the same way for 150 years. Cannolis. So popular, and we, you know, we still make them the same way. So it's excellent. 
>> Lidia: I see the sfogliatelle you have, and you have the big lobster tails, too. 
>> Yes, we do, sfogliatelle. That's surprising. That's something that started to die out, and now it's coming back stronger th ever, which is amazing. My own little kids -- I've got a daughter that's 8 yearold -- loves sfogliatelle. 
>> Good. Are you training anybody? 
>> I am, traing two of them. They seem to like the business. 
>> Oh, great. I love it. So the italian tradition will continue in boston. 
>> I keep my fingers crossed. Yeah, I hope so. 
>> Thank you very much. No, thank you. 
>> Lidia: Then it was off to maria's pastry shop, owned by maria merola, a more recent immigrant, like myself. Hello, maria. 
[ Speaking italian ] 
>> Maria: [ Speaking italian ] 
>> ah, so we're making some biscotti here. 
>> Biscotti, yeah. 
>> And they sell well here? 
>> Very well. 
>> People love them, eh? 
>> Oh, they never -- they say that they never had it the way I make it, nice and crunchy, crispy. 
>> Ah, it's the maria touch. 
>> It's the maria touch. Absolutely. 
>> So, maria, tell me. You came here as a young girl, as an immigrant, yeah? 
>> Yes, I was very young. I was about 14 years old. 
>> Ah, and then you came into this pastry shop here -- 
>> yes, I started to work here as a salesperson. 

[00:15:30]


>> Lidia: And then you loved baking? 
>> I guess so. 
[ Laughs ] 
>> well, you're darn good at it, so you must be doing something right. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Okay, we hear all over the united states about maria in boston. When you came here as a young immigrant, what did america look like to you? 
>> I like to say I was a mouse from the country. You put a mouse in the city, it's lost. 
>> It's lost, eh? But you surely found your way fast, eh? Your talents, your passion for cooking. 
>> Maria: Yes, yes. 
>> Lidia: Do you find that you do things a little different for americans, or do you just stick to your italian style? 
>> I'm sticking to my italian style. 
>> Good for you, good for you. 
>> Oh, yeah, if the people, they don't like it, I tell them, "i like it." And if they want to change it, i say, "hey, listen, this is the way it goes." I'm traditional. I'm not going to change. What's all this mix this and mix that? No. 
>> E cosi e basta. 
>> E cosi e basta. 
[ Speaking italian ] 
>> ah, but that's why you're successful, you see, you came a long way. America is -- there are opportunities. 
>> Maria: Yes, yes, yes, it gives you opportunity, and you take it, and you go with it. But you've still got to stick to your traditional -- to what you believe in. 
>> I am on the same lines, and that's why you're a success, you know, as a young immigrant, I came as a young immigrant. We are two american success stories. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> [ Speaks italian ] much continued success. There are as many immigrant stories as there are people. And boston is fortunate to have places like modern pastry and maria's pastry shop keeping the north end vital and truly italian. 
>> So, struffoli. We're going to make struffoli. This is the mound of the fried little doughs, and then have the sprinkle on top, and they're always on an italian table for the holidays. They're really easy to make. Flour. This is the dough, very simple. A little bit of sugar. A bit of cinnamon. A little bit of salt. We'll give this just a whirl. Then we'll whisk some eggs. A little bit of vanilla, just to give it a flavor. Little bit of butter, so let's get... 

[00:18:00]


[ Food processor whirring ] just a little bit of water. The dough is a rather dry dough. So when you fry it, it's almost between a cake and a bread, almost. Little bit of orange and lemon peel for flavor. One whirl. One more whirl. It looks a little crumbly, but we'll just pull it all together just perfect to fry. And when it fries, it just puffs up a little bit, because of the eggs. So that's ready to go. Fry them in vegetable oil. And here we'll make the sauce, and e sauce is honey... Lots of honey. You can see how this is a very basic dessert. You know, what they had. Wheat flour, yes or no sugar, and honey. So the sugar, and a little bit of water. And usually these kind of desserthey're simple, but they also keep. They keep a while. You know, because during the holidays, people visited from home to home, and you always had to have something in the house, something to offer, because to enter an italian home and not be offered anything, it just doesn't exist. It's not an italian home. So, especially during the holidays. Okay, so the dough is together. You wrap it in cellophane paper, and you let it rest for an hour. And the dough will relax, and you'll be ready to form your little struffoli. I have one here that's been resting. And we'll get right into making struffoli. So struffoli,just like that, a little one. You roll them into all kinds of sizes, whatever, just, I guess, it's wise to make them the same size, so they fry at the same timing. So you make one batch, we'll put it to fry, and while the bat is frying, you make your next batch, and so on down the line. Okay. And you do want the oil hot, but you want them to cook inside, as well. So, once they're in there, the oil temperature will go down, but make sure that it's not overly hot. You can actually hear them when they're done. There's a dryness to it. There's a clink-clink to it. And that tells you they're done. They don't really absorb all that much fat or oil. But always it's a good idea to drain them a little bit before we put them in the syrup. The honey is boiling. Let it boil for a few minutes. I'll clean up. And then we'll just dunk them in there and coat them. So the struffoli,get them nice and coated with honey. Mm, mm, just like that. And then you just fish them out. All you want is for them to be coated with the honey. And then you just pile them up. And, of course, the traditional is the sprinklers, but if you're not into sprinklers, you can put chopped nuts in here. But you do wait a little bit til they cool off, so that whatever you're putting, the sprinklers do not melt. And, of course, the idea is here that it piles up so it look like a christmas tree. Okay, one more to the top? Okay. Mm! Shall we? Kids like them. And everybody expects them. So let's put some all over the place. I'm going to take one. I'm just going to kind of dip it a little bit and I'm going to taste it for you. Mm! It's good. It's still warm, so it's a little soft. It's really great when it stands and kind of gets crunchy. But now I have to take it to the table. I can't eat this by myself, and they're waiting. And so I want you to come with me, and let's deliver it together. Tutti a tavola a mangiare. Andiamo!

=======================================================

Dar la via tate. Fact:30 million men now suffer fr an enlarged prostate. 
Fact: Every other man now watching this show will someday face the same painful problems. Until now you had three choices: Take expensive drugs with potentially serious side effects, face painful and bloody surgery, or try and live with the pain and embarrassment. 
Fact: You don't have to live with it anymore. Introducing prosvent, the all-natural solution so good, it's guaranteed to give you relief in less than 30 days. 
>> I experienced within the first two or three days a significant change. 
>> You know, not having to worry about running to a bathroom is unbelievable. 
>> When I started taking the product and I wasn't getting up at night, it was great. I mean, the rest, you know, you get at night, you know, was great. I didn't have to get up. 
>> It's just a little pill that I just take, and it, it makes a big difference. 
>> I'm not ruled by going to the bathroom, and I don't think I have to worry about those things again. 
>> I mean, I hadn't slept through an entire night maybe 10 years. I mean, it was just remarkable. 
>> It's like my youth. [Laughs] I feel, I feel great. 
>> Announcer: And you can start feeling great again too, without harmful side effects and without painful surgery. Today you're going to find out what the prostate is, what it does, why it causes so many problems for so many men, and can finally do about it simply, easily, and safely. This is dr. Larry may. He received his medical degree from harvard, is a faculty member at the u.C.L.A. School of medicine and is listed in this book, the best doctors in america. He's helped thousands reverse and control the problem of an enlarged prostate. Today he'll help you. 
>> Dr. May, the numbers, they're unbelievable. Half the men over 50 in this country-- that's 30 million men-- suffering from an enlarged prostate? 

[00:02:06]


>> Barbara, that's right. Every man has a prostate, and as surely as their hair is going to turn gray, that prostate is going to enlarge, and by the age of 70, 80% of men will have problems. As men age, testosterone, the male hormone, is converted to dihydrotestosterone, a much more potent variety, and it stimulates the prostate cells to grow and multiply and the prostate to enlarge. 
>> What kind of problems does that cause? 
>> A weak stream, hesitancy, stopping and starting, urgency, frequency, getting up frequently at night to urinate, ultimately pain, and sexual dysfunction. 
>> And virtually every man is gonna face this? 
>> Every man has a prostate, and if a man lives long enough, they're gonna experience symptoms. 
>> Let's back up just a minute. What is the prostate, and why the problem? 
>> The only function of the prostate is it provides fluid to transport the sperm, but just like in real estate, location is everything, and the problem is the location of the prostate. Here's the prostate, located just below the bladder, which is where the urine accumulates and then flows through this tube called the urethra. The prostate surrounds the urethra, and as it enlarges, it squeezes the urethra, slowing the flow of urine, much like you can see in an hourglass. The sand flows through just like the urine flowing through the urethra, and the prostate surrounds it, slowing the flow and ultimately stopping it. And a doctor can help because a doctor performs an exam we call a digital rectal exam, and he can feel the prostate and say, "hey, your prostate's getting a little big," but unfortunately that usually doesn't occur until THE 50s, AND THE GROWTH OF THE PROSTATE MAY BEGIN IN THE 30s. And unless the symptoms are now debilitating, the doctor may not offer any treatment other than to rule out a serious disease. To wait until your life revolves around the bathroom or you lose your sex life is no life at all. 
>> And then it's back to the doctor. 
>> Back to the doctor for drug treatment-- prescription medications which may relieve the symptoms but often the sideffects are worse: Decreased libido and even impotence. Plus, the prostate can continue to grow. Ultimately there's surgery. 

[00:04:14]


>> But at least the problems go away, right? 
>> Yes and no. There are many types of surgeries, and they each have their own problems and side effects, and often they need to be repeated. There's the gold standard, what we call a turp, or transurethral resection of the prostate. For this we use an instrument known as a resectoscope. 
>> That looks scary. 
>> It is, and it's a 12-inch instrument that you introduce through the penis into the area where the prostate is, and then you scrape away the prostate, scrape it away in order to create a new opening. It's painful, it's bloody, it requires a hospitalization, but patients submit to it because untreated, the enlarged prostate can damage the bladder, cause renal failure, lead to infection, or ultimately obstruct urine flow completely. 
>> But there's something that can help. 
>> This is prosvent. It contains natural substances and minerals which have been shown in study after study involving thousands of patients to reduce the symptoms of an enlarged prostate, promoting prostate health and returning men to a normal existence in less than 30 days. 
>> I love driving a school bus. I love the kids, but when you got kids on the bus, you can't just "you got to go, you got to go..." You can't. And I thought I was gonna have to give up driving a school bus. And so when this thing came about, I figured this is something I want to try, and it worked. It worked within a week. You know, not having to worry about running to a bathroom is unbelievable. It's kind of changed my life to what it used to be. It's, it's better than great, because it's made a big difference in my life. 
>> I'm surprised it worked, and I'm surprised it worked so quickly, because within a week and a half, I was doing fine after that. I wasn't going to the bathroom during the night. 
>> Sometimes you have the urge to go to the bathroom, and you stand there, and nothing's coming out, and then when it finally comes out, it trickles out. Well, now, after taking the pill, I've noticed that I go less frequently and when I do have to go, it just comes out, and boom, right back to bed. 
>> What's in this? 
>> It's the most comprehensive formula that's ever been developed. It contains stinging nettle. This herb has been used for years for prostate and urinary problems, even for the relief of pain from urinary tract infections. It's especially helpful in relieving frequent urination, particularly overnight. Pygeum africanum, also found to reduce frequency and urgency. Pumpkin seed oil contributes additional sterols. Saw palmetto to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, the root cause of prostate enlargement. Acting together and in concert, they inhibit prostate enlargement, reduce frequent overnight urination, and dramatically improve urinary flow. Lycopene, a nutrie antioxidant that's derived from tomatoes. And then there's vitamin d and zinc, which help contribute to overall prostate health. I have never seea combination of ingredients together in a formulation that is so effective in eliminating the debilitating symptoms. 

[00:07:17]


>> Very happy to be able to be normal again. I did think of it as an old man's problem. For me to have it at 40 instead of 60, um... Was a little alarming. After the first week, I noticed that I didn't have to stop wt I was doing at work. I could continue working. This is wonderful stuff, remarkable stuff. I wish someone had told me about it sooner. 
>> I went from three to four times a night to once a night getting up. It's a good product, and it works. 
>> I've been getting up, like, two, three times a night, sometimes four times a night to run to the bathroom. Dire urgency to get there, and then, you know,... Not much happens. Before I knew it, going... Waking up once, and then a couple of weeks later, a few weeks later, a whole night's sleep. Wow! Wonderful! 
>> I want every man watching right now to answer these questions. In the last month, have you had the sensn of not emptying your bladder completely? Do you urinates than two hours after you've just finished? Do you start and stop several times while urinating? Do you have a weak urine stream? When you have to go, do you feel an urgency like you might have an accident? Do you strain or push? And finally, do you get up two or more times a night? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may already have an enlarged prostate, and if you've answered yes to more than one, you've got to do something about it now. 
>> And prosvent can help? 
>> Prosvent can absolutely help, and it does it without side effects. Prescription drugs can help, but they do it with side effects that may diminish yo sex life. And surgery, while it can sometimes help, can be bloody,dangerous, and often has to be repeated. 
>> How long till they start seeing changes? 
>> Many men will see changes within two weeks, but most will experience benefits within 30 days. 
>> If you or someone you love suffers from the symptoms of an enlarged prostate-- frequent urination, urgency, hesitancy, reduced flow, pushing or straining, pain, or a diminished sex drive-- pick up the phone now. Get your life back. 

[00:09:32]


>> Announcer: Do you or someone you love make too many trips to the bathroom? Suffer from urgency that is hard to control? Have a weak ream or find it difficult to start and stop? Do you get up more than once a night or find it next impossible to sit through a movie? Worse yet, is a diminished sex drive destroying your life? If you answered yes to more than one of those questions, you are probably one of the 30 million men who suffer from an enlarged prostate. Until now, you had three 
choices: Take expensive drugs with potentially serious side effects, suffer painful and bloody surgery that often must be repeated, or try and live with it. You don't have to live with it anymore. Introducing prosvent, the all-natural solution so good, it's guaranteed to give you relief in less than 30 days. Prosvent is a unique combination with naturally occurring substances shown to reduce the symptoms of an enlarg prostate, helping h return men to comfortable and happy lives, and no side effects.

>> So it's pretty obvious that men should start using prosvent way before symptoms start to appear. 
>> Absolutely, because the prostate begins to grow long before symptoms. Here's our normal walnut-sized PROSTATE IN THE 20s. No symptoms. BY THE 30s, THERE'S OFTEN Enlargement occurring, but still no symptoms. BY THE 40s AND 50s, THE Enlargement continues, but now symptoms begin to occur. The prostate squeezes the urethra, slows the urine, ultimately stopping the urine flow. Recently, I sat with a group of men o'd been experiencing some of those symptoms. This was the first time they'd talked in a group. 
>> I can't remember the last night I didn't have to get up four or five times. I mean, I was saying it to myself just two or three nights ago, "god, wouldn't it bnice to experience an eight-hour uninterrupted sleep?" 
>> When you get to a certain point, it's almost like being a drug addict, where you're worrying about your next drug. I'm worrying about where the next bathroom is. If I'm on a plane, am I in the aisle seat? The worst one was, though, I took my son to go see the last lord of the rings. I thought it was atwo-hour movie. I'm in there-- I make it two hours on the nose. All of a sudden, this thing's going, and I'm going, "oh, no." 
>> You're going, "throw the ring, throw the ring..." 
>> Please... Is this the end? 
>> I got news for you. I'm very happy that my wife an r.N. She worked in a hospital, and we used to get urine... The urine cups. Put it in the trunk. I'd reach down, "hello there, how's everything?" [Laughter] "oh, yeah, sure, fine." 
>> I thought it was normal to pee two or three times a night. 
>> Sometimes my doctor would say, "you know, you're not 21 anymore," so I just sort of wrote it off as that. Until finally he said, "well, just how many times areyou going," you know? I said, "five, six, sometimes seven." 
>> You got up five or six, seven times a night? 
>> Yeah. 
>> You didn't think there was something strange about every hour-- did you ever sleep? 
>> I thought what goes in goes out. 
>> Are we that stupid or that embarrassed over something that we shouldn't be embarrassed about? >> Yes! 
>> I think embarrassed andum, living in denial. 
>> We notice these changes so subtly that they don't really register, and that's why we always become aware of a problem when it's too late. 

[00:15:08]


>> The truth is that now I start mentioning it iends. I go up to guys that, you know, when I'm standing at the urinal and there's a guy standing next to me and he's slower than I am, I ask him how long his prostate's been enlarged... 
[Laughter] and he doesn't know what the hell I'm talking about. 
>> It's a great pickup line, absolutely. [Laughter] 
>> Man: Does he slug you? 
>> In the john-- they love me for that! [Laughter] ...What happened when you started taking prosvent? 
>> It probably took, you know, maybe two weeks-- 10 days to two weeks-- before I really started knowing-- instead of three times a night, I might get up once now, and I had one or two nights where I didn't get up at all. I was, like, shocked. I mean, I hadn't slept through an entire night maybe 10 years. I like it. I'm taking it. 
>> I am very happy. I am thrilled beyond compare. I mean, I take the stuff and, hey, I'll sleep all night long. 
>> It's really funny. I was just-- we went on a trip. My wife and I said, "let's get away before the holiday." So we had to sit in the car. 
>> Oh, boy. >> Oh, boy. 
>> Before I started taking... I would have had a fit, but I was o.K. I was really surprised. Say, six, seven months ago, no. So I love it. It's a great product. 
>> When does someone-- when should you start doing something about all this? 
>> At the first sign of any symptoms, that is, that your urinary stream has gotten a little narrower, or you wake up once a night, or you find that you can't make it through the whole movie, that's when you absolutely should start treating it so you don't progress to three of four times wakening at night. >>Or me it's remarkable, because I found it to be, you know, probably one of the, maybe the most significant, lifestyle- altering things, and that's, that's huge. 
>> Having gone through what I've gone through, had that been available when I was in my mid- 20s, I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE Talked to my doctor about it, you know, 'cause I mean, I wouldn't wish what I've gone through on anybody. 
>> If no one takes anything else away from this show, I want them to figure out what's going on, because being silent is being stupid, and I don't want to be stupid anymore. >> Absolutely. 
>> Nope. >> Right. 
>> Tell us again about what's in prosvent. Prosvent has a unique combination of natural substances and minerals that both help alleviate symptoms and protect the prostate's health. There's pygeum africanum, stinging nettle, pumpkin seed oil, and saw palmetto. Acting together and in concert, they inhibit prostate enlargement, reduce frequent overnight urination, lessen urgency, and dramatically increase urine flow, but we wanted an even more comprehensive formula, so to all of that we added lycopene, a powerful anti-oxidant, plus zinc and vitamin d for overall prostate health. 

[00:17:44]


>> Before I did anything, i would always go to the restroom. Leave the house, go to the restroom. When you get to the next destination, go to the restroom. I haven't experienced that since I've been taking the pill. So it definitely has improved my daily routine and the quality of my life. 
>> It happens every two, three hours, and then, as I when I get up and go to the restroom, come back to bed, i, I have problems to go back to sleep, you know? Now that after taking this pill for two weeks now, it helps me a lot, you know? I think I'm more productive and more restful during the day also. 
>> If somebody had the same symptoms that I had, I would tell them to try this product because of the fact that I don't want them to be an idiot like I was. 
>> He was on a constant search for whatever bathroom he could get to in whatever quick amount of time he could get there, and this has enabled him to see life a little bit differently. 
>> It made my husband a completely different person, and I'm not crabby either, because he kept waking me up every time he would get up. I'm very happy for him, and I'm happy for me too. 
>> So many times wake up at night-- five, six times at night-- and even for only a few drops, and I haveto go. I cannot hold. So my life is a lot better now. It has changed my life, changed my life. 
>> There was some times when i didn't quite make it to the, to a bathroom sometimes, some places, but now, oh, jeez, I can't... I just can't get over how great these here pills work. 
>> The best thing about taking prosvent is, not only do I not have to get up three or four times a night, but I don't have to take drugs. 
>> Now is your chance to order. You really can change your life for the better. And still ahead, we have callers with questions for dr. May. 
>> Announcer: Do you or someone you love make too many trips to the bathroom? Suffer from urgency that is hard to control? Have a weak stream or find it difficult to start and stop? Do you get up more than once a night or find it next to impossible to sit through a movie? Worse yet, is a diminished sex drive destroying your life? If you answered yes to more than one of those questions, you are probably one of the 30 million men who suffer from an enlarged prostate. Until now, you had thr

[00:23:00]


>> Dr. May, we have some callers on the line with questions. Chris in rochester, u're on the air. 
>> Man: Yeah, I'm just beginning to see some of these things happen, and I gotta ll ya, I'm a little scared. How quickly is this gonna get worse, and can I reverse what's started? 
>> Nobody can tell you how quickly your symptoms are gonna progress. We can only tell you that with time they will get worse. But if you start prosvent, it has the ingredients that will reverse that process, and from the day you start, the healing will begin. 
>> Our next caller is lou from new york. Do you have a question for the doctor? 
>> Hi, yes, Doctor. I'm 62 years old, and I'm having some of the symptoms you're discussing today Can some of these lead to cancer? 
>> Lou, the simple answer is no, but the man of 62 who has benign prostatic enlargement is also the man who is at risk for cancer. Remember, I encourage every man at the age of 50 to see their physician, have a digital rectal exam, and get a p.S.A. Measure. You've got to rule out cancer. Then prosvent can help alleviate the problems of an enlarged prostate and increase your overall prostate health. 
>> Barbara: And no side effects? 
>> These ingredients have been studied countless times with thousands of patients and no side effects. 
>> I'm glad to say we have a woman on the line. Francine from philadelphia, what's your question for dr. May? 
>> I'm really worried about my husband. He says he's fine, but I know something's wrong with him because he just gets up all night long to go to the bathroom, and when he goes to the bathroom, he's in there forever. He said nothing's wrong because his P.H.-- P.S., whatever you call it, P.S.A.-- is negative, and he just won't talk about it. What should I do? 
>> Francine, you've got to talk to him. Understand that it's unlikely that he has cancer. That's what the p.S.A. Means. But those symptoms are horrible, and they're inrfering with his life and yours, and you've got to persuade him that there is something that can be done and he doesn't have to live with those symptoms. 

[00:25:06]


>> This is a perfect example of how it not only affects the man but his loved one too. I can't believe how men just think this is gonna go away. Francine, if you're stitl there, you got to pick up the phone and you got to order this for him, put it down, and make him take it, because it's not gonna only help him, it's gonna help you and your relationship before it gets any bigger problems. 
>> And he's gonna be grateful for your help. 
>> All right, we have time for one more caller, dr. May. Neil from los angeles. How are you doing, neil? You have a question? 
>> Yes, Doctor, you know, I've been having these symptoms that you've been describing for many years now, and you know, I've tried a lot of things. Why don't I just have the prostate removed? 
>> That's a good question. 
>> Neil, your body is not like a car. You can't just change the oil filter. You may be trading a bad problem for a worse one. If you have your prostat removed, you run the risk of damaging the nerves and winding up incontinent, impotent. It is not the treatment of choice. It is truly your last resort. 
>> Now, we only have a couple of minutes left. Is there anything else that you want to add? 
>> The problem of an enlarged prostate is inevitable. It's going to happen to every man listening out there today. So far it's aren a silent epidemic. Don't be afraid to talk about it. Don't be embarrassed. Don't wait until the problems overtake your life. If you have a family history of prostate problems or have any symptoms such as frequent urination, urgency, hesitancy, getting up frequently at night, pain or discomfort when urinating, or a diminished sex drive, try prosvent today. Get back your life. 
>> For dr. May and myself, thank you for joining us and be well. 
[??????...] 
>> I had run out of the samples at one time, and I noticed going back to getting up once a night, then twice a night, and I said-- that's when I really realized that I really-- this product was really working and that I should continue taking it. 
>> Going to bed and being able to get a full night's sleep, get up in the morning, and make believe I'm a racehorse was unbelievable. 

[00:27:11]


>> I want to be healthy, and I am. Maybe I'm a little overweight, but that's because I eat too many cookies, but what are you gonna do? 
>> Announcer: Introducing prosvent, the all-natural solution so good, it's guaranteed to give you relief in less than 30 days. Have your credit card ready when you call.

Striving to make every day an improment. Re-imagining the home. Re-imagining dinner. J.C. Penney proudly sponsors "martha stewart's cooking school." University of phoenix is proud to sponsor "martha stewart's cooking school." Information about university of phoenix IS AVAILABLE AT phoenix.edu. Martha: Are you looking to save money? [ Coins rattle ] try butchering at home. You won't need an apprenticeship to learn how to do it because in today's lesson, you'll discover how easy it is to cut up a whole chicken, how to butterfly a leg of lamb for the grill, and how to get your money's worth when purchasing a beef tenderloin. [ Ding ] there is a new or I could even say renewed interest in the craft of butchering, and home cooks are eager to learn the basics. So, today, I've invited a fifth-generation butcher to share his extensive knowledge. Please welcome en lobel. Evan, I'm so glad that you're here. It's a pleasure to be here, and I can say that butchering is fun. I learned so much just watching the buter when I was growing up. Mm-hmm. My great-uncle joe had a butcher shop, and I learned how to french the rack of lamb, and I learned about the baby lamb chops, and I learned about how to cut up a chicken into eight really nice pieces. But I need a refresher course, and I think everybody out there needs a refresher course. Well, that's why I'm here. Good. Excellent. So, we're gonna start with the chicken. Now, what kind of chicken is this? How big? This is a free-range chicken. It's about 3 3/4 pounds. It's good for broiling, good for frying, and very good for roasting, also. Okay, so it's an all-purpose chicken. Pretty much. Okay. Pretty much. Want to truss it real fast for me? Sure. Truss it. Now, this very important when you're roasting a chicken to truss it correctly. Yeah, what I do -- everybody has a different technique. This is a technique that I've used. Oh, can I have a piece of stri 

[00:02:00]


I'll do mine. Yes, absolutely. I'll do my technique, and you do yours. Now, is that too a long a string? No, not for me. Perfect. Okay. So, you do yours, and I'll do mine. I remember the last time we did it together. Did we do it? Oh, my gosh. Yeah, we did. You start a different end. Yes. I start from the back, I do a figure eight like that. Then I just flip it over and tie it wh a bow so it's easy to take off after it's cooked. Yeah. There we go. And, see, I do it this way. I do it starting at the neck end and around the parson's tail. Did you go around the parson's tail? I didn't go around the tail. I like the tail to be free. [ Both laugh ] each to his own. So, here, I have my little trussed chicken. And your bow is on the top. Yeah, my bow's on the top. So, I just untie it, okay. Oh, and I go over the drumstick. You go under the drumstick. I see. Yeah, I do. I find that between the breast and the thigh, it gets sticky and sometimes has a tendency to rip the skin... Oh, oh. ...When you take it off. Sometimes. Okay, so, that's trussing 101. All righty. Follow evan. It's probably better. It has to be better. It's fifth generation. Oh, I don't know about that. So, we have the chicken. What I like to do first is turn it breast side down and pull away the wing slightly and make a little indentation, just enough so you can see -- oh, right to where the joint is? The joint. Exactly. And once you find the joint, then you take it off. Exactly. And the same on the other side. Sometimes, it's less expensive to buy a whole chicken and cut it up into the pieces that you need than to buy the legs, the thighs, right? Yeah, absolutely. And not that, once we get to the breast, then we can make it into a cutlet. We can leave the skin on or the skin off, and that's a big money saver because the breast is very expensive. So, what we're gonna do next is, we're gonna separate the thigh from the carcass. So, we look for that natural separation. Okay? And it's important where you make the first 

[00:04:00]


cut because if you make the first cut too high, you're not gonna leave enough skin on the breast. You make it too low -- well, like, if you're gonna fry, you want the skin on the -- exactly. Exactly. Okay. So, we make that cut right at the seam. And we can go -- actually, go through almost all the way. But the first cut should be, again, cutting the skin. Okay. Okay, so, once we do that, then we pull it away from the main carcass a little bit, so then we can just take that off. Beautiful. This knife is nice and sharp. Nice and sharp? Good. And what I like to do after that -- I just like to clean it up a little bit, like to take a little bit of the fat off. Not very much fat on this beautiful chicken. There's not very much fat. And then we can cut the thigh from the leg. Move the skin so it's -- move the skin away, and you can see between the drumstick or the leg and the thigh, there's also -- same thing on the other side. So, we'll make a nice cut into the skin. The back gets tricky at home. So what I do is, I'll break it and then cut it. And there's a nice back. Now we have just a small portn of the back. I like to get rid of t larger portion of the back fi and then you can take a scissor or with a strong wrist motion downward, just straight down into the cleaver. Now, is that for the stock pot? That's for the stock pot. Okay. Now we have the whole breast. Yes. There's a little piece of cartilage right below the breastbone. Put the point of your knife -- just the point -- into that cartilage and go all the way down. And then put your finger -- your hands on the other side, open it up... And then run your finger along the side... Oh, yes, right here. ...Of the breastbone. What do you call that? That's the breastbone? That's the breastbone. Okay. And then you should be able to cut it in half. Okay. 

[00:06:01]


And it goes right through. Lovely. Then we have one breast that's finished. So, we don't take that out? I like to leave it in. Oh, you do? I think it's nice for flavor. Okay, I'm gonna leave mine. Okay, so, these are big breasts. Martha: So, there, that was easy -- chicken 101. [ Ding ] so, in front of us, we have like 4 1/2-pound legs of lamb. About 4 1/2. And evan's gonna show us how to bone and butterfly a leg of lamb, which is very useful for roasting and grilling. Grilling -- wonderful on the grill. Marinated then grilled -- perfec okay, well, while we do this, you can tell me what your marinade is. Okay, okay. First, I like to just have nice, sharp knife, especially the tip of the knife. Okay. So, we use a steel for that. What we'll do is put the fat side down because the bone is easy to get to from the underside. This is the thighbone. It runs right across the meat here. So, the first thing we do is find the knee joint. Oh, yes. And if you feel with your finger, you can -- I think I found it. Yeah, that's it. That's perfect. So, we're gonna make a slight line right at the bulbous end of the thigh and all the way down right to the mark that we had made before. Now, that is going to be close to being on top of the bone, and that's where we want to start boning it out. So now we can make our cut even further, and with the tip of your knife, you should -- oh, feel the bone. Exactly. All the -- okay. Mm-hmm. Okay, so, that's the first cut. Now we continue to work the knife. Sometimes, I take a different grip. I like this. I love to watch butchers do this. And I'll just work this around the bone, and the tip is my feeler, so that's gonna tell me about where I am. Now, you don't want to go too deep. You want to go just deep enough to get to the end of the bone, okay, and when you do, you can turn it around to the other side. And do the other side? Yeah, start from the top and do the other side. 

[00:08:03]


So, if you feel the bone, you know you're on it, and you're not gna waste a lot of meat. That's right. The cleaner the bone when you're finished, the better the butcher you are. That's right. Okay. Mine's very clean. Good. So, then the next thing to do is, again, watch your hands here because you're cutting towards you, but you want to work underneath that bulbous area and ee up this portion of the bone. Nice job, martha. Can I come to work? Any day. Okay. Can I afford you? Nope. [ Laughs ] okay, I feel it. So, once we expose that, we have something to hold onto to get the rest of the bone out. Okay, I got . Good. So then we have hold onto, and we continue to work our way down. And, basically, we're just working around. I like doing this. So, what would you marinate this in? I love dijon mustard with lamb -- dijon, fresh rosemary, some red wine vinegar, some oil, and let it sit in there for a while. Mmnds good. Yeah. Good. So now you can start on this little portion right here of the shank 'cause the shank is sweet meat, so you want to go along the bone and keep that shank in here. Oh, keep it in here? You want to keep it in there, yeah. Oh, okay. Every piece. Utilize every piece. And do you grill or do you roast the lamb? I like to -- if I were to roast it, I would butterfly this, then stuff it maybe with a feta, rod, toasted pignolia nuts, and spinach. Mmm. Okay, so, now there's a gland inside here that we have to get out. This is a gland that when cooked has a strong, pungent smell. Where is that? Okay, so, what we do is, this is the top-round portion of the lamb. So, we pull that aside. We want to separate... The top round from the bottom round. Right here? And that's exactly it. Open that up just a little bit. 

[00:10:03]


Flip your knife underneath. And that gland comes out. And there's the gland that you can see. Oh, it's right in the fat? It's in the fat. Oh, okay. We can just trim a little more on the inside of the lamb. There are some sinews on the leg of lamb like in the top round -- the bottom round, I'm sorry. It's a silver skil that will beough. Okay. And the cleaner we get it... I'm starting to appreciate the butcher more. Thought you always appreciated me. I always did, but more, even. 'Cause you don't realize -- I mean, there is a lot to preparing your meat. So, now we have a -- it can be -- we have a lump of meat. [ Laughs ] what I like to do is even it out. Okay. So, this is where the butterfly comes in. So, I separate it or butterfly it or open it up in two separate places. One ver here -- top round and the shank. So I'll put my knife right in the middle and go through, making sure not to go all the way through to the end where it would separate. Do it slowly. And there, it opens up. So, the flatter, more even, the better. Well, the evenness is good, obviously, for even cooking. Okay. And then we can do a similar thing on the other side here. Just make one cut going across. Not too deep. Okay. And then I just like to finish it off with a nice crisscross score... Oh. ...On the back sides to keep it looking nice. Looks pretty when it's finished cooking. And we're done. Martha: Well, this is another excellent lesson and one that I hope you can practice at home. [ Ding ] I didn't know there was a no-fuss way of frenching a rack of lamb. I'm gonna show it to you. Okay, good. So, this is the outside. 

[00:12:03]


Yeah, we have a baby rack of lamb here, and I've left some of the outside on just so your audience can see how much waste there is, actually, on a rack of lamb, and that's why they're so expensive. Just basically following the seam and pulling off the outside. So, what do you do with this top layer? Well, there's a lot of things you can do with it. There's -- of course, you can grind up the lamb, make a nice moussaka, or if it's sliced the right way, you can make a lamb pepper steak from it... Oh. ...Slice very, very thin. So, you're just taking the point of your knife and getting right without going into the meat, right? Exactly. Okay. And the rack of lamb weighs about how much when it's finally finished? After it's finished, about a pound and a quarter. Oh, my goodness. With how many chops? Seven or eight chops. Okay. Perfect for two. What is this called? It's the top of the rack. There's a portion of the breast in it. Top of the rib, really. Okay. Okay, so, we have the rack here, and what I like to do is make a cut across the bones about 1/2 inch off of the eye of the chop. Okay, so, then we get that grip again, and we're going to go in between the bones. And push until we hit a bone, then go down. Oh, I see. Push till you hit a bone, then go down, and we keep on doing that until we get to the end. There. Good, good. So, then what we have to do is, we have to take the meat away from in between the bones. So, I like to stand it up, and I run my knife on the left side first, straight down. I've already made my indentation on the bottom, so when I get to the bottom, it should pull right off. Okay. Okay. And then we'll go on the right side. So hold onto the bone and just work your knife right along the right side. And we continue with that same motion, that same technique. There is a lot of waste. 

[00:14:04]


There's a huge amount of waste, especially when you french it like this. Basically, at the end, you're pretty much just looking at a pound, a pound and a quarter, tops. So, evan, what is -- where did frenching come from? Frenching is an elegant way to present the rack of lamb. It exposes the bones, and it cooks very evenly, just having the eye of the rack. The way I like to scrape the bones or clean the bones, if you will, is take the mea side of the knife and just work my way down. Oh, and it cleans it perfectly, right? And it cleans it a lot more easily, yeah. This is the backbone, so that should be taken off. Okay, how do you do that? Work your way -- that's perfect. Just like that. Oh, okay, again, taking off as little meat as possible. As little meat as possible, and... And this would take about how long to roast -- 20 minutes? Tops. Tops. 20 minutes? After a sear, 15. So, you can see how beautiful the little chops will be, how tender and bite-size they are. This is great for an hors d'oeuvre, and it's also great as a roast. Okay, well, thank you. This is rack of lamb, and next, evan's going to teach us how to make pork-loin medallions. [ Ding ] so, now we are going to trim and cut a pork loin into medallions and into pork scallopini. Correct. This is actually a rack of pork. A rack of pork. It's got the rib bones. I like to use this for scallopini because it has some fat running through it, which is really nice and keeps it moist and tender when you're frying it. There are a couple of different ways to approach this. I think the best way to do it is to pull the ribs off in one piece, and I start with these little riblet bonesbo and stay really, really tight to them. 

[00:16:05]


Okay. Just with the point of the knife? I like to use a little more of the meat of my knife. Okay. And don't go too deep on that, and after you get through those little rib bones or those little button bones I call them, we can work our knife flat and pull off the whole rib. Keeping the knife slightly upwards so it doesn't go too far into the actual eye of the meat. So, now, in a supermarket, can you buy this cut of meat? You definitely should be able to, and if not, then get the thickest pork chops that you can, take the bone out, and we'll be able to make medallions from that. Oh. Oh, this comes off very nicely. Yeah. So, now, these are the baby-back ribs. They're great for grilling, great for low and slow barbecue, indirect heat, and we keep those off to the side. This is good, right? Beautiful. Perfect job. Mm-hmm. Perfect. Okay. Absolutely perfect. So, next step is, we're going to trim the outside a little bit and make it look like it's just the boneless rack of pork here. Clean off a little bit mor the fat. Beautiful, beautiful. So, we're gonna use that technique that we had used before when we were skinning the leg of lamb, <p THE SILVER SKIN. We put the knife -- the of the knife -- underneath, and we'll start working our way towards us. Oh, this way? Yeah. Oh, okay. Now, I feel comfortable that way. If you feel a little uncomfortable doing that, then -- what about this little piece that's gonna come off? That should come off. Oh, it will? Okay. Okay. Oh, so then we're gonna get straight down to the beautiful, solid meat. Exactly. So, why don't you start working om this way over? Okay. Like that? Mm-hmm. And then when you get to that point, you can almost peel it. Okay. Oh, you can. You can peel it off. Mm-hmm. 

[00:18:06]


And once you do that, you can take it off completely. And then we have the rest of the silver skin. If we want to go down even further, we can slip our knife underneath... And pull off that silver skin. So, butchering takes time. It takes patience, but the result is certainly worth it, isn't it? It's worth it, and it's satisfying, feels good to do it at home by yourself, and you learn each time you go around, and it's very fulfilling to do it at home. Okay. Okay, so, now we have the full pork loin or part of the pork loin, mostly the rib, and we can cut medallions any size we like. Medallions are a little thicker. Like an inch thick or... Uh, not quite a inch. I would say 3/4 of an inch is good, straight down. Let the knife do the work, back and forth. And nice, strong at the bottom. Perfect. A couple of those. Now, if you want to do scallopini, we'll just slice it a little thinner. I would slice it about 1/4 of an inch. And then take a couple of pieces of wax paper. Lay it on the wax paper. And you can either use a mallet. Give it a little whack. If you don't have a mallet, you can use a cleaver. Oh, yes. Give it a little whack. Okay, but notoo much. If you don't have a cleaver... Not too much. But chill it, then. ...Then take your big cast-in skillet and give it a couple of whacks. It's not pretty, but it does the job. Yeah, so, this is exactly -- oh, I love that -- so nice. It's beautiful. Really perfect. So, you can make your own. 

[00:20:06]


This is great, evan. What a great lesson. And I love pork. Next, evan's going to show us our final lesson on how to get the most of your beef tenderloin. [ Ding ] finally, purchasing a whole beef tenderloin and butchering at home can save you lots of money. These tenderloins have already been well-trimmed by evan, and now you're gonna show us how to maximize the use of this. I am. This is all trimmed up. This is a prime fillet. How many pound? Right now, this is probably about 3 1/2, a little over 3 1/2 pounds. When you buy it untrimmed, though, it's about what, 6 pounds? Yeah.5 to 7. And any of the trimmings, they can be ground up for -- utilize everything. Yes, okay. Yes, it can be ground up. I like to look at the fillet in three parts -- the head or butt tender, the center portion, which is the chateaubriand, and the tail portion. Okay. And there's something that you can do with each if you don't have a party of 8 to 10 people... Right. ...To serve a whole fillet. So, what I do is, I separate them out first. Turn it over, and I'm gonna take off the butt tender, or the head... Okay. ...Right at that spot. Right here? Okay. And we'll go straight down. Okay, so, we'll work with this first. There's a lot of uses for this particular cut. I can separate off the bigger portion, the side piece. Okay. Just straight down? Just straight down. And what we can do from here is make beautiful fondues. Oh. I'm using this one. Oh, this one? Yeah. Oh, fondue. Yeah, you can make a perfect fondue with this like that. Oh, okay. So, cut on an angle? You can cut on a slight angle, yeah. And then cut this in half? Cut it in half. You want chunks? I would say about like that. Okay. Oh, so this is a good use for this, and it's the best meat. And it's tender, it cooks fast in the hot oil, 

[00:22:07]


and it's something that most people don't think about. So, you have that there. And children love fondue beef, don't they? Absolutely love it. Absolutely. The next thing that I like to do from this is just what you're doing without cutting it. You can do a stroganoff for stroganoff. Classic stroganoff is used with fillet. Oh, just pieces of meat like that about 1/4 of an inch? About 1/4 of an inch. Slice it right down. Okay, now, what about this? With this, I like to do maybe a pepper steak, so I'll cut it lengthwise here and flatten it down just a little bit with my hand. And on an angle the way you were doing it before... Oh. ...Cut it down for pepper steak. And if you were gonna make any kind of chinese food, this would be so great, right, with beef and peers or beef and string beans. That's right, that's right. Mmm, yum. Look how many piles of things I have. Two people can have three meals out of just the head. Everythings interchangeable. What I want to save is the chateaubriand for the more primer meal. Show us that. I want to see the chateaubriand. Well, the chateaubriand is simply the center portion of the fillet. It's usually about 6 to 8 inches, and this is the absolute primest cut. I like to sear the chateaubriand in cast iron, finish it off in the oven. Okay, so this is it right here. That's it. That part to here? Yeah, so we're just taking off the tail portion. Okay. Mmm, oh, wow. And if you're going to do tournedos rossini... What? [ Both laugh ] how thick -- how thick would they be? Tournedos is going to be about an inch and a half, 6 to 8 ounces, about like that. Those are individual tournedos rossinis. Oh, my gosh, how beautiful that is depending on how you sauce it, right? That's right. And then you can be left with the chateaubriand for two. 

[00:24:07]


Yes. And with the tail, we can make beef scallopinis. Oh. So we'll slice these on the thinner side. Like 1/4 of an inch or less? About 1/4 of an inch. Should we be using that big knife? Yeah, this is a good knife to use for slicing like that. And if you wanted to make carpaccio, is this the beef you would use for carpaccio? This is the beef for carpaccio. It's very difficult to slice the beef so thin at home. So you have to freeze it, slice it thin, pound it down at home. If it's not frozen and you're pounding it down the way it is now, it's gonna fall apart. Yeah. Well, thanks so much, evan. Your lesson has been really phenomenal, and I think that any of you at home who've had any trepidation whatsoever at attempting a little bit of butchery in your own kitchen, well, now with this lesson, I hope we've erased that fear. And we'll see you next time. Martha: For video clips, recipes, tips, and more, VISIT pbs.org/marthascookingschool.

=======================================================

>> I'm not going to -- that's 
>> no barack obama! 
>> If it's obama, america wins. If it's romney, comedy wins. 
>> Senator grassley, have you hit a big deer lately? The deer didn't make it, but was it delicious? 
>> I love you back, and we've t more work to do. 
>> One more ye! One more ar! 
>> Never imagine such a thing as funny. President obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans. Never imagine such a thing as funny. I'm not particular precisely of what I said but I stand by whatever I said, whatever it was. 
>> We are closing in on the final 48 hours of this campaign. The president is speaking live in debuk, iowa, his third of four stops today. And with him and his challenger in a frenzied sprint to win voters in those crucial battleground states. For the president that means shoring up support in the midwest states that backed him with great enthusiasm in 2008. With events in iowa, ohio, and wisconsin already today. And it was in the key battleground ohio that the president lambasted his challenger's latest effort to seize the medal of change. 
>> Governor romney, he is a very talented salesman. So in this campaign, he has tried as hard as he can to repackage the same policies that didn't work and offer them up as change. But, you know, here's the problem, we khat change looks like. And what he's o about it it. 
>> No, indid, it ain't. Vice president joe biden hit it a bit closer to the mark when he joked about romney's favorite time of year out in colorado. 

[00:02:03]


>> Folks, I want to remind you, this is the end of daylight savings time tonight. It's mitt romney's favorite time of the year because he gets to turn the clock back. 
>> Yes, for mitt romney it's the closing hours of his six- or seven- or eight-year bid for the white house. It is a palpable feeling on the romney campaign plane that is end the near. Indied, that was evident today in colorado springs with mr. And mrs. Romney showing evident wear and tear, even getting a bit misty-eyed from the long flight. 
>> It has been quite a journey. It's coming to a close. We have three more days. 
>> It's no wonder emotions are running so high, particularly with new hoel o. Polls out today showing romney down six in critical ohio. Down two in his absolute must win florida. Seven, eight yea of campaigning and it's come down to this. Romney still combing through the president's speeches trying to find anything that he might tether his message to, this time a line best served cold. 
>> Yesterday the president said something you may have already heard, that I found troubling.E to an audience and said voting is the best revenge. He's asking us -- he is asking his supporters to vote for revenge. I'm asking you to vote for love of country. 
>> Oh, for the love of christmas, three days to go. Let's get right to our panel. With me here at democracy plaza is professor james peterson of lee high university, nbc contribute ari and little li gill of the excel alliance. Ari, the fact that romney is still desperately trying to find a zinger from the president's speech indicates there's a problem, isn't there? He's just not winning. 

[00:04:09]


>> It is a bad sign if you're playing these kind of word games this close to the end. You want to be making a big, bold closing argument. That's not what you're seeing from the romney campaign. You're seeing a lot of spinning. You're seeing talk about pennsylvania. You're seeing talk about these quotes and obviously what the president meant was, if you have a feeling of revenge, if you're feeling excited, make sure to go out and do your civic duty, that's what counts. I me it's such a reach and so silly to try to take that and turn it inng else. But that's where they're at right now. 
>> So it's an act of desperation? 
>> I think so. I think the problem for mitt romney here is, look at ohio, right? Talk about a dispute over jobs and facts and he is losing. If you go on twitter, I mean, i was doing romney ohio clips as the hash tag and the obama campaign and others were circulated today. Not three, not five, but literally about 15 articles saying to mitt romney, you've got the economic plan wrong with your approach to jobs and the auto industry. And number two, equally important in a campaign, you're lying. Stop lying to the people of ohio. 
>> Dr. Peterson, "the washington post" to are's point had an article entitled, mitt romney's campaign insults voters. Through all the flip-flops there has been one consistency in the campaign of republican president nominee mitt romney, a contempt for the electorate. Mr. Rrm seems to be betting that voters have no memories, poor arithmetic skills and general inability to look behind the curtain. We hope the results tuesday prove him wrong. 
>> Yeah, again, if we put that revenge comment in its proper context, part of what that revenge is about is romney's violation of the public trust. When we look at these different things that have gone on in the campaign, it's very, very difficult to see mitt romney as an authentic campaigner or authentic politician. That's where you get the revenge piece. That's where the oped seems to be right on point. Again, we look at aber of different issues. Look at the adz playing in ohio right now. You look at that chrysler ad, you look at this desperate republican ad trying to convince black folk that the republican party are on their side. They speak down to voters and let voters understand the ways in which politics gets really, really messy at this stage of the game. 

[00:06:25]


>> It's not just the campaign, it's the character of the man. That's what's being exposed to ari's point. 
>> Yes. 
>> By these ads. Is thanot true? If you willfully lie repeatedly to the electorate, what does that say about you as an individual? 
>> It doesn't speak very highly of you. Again, I'm all about authenticity and truth in politics. I know that seems really, really crazy in the 21st century. I think the american electorate is with me on this. At the end of the day mitt romney has played with the truth fast and furious, as we said, many times on your show. This is the result, the six-point deficit in ohio. 
>> Despite that misleading g-pad, he hasn't made any inroads in ohio, as we've heard. We've heard about this absurd ad in spanish to latino voters where there's the president linked idel, hugo chavez. Could it be, dooung, that mitt romney made the mistake that think that the electorate is dumb, that basically we're stupid and we wouldn't see through the stupidity of an ad like that? 
>> I have to agree with ari, at this point of the game we need to focus on bigger issues and just trying to, you know, grab one very emotional and personal matter in the case of florida i don't knows and cuban-americans and try to draw a parallelism of communism with these very strong figures in an ad just goes back to picking one item that it's not the most critical at this point of the race and those few that maybe were undecided want to hear about the economy, want to hear aut jobs, want to hear about -- 
>> immigration. 
>> -- Hispanic business, or immigration. So in the case of this particular ad, I just -- it's unfortunate the funding went there when there were so many other opportunities to have a bigger impact and not stereotype on things like the communist message with the floridians or hispanic. 
>> I want to get to you because u've written a very interesting article. Is obamaood for black people? And in your piece you say this, whatever else happens, obama's first term delivered an ambitious domestic agenda, with tax,x, spending, health care, and several rights policies that benefited black americans more than recent administrations in either part just usually without making a sound. 

[00:08:45]


>> Uh-huh. 
>> Now, the narrative that I've been hearing for some time is that this president has been silent on the issues of race, and actually has not been helpful to african-americans. You say the exact opposite. 
>> It is a narrative that's out there and ere are some very respected voices in african-american sbel chul circles who have raised that which part of what I was doing is making that argument and looking at the policy. We were speaking about this before just coming on air. If you look, for example, at the people in the lowest fifth of income in this country, barack obama's tax policies and stimulative policies have cut their taxes more than any other administration in 30 years. And if you then look at that in the context of african-american communities for a range of reasons are more -- 
>> the lower fifth. 
>> -- Moreover represented in that lower fifth than any other bracket is a boon. Then on affirmative action this president sent his lawyers to the supreme court to argue in favor of it. He doesn't give big speeches on it and we can talk about what that means. My point was in taking ts argument seriously let's look at the substance and the policies -- 
>> content of what he's done. 
>> Exactly. He hasn't put an emphasis on it as race and he talks about it and contrast again to mitt romney who in reporting on this I looked into mitt romney's record. He was for and against affirmative action at various points in massachusetts. He actually rolled back to executive order affirmative action policies but reversed that. Now despite inquiries from the "wall street journal," politico and other papers, throughout this entire campaign he would never state a position on affirmative action. 
>> Professor peterson, the president himself when interviewed earlier this year when asked what was his single most mistake he said he had failed to -- in terms of his messaging. Is this one area that ari's article points to where in a sense he's been somewhat slow in coming forward in terms of what he's done in relation directly to black voters? 
>> I think that this is a very complicatedish sho within the black community. Because there is this sense -- even within the black community that there's a supposed for for the president and there really isn't. When you talk to folks, there's a wide range of opinions. There are a lot of black people to the left of this president. And so that's where he's getting that criticism from. You still get the support in that sort of context but we have to understand that it's a very, very complex issue. 

[00:10:56]


>> I have to say one more thing, which is very interesting. This is a very common mistake. I heard a lot of talk about the black vote and barack obama. There is no special historical relationship when you look at the data there. The relationship is between the quote, unquote, black vote and the democratic party. The numbers I'll give you are brief. Barack obama improved his overall vote total for the democrats from '04 to '08 by five points, more than kerry. For all voters. Among african-american voters, it was seven points. Two-point difference. So whatever we say about the african-american community, they may be committed for all series to democrats but there isn't a big voting pattern in there about this president. 
>> I wish more people would read your piece and get it squared. Again, I don't think we should file as whole issue around race under his inability to communicate his policies. It's really up to us to try to move beyond some of the discussions we've been having around this presidency cause he is black. If we do that we might see -- 
>> I think to some extent he's helped us with that. Lily, ari, prossor james peterson, stay where you are. 
>>> Next, chris christie and mitt romney, the bromance that was, is sadly no more. Do stay with us. 2013 airbags, a crash management system and the world's only tridion safety cell which can withstand over three and a half tons. Small in size.

>>> You can now add rupert murdoch to the list of conservatives who are preparing to blame the governor of new jersey if the president wins re-election. He tweets, somewhat ho rer tently, thanks, bloomberg, right decision. Now christie, while theying o, must redeclare for romney or take blame for next four dire years. In case you can't remember this insomnia that chris christie spoke that so disgusted consertives, here's a reminder. 
>> I cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state and for the people of our state. 
>> I just want to thank him for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. 
>> Joining me to discuss that disgusting press conference is dr. James peterson, ari melber. Dr. Peterson, can you explain to me the problem here. If it was a republican president and democratic governor, they presumably would have acted in exactly the same way in the face of a storm. What's the problem? 
>> I don't know. I mean, should we pat them on the back for doing their jobs? I mean, that's essentially what the governor and the president are doing here. 
>> Have you got rupert murdoch condemning him? 
>> I'm not sure we should be paying any attention to rupert murdoch at all. Let me say this, they're doing a great job in a disastrous moment and that's why they get the platform they have. People forget that this great optics for governor christie who is a blue state. This is a time of dire need, people still don't have power right now. We should not be playing politics here. Murdoch's comments are completely out of place. 
>> Why do con zer tives, ari, insists that his kind words may swing the election. Why are they doing that? 
>> I think they have a couple of problems. Number one is they are already looking for things to blame for a romney loss. 
>> That's right. 
>> That's happening, first of all. 
>> The post-mortem is occurring even though the body is not dead? 

[00:17:34]


>> Right. I mean, you know, there's a question about how much people are doing early voting nowadays. Tuesday is almost like the time for late vote. If you have your stuff together you should have voted already. That's how it is in politics. I have worked on campaigns that have lost and it does happen. Long before election day they see what they can do to maintain their legacy and angle that they weren't responsible for the loss. The other piece with rupert murdoch is -- by the way, I'm glad he's on the first initial basis with the president. It's not just barack, it's just "o." It's fascinating because what we get through twitter is a bee line to powerful people's minds. And rupert murdoch may give away more of the game than he realizes. This is how he views it. I want to echo what you said. This is not a political time. There may be political ramifications but first, we still have people who need help. Rupert murdoch is sitting there saying that governor christie -- 
>> he lives on the upper east side of manhattan. He's not bothered about hurricane sandy. 
>> Exactly. Mayor bloomberg has done some good things here but also showed an incredible lack of understanding in trying to continue the marathon. You have some people here who have power, media power, financial power, political power, and they're looking at this and we're seeing how they view these developments. That's unfortunate what they think. 
>> I want to add something to that, because what I like about this I guess in the middle of the nonsense of political partisan ship is that it shows we still have it in us as americans when you see a democrat and a republican coming together from different sides of the aisle to solve an issue. We've had many ises. Rrdless of who is president or not, there are issues in the economy, in the debt, and immigration, with the war, why couldn't we celebrate and see this as a sign of hope instead of trying to over dramatize it. It's really unfortunate, whether it is through twitter of powerful people or even us in the media, to not look at this and see the positive in it and try to make it into a big on the other side. 

[00:19:37]


>> They need chris christie. They need his personality. They need the kind of energy he brings to the party. 
>> Some suggestion he might have been needed as a vice presidential candidate. That really goes, martin, to the question you raised at the top of the broadcast. What is mitt romney's closing argument. They spent an enormous amount of time to impugn christie and wlorcht he was a running mate. That's what they're doing the weekenfore the final election. That shows real problems. 
>> Shows they're making some concessions here right in the run-up to the end. On the other side, they're confident about their numbers. You were on the same call earlier. They are confident about their numbers in the swing states. 
>> To your point, lili, is it not the case that republicans are probably angry because their whole strategy from the moment this president was inaugurated was to oppose, obstruct, ambush, absolutely everything he did and in the last week of the campaign, here's a republican who gets on board and cooperates with the president. 
>> See, once again, I will look at that as an example of showing that a republican mindset can collaborate with the democratic side and work on the other side of the aisle. But again, it's not bei used strategically or maybe generally as a way to portray and show that there is a new spirit and there is a true american spirit when we work together, and that's what's happening now in the time of crisis. It's a strength, it's not a weakness, what we're seeing. 
>> Here, here. Dr. James peterson, ari melber, lili, thank you. 
>>> Coming up, new video evidence shows why mitt romney is so afraid to answer a reporter's questions. Do stay with us. Ah. Fire bad! Just have to fire roast these tomatoes. This is going to give you a head start on your dinner. That seems easier

>>> The president has just finished speaking in iowa. He's still actually shaking hands with members of the crowd. With three days to go until the election, he's campaigning like a man possessed. Consider this is how campaign strategist david axeod put it to reporters. Quote, I've known him for 20 years. I've never seen him more exhilarated than he is right now. You an see in the speech he's devering, that this is coming from his loins. Well, with that, let's go live to iowa where mitt romney spoke earlier today and where nbc's kristen welker traveling with the president is with us. Kristen, I'm reluctant to ask you questions about the president's loins but I guess the truth is that the president's campaign is feeling upbeat about tuesday's election. 
>> Well, if they're using the world loins they must be feeling pretty upbeat. Martin, I think this was a campaign trail first. First time we've ever heard that word used. But theoryality is, martin, both of these come pains are trying to convince us that their candidate is going to win on tuesday. What we're doing right now is really trying to look at the numbers. What I can tell you is 27 million people have voted early so far in about 34 states, and right now those who are registered as democrats have an edge over republicans. A lot of these key battleground states, including iowa, florida, north carolina, ohio, republicans have the edge when it comes to colorado. Now, democrats say this is a zine that their ground game is working. It's doing exactly what it needs to do. Republicans say, look, their turnout is not as large as it was at ts point in 2008. So we're going to have to wait and see, the bottom line is, until tuesday to see who is right. What I can tell you, martin, this race remains razor tight between now and election day, these two candidates will travel about 8,000 miles. Hitting all of the key battleground states in between. Mart? 

[00:26:22]


>> I should also mention that it was you, kristen, who provoked that answer about the president's loins. 
>> I did. 
>> In a question to david axelrod. Kristen welker in iowa, thanks so much. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> Could we be running out top lines from mitt and ann romney? Stay with us. There are just three days to go. Victor! I got your campbell's chunky soup. Mom? Who's mom? I'm the giants mascot.

>>> Hello and welcome back to democracy plaza where we have transformed rockefeller center into a home for our special verage of this presidential election campaign. And it has been a frenzied final sprint to election day. Here are today's top lines. Three is the magic number. 
>> Stop telling me you can't wait for this election to be over. You love it. 
>> Three more days, four more years. 
>> In three days, we win, obama loses. 
>> Next to ann romney, paul ryan is the best choice I've ever made. 
>> It's been an extraordinary experience. 
>> I want to remind you, this is the end of daylight savings time tonight. It's mitt romney's favorite time of the year because he gets to turn the clock back. 
>> You got to own what you say. This isn't a game. 
>> Senator grassley, have you hit any deer lately? 
>> Always been, if you will, a rodent and rabbit hunter. Small varmints, if you will. 
>> Was it delicious. 
>> Governor romney is having a tough time here in ohio because he is against the auto industry. 
>> Folks who work at the jeep plant asking, is it true, are our jobs being shippedo china? 
>> I'm counting on your clear eyes and full hearts to make sure that we can't lose. 
>> One of my more favorite moments of the campaign is throwing touchdown pass. I know how to throw spirals. 
>> I don't want your lies. 
>> America is atts best when everybody gets a fire shot. That's why I'm running for a second term of the president of the united states. 
>> He said voting is the best revenge. 

[00:31:17]


>> Don't boo, vote. Voting is the best revenge. 
>> Vote for love of country. 
>> No obama! He should resign! 
>> Silence is deafening, but silence is also telling. 
>> Do you still think that it's funny? 
>> President obama promised to slow the rise of the oceans? I would never imagine such a thing is funny. 
>> You know I tell the truth and you know I fight for working families every single day as hard as I know how. 
>> So that's it. That's the election. It is your choice, america, because, for me, it is a win-win. If it's obama, america wins. If it's romney, comedy wins. 
>> Let's welcome our panel here t at democracy plaza. Cyst to is my colleague and cohost of "the cycle." Carol finney is former communications director for the democratic national committee. And jonathan is an msnbc contributor and "washington post" columnist. Karen, we've had no less than six national tracking polls in the last 24 hours. 
>> Okay. 
>> I tell you, I'm polled to death. 
>> I bet you are. We all are. 
>> But the story changes a bit when you look a battleground states. While the national polls appear to be tight, the president is up 6 percentage points according to nbc of likely voters in ohio. What does that tell us? 
>> I have long believed, we have talked about this, the state polls are the thing to focus on. 
>> You always maintained that. 
>> They have the best idea in terms of their sample, women, minorities, the demographics of those states. The other key things in those battleground states is if you take a look t the early vote numbers and you start to see how hard it will be for mitt romney to get to 270 because in most of those early battleground states where there's early voting he's got to win upwards of 50% of the remaining amount of votes to win the election. That sdarts to make that a lot tougher. 
>> Right. Now, crystal, the margins are much closer in places like new hampshire, colorado, virginia, you know very well, florida. The president leads in wionsin, iowa, and nevada. Let me ask you specifically about nevada. We see -- as karen was saying, strong early voting advantages. Mitt romney appears not to be making any stops there over the next three days. Do you der rooifr anything from that sfl. 

[00:33:34]


>> I derive a lot from the early voting numbers and I think the fact that romney is not going there is quite telling. Nevada is probably almost gone. And the way that the demographics have shifted in nevada this may be the last election where nevada is really in play for republicans. There's al an interesting thing that happened there on the ground. Ron paul supporters sort of took over the republican party in nevada and kind of destroyed it in a way. The groundwork there is really poor for the republican party to the extent that the idaho republican party has actually been sending mail into the state. That's how bad it is. 
>> So why is mitt romney going to pennsylvania? 
>> Well, I think he's looking at the fact that he can't win in ohio, he's behind there. Even his people are sort of acknowledging that that's falling off the map. He has to either win in wisconsin which is also looking very much out of reach. Or he has to figure out some other path of pennsylvania. I do t think it's credible but he's trying to do at least a head fake to figure out you some other path t get ere. 
>> Jonathan, to you. You might have thought that the 30 years war in the first amendment settled the issue of politics and religion. You would be wrong. I'd like you to take a listen to this, please. 
>> And remember when obama forcedhristian organizations to provide insurance coverage that was contrary to their religious beliefs? That's the real barack obama. That's the real threat to our religious freedom. 
>> Jonathan, I'm sorry, once again to pick up on another robo lie by romney. But I thought the president allowed for exceptions for religious organizations in relation to the provision of contraception. Is that not correct? 
>> Yes, that is correct. 
>> And yet the robo says the exact opposite. 
>> And yet you are shocked and surprised and probably horrified that the robo call for governor romney is repeating a lie that has been knocked down. Is it controversial thing that's happened with -- with what the president did, sure. But the question is settled. We've seen this with the health exemption. We've seen it with welfare. We've seen it with the jeep ad. We've seen it time and time again with governor romney's campaign. They are -- they said during the republican convention one of the seniored a viders said, we are not going to run our campaign based on fact checker or paraphing here. 

[00:35:47]


>> Dictated by fact checkers. 
>> That proves it again. 
>> If I could here. He's christian. The president is christian. 
>> Right. 
>> He is not declaring war on his own religion. 
>> Good point. 
>> Karen, to that point, and crystal is absolutely right. Isn't the intention here, let's be honest, to dress this president up as closely as possible to some kind of islamic, some kind of muslim that detaches him from this country? They've been doing it from the beginning and they continue to do it. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> To crystal's point, he is a committed christian. 
>> He is a christian. And by the way, let's just remember this issue of access to birth control. Women's issues. The ad to not mention that the issue is about women being able to choose what medicines they take. Sure this is all about passing the president as some kind of other. 
>> Something to be scared of. And john sununu, the inspector of john sununu said the only reason that colin powell is supporting barack obama is because he's black. The same guy who basically said he's got to learn how to be an american. Very clear from the beginning what this strategy was all about. >John sununu is a vat of poison. I was here a day after reporting of 9/11. Unfortunately that's not the only thing we remember about mr. Giuliani. Take a listen to this. 
>> Thereatest country on eah, the greatest country in the history of the world, and our growth is at 1.2%. He should resign. 
>> Now, we're obviously concerned for the mental health of rudy giuliani, but we also know that he loves opera and he appeared to be close to some kind of physical explosion. 
>> I mean, in all seriousness, though, I think that is a perfect example of why the romney team is going to lose, because the republicans are not living in the world of reality. You know, the base so hates the pr ident with such a visceral, gutteral hatred they can't understand that most of the country likes this president, wants him to succeed. Thinks he's good guy who is trying hard. And so you can't think that -- you can't have that hatred and come up with a compelling message that appealing to centrist voters who you need to win over to your side. 

[00:38:05]


>> We've seen in ohio where there's been a little bit of a backlash with the jeep ads that jonathan was mentioning because they're such blatant lies that the head of gm and chrysler had to come out. There's a population growing in america saying, wow, you might want to chill that hate down a little bit. It's a little daunting. You can almost see voters saying, did you know you just said that out loud? The rest of us heard you say that? 
>> The problem is, karen, they wouldn't be doing it if they didn't think they were appealing to somebody. I mean, you don't spend a million dollars on advertising unless you think you're goi to get some return. 
>> But remember from the very beginning this has been a base election. President obama needs his base to come out if he's going to win. Mitt romney needs his base to come out if he's going to win. And so the fact that he -- that they are still going this route spells trouble for governor romney. 
>> There aren't enough white men in this country to elect a president. I'm sorry, fellas. It's the truth. And the barack obama electorate is blacker and browner and it's women and it's far more diverse, like the country actually is. 
>> Even republican senator lindsey graham said something to the effect of we're not turning out enough angry old white guys. The romney campaign made the bet that they had enough of those guys on their side if they just did stuff like what rudy giulni did, they would win. They were wrong. 
>>> Crystal ball, karen finney, jonathan, stay with us. 
>>> A programming note, tomorrow, vice president joe biden sits down with chris matthews for a special preelection edition of "hard ball" tomorrow night at 7:00. 
>>> Next, it's been three weeks since mitt took a question from a reporter. When we come back, you will see why. Stay with us. 
>> Refusing to answer details about your policies until after the election, that's definitely not change. We've heard that from politicians before. Nobody said an inkjet slow.

>>> President obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans. And to heal the planet. 
>> Trying to bitey lip just like mitt romney. It was a stupid joke when he told it at the republican convention in tampa. But only the dregs of mitt romney's base could find funny. But now after a week where we saw more than our fair share of rising sea levels, it's pure political poison. And even mr. Romney is embarrassed. Take a listen to this. 
>> Something to rise of funny? 
>> I would never imagine such a thing as funny. How are you? 
>> Is climate change still a joke to you? 
>> As a matter of fact, I know you're filming, if you would like to see my view on global warming, I wrote a book and there's a chapter on global warming and you will see what i think we need to do to deal with it. 

[00:44:14]


>> KAREN, IT WAS OCTOBER 10th, Over three weeks ago that mr. Romney took a reporter's question. I think we now see why that is. 
>> Absolutely. He doesn't -- here's the thing. He doesn't care about telling the truth anyway so he might as well go ahead and take the question. 
>> That's true. 
>> Either way, it's not like we're getting the truth. 
>> Extraordinary because he said he didn't say it was a laughing matter but he just made a joke of it. 
>> How many times has he actually said -- you know, himself, basically contradict what's in his book. 
>> We have his book, karen. 
>> Ah. 
>> Here it is. Mr. Romney suggest we take a look. In 2010 mr. Romney wrote, i believe that climate change is occurring. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor. Then, in 2011, mr. Romney was running in a republican presidential primary and he changed his answer to, we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. We also checked his book, what's your thoughts? 
>> Well, look, this fits in what mitt romney has done throughout this campaign. It's clip that you love showing, top line, when he says, I stand by whatever it is -- what i said, whatever it is, whatever i said when I said it. That's exactly what we're seeing here. You know, mitt romney, he answered the question as best he could. He doesn't really want to talk to the person. Remember, he said, I know you're filming, just go check out my book, hey, how are you doing. 
>> We did check out the book. Great. Rub badge. Crystal, if you had any doubts that hurricane sandy changed the race in the last week, listen to carl rove. This is what he tells the "washington post." If you hadn't had the storm, there would have been more of a chance for the romney campaign to talk about the deficit, the debt, the economy. When you have attention drawn away to somewhere else, to something else, it is not to romney's advantage. Is that really true given all the statistics have been going improving for the president in relation to the economy? 
>> Well, that is true. I mean, I think rove is already trying to find a reason why romney is going to lose. Even karl rove is now having to admiat there were some problems this week that the campaign is not looking good. 

[00:46:20]


>> Topsy on the body before the body is dead. 
>> Exactly. Rather than admitting that maybe the conservative policy prescriptions did not appeal to the american public and bashing the president doesn't appeal to the american public he has to instead go down this path. Flip-flopping, when he was a governor of massachusetts, he was a strong proponent of the regional greenhouse gas emission, right up to the point that he decided and declared that he was not going to run for office again, in effect, announcing his run for the president of the united states on that very day he made that announcement and that he was pulling out of the regional greenhouse gas initiative. 
>> Totally unrelated. 
>> Totally politically calculated. 
>> Karen, what were you going to say about the flip flog in relation to the climate change issue? 
>> I was going to -- I wasn't going to say in relation to the flip-flop of the climate change issue. I was going to say in general of mitt romney. You heard me say this before, we're back where we started. The dishonesty, I won't show you my tax records, I won't do this, I won't do that. But also, what karl rove is doing there, let's be very, very clear because we're going to hear a lot of it for the next three days, that is starting to deledge mize the second term for barack obama. If chris christie hadn't done this, if sandy hadn't happened -- 
>> if we hadn't cheated the unemployment numbers, if the hurricane hadn't happened, bureau of labor statistics. 
>> Polls and media. The liberal media. The mainstream media. 
>> That's right. 
>> Is that what's going to happen over the next few days, i don'jonathan, in your experience of covering presidential elections, does this feel premature that they're writing the epitaph or does that tell you what is going to happen? 
>> It tells you that they are cya'ing right now before the election. They're not going to let themselves and we're all very bullish about the president's prospects on stoous. But until the people actually vote we won't know. What they're doing is very -- if mitt romney does indeed lose everyone is on record as saying, well, if it's this or it was that. It was sandy. 

[00:48:31]


>> Yeah, of course. Except never admitting that he was actually a horrendous candidate. 
>> Heard it. Terrible. 
>> Crystal ball, karen finney, jonathan capehart.

[00:52:03]


>>> That's the live shot here at rockefeller center where the rink has been transformed into a battleground in the final hours of this grueling campaign. Mitt romney is racing across as many states as he possibly can offe ng his closing argument that he's the only man in america who can possibly work across the aisle in the congress, not the president. 
>> He will not be able to work with congress. He is not for the last four years, he's ignoredthem, he's attacked them. I will meet regularly with democrat leaders, republican leaders, I'll find good people in both parties who care more about the interest of the people than they do about politics. It can happen. It's got to happen. 
>> Congressman john rmouth/is the democrat from kentucky. 
>> He may not be aware from the moment the president was gnawing rated republicans set out a strategy to obstruct, to prevent, to ambush absolutely anything he tried to achieve. Is this all the president's fault? 
>> I don't think he's been paying much attention because it's been clear that republicans as you said have set out from DAY ONE, mitch McContinental and the republican meeting the night of the inauguration saying we can't give the president any ways at all. We met without any staff or media in the ways and means committee and is there any health care law that you all can vote for and they said flat out, no. It's been clear what's going on. The president's problem, if god forbid mitt romney were elected, is with the republicans, it's not with the democrats. 
>> Mr. Romney, I guess, to create the impression that he'll start vigorously, says that he'll accomplish a remarkable number of things from day one if he wins the election. Listen. 

[00:54:11]


>> Day one of my administration I will label china a currency manipulator. 
>> Day one we'll say yes to keystone pipeline. On day one I'll ensure that organizations like planned partner hood get no more support. I'll get rid of o oma care on day one. 
>> With just three days to go, given he will start to repeal the president's health care and start a trade war with china, what kind of mood will democrats be when they meet with mr. Romneyn day two? 
>> I guess he's not going to go to the parade or inaugural balls if he's going to do all that on day one. This is all absolute bluster. We know he's likely to change his mind on day two and day three so I don't think the american people should pay much attention to what he says he's going to do on day one. 
>> Some people would say it's hour to hour rather than day to day. Mitt romney as we know is probably the finest living revisionist in america, when he talks about his experience in massachusetts, he fails to acknowledge that the reason he won support from democrats is because health care and education were priorities for those democrats. That's why they worked with him. It wasn't down to some magical elixir that he brewed, was it? 
>> Remember even when he was asked about gun control laws, he said he supported that because there was general agreement on it. It wasn't because he exerted any kind of leadership ability. His entire history, clearly when he faced a legislature that was 85% democrat there wasn't much he was abl to do unless democrats wanted to go there. This is a very very different environment he would find himself in in washington. And again his problem is that eric cantor and a lot of republicans aren't willing to compromise, aren't willing to reach out to anybody. His problem is going to be with his own party. Democrats have bn willing all along to sit down and talk about some common approaches to some serious problems and republicans.

=======================================================

Three more days. Not going to -- that's it. 
>> No obama. 
>> If it's obama, america wins. If it's romney, comedy wins. 
>> Senator grassley, have you hit a big deer lately? The deer didn't make it, but was it delicious? 
>> I love you back, and we've got more work to do. 
>> One more year! One more year! 
>> Never imagine such a thing as funny. President obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans. Never imagine such a thing as funny. I'm not particular precisely of what I said but I stand by whatever I said, whatever it was. 
>> We are closing in on the final 48 hours of this campaign. The president is speaking live in dubuque, iowa, his third of four stops today. And with him and his challenger in a frenzied sprint to win voters in those crucial battleground states. For the president that means shoring up support in the midwest states that backed him with great enthusiasm in 2008. With events in iowa, ohio, and wisconsin already today. And it was in the key battleground ohio that the president lambasted his challenger's latest effort to seize the medal of change. 
>> Governor romney, he is a very talented salesman. So in this campaign, he has tried as hard as he can to repackage the same policies that didn't work and offer them up as change. But, you know, here's the problem, ohio, we know what change looks like. And what he's offering about ain't it. 
>> No, indeed, it ain't. Vice president joe biden hit it a bit closer to the mark when he joked about romney's favorite time of year out in colorado. 

[00:02:08]


>> Folks, I want to remind you, this is the end of daylight savings time tonight. It's mitt romney's favorite time of the year because he gets to turn the clock back. 
>> Yes, for mitt romney it's the closing hours of his six- or seven- or eight-year bid for the white house. It is a palpable feeling on the romney campaign plane that is end the near. Deed, that was evident today in colorado springs with mr. And mrs. Romney showing evident wear and tear, evenaretting a bit misty-eyed from the long flight. 
>> It has been quite a journey. It's coming to a close. We have three more days. 
>> It's no wonder emotions are running so high, particularly with new polls out today showing romney down six in critical ohio. Down two in his absolute must win florida. Six, seven, eight years of campaigning and it's come down to this. Romney still combing through the president's speeches trying to find anything that he might tether his message to, this time a line best served cold. 
>> Yesterday the president said something you may have already heard, that I found troubling. Spoke to an audience and said voting is the best revenge. He's asking us -- he is asking his supporters to vote for revenge. I'm asking you to vote for love of country. 
>> Oh, for the love of christmas, three days to go. Let's get right to our panel. With me here at democracy plaza is professor james peterson of lehigh university, nbc correspondent and eli gilmore of the excel ie license. Ari, the fact that romney is still desperately trying to find a zinger from the president's speech indicates there's a problem, isn't there? He's just not winning. 

[00:04:11]


>> It is a bad sign if you're playing these kind of word games this close to the end. You want to be making a big, bold closing argument. That's not what you're seeing from the romney campaign. You're seeing a lot of spinning. You're seeing talk about pennsylvania. You're seeing talk about these quotes and obviously what the president meant was, if you have a feeling of revenge, if you're feeling excited, make sure to go out and do your civic duty, that's what counts. I mean, it's such a reach and so silly to try to take that and turn it into something else. But that's where they're at right now. 
>> So it's an act of desperation? 
>> I think so. I think the problem for mitt romney here is, look at ohio, right? Talk about a dispute over jobs and facts and he is losing. If you go on twitter, I mean, i was doing #romneyohioclips as the hash tag and the obama campaign and others were circulated today. Not three, not five, but literally about 15 articles saying to mitt romney, you've got the economic plan wrong with your approach to jobs and the auto industry. And number two, equally important in a campaign, you're lying. Stop lying to the people of ohio. 
>> Dr. Peterson, "the washington post," to ari's point, had an article entitled, mitt romney's campaign insults voters. Through all the flip-flops there has been one consistency in the campaign of republican president nominee mitt romney, a contempt for the electorate. Mr. Romney seems to be betting that voters have no memories, poor arithmetic skills and general inability to look behind the curtain. We hope the results tuesday prove him wrong. 
>> Yeah, again, if we put that revenge comment in its proper context, part of what that revenge is about is romney's violation of the public trust. When we look at these different things that have gone on in the campaign, it's very, very difficult to see mitt romney as an authentic campaigner or authentic politician. That's where you get the revenge piece. That's where the oped seems to be right on point. Again, we look at a number of different issues. Look at the adz playing in ohio right now. You look at that chrysler ad, you look at this desperate republican ad trying to convince black folk that the hapublican party are on their side. They speak down to voters and let voters understand the ways in which politics gets really, really messy at this stage of the game. 

[00:06:22]


>> It's not just the campaign, it's the character of the man. That's what's being exposed to ari's point. 
>> Yes. 
>> By these ads. Is that not true? If you willfully lie repeatedly to the electorate, what does that say about you as an individual? 
>> It doesn't speak very highly of you. Again, I'm all about authenticity and truth in politics. I know that seems really, really crazy in the 21st century. I think the american electorate is with me on this. At the end of the day mitt romney has played with the truth fast and furious, as we said, many times on your show. This is the result, the six-point deficit in ohio. 
>> Despite that misleading g-pad, he hasn't made any inroads in ohio, as we've heard. We've heard about this absurd ad in spanish to latino voters where there's the president linked to fidel, hugo chavez. Could it be, do you think, that mitt romney made the mistake that think that the electorate is dumb, that basically we're stupid and we wouldn't see through the stupidity of an ad like that? 
>> I have to agree with ari, at this point of the game we need to focus on bigger issues and just trying to, you know, grab one very emotional and personal matter in the case of floridians and cuban-americans and try to draw a parallelism of communism with these very strong figures in an ad just goes back to picking one item that it's not the most critical at this point of the race and those few that maybe were undecided want to hear about the economy, want to hear about jobs, want to hear about -- 
>> immigration. 
>> -- Hispanic business, or immigration. So in the case of this particular ad, I just -- it's unfort ate the funding went there when there were so many other opportunities to have a bigger impact and not stereotype on things like the communist message with the floridians or hispanic. 
>> Ari, I want to get to you because you've written a very interesting article. Is obama good for black people? And in your piece you say this, whatever else happens, obama's first term delivered an ambitious domestic agenda, wh tax, spending, health care, and several rights policies that benefited black americans more than recent administrations in either party. Just usually without making a sound. 

[00:08:52]


>> Uh-huh. 
>> Now, the narrative that I've been hearing for some time is that this president has been silent on the issues of race, and actually has not been helpful to african-americans. You say the exact opposite. 
>> It is a narrative that's out there and there are some very respected voices in african-american intellectual circles who have raised that which part of what I was doing is making that argument and looking at the policy. We were speaking about this before just coming on air. If you look, for example, at the people in the lowest fifth of income in this country, barack obama's tax policies and stimulative policies have cut their taxes more than any other administration in 30 years. And if you then look at that in the context african-american communities for a range of reasons are more -- 
>> the lower fifth. 
>> -- Moreover represented in that lower fifth than any other bracket is a boon. Then on affirmative action this president sent his lawyers to the supreme court to argue in favor of it. He doesn't give big speeches on it and we can talk about what that means. My point was in taking this argument seriously let's look at the substance and the policies -- 
>> content of what he's done. 
>> Exactly. He hasn't put an emphasis on it as race and he talks about it and contrast again to mitt romney who in reporting on this I looked into mitt romney's record. He was for and against affirmative action at various points in massachusetts. He actually rolled back to executive order affirmative action policies but reversed that. Now despite inquiries from the "wall street journal," politico and other papers, throughout this entire campaign he would never state a position on affirmative action. 
>> Professor peterson, the president himself when interviewed earlier this year when asked what was his single most mistake he said he had failed to -- in terms of his messag is this one area that ari's article points to where in a sense he's been somewhat slow in coming forward in terms of what he's done in relation directly to black voters? 
>> I think that this is a very complicated issue within the black community. Because there is this sense -- even within the black community that there's a supposed for for the president and there really isn't. When you talk to folks, there's a wide range of opinions. There are a lot of black people to the left of this president. And so that's where he's getting that criticism from. You still get the support in that sort of context but we have to understand that it's a very, very complex issue. 

[00:11:01]


>> I have to say one more thing, which is very interesting. This is a very common mistake. I heard a lot of talk about the black vote and barack obama. There is no special historical relationship when you look at the data there. The relationship is between the quote, unquote, black vote and the democratic party. The numbers I'll give you are brief. Barack obama improved his overall vote total for the democrats from '04 to '08 by five points, more than kerry. For all voters. Among african-american voters, it was seven points. Two-point difference. So whatever we say about the african-american community, they may be committed for all series to democrats but there isn't a big voting pattern in there about this president. 
>> I wish more people would read your piece and get it squared. Again, I don't think we should file as whole issue around race under his inability to communicate his policies. It's really up to us to try to move beyond some of the discussions we've been having around this presidency because he is black. If we do that we might see -- 
>> I think to some extent he's helped us with that. Lili gil valetta, ari melber, professor james peterson, stay where you are. 
>>> Next, chris christie and mitt romney, the bromance that was, is sadly no more. Do stay with us. ] time drop?

>>> you can now add rupert murdoch to the list of conservatives who are preparing to blame the governor of new jersey if the president wins re-election. He tweets, thanks, bloomberg, right decision. Now christie, while thanking o, must redeclare for romney or take blame for the next four dire years. In case you can't remember this insomnia that chris christie spoke that so disgusted conservatives, here's a reminder. 
>> I cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state and for the people of our state. 
>> I just want to thank him for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. 
>> Joining me to discuss that disgusting press conference is dr. James peterson, ari melber, and lili gil valetta. Dr. Peterson, can you explain to me the problem here. If it was a republican president and democratic governor, they presumably would have acted in exactly the same way in the face of a storm. What's the problem? 
>> I don't know. I mean, should we pat them on the back for doing their jobs? I mean, that's essentially what the governor and the president are doing here. 
>> Have you got rupert murdoch condemning him? 
>> I'm not sure we should be paying any attention to rupert murdoch at all. Let me say this, they're doing a great job in a disastrous moment and that's why they get the platform they have. People forget that this great opticsor governor christie who is a blue state. This is a time of dire need, people still don't have power right now. We should not be playing politics here. Murdoch's comments are completely out of place. 
>> Why do conservatives, ari, insists that his kind words may swing the election. Why are they doing that? 
>> I think they have a couple of problems. Number one is they are already looking for things to blame for a romney loss. 
>> That's right. 
>> That's happening, first of all. 

[00:17:36]


>> The post-mortem is occurring even though the body is not dead? 
>> Right. I mean, you know, there's a question about how much peop are doing early voting nowadays. Tuesday is almost like the time for late vote. If you have your stuff together you should have voted already. That's how it is in politics. I have worked on campaigns that have lost and it does ppen. Long before election day they see what they can do to maintain their legacy and angle that they weren't responsible for the loss. The other piece with rupert murdoch is -- by the way, I'm glad he's on the first initial basis with the president. It's not just barack, it's just "o." It's fascinating because what we get through twitter is a bee line to powerful people's minds. And rupert murdoch may give away more of the game than he realizes. This is how he views it. I want to echo what you said. This is not a political time. There may be political ramifications but first, we still have people who need help. Rupert murdoch is sitting there saying that governor christie -- 
>> he lives on the upper east side of manhattan. He's not bothered about hurricane sandy. 
>> Exactly. Mayor bloomberg has done some good things here but also showed an incredible lack of understanding in trying to continue the marathon. You have some people here who have power, media power, financial power, political power, and they're looking at this and we're seeing how they view these developments. That's unfortunate what they think. 
>> I want to add something to that, because what I like about this I guess in the middle of the nonsense of political partisanship is that it shows we still have it in us as americans when you see a democrat and a republican coming together from different sides of the aisle to solve an issue. We've had many issues. Regardless of who is president or not, there are issues in the economy, in the debt, and immigration, with the war, why couldn't we celebrate and see this as a sign of hope instead of trying to over dramatize it. It's really unfortunate, whether it is through twitter of powerful people or even us in the media, to not look at this and see the positive in it and try to make it into a big on the other side. 
>> They need chris christie. They need his personality. They nd the kind of energy he brings to the party. 

[00:19:42]


>> Some suggestion he might have been needed as a vice presidential candidate. That really goes, martin, to the question you raised at the top of the broadcast. What is mitt romney's closing argument. They spent an enormous amount of time to impugn christie and whether or not he was a running mate. That's what they're doing the weekend before the final election. That shows real problems. 
>> Shows they're making some concessions here right in the run-up to the end. On the other side, they're confident about their numbers. You were on the same call earlier. They are confident about their numbers in the swing states. 
>> To your point, lili, is it not the case that republicans are probably angry because their whole strategy from the moment this president was inaugurated was to oppose, obstruct, ambush, absolutely everything he did and in the last week of the campaign, here's a republican who gets on board and cooperates with the president. 
>> See, once again, I will look at that as an example of showing that a republican mindset can collaborate with the democratic side and work on the other side of the aisle. But again, it's not being used strategically or maybe generally as a way to portray and show that there is a new spirit and there is a true american spiri when we work together, and that's what's happening now in the time of crisis. It's a strength, it's not a weakness, what we're seeing. 
>> Here, here. Dr. James peterson, ari melber, li gil valetta, thank you. 
>>> Coming up, new video evidence shows why mitt romney is so afraid to answer a reporter's questions. Do stay with us. wildberry is the same frequent heartburn treatment as prilosec otc. Now with a fancy coating that gives you a burst of wildberry flavor. Now why make a flavored heartburn pill? Because this is america.

>>> The president has just finished speaking in iowa. 
>>> We are following the presidential candidates as they chris cross the coup tri in the final weekend of campaigning. We want to take you to virginia where the president is appearing with former president bill clinton. Let's listen. 
>> It was great to hear the dave matthews band again. 
[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> but, as you can see, I have given my voice in the service of my president. 
[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> but I had the honor of introducing the president tonight and started setting up his speech. And I want to tell you that four years ago when he ran, b hillary and I worked very hard. We did, together, over a hundred appearances. But I am much more enthusiastic about barack obama's election tonight than I was even four years ago. There are five simple reasons. First of all, in a time torn by etilogical warfare, he knows any of us together works a lot better than if you're on your own. He knows that an economy that builds a middle class and gives poor people an honorable way to work their way into it is a lot better than four more years have trickled down. We've been there, we've done that. He knows that a budget based on arithmetic is a lot better than one based on illusion. And he knows that practical cooperation is better than all of this constant etiological conflict. We saw it the way the president got off the campaign trail and responded to sandy. And all over america, people were thrilled to see him working with the republican governor of new jersey. And the mayor of new york city who is an independent and who endorsed president obama. And the democratic governors of new york and connecticut. There is no republican or democratic way to rebuild after a flood, to save lives, to start again, to turn the electricity on, to clean the debris. But what I want to tell you is cooperation works better when there is no disaster. And if you don't have cooperation, you have the makings of a disaster. Barack obama is a proven coop ray tor. He even offered the republicans, unilaterally, inn attempt to get a budget deal, a trillion dollars in spendg cuts. They said thank you very much, no deal. We will not see one penny raised on the wealthiest americans, even if it will get rid of $4 trillion in debt. But he kept going and the door is still open and when you reelect him, the door will be open and they will walk through that door. 

[00:28:42]


[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> the second reason that I am for president obama is that he has done a good job with a bad hand. Keep in mind that all through 2007 and 2008, then senator obama, crossed america with senator clinton and senator biden and other good democrats all talking about how bad the economy already was. Median family income after inflation was lower than it was the day after I left office. Poverty was up. All of these things mr. Romney talks about now were true before the crash. Because of the policies he now advocates. And then came the crash just six weeks before the election. He took office and the economy was losing 800,000 jobs a month. Now, the economy lost jobs for about 15 months. But when it started again, and president obama's program starting kicking in, in just 33 months, we had 5.5 million jobs, as of yesterday. When someone criticizes an office holder, you have a right to ask them, "compared to what"? So let's look at our most recent comparison. If you don't count the losses in the crash against president bush and you just look at the seven years after the brief slow down we had when the dot com stocks crashed a little bit and the on set of the crash in september, 2008, just that seven-year period, there were 2.6 million private sector jobs. In 33 months, less than half that time, twice as many jobs, 5.5 million. Barack obama has done a good job with a bad hand. The third reason I'm for him is he has fulfilled a solid responsibility to be a good commander in chief. He has advanced the nation's security by ending the war in iraq, by bringing our troops home from afghanistan, by fighting terror, modernizing the military and aggressively pursuing diplomacy to make a world with more friends and fewer adversaries. And he's got a heck of a secretary of state. 

[00:31:52]


[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> but, far more important, most important of all to me, he has shown a consistent, unbreakable commitment to take care of the men and women in uniform when they come home. For all of these reasons, he was endorsed by a self-described, moderate republican. And one of the most distinguished military leaders since world war ii, general colin powell who also pointed out that his opponent's main advisors are the same neocons that took us into war in iraq on bad intelligence. Barack obama is your choice for commander-in-chief. The fourth reason I'm for him can best be described in a phrase once used by the second president bush. Believe it or not, he said something I really agree with. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> and he often got made fun of, but it's true. He said the president is the decider-in-chief. Okay? So let's look how these deciders stack up. Barack obama decided to sign the lily ledveder fair pay out. And at is not just a woman's issue. Anybody who like me was a kid in a famil where both the mother and the father worked know that every father with any sense wants his wife to be paid an equal amount for equal work so they can raise the kids. Now this law has been on the books for a couple of years now. And when mitt romney who wants to be the decider-in-chief was asked -- wait a minute. He was asked, well, governor, would you have signed the bill? I mean, folks, you're going to have a lot harder decisions than this 

[00:34:33]


[ laughter ] 
[ cheers and applause ] I mean, there's a law, it's been there. There's an answer to this question. You can answer yes or you can answer no. But when you are the decider-in-chief, you don't need to just shuffle along. You can't do that. Barack obama wants to kee funding planned parenthood and mitt romney doesn't. Barack obama decided that america could not afford to let the automobile industry die and he saved it. And mitt romney opposed what he did. And, now, he's tied himself in so many notes over this automobile deal, he could be hired as the chief contortionist for the cirque de soleil. I know something about this. I grew up in this business and it wasn't just general motors and chrysler. There's a reason that all the german and japanese companies that make cars in america who didn't get a penny out of this deal were for the automobile restructuring. They knew if general motors quit buying parts, the parts manufacturerwould go down and they were toast. It's another example of we're all in this together, it works better than you're on your own. Barack obama made the right decision and his opponent was wrong. 
[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> and, in an unbelievable attempt to distract the voters of ohio where one in eight jobs depends on the car business, he accused the president of allowing jeep to move jobs to china. I have to tell you. I took that personally because the jeep plan to lead ohio was open when ifgs president. I remember how hard it was to get it there and the work we did in the white house to get it there. I know that they are expanding that plant, hiring more people, taking on new production lengths. And, first, jeep said it wasn't so. Then chrysler said gornor romney was wrong. You know, when I was a kid and i got my hand caught in the cookie jar, well, my face started to turn red and I took my hand out of the cookie jar. Not governor romney. He's just digging for more cookies. 

[00:37:47]


[ Laughter ] when general motors and chrysler and jeep all said this is bull, what did he do he then said because fiat owns the controlling interest in chrysler, that the president had moved with the italians to move jobs to china. You know, first he took fsd notes on the immigration deal. And then a lot of other people, in ways I won't take your time up with, now he's going after the italians. If the irish are next, I'm toast. Far worse, after every single reputableuthority said this is a false charge, he put it on television and then doubled down and put more money behind the ad. Because he believes that middle class people are soascared about their jobs and so uninformed that they will buy any line of bull they see on television. I think they and you are smarter and barack obama will be elected president. Finally, and most important, i am for president obama because his plans for the future are better. That's what really matters. And he's going to talk about this, but I'll just give you a brief outline. He wants to begin to invest even more of the new jobs in the 21st century and infrastructure and information technology and clean energy in manufacturering and modern agriculture and he wants to empower people to do those jobs. He wants to help middle-aged, non-college educated long time workers to get back in the mix by going back to the community colleges and getting skills that will get them good jobs. And he has litally revolutionized the student loan law. From now on, beginning next year, lisn to this, every person in america who has a college loan beginning next year will, first of all, get it at a lower cost and will have the abte right to pay that loan back as a low, fixed percent of their income for 20 years. And since in this last decade we have fallen to 15th or so in the percentage of our young people with four-year college des, this is great. It means nobody ever has to drop out of college again. Ever because of the cost. One of the reasons middle class people didn't get a pay raise in the last decade is that health care costs went up so much. The health care law has not only allowed three million young people to be on their parents' insurance policy for the first time, has not only it possible beginning next year, if he wins, for more than 30 million americans, many with preexisting conditions to be insured, not only has made it legal for women to be charged the same as men for the same health care, but the last two years, we've had the lowest inflation in health care costs in 50 years. If this keeps going, if this keeps going, the barack obama is doing it the right way. Bring health care costs down, bring health care costs and quality education up. Finally, he's got a budget based on arithmetic. Cuts $4 trillion, $2 trillion in tax cuts, spending cuts for every one dollar in revenue increases. And he only asks those of us in high income groups to pay a little more to balance the budget, get rid of the debt d manage our future. Now, how does that compare with governor romney's plan? Do you remember they told us at their convention that the debt was the biggest problem in the world? Do you remember that? They forgot to tell us that we never had permanent deaths in peacetime until they convinced everybody that government would mess up a two-car parade and th there was no such thing as a bad tax cut about 30 years ago. Then they tripled and quadrupled the debt before I took office in 12 years. And then I gave you four years of declining deficits and four years of surpluses. And then they got back in with the same old theory that governor romney wasdvancing and they doubled the debt again. So this should explain something to you. Obama's plan brings the debt down and it's based on arithmetic. What is romney's plan? Another big tax cut for upper income people. Give the highest of us, highest income people 60% of the tax cut. And then cut the investment in all of these 21st century jobs, repeal the student loan law, making the loans more expensive and harder to repay and keeping us down there in the rankings of college graduates. And don't produce a budget. You say, well, governor, you want to spend $2.5 trillion more than the president wants to spend. You want to cut taxes $5 trillion more than he wants cut taxes. And you've only identified about a trillion dollars worth of tax deductions on companies that you want to repeal to lower the corporate income tax. That's president obama's idea. But that leaves $6.5 trillion. Even if you fill it, you want to produce the long-term dealt. How are you doing to do that? See me about that after the election. 

[00:44:52]


>> He has no budget. I want to vote for the president who has a budget, who has a plan that will produce broad-based posterity. I want to vote for a president who's been a good commander in chief and a good decider in chief. And I want to vote for a president who's been through the fire of these last four years and brought america out on the other side ready to take off. And, lastly, just remember this. You know,ernor romney has promised us 12 million jobs. You all remember that? He says by just electing me, people will be so elated that you're going to get 12 million jobs. Now,'m sure it was just an oversight. Or, as the president has told us, america is in the group for this huge public health epidemic. There's this virus all over america backed by hundreds of millions of dollars spreading a condition knownesia" and it's so prevalent that even his opponent could have picked up a little bit of it. And he forgot to tell you that just days before he promised those 12 million jobs, an independent business forecaster says we're going to get 12 million jobs in the next four years if we just don't mess up what president obama has already done. So it is my great honor to introduce to you, the next president, the decider-in-chief, the commander-in-chief, the man who broug us back and will take us forward, barack obama. 

[00:47:05]


[ Cheers and applause ] 
>> former president bill clinton has lost his voice being such an amazing campaign partner for barack obama, president barack obama with just about two days to go until the election. His voice sounds positively low, but he the president as he is walking out and making his way to the podium. 
>> Hello, virginia. Are you fired up? Are you ready to go? You've got to be fired up after bill clinton. He has been traveling all across the country for this campaign. He has been laying out the stakes so well that our team basically calls him the secretary of explaining stuff. The only clinton working harder than him is our secretary of state, hillary clinton. And I am so grateful to both of them. The only problem is I was in t back, I was enjoying listening to president clinton so much, i had to run up to get my cue. I was sitting there just soaking it all in. He was a great president. He's been a great friend. So I want everybody to give president bill clinton a big round of applause. Speaking of outstanding public service, your next senator, your former governor, timkaine is in the house. Your outstanding congressman, jerry conneley is here. And I want everybody to please thank dave matthews for the outstanding performance. Now -- I love u back. And I am glad to see all of you. For the past several days, obviously, all of this has been focused on the devastation that's been taking place all along the east coast. Now, virginia got hit but was spared some of the worst brunt of the storm. But I've been to new jersey. We've been on the phone every day with folks from connecticut and new york and, you know, as a nation, we mourn those who have been lost. Our hearts and prayers go out to the families who are going through just some unbearable pain. So in folks have been impacted. It's going to be a long, hard road to recovery. But every time I've spoken to folks in the region, what I've told them is that america will be with them every step of the way. America will be there on this hard road ahead. We will help them rebuild together, which is what we do as americans. Which is why during the course of tragedy, we've also been inspired over these last few days by hero, firefighters and national guardsmen and women and ems folks and police officers running into buildings, wading through water, neighbors -- helping neighbors cope with tragedy, leaders of different political parties working together to fix what's broken. Not worrying about who's getting credit. Not worrying about the politics of it. A spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is, we bounce back. No matter how tough times are, we're all in this together. We rise or fall as one nation and as one people. Andhat spirit hass guided this country along its improbable journey for more than two centuries. It's what's carried u through the trials and tribulations the last four years. Remember, in 2008, we were in the middle of two wars in the worst economic crisis since the depression. Today, our businesses created 5.5 million jobs. Home values are on the rise. Housing con instruction is coming back. We're less-dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years because of the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform. The war in iraq is over. The war in afghanistan is coming to a close. Al-qaida has been decimated, we are safer than we were four years ago. So we've de real progress, virginia. We've made real progress. But, virginia, we're here tonight not only to listen to dave matthews. Not only to hear the master, bill clinton, break things down for us. But we're also here because we've got more work to do. As long as there's a single american who wants a job and can't find one, our work is not yet done. As long as there are families working harder but still falling behind, our work is not yet done. As long as there's a child anywhere in virginia, anywhere in this country who is still languishing in poverty and barred from opportunity, our work is not yet done. We've got more work to do. Our fight goes on, virginia, because we know this nation can't succeed without a growing, thriving middle class. Our fight goes on because america has always done best. When everybody has a fair shot and everybody's doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules. That's what we believe. That's why you elected bill clinton in 't 2. That's why you elected me in '08. That's why I'm running for a second term as president of the united states. 

[00:54:29]


[ Cheers and applause ] now, virginia, in three days, you've got a choice to make. Even if you've made the choice, you've got to talk to some folks who have. And you've got to tell them, it's not just j a choice between two candidates or two parties, it's a choice between two different visions of america. It's a choice between topdow economics that crashed our economy or bottom up, middle-out economics that create a strong and growing middle class. You know, as americans, we honor the survivors and the dreamers, the entrepreneurs, the small business makers, the risk takers who are the driving force between our free enterprise system. And we believe the free enterprise system is the greatest growth and prosperity engine the world has ever known. But we also known in this country, the market works best, the free enterprise system works best, more businesses are created, more jobs are created when everybody has a chance to succeed. When everybody has the chance to get a good education and learn new skills. When we support research in the medical breakthroughs or new technologies because we know th we can't do that on our own. We've got to pool our resources to disr the future. We know that america is stronger when everybody can count on affordable health care insurance. When everybody can count on social security to give them a digied retirement. We know the market works better when the rules of the road protect kids from toxic dumping, to be protected against unscrupulous credit card companies or mortgage lenders. We believe that there's a role for rules or regulations that are smart and we also believe that we should leave to the people -- for example, we don't think politicians in washington are very smart about controlling health care choices that women are perfectly capable of making themselves. Now, for 8 years, we had a president who shared these believes. You just heard. President clinton's economic plan asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more so we can invest in the skills of our people. And the interesting thing, at the time, the republicans in congress and a certain senate candidate by the name of mitt romney -- don't boo. You've got to vote. Don't boo. But the senate candidate named mitt romney said that bill clinton's program would hurt the economy and kill jobs. Sound familiar? It turns out his math was just as bad back then as it is today. By the end of president clinton's second term, america created 23 million new jobs, incomes were up, poverty was down, our deficit became the biggest surplus in history. So, virginia, we know our ideas work. What about their ideas? After bill clinton left office, for eight years, we tried giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest americans. We tried to strip away regulation sos that wall street and insurance companies wer free to do whatever they please. What do we get? Falling incomes, record deficits and an economic crisis that we've been cleaning up afterwards ever since. So we tried one way, it worked. We tried another way, it didn't work. Which presents a dilemma for governor romney. He wants to go back to the same policies that didn't work. Governor romney is a very talented salesman. In this campaign, he has tried as hard as he can to repackage. These same ideas. And he's got, I think president clinton called it, "the brass" to call it change. Now let me tell you, we know what change looks li we know what change looks like and what governor romney i

Priva jobs created. 
>>> Teaing students to be citizens. First, why sandy should make us ask, what is a disaster anyway? 
>>> Good morning. I'm melissa harris perry coming to you frockefeller city, the new york city still reeling from the effects of superstorm sandy and her landfall earlier this week. Today, 2.5 million people remain without power and at least 40 new yorkers have died in the storms aftermath. Almost half of those deaths were inust one of the burroughs that make up the five burroughs of new york, staten island. Now, this striking image was captured by an nbc producer and staten island. Sandy's wake left the debris in the backyard of john della rosa's severely smashed home. Smashedas plates mingled with halloween decorations. Overwhelmed by thehedevastation, rocked by the power of the storm, he is left to pick up the pieces of the storm surge which sent more than 8 feet oeeater into the neighborhood. He is also left to grieve the losses of his nextoor neighbors, the foundation and stairs are all that remain of the dresh family home. George dresh and his 13-year-old daughter, angela died, when the storm surge came through their home. George's wife and angela's moth patricia, remain in the hospital. That is one story of devastation wrought by the hurricane on one street in one neighborhood in new york city. The immediate aftermath of the storm, president obama declared a large swath of the east coast as a major disaster area. Neighborhoods brought to their knees by what we think of as mother nature's dispassion nat, impersonal force. They blow back the covers on the structural inequities and reveal the life and death consequences of the inequalities, slamming directly into the heart of one of the biggest metropolises. Sandy racked the focus in a way that let's us see the differences. 21% of this city lives in poverty. On the island of manhattan, the wealthiest fifth make 40 times of the poorest fifth. A gap only surpassed by a few developing nations. This is a disaster we live with each a every day, the gulf between the rich and poor in this city was only exacerbated by the great reception. All of us are still ling through a disaster brought on by the immediate devastation from the financial crash and housing crises. We have been living in a state of disaster since the financial storm racked our nation to its structural core. A housing cyclone that hollowed out more homes that hurricane katrina and sandy combined. The very definition of disaster needs broadening. We need to recapture the initial horror created by those single natural disaster and put it toward the relief of our on going national disasters. The energy gathered by gale force winds has the power to focus our public attention. Superstorm sandy may help the electorate focus in the few days that remain in the 2012 presidential campaign. Our vote on tuesday will be for a disaster manager and chief taking charge of a country in an economic state of emergency, building a society that leaves all of us more prepared for disaster. At my table is ari melber, msnbc contributor. Norry tan dan, kate dawson and david rodi, a reuters colum and contributor for the atlantic. Thank you all for being here. 

[00:04:07]


>> I want to start with you. The article, the piece you wrote was about the inequalities that have been revealed in the con context of sandy. 
>> I am one of the privileged new yorkers. There has always been divisions in the city but this storm brought them out more vividly than ever. I was able to go to a hotel. I was in a mandatory evacuation area. I went to this hotel. If you had wealth, you could shelter in a nice place I had. If you had a steady job, you didn't have to work. All around the hotel were restaurant workers that had no choice and stayed. There was a restaurant serving food two to three hours before landfall, maids in the hotel, a garageattendant, hadn't been able to reach his sister. I said, where did you spend the storm? He said h slept in his car. 
>> Those images from staten island, particularly the stairs to nowhere, it is an iconic image of the lower ninth ward of those of us who lived in post-katrina new orleans where houses were knocked straight off their foundation. The stories you are telling are such reminders that when a storm comes at the end of the month. If you have a savings account, no problem, because you can put gas in your car and get food and get out of town. If it comes at the end of the month and you need to wait until the first of the month to get paid, you are never more broke than your at the end of the month. Is there something we learn about the broader nn of what constitutes disaster. If we can take a step back from the immediate cause and learn something about what's happening underneath. 
>> I think as david mentioned, what's really happening here is we have these moments in time when a light is shown on these inequalities. We live with them all the time. In a moment where people are suffering, there is greater concern. Peop look at it in a new light. Iss a teachable moment. Do we take this opportunity to say, when it comes to life and death choices, is it right some group of people have such constrained choices and others don't? I think that's what we have to think about in these issues, ich is how do we address them, how do we insure there is action taken around them and we don't wait for the next disaster? 

[00:06:45]


>> For kate and for me, this is where the politics are. You hear, don't itisize this. I want to listen to candidate romney talking about fema during a presidential debate. This is the key moment we all want to here. New studio. We don't have it this morning. I will read a bit of it. When he was asked about fema, mr. Romney said absolutely every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the state, that's the right direction. You can go further and send it back to the private sector. That's better. He talks about taking fema and divesting it into the states. Yet, this week, I think that statement is my could go back to haunt him. Is this more than anything a teachable moment for mitt romney? 
>> Storms bring the best and the worst out in america. They both seem to show up during a natural disaster. A natural disaster is one that crosses a couple of states. I lived through hurricane hugo in 1989 and watched the politics of a hurricane. We were out of power. My business was down. For politicians, they have to be very careful. It can make or break a political career. This is where the american public expect the government to step up, not just for a couple of days or a couple of sound bites. Right now, it is going to be the sound bites that will get us to this election. President obama has showed leadership. Governor romney, I don't think there was a natural disaster while he was head of the state. It is a teachable moment. It is one where once you land in new york, you see the city is a little empty and people are fairly desperate and the desperation is just going to start. Our hearts and prayers are from people that live in harm's way and people that live through katrina know what it is. The political ramifications could show up on tuesday. 

[00:08:56]


>> Is this a moment whenmuch as we are talking about the politics in short-tem electoral politics, is this a moment where we can through a broader political conversation? 
>> It is not just that mitt romney would point fema back to the state but the very notion of inequality, of that 47%, that that is what is revealed in this moment. 
>> I think that's right. The feeling you have when you see what you just showed, which is someone through no fault of their own being dealt the worst tragedy that can befall a human being. When you look at people through no fault of their own were born into tough circumstances. That is the feeling that animates a lot of modern liberalism. It is a feeling that conservatives do have sometimes although they talk more about other elements in society like churches or private charities stepping up. The church isn't going to solve this problem. There are big enough problems and inequalities that only government can deal with. What we have seenrom the republican primaries, it is like seeing into someone. If they are courting you, they want to take you out and tell you how great they are and seal the deal. You get a portal into them talking to their friends. It turns out they sound different or they trash talk you. That's not always the case. To go to two moments, the one you showed and the one when congressman ron paul said, well, there really shouldn't be any help in the emergency. If you go to the e.R., You should be allowed to die rather than he government help. That was the republican mainstream position. The problem is that position that got applause in the republican primary is legal, because a republican senate and the republican president, ronald reagan, signed a law saying you need the assistance. The feeling you go when you have in the e.R. Or when you want fema to be there is a good feeling. 

[00:11:03]

>>> We are here in democracy plaza home of nbc's 2p12 coverage. Thousands will gather here watching the results coming in. A map of the united states, states icing over in redr blue banners representing electoral votes will rise up in front of the billing as each campaign climbs towards 270. 
>>> Now, we turn back to the discussion of sandy. The drama of the storm, whether political or weather related is never without a protag goneist. This political see sorngs we were gifted with many. Superstorm sandy, itself, had stolen the spotlight as the leading lady of this presidential election but a lot of political hay has been made this week from the storm's debris. Cue the political troops. Quick to the draw, they have rushed to announce the sandy effect. Forget obama's katrina. This is october surprise named sandy. Thankfully, in the last days, many have thoughtfully considered the role of a strong infrastructure and a strger government. This helped us focus on the very real need for the kind of disaster planning and preparedness that only our government can provide. This morning, president obama said he remains focused as well. 

[00:16:15]


>> This continues to be my number one priority. There is nothing moreortant than us getting this right. We are going to spend as much time, effort, and energy that is necessary to make sure all the people in new york, new jersey, and connecticut know that the entire country is behind them. 
>> Back to my panel, david, in the immediate moments after a disaster, with he feel like, oh, all victims are worthy and we have this rallying around the victim effect. How long does that last? Should we expect in this context that some folks are going to be made into villains. 
>> That is going to happen. There is tremendous anger in staten island. The power is coming back on in manhattan. They are talking about november 10th for other people getting their power back. There is the same sense of inequality. Yesterday, mayor mike bloomberg nearly blew it. Marathon decision was astonishing, incredibly foolish and insensitive. He is very stubborn. The details are that all the deputies and police commissioners said, do not hold this marathon. 
>> Part of it is the optics of runningisaster ne and the other things are the generators and hotel workers, human beings that are also impacted by the storm. 
>> This is a test of government, terms of both sides here. The government can still fail in the coming days. People are furious about this gas rationing now. IN THE '70s, ODD LICENSE PLATES. Chris christie said you can buy gas in new jersey on odd days, even license plates, even days. If all this delivery of gas doesn't happen, this could still backfire on the president. It is not an automatic thing for him. The government must perform or we are not through. 
>> The government optic is the chris christie embracing of president obama. I want to listen just for a moment to sort of how chris christie was talking on fox news channel about his interest in having the president and his disinterest in having mitt romney. 

[00:18:27]


>> Is there any possibility that governor romney may go to new jersey to tour some of the damage with you? I have no idea nor am I the least bit concerned or interested. I have a job to do here in new jersey that is much better than presidential politics. I have a jobobo do. I have 2.4 million people out of power. I have devastation on the shore. I have floods in the northern part of my state. If you think right now I give a damn about presidential politics, then you don't know me. 
>> No better way to run for 2016 than to say I don't give a damn about presidential politics. I take him at his words but there is always a politics to this. 
>> Can I start answering questions from you the way governor christie talks to fox? 
>> I don't give a damn about that. 
>> The question, to be fair to steve ducey, who asks a lot of bad questions. That was a straight question. Prior to that clip, they were talking about the role of the president. To balance it out, he said, what about governor romney? It is not unusual within the traditions of our country to have the challenger engage. We do that on foreign policy. They get briefings. Governor romney has been included and offered to talk to the management infrastructure. If governor romney were to win, there would be briefings before he became president. It was not a political question. I think it was a fair question. I think what we saw was governor christie's desire to show everyone how strongly he is a political, which, as you said, makes him look political. 
>> Having worked for a lot of politicians, I don't think we should always read into everyone's motives. Of yisly, there is politics. At the end of the day, chris christie is is aware of it. His number one priority has to be to people of new jersey that he is working on this. Having an event with mitt romney would seem very political. I think he had the right response. Maybe he was a bit more confrontational than I would be. The substance of this is the right one. The fact that we have politicians reaching across the aisle is something we should separate and start looking at their motives cynically. That's what also feeds distressed government. 

[00:20:43]


>> I would agree we should embrace this idea of a bipartisan moment. The fact is, it doesn't have to happen that way. Living in louisiana with bobby jindal during the last hurricane, during isaac, when i lost a home, jindal refused to allow the president on the ground initially, embraced and accepted romney. It is not to say that there is a pure cynical motive on the part of him. 
>> Bobby jindal looks much smaller today because of what governor christie did. 
>> We should note that earlier this morn new york governor, andrew cuomo, announced the department of defense will be setting up gas distribution centers to help motorists. There will be a ten gallon limit. Up next, the convention speech one-liner that mitt romney would rather we forg. ?????? ??????

[ Male Announcer ] YOU'VE REACHED THE AGE Where you don't back down from a challenge. This is the age of knowing how to make things happen. So, why let erectile dysfunction get in your way? Talk to your doctor about viagra. 20 million men already have. Ask your doctor if your heart is healthy enough for sex. Do not take viagra if you take nitrates for chest pain; it may cause an unsafe drop in blood pressure. Side effects include headache, flushing, upset stomach, and abnormal vision. To avoid long-term injury, seek immediate medical help for an erection lasting more than four hours. Stop taking viagra and call your doctor right away if you experience a sudden decrease or loss in vision or hearing. This is the age of taking action. Viagra. Talk to your doctor. 
>>> President obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans. And to heal the planet. My promise is to help you and your family. 
>>> Tell that to the people across the east coast today still dealing with the effects of the planet's rg oceans and raising storms. Sometimes, mr. Romney, climate infrastructure and family are the same thing. Back to my panel, david. 
>> After katrina, we started talking about category 5 levees. I kept thinking, the category 5 levees we need are shelter and quality education and health care for everybody and frastructure and transportation so that people can move on. Is there any possibility of taking that and making it a broader conversation, enviental policy or housing policy that makes it easier to manage this? 
>> I think there is. I agree with neera t people like this post-partisan moment. They are tired of partisan politics and nothing getting done. We need it all. We need education and infrastructure. Bloomberg endorsed obama citing global warming as the cause. Twice in the last 14 months, new york city has had to evacua. That has never happened before in the city's history. All these things are in play. This has changed the dynamic. There is a sense we need to move on this. I wish we could have bipartisan agreement on how to move forward. 

[00:26:43]


>> It is tough toave bipartisan agreement when republicans keep being climate change designers and anti-science in a variety of ways. 
>> Anti-science, we are still dealing with 46 million people on food stamps. We are still dealing with a 50% increase in the national debt and 100% increase in the gasoline price. Now, in new jersey, they can only get 10 gallons. We are dealing with a lot of economic problems. 
>> Part of what sandy tells us, yes, we are dealing with all of those things. That's not somehow separate about trying to get a laugh line by talking about the rising ocean. 
>> EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE C-130s Unloading electric trucks to help them. They expect the government to show up. It is what level the government takes irresponsibilities. Not enough time to see what this storm has done. 
>> If we keep thinking of government's response as only about response after the fact rather than thinking about the money that is saved and the policies and the fairness associated with doing disaster planning through fair governorer nance in the first place. 
>> You are talking about wanting a cop to do on the job. What melissa is talking about is funding the cop, training the cop, making sure we have the right cops. That's a policy discussion. It goes deeper than this disaster. The problem I see is that i think conservatives have brain washed a lot of what I would call the political class into right-wing rules for disasters that require liberal reforms. Whether there is a school shooting, it is to talk about gun control. When there is a disaster, it is time to call about structural inequality attacks. This is so baked in that if you watch a lot of sunday shows and other networks, you will hear that stated not as an idea or a concept but as a premise that to talk about big government right now would be to somehow abuse the disaster. I think it is the opposite. We live in a democracy. When we have problems, we deal with infrastructure and politics. 

[00:29:10]


>> Here is what's sad about the moment we live in. We have 0% interest rates, essentially. This is the opportune times to have investment in infrastructure. We are growing but we could use more jobs. This would be a way to employ more people. The president has had an infrastructure proposal before the congress. They won't act on it. That's what's depressing about our politics. Even things across the aisle. We are looking at a situation where we are going to have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars instead of spending the $10 billion or $15 billion to protect us. That's what's depressing about it. It is likeommon sense notions are politicized in a way you can't get cess. 
>> I hear depressing but it also feels deeply strategic in the way ari was talking about. These sort of infrastructure investments have been acceptable. As long as they are happening through pitalism. There are people that profit and jobs to be had and infrastructure to be built after these disaster but it is overwhelmingly not the public sector that end up doing it but the storm chaser disaster capitalists. David rohde, I appreciate you being here. The rest are back for more. Before we go to break, I do want to acknowledge one little thing. Many of the visuals created by sandy are traumatic and upsetting. There was one image that emerged in the story of sandy. The woman next to new york mayor michael bloomberg. Lydia grew up in a deaf family and is the mayor's new sign interpreter. We have been talking about inequality and the mayor did one thing right. He kept lydia next to him. Some have criticized her animated style but those of us here in nerdland love it, because in time of crisis, communication is key. Kudos for lydia to even know how to sign with a new york accent. Stay with us. My weekly trip to the post office is next. I have a letter to send to that fellow that did a heck of a job. ???????????? wildbry is the same frequent heartburn treatment as prilosec otc. Now with a fancy coating that gives you a burst of wildberry flavor. Now why make a flavored heartburn pill? Because this is america. And we don't just make things you want, we make things you didn't even know you wanted. Like a oon fork. Spray cheese. And jeans made out of sweatpants. So grab yourself some new prilosec otc wildberry.

>>> This week, many made comparisons to the federal response to superstorm sandy to that of the bush administration following hurricane katrina. None was more stunning than that of former fema chief, michael brown. So stunning I thought it deserved an open letter. Dear michael, it is me, melissa. You won't mind if I call you brownie. I feel you have a few choice words for president obama about his response to hurricane sandy. You actually said, one thing he is gonna be asked is, why did he jump on the hurricane so quickly and go back to d.C. So quick? Actually, no. No one is going to ask the presiden of the united states why he responded so quickly to an unprecedented weather event threatening millions. Why? Because while it is bad manners to show up early for a dinner party, it is a great idea to show up early to disaster response. I am a little taken aback that you don't already know this after you and your"w" fumbled the response to hurricane katrina. The report reads fema's efforts to support state emergency management and to repair the federal response and recovery were insufficient for an event of hurricane katrina's magnitude. Your agency was described as overwhelmed the first week after landfall. Maybe they overwhelmed because you, the director, were given full authority to respond to katrina on august 27th but didn't request homeland security workers for four hours after KATRINA HIT THE 29th. Maybe it was your decision to only send 100 buses to louisiana after the national guard requested 700 for evacuations or maybe it is because in the midst of a crisis, you were busy sending cute e-mails to your staff about your clothing choices and joking, I'm trapped now, please rescue me as new orleans was actually trapped without food or water. So remember when two days after katrina hit and a fema employee told you the situation is past critical and listed problems, including many people near death and food and water running out at the superdome, your entire response was, thank for the update, anything specific I need to do or tweet. It is not all your fault. You never should have been in that role. After all, you had no experience or qualification, having been a lawyer for the international arabian horse association, which is perhaps why president obama, unlike your boss, chose an experienced disaster manager to head fema. Craig fugate was the director of the florida division of emergency staff. His experience, in 2004, fugate managed the largest federal disaster response in florida history as hurricane's charlie, francis, ivan and gene all pummeled the state in quick succession and he was even a volunteer firefighter and paramedic. You see, brownie, president obama didn't begin preparing for sandy on sunday. He started in 2009 when appointed a qualified responsive leader to manage fema. Jarvis writing for my home site asked this pointed question. If a reporter comesling with a question for comment, why would you even answer the phone? I thank you for your intervention into public discourse. It is a reminder of the stark and important questions we are facing in this election. Pick another bush who will put someone like you for national vulnerability or reelect president obama. One of your famous katrina e-mails you asked, can I quit now? The answer is yes, yes, please, quit now. Sincerely, melissa. calcium is efficiently absorbed in small continuous amounts.

>>> Some of you out there in nerdland will hate to ask the question but it must the be asked. What if? What if mitt romney wins? For starters, he is going to have one very, very busy first day. 
>> On day one of my administration, I will label china a currency welfare. We will say yes to keystone pipeline. 
>> My presidency will be a pro-life presidency. I will get rid of obama care day one. I will repeal obama care on day one with all the energy I can muster. 
>> All right. So we agoing to take mitt romney at his word. He will get all of that done on his first day in office. What about the next four years? What would a romney presidency really look like. Joiningprognosticate, ari melber, neera tanden, kate ton dawson. Let's start with the tax pl if there is something I believe mitt romney is invested in doing, it is the tax plan. He claims it is revenue neutral. 
>> You have to claim certain things. This goes for both side there is this thing cled business cycle. This is what we study. In a free market economy, recessions and recoveries, upswings and down swings are part and parcel of the world we live in. When you look at how budgets are proposed, of the congressional budget office projection. They are not that realistic. In 2014, 2015, 2016, they are projected real gdp growth of 4.4%. Sounds pretty good. How realistic is it? If you take a look at reality, at's happened since the beginning of the century? Gdp has grown at 1.7% and we know we are in a pretty sluggish economy. There is a huge disconnect between what'sposed and what's going on outside t window? 

[00:44:36]


>> That's the big deal. The claim is, I'm going to go in and cut taxes. Don't worry, cutting taxes is going to be stimulative. We are going to end up wit way more jobs and there will be fewer taxes from each individual. There will be way more paying into the tax system. Revenue neutral. Lakshman is telling us you have a choice over how much you charge people in taxes. They may not produce all the jobs. What he is doing on day one is adding to the deficit. 
>> Could be but let's go back to 1980 and ronald reagan. Changed tax policy, a similar situation to now. I don't know many people who trust washington to have any more money to spend. 
>> I think reagan is a great example. He did cut taxes and we had EXPLOITING DEFICITS IN 1980s. 
>> Then he raised them. 
>> Then he raised them. We do also have another example FROM THE 1990s, WHICH IS President clinton, who had a balanced budget. He asked the wealthy to pay more. E rates went up to 39.6. We had eight years of very strong growth. 
>> Includingsurplus. 
>> I'm not saying the taxes cause that but we know that having higher taxes onealthy americans didn't lead to a recession as republicans have argued. That's what's really daunting about the whole discussion about taxes. The fact that we have no real idea what mitt romney will do on taxes as president other than if we take him at his word, it does mean that middle class americans will pay more in taxes. Either he is not being honest with us or middle class americans will see a tax increase. That's the choice people have. 
>> He also seems to be threatening us a little bit. Ari, I want you to respond to this. Let's listen to mitt romney who seems to be threatening that if president obama is reelected that republicans are going to take us over the fiscal cliff. Let's listen to this. 
>> Unless we change course, with he may well be looking at another recession. You know that if the president is reelected, he will still be unable to work with the people in congress. He has ignored them. He has attacked them. He has blamed them. The debt ceiling will come up again and shut down and default will be threatened. 

[00:46:52]


>> The debt ceiling will come up again. It just will happen. It is just this thing that will transpire and destroy the president's second term. The debt ceiling doesn't just come up. There is a process by which congress votes to raise it and has done so as everyone may remember from the last terrible fight under presidents for both parties. This is the first time the hostage crisis got this bad. Got so bad that many serious economic voices, including prominent republicans in this town went really hard house republicans. What did the debt ceiling does is deal with the spending decisions congress has already made, both parties. There were some republicans that were really bad and irresponsible and some that tried to walk it back from the brink, including a lot of republican cituents. The problem here is what you aring is the most irresponsible type of approach to an election, threatening to do bad things to the economy and the country. During a recession in order to get your political outcome. 
>> A slight thing on the framing also. Somehow one policy or another will avert a rece 
>> that's kind of naive. We hav 222 years of business cycle history for the united states. We have had 47 recessions. None of them were welcome. All of them people tried to avoid. The idea that one policy or another will push a reception off indefinitely is also naive or that if a certain policy will bring one on. It doesn't work that way. 
>> Or one politician versus another one. 
>> I have to disagree with this a little business. Government policy can exacerbate recess. Look what's happening in great britain. They are going into a double dip reception. If you look at policies, mitt romney, the first thing that mitt romney and paul ryan are going to do is adopt a budget that is going to taney out of the economy, take it from seniors and they support a variety of proposals. It is not like you can't have a double dip recession. 

[00:49:23]


>> I am agreeing that it is probably more likely than anyone here may admit. 
>> It may not be easy to drag it out. 
>> The government can make it happen. 
>> Let's stay on the sub. I want you to talk about that stimulative impact of government versus this possibility of austerity creating this recession. I also want to talk about the other thing that mitt romney just might send us back to I he really gets a chance when we come back. classic stouffer's starts with ground beef, unions, and peppers baked in a ketchup glaze with savory gravy and mashed russet potatoes.

>>> We are awaiting president obama's campaign appearance in ohio. We have been discussing what a romney administration woul look like should he win. I need a little disclaimer for the church crowd that believes he can speak things into being. I am not trying to manifest a romney win. I think we better know what we are facing. Here is a new ad that the obama campaign has put out just on the web. It hints at just how bad a romney white house could be for some of us. 

[00:53:43]


>> Back in washington, the supreme court decided it would hear arguments in a case as a vehicle for reversing roe v. Wade which they say is all but certain in the wake of president nominee joining the high court. The ad goes on for about three minutes. It is kind of this fake news report of what 100 days into a romney presidency looks like. It includes the massive deficit but also the possible overturn of roe v. Wade, the end of epa, all of these other kind of social issues, the social security voucher system. Realistically, presidents don't ve complete control over the economy despite the fact that retro voters hd them accountable. He is going to put someone on the supreme court. He has indicated that would be someone that would overturn roe v. Wade. He hasdicated he wants to cut taxes. Katon, did you want to? 
>> Certainly, I do. When we talk about 1300 days, let's talk abouthe last four years. At the end of the day, this election and what's happened this week and happened this morning is this storm and hurricane has taken libya off the table. It has taken the 23 million people out of work off the table. It has taken 46 million people on food stamps right before the table right before an election. That's the political frame of what's going on here. 
>> In the last four years. 
>> Our base is motivated out there and so is the base of the president on the supreme court justices. I've always said, turn out. We don't have to worry about our bases. They are showing, 23% of america has already voted. A lot of people cast the vote before the storm came up. This election is hinging in the balance. Ohio certainly. 
>> I don't want to miss. In the last four years, I have not at any point lost my right to choose or use health insurance to cover birth control pills. Those are very real issues on the table right now. 

[00:55:51]


>> I first want to just touch on some of the issues you mentioned which is that this is a great example. 23 million people around unemployed. This is something that mitt romney says. It is not true. We have an underemployment problem. The truth is, if you compare the last four, we have 5.6 million private sector jobs that beats the record of the previous eight years. We have business cycle challenges and growth challenges. We should continue to work on those. We are facing a choice in this election, which is what to do over the next four years. The challenge is mitt romney has adopted policies that are unfortunately to the right of where george bush was on tax policy. He is a more conservative tax policy at this point than george bush did. So that's the choice that people face. It is true. I think people should vote on issues like choice because the reason why we have women engaged so much in this election, is because republicansade issues like contraception controversial. Young women who have not been motivated to vote are voting, because they never thought birth control would be a political issue. That happened because republicans attacked it, not democrats. 
>> I absolutely agree with you on why women matter. That's why we are doing a whole special at 6:00 tonight on exactly this issue of why women matter. Coming up, the slow and steady comeback of the u.S. Economy. There is some undeniable evidence that there is a roux he coverry. Is it enough? What is next? That's what we come back. have need?

>>> Welcome back. We are awaiting president obama in ohio. We will take you there when the president is on the stage. 
>>> Three days before the election, the candidates are going in hard and making their closing economic arguments to the american people in light of the latest jobs numbers reports. 
>>> We could argue until we are blue in the fes about what voters care about most but the economy has been undeniably and is going to continue to be the dominant issue of this election. The latest jobs report that while the unemployment rate had an uptick from 7.8% to 7.9%, total nonfarm payroll increased by 171,000 jobs in october. For president obama, the glass is half full. 
>> Today, our businesses have created nearly 5.5 new jobs. This morning, we learned that companies hired more workers in october than at any time in the last eight months. 
>> Yes, progress u president obama has been slownd sometimes frustratingly so but it has been steady. There has been progress. Still, for mitt romney, the glass is half empty. 
>> He said he was going to lower unemployment rate down to 5.2% right now. Today, we learned that it is actually 7.9% and that's 9 million jobs short of what he promised. Unemployment is higher today than when barack obama took office. 
>> If you haven't heard by now, and I can't imagine how you haven't heard by now, in regards to what mitt romney says he is going to actually do, he has got a five-point plan for you. 

[01:02:15]


>> People across the country are responding to our five-part plan to create jobs. Part one, as you know, is about taking full advantage of our energy resources. Second, I'm going to move to boost trade, especially with latin america. Third, I am going to send to congress the retraining reform act. To make sure every worker can get the skills and chance for a good-paying job. Fourth, I will move to can tale out of control spending. I am going to act to boost small business an all business. 
>> What the american people will have to decide on tuesday is whether it is worth it to stay the course or choose an unknown path. Big on problem. Shore on specifics. In 2008, we as an electorate decid the change was good, given crisis averted and progress made since then, is it the right course now. To paraphrase, don't change horses in mid stream. Back to my panel. Ari, you have made the argument before, that being a businessman is not the same thing as being a good adviser to the economy or leader to the economy in a government role. Is that what we are seeing, a mismatch? 
>> That is a problem for mitt romney. This is the republicans best argunt, reality based, identifying a problem that we are all experiencing. It is a very real problem. It is not one the president can dispute. It is their best argument. John dewey always said, a problem well-stated is a problem half-solved. We do agree, we must agree that the jobs crisis is one of the core policy choices of the era we are live willing in and perhaps for some time. That's number one. Number two goes back to the segment we just did on romney. What does the romney era look like? There, I have to echo neera. What is your solution to the problem? You just played the five points. They do not deal with domestic spending in a way that most economists think will jump-start jobs. Republicans have some economists and studies on their side. There are studies out that show what the republicans have managed to do with the power they are wielding has actually raised unemployment by a full point. That's many, many jobs because of the crackdown on all these state governments. 

[01:04:38]


>> Let's look at exactly that. This is just point about what government does, can, in fact, make a difference in our economy. When you look at these public versus private sector jobs, to the extent this has been modest growth, it is mostly modest. We are constantly offsetting growth in the private sector with a decrease in the public. The idea that governor doesn't create jobs, if only republican governors would allow these jobs to stay and be created, we would be seeing a morrow bust growth. 
>> We would have 700,000 more jobs. The unemployment rate would be much lower if we hadn't had all these cuts over that's last couple of years from the private sector, from the public seor. When we are looking at these issues, we shod really look at not just public sector versus private sector, I am happy to say private sector jobs is a good measure for us. What challenges the romney/ryan budget is something that would cut jobs. When you are taking that much money out of the economy, when you are cutting programs across the board, that does have affect. If you cut people's ability to pay rent, then they have -- it has a negative consequence on the economy. 
>> This is really the key of what's going on right now. It is somewhat unusual. Now, what a down turn is, what a business cycle downturn is, it is not about gdp. It is about production, it is about jo, which is still growing but underwhelming. It is about income and it is about sales. When we look -- 
>> because we are a consumer-driven economy. 
>> We are consumer driven. These are things that tell you where you are in the business cycle. How much are you producing, how many people are working, how much are they making and how much are they buying? These four things tog, we can look at them. It is hard to measure them so they get revised a lot. 
>> Sure,sure. 
>> Things get moved around. Right now, when you look at those four things, what you see is that you've got ease in three out of four. The only one bucking the trend at the moment is jobs. So the problem is they tend to move together when you look at these patterns. The thing is, what are the patterns here? Then, when we talk about all these other policies and different expansions, you had an eight-year expansion with reagan, a ten-year expansion with clinton, very different policies. We had an almost seven-year expansion with bush. Here we are 3 1/2 years and what it tells us is that the length of these expansions is getting shorter, not because of any particular policy that's a pattern that is going on now, which is something that troubles us here at home. It is something that troubles developed economies. This is a serious policy issue, which is going to basically have to deal with high unemployment almost no matter what. 

[01:07:41]


>> It can't be addressed simply by saying, china, you are behaving badly. We are in a global crisis. 
>> You a talking about turning the titanic. 
>> As I listen to you, I'm feeling a little bit of the angst that many of us felt in 2008. 
>> It is not that bad. 
>> I have been walking around for a month with this article, "the new york times" on october 2nd of 2012. It is bob draper with the mitt romney who might have been. It is this claim in this reporting that romney was in the ROOM ALONG WITH john McCain when they were getting the reporting. This is p as bad as we can imagine it being. It wasfusing and complicated. He, like everyone else, found it confusing and tough. More than anything, part of what I am yearning for from the republicans, katon, is the sense of complexity. It is hard work. There is not one single policy that impacts such a complex economy. 
>> There is not one single party that is going to get it . 
>> I think you just framed the election for me and a lot of other people. How big do we want our government to be? You talk about increasing jobs. How big of a government can we afford. 
>> If it is teachers, I would like it to be very big. 
>> I have my sister back home that would like that also. My point is, this is the choice america is making. How big of a governme, not do we want but can which afford? That gets to a liberty versus conservative argument. Policies and all this other stuff gets stuff in the weeds. Do we want more government jobs? That becomes a real thing. 
>> You do. I'm sure I don't. I want more private sector small business opportunities and entrepreneurs that have a chance to live the american dream. 

[01:09:44]


>> This is the great irony. If you look at private versus public sector jobs, we just talked about the expansion in the bush years, as you know, that came from government spending. All the jobrowth for the first six years -- let me just answer you. All the job growth essentially from 2000 to 2006 was public sector jobs. It was a giant expansion of t government. You have inverted. President obama has increased private sector jobs. We have lost public sector jobs. His proposals aren't about expanding the government. His proposals are actually insuring that middle class families have what they need to grow. 
>> When we come back, we are going to talk about one sector of the private sector in particular that has been an important part of our politics. That is the car. We are going to take our focus to the battle for the auto vote in ohio. The latest whopper that mitt romney is using to curry favor. boost. Flavor boost, meet beef. It's swanson flavor boost.

>>> welcome back. We are here in democracy plaza, me of nbc's 2012 coverage. Thousands will ther here on election night. The skating ring will hold a map of the united states with states icing over in red and blue. We are going to have red and blue banners that will rise up in front of the building as each campaign climbs towards 270. Why 270? That's how many electoral college votes you need to be president. Right now, the key one is ohio, which is why we are going to talk about mitt romney's closing argument for the auto industry. He says he is going to be better than president obama. 
>> Who will do more for the auto industry not barack obama. Fact checkers confirm his attacks on mitt romney are false much the truth, mitt romney has a plan to help the auto industry. He is supported by lee iacocca and the detroit news. Obama took gm and chrysler into bankruptcy and sold chrysler to italians that are going to build jeeps in china. 
>> Romney's new ad running in ohio claims that president obama took gm and chrysler into bankruptcy. Interesting. Because romney preferred a managed bankruptcy for the car companies. He claimed that jeeps are going to be built in china by italians. The ceo of chrysler found that whopper too much to bear and issued a statement to say, . 
>> Who will be best for the auto industry? It may not be the guy whose car ad is full of holes. Joining me from detroit is jonathan cone. 
>> Thanks for having me on. When we talk cars, I get out my transformers and have this whole thing about president obama being ptimist prime. Is the car issues going to be the thing that turns ohio voters? 

[01:16:28]


>> It is a huge issue. In ohio, 1 of every 8 jobs is tied to the auto industry. The voters there, they understand how important the auto rescue, the obama's decision to provide chrysler and g.M. Loans. They know how important that was. People forget now but 2008, 2009 when g.M. And chrysler were on the verge of collapse, the idea of saving them. It was not very popular. Th voters were tired of bailouts. A lot of democrats were saying, the auto industry, it has all kinds of problems. It is just not worth saving. 
>> Whi is how you end up with mitt romney saying, let detroit go bankrupt. At that time, he is going with public sentiment, go ahead, let detroit go bankrupt. 
>> Exactly. He was sort of riding the wave at that time. We have seen from mitt romney, he has an acute sense of what he thinks voters want to hear. He gives them that. He was saying, look, let's let them go. I think the voters of ohio understand that president obama said I am not going to let this backbone of american manufacturing collapse. I am not going to let 1 million people lose their jobs. I think the voters of ohio, the voters of michigan, I think they remember that. I think they say, look, this is a president who cares about us. He is a president who understands ho our economy works and he is a president who when it was tough, when it was unpopular, when everybody was against this, he stood up for us. That's not just a policy judgment. It hits at an emotional level that this is a guy that cares about us. That helps explain why even when president obama's poll numbers after that denver debate, they were looking a little shaky. They held up pretty well in ohio. You look a it and think, that has got to be the auto rescue. 
>> The lates nbc marist poll is showing that the president is holding a fairly sizeable lead in ohio, a six points at this point. Most folks are indicating that's because he has a better margin with white male voters in ohio than he does anywhere else in the country at this time. That's probably related to the cars. I want to bring in ari melber for a moment. We were chatting about this before. This is time when maybe progress sives are down with a corporation spending money on political ads. 

[01:18:52]


>> We have had a lot of talk about speech and corporate personhood and these interesting doctrinal questions. If you want to say corporations shouldn't have the free speech and spending rights that others have, you wouldn't have them able to come out and robustly engage in the political process. They are free under current law to speak close to an election which was restricted under McCAIN FINE GOLD AND WAS WIPED Out under the supreme court. That is not always bad in the same way that when michael moore speaks, he speaks through the mere an height corporation to make 911. 
>> The value is that they are speaking about something they have deep knowledge, because it is about themselves. 
>> Absolutely. I support and on record for public finan and the fair elections now bill in the senate. When we go a step further beyond public financing, this is a good example where more speech is good for the political process. 
>> It fact chcks romney in this case. 
>> There was nothing that wouldn't have allowed sergio marchiaonni to issue a statement. 
>> If ey wanted to do anything like run a full page which corporations have done, if they felt that because they were g attacked on tv, they wanted to respond on tv, they are free to do that. 
>> They are not doing that. 
>> He ran the op ed in the paper, right? If he wanted to buy that space, that's aery f grain distinction. My point is, they are freer to speak morrow bustly. 
>> Just on the broader issue, i think you learn a lot about campaigns and what's moving by both sides. Clearly, when mitt romney runs a g-bad like that, it is clearly false. He knows the auto industry is clearly hurting him and he has to go on offense. This goes to jonathan's point. We know the auto bailout is a big issue in ohio because of mitt romney's ads. The problem for him is that it's a challenge to d a demonstrably false ad. There is a negative consequence to this. When you do an ad like this, you get days and days of newspapers attacking you. 

[01:21:18]


>> Pinocchio stands on fire, all of that thing. 
>> You have cleveland and cincinnati papers, front page articles saying he is not telling the truth about this. It has been a high-risk strategy. I don't know if ohio has gone from 3 to 6 as the polls seem to indicate. I think the risk he took in being dishonwas a bad risk for him to take. 
>> What is it that you are hearing personally on the ground in the midwest right now? 
>> Well, you know, you talk to people and, you know, again, i think it is a question of who they think will stand up for them? They look at a guy like mitt romney. He is running around saying, hey, I'm from michigan. I'm a car guy. Well, yeah, he is a car guy. His dad owned the car company. Being a car guy means understanding what it is like to work in a factory. It means understanding what people who are looking at their jobs and wondering if they are really going to go overseas, what that feels like. I think that's one of the ironies here, is that by raising this, something so obviously false, he scared the bejeezus out of people. I think people don't like that. It is funny. He cites in his ad the detroit news. They did endorse him. People think he is using them as a political pawn. 
>> The 47% does n like to have the bejeezus scared out of us. Thank you to jonathan cohn in michigan. 
>>> Up next, what warning we should take from sandy for our future. 
>>> Tune in for why women matter at 6:00 p.M. Eastern. You are not going to want to miss it. feeling skin. 
[ Designer ] ENOUGH OF JUST COVERING UP My moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. I decided enough is enough. ?????? ?????? 

[01:23:20]


[ Spa Lady ] I STARTED ENBREL. It's clinically proven to provide clearer skin. 
[ RV Guy ] ENBREL MAY NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE 
-- and may not cleayou completely, but for many, it gets skin clearer fast, within 2 months, and keeps it clearer up to 9 months. 
[ Male Announcer ] BECAUSE ENBREL????, ETANERCEPT, Suppresses your immune system, it may lower your ability to f infections. Serious, sometimes fatal, events including infections, tuberculosis, lymphoma, other cancers, and nervous system and blood disorders have occurre before starting enbrel, your doctor should test you for tuberculosis and discuss whether you've been to a region where certain fungal infections are common. Don't start enbrel ihave an infection like the flu. Tell your doctor if you're prone to infections, have cuts or sores, have had hepatitis b, have been treated for heart failure, or if, while on enbrel, you experience persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, or paleness. If you've had enough, ask your dermatologist about enbrel. 

[01:26:23]


>>> I also want to thank the president who granted a request we made which will increase people's food stamp allocation by 50%. Let's give the president a round of applause for that. 
>>> That was new york governor, andrew cuomo, speaking earlier this morning at the national guard food distribution site for victims of hurricane sandy. It is the most recent reminder that the greatest economic closing arguments that candidates can make is how they are going to prepare for the future. Lakshman, you have been saying earlier, here is a moment in disaster relief. As much as republicans have hammered on food stamps. Here it is, this isng to feed hungry people. 
>> To the broader point. Can government step in and make a difference to the shape of the business cycle, absolutely. So during the great recession, you saw the former president obama -- bush. He had a bailout. The business cycle overwhelmed it. You had rate cuts going on out of the federal rerve. Obama continued that kind of intervention and specifically here with autos we were just talking about. That's a strategic issue for the nation. Lots of countries want to build cars. It is important for us to be able to do it too. These were all really critical interventions that probably it is hard to prove it counter-factual but probably kept the great recession from being something worse. 
>> This point of it being hard to count it counter fak u, yes, I know things are bad but, boy, they could have been terrible. Sandy is sort of a reminder. This is how bad things can be. In this case, here you have a governor saying, thank you, mr. President for increasing access to food stamps. Now, he is in war. People have more food stamps. The difference is this is a national tragedy. 

[01:28:27]


>> The presidential power of the purse. He is able to give money away. Whether it is right, wrong, or indifferent, I am not going to eliminate that pain. I don't think you will see that as an issue they increased it. It is an isue we have 314 million americans and 46 million are using food stamps to help supplement. This is just math. The dignity that's involved in trying to get a job. We are talking about, is this election going to be about jobs or about camouflage? 
>> Let's push on that. You say, this is a national tragedy. In this case, the extension of food subsidy benefits is not something that is likely to become a partisan political issue. The very fact that we are coming out of a part of the business cycle where we had this deep recession where people were hungry feels to me like from the very beginning, how do we define disaster. That was a disaster. The president needed to make available greater access to food. 
>> What was going on isn't over. 
>> This election is going to solve it. We are going to elect somebody and we will move forward, move backward, lean forward or get crossed. 
>> This is something that's been going on for a quarter century. A lot of us are framed by what remember the economy was in the lastouple of decades. Ihink that is history. We are not there. We have left that. We are not in kansas anymore. 
>> THE '90s ARE DONE. 
>> We are in a different world. A global world, a competitive world. You need to figure out how policywise from both side, how are you going to change that growth pattern? On one hand, something with taxes. On the other hand, something with spending. If you don't figure that out. If we don't figure that out, we have a long time of unemployment cycling around at high levels. 

[01:30:28]


>> I want my government to intervene in those. 
>> I have to say, these arguments that food stamps have gone up and we have unemployment, you are absolutely right. We are still dealing with the aftermath of the great recession. What was the great recession. It was a decision. It was affected by decisions by the government to deregulate and let things go in a way that many people around wall street now would recognize was wrong. 
>> A couple of big bubbles. You had a tech bubble followed by housing. 
>> The hoububble was if you listen to republicans par as well. 
>> This whole conversation about the food stamps increasing and unemployment increasing and things aren't good enough, republicans got us into this mess. They did. George bush wasn't doing what he needed to do and the accusation against president obama is that he hasn't fixed it fast enough. 
>> The voter have the tolerance to keep waiting? Does this voter -- 
>> we are not going to have much longer. This tuesday is election day.

>>> Next week as voting age adults cast a ballot, many of our fellow citizens, under 18 will pretend to vote in mock elections. Students will be engaging in a kind of make-believe that often passes for real education. Students understanding of themselves as citizens is grounded in the mythical stories that we tell ourselves. They are myths that begin wit in 1492, columbus sailed the ocean blue and tell how the pilgrims and indians gave thanks for a bountiful harvest over a turkey dinner but none of the lessons prepare students to deal with the duty which they will be charged with as american adults, how to become responsible citizens. Joining my p is seth andrew, founder and superintendent of democracy prep, public scols. I want to move our conversation a little bit. This close to the election, what I want to talk about as a teacher is not just what's going to happen in this election but what's going to happen going forward. When I was looking at these tests of national civic knowledge, I was completely freaked out. May of 2011, fewer than 5% are demonstrating advanced levels of knowledge. What kind of social studies are we teaching? 
>> We have a crisis when we think of the actual knowledge of our eltorate. We have kids that get out of school and they can't determine truth from lies. We have to rethink civic education in america in a dramatic way. We think about civic knowledge often and what it takes to build civic knowledge. We need to be creating civic dispositions. The habits of individuals coming out of school who actually know what it takes to be a good citizen and become engaged in civic life for the rest of their lives. 

[01:37:11]


>> Is one of the reasons we have trouble telling the difference between myth and fact or between good arguments and poor ones about our civic culture? Because we lie to kids so much early on, on the one hand, I get that you need to know the story first before you can deconstruct it. You need to know the columbus story before you can go back and say, that's not h it went down. Abraham lincoln freed the sves but not quite. Do we just teach the lies and the myth and it is easy for a politician to repeat those myths later. 
>> Let's start with this. We have to teach kids to read. Our public schools are in a similar crisis. Our students are not able to read or think critically at the foundation. If you take the lies and the history books that may or may not be correctly based on the reality of history or skewed in one way or another or put together by a text book publisher, you are not looking at the core issues. What we have tried to do is say, let's get to the core issues. How do we build kids that critical thinkers and readers and look at issues and deconstruct them and understand the negatives of any individual case that is being made in the public realm and make their own cases? We work hard to build those civic dispositions and then turn to authentic skills. If you have the dispositions and the skills you need to be a good citizen, the knowledge is easy to attain. If you can read, you can understand what you need to learn about history. That's something we are focused on in all the wrong directions. 
>> It is interesting you mak this point. I was looking at the fact that g brewer after hb-1081 which stripped the arizona schools of ethnic solidarity courses, african-american history and latino history. The democracy prep is a predominantly african-american school in harlem. Is there a way as your trying to get young people involved for helping them get that critical world view on their own nation. 

[01:39:11]


>> People use it is as an excuse. We have a black president. You can't say, I can't relate to politics because there aren't people like me in office. There are now. The quon is the quality of our public schools. With our kids, we try to focus onreally early. So they can say, how can i become an engaged citizen when I'm an adult? Kids are out doing, get out to vote campaigns. They are out there doing a campaign called, I can't vote but you can. You will see them in harlem with their bright yellow shirt saying, I can't vote. They want to let people know, today is election day. 40% of americans are not going to turn out on tuesday despite all that we are talking about. 
>> I am going to bring the rest of my panel back in as soon as we come back. As we go to break, I want you to take a look at seth's kids from democracy prep harlem campus teaching all of us about civil responsibility. ???????????? 

[01:43:54]


>>> welcome back. We have been discussing the content of what we teach our children to help them grow up to be constructive and productive citizens on democracy. Has high-stake testing killed social studies? Are you making a claim that the testing is the most important? I keep thinking I think politics is fascinating. How can they know so little? 
>> I think performance pressure on teachers sets up really weird incentives. We don't want teachers to be productivity machines. I believe as much about the 10% as the top 10%. The testing from no child left behind is concerning to a lot of us. I didn't know what you were doing. I always learn something watching melissa harris-perry. One of the programs that jumped out is there is a lot of stupidity in how our elite deals with polics. After the health care, a lot of the coverage was, how are people reacting? There were a lot of polls, did people support or oppose the health care opinion? I'm not talking about politics but how people felt about a decisi of the supreme court that was going to become law of the land. There was one poll that asked people, hey, what did the supreme court do? 
>> I don't know. 
>> It was the most widely covered decision according to media metrics since bush v. Gore? What they found was 45% of adults had no idea what the court did. Those numbers broke down into a majority of those people, thought they knew what the court did and said they opposed it. A smaller plurality said they didn't know. How much of the top down larger discourse that we have that treats politics as a game and a sport and a predictive project rather civics. 

[01:45:57]


>> We forget the purpose of our public hools, to educate citizens for our democracy, to prepare people so they can fu at our democracy. As you are indicating and as all the polls show and the research data show, we have done a terrible job of doing that. The majority of americans can't handle the basic civic truths of our life today. We have to stop and rethink what civic education looks like across the country in every school across the country. We have to say, what we are doing isn't working? We have to stop and reset. 
>> In one of t few places where dems and republicans have managed to find common ground has been around education reform. 
>> A lot of it makes my teeth itch in the back. There is a place that's been common ground. When you hear these stories, how does it resonate with what yo are seeing in south carolina? 
>> The constitution was a big deal in the primaries. We saw people starting to carry a constitution. My little sister, who is a public school teacher and now works at a private school, talk civics for about 17 years and the constitution and how importan is to the develot of a child. Back to education, that's my criticism from this election cycle from both candidates. We have heard very little on education. All about jobs, all about food stamps. Education is getting ready to change drastically. I work for a school in ohio that educates 15,000 kids that never go into bricks and mortar. The largest gating class in americine learning. This is coming and coming at 100 miles an hour to help people that don't have people. 
>> Yet it is interesting. Asome point, I promise you and i are going to have a conversation about that online learning. Seth's democracy prep feels like the sort of thing that can't happen online. I feel like there are all kinds of skills that you can pick up. Part of what happens when you are sitting in a classroom with your friends singing, vote for obama or vote for romney, is a different kind of experience. 

[01:48:02]


>> They could handle any kind of educational tool that you put in that? 
>> They I they have great teaches. 
>> New technology helps us in harlem or whether it helps us in hilton head, south carolina. This presidential race has been devoid of big ideas on edation. On both sides. 
>> The one thing I would say, i do think we can have a technological revolution on teaching. It isn't actually the case there hasn't been any discussing about teaching. There hasn't been enough. The facts are that mitt romney does have an education proposal. It is a very radical educational proposal. He proposes title one into a voucher program. That would dramatically undermine most have o our pib lick schools. He did that in the primary or towards the end of the primary. The president tried to make it more of an issue in the debates. It is one where when you are talking about what we need to do to compete over the 21st century, education is the area. We are in a global competition for having a high school workforce and not taking those resources out of the high school isn't the right thing. 
>> There was this point in the middle of the foreign policy debate where they began to have an education conversation. That was like, what is happening. Up next, there are more than 25 million foot soldiers who are going to get a special shoutout from mhp.Ou are one of the millions of men WHO HAVE USED AndroGel 1%, There's big news.

=======================================================

Good evening. A harris-perry. I'm kog to you from our studio in democracy plaza right here in new york city. The last time we were here, not here, that was this morning, but here on the cusp of an election, we reached the culmination of an extraordinary year. Not because our country was about to elect the first african-american president. We must remember 2008 was a year a woman almost won the democratic nom face for president of the united states. And though some of us may want to for get sarah palin her place as the first ever woman in the vp slot on the republican ticket represents another historic milestone for women that year. In 2008 nancy pelosi was making history as the first woman to serve as speaker of the house. Four women, 2008 felt like a moment. I mean, president obama may have been the reason that there was no president hillary clinton, but he was also the reason that the united states has been repped on the world stage for the past four years by secretary of state hillary clinton. And president obama nominated elaine that kagan and sonya sotomayor to the supreme court. One-third of the judicial seats in the highest court of the land are occupied by women. And it was all made possible because of the way women were most politically potent in 2008, at the ballot box. In 2008 then senator obama won a decisiveictory against john McCAIN AMONG WOMEN BY A WHOPPING 13-point margin. Among men, by a shriver. Just a single point. There seemed there was no stopping women's political momentum until we ran smack-dab into 2010. And the tea party poured into congress. There wasn't just a full stop but more like a full reversal in women's political prospects. The 2010 mid-term year was the first time in more than 30 years that women not only failed to gain seats but actually lost seats in the house of representatives. The tea party's ideological take over of congress also brought with it a regressive social agenda, wrapped inside a trojan horse of economic reform that has left us where we find ourselves today, facing an unprecedented legislative erosion of reproductive rights at the state and federal level. We find ourselves almost unable to go a week without women being treated like children who can't be trusted to make sound decisions abou our own lives and bodies. Most recently, the misinformed manplaining about rape, health, and abortion. 

[00:02:42]


>> Life is a gift from god, and I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that god intended to happen. 
>> There's no such exception as life of the mother. Health of the mother has been -- has become a tool for abortions any time under any reason. 
>> If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. 
>> Now, though the verbal attacks are only the most noticeable of the assaults against women's bodies, far more damaging are the policy punches that you don't even see. 2011 was a record-breaking year for attacks against reproductive rights with 127 abortion restrictions approved and 38 enacted by this time last year. Add to that number the 76 abortion restrictions approved and 9 enacted in states across the country so far in 2012. We have seen reproductive rights nearly eliminated in the state of mississippi. And virginia's legislators attempted to enact what amounts to a state sensed sexually assaulted with trans vaginal ultrasounds. And violence against women act being held hostage by republican lawmakers to use as a legislative bargaining chip, if there was any one picture that fully encapsulated the absurdity of men speaking for and about women in 2012, it must be this. Darrell issa's panel of five men testifying on a hearing about insurers and employers providing coverage for contraception. More on that in a moment, but as we move into the finish line in this race, mitt romney may be moving to the middle but he is carrying with him a social agenda for women that swings so far to the right he barely is on the track. And according to recent poll, almost half of the elections most crucial, women voters, are running right behind him. You see, a "usa today" gallop poll found that governor romney pulled within one point of president obama among women who are likely voters in battleground states spop when you look even closer at the supposed coalition of women supporting president obama you find that they're not necessarily coalescing and their gender. In 2008 president obama's largest base of supporters were african-american women. His supporters were also latin thats, young women, same-same-sex loving women, women who have travelled the many roads that lead to the intersection where our identities meet. What matters most is that women show up for ourselves because, as we've seen over the last year, if we don't, there are those who will be happy to show up for us. The importance of showing up even when the door gets slammed in your face wasn't lost on the woman who is with me today. She is a face who was missing from that congressional hearing, sandra fluk, women's health care advocate and graduate from georgetown university. She joins me with karen finney, msnbc political analyst, columnist for "the hill" and victoria, nbc latino contributor, fellow at the lbj school at the university of texas and director of communication for latino divisions, and joy reid, msnbc contributor and managing editor for "the gri.Com." Senator, let me ask you, were you surprised to find yourself in the middle of the 2012 election cycle in the this way? 

[00:06:04]


>> Yes, it was definitely not what I had planned for 2012. 
>> You had other things on your mind. 
>> I did. 
>> Talk to me, at the point in which you made the decision to go and testify before congress, it's a big moment for a young woman, what were your policy thoughts at that point? 
>> I was really concerned about what we were seeing in the national conversation at that point about the affordable care act, contraception, specifically, we were learning a lot about religious liberty but we weren't hearing about women and we weren't hearing about women' lives, we certainly weren't hearing about students who are most effected, perhaps, by this policy. So that was recally where our focus was on students on trying to broaden the conversation and have it be about the women who impacted by that policy. 
>> Your story, it's the moment when you are attacked and you are attacked by conservative talk show host rush limbaugh, people say, wait a minute, this has gone beyond a difference of opinion, this is an attack on a young woman. You start to see women galvanizing around that no matter what their policy positions. When I look at the polls, haven't we lost that just that quickly, it goes from being just about you instead of being about all of us? 
>> Well, I think that what that symbolizes is that this is not a fight that is easily won. This is a long-term effort that we are going to have to continue to engage in to create broad social change and to really eliminate masogony from our culture. If you look at unmarried women in the likely voters unmarried in the battleground states, there's a 25-point gender gap among those women. Those are young women and they are the future of the electorate and they are going to make a difference. 
>> This point, exactly, when you take apart the women's numbers it looked like there are groups of women, again, at the intersectional identities who absolutely get it and others who don't. Is it shocking for you, I mean, you were there in 2008. Eel like, okay, maybe we didn't get a woman president but we are on our way and where we are now. 

[00:08:08]


>> I think that's what was part of what was so wonderful this last year and the conversation. I'm not sure I buy into the gallup numbers. It's not just what happened with sandra this is where the republicans completely miscalculated. It was the susan g. Komen stuff where women said, time-out. This is our health. This is not for politics. Also, the tone and tenor and lack of respect and the nature of the conversation that was happening, not just at the federal level but at the state level saying, you know those shifty women, they'll use rape as a loophole if we let them. I think women were really offended and felt like, wait a second, if you can't trust me to make these decisions how do you know you really trust me as secretary of state or as a ceo. I actually think that women have -- look at the waitress moms the president has a huge advantage because for women these issues, we're integrated. It's all integrated. It's economic, it's social, it's our civil rights. I think women take a different view. As sandra was saying, though, there is that gap between married women and what I prefer to say as unmarried women other than single women. Some of us are a little older and not married. There's 52 million unmarried women. They break overwhelmingly for president obama. So I do think that in these broader numbers, some of those distinctions get lost and most important group for president obama, black women voted for him. 
>> Right, who are the single largest group in terms of turnout in 2008. Victoria, I was wdering a little bit about this idea of what does it take to create a multi-racial cross class, close enter generational women's coalition? On the one hand, we're not all the same. Having ovaries or at one point having ovaries, not even get spoog the biology of it all. But that ane doesn't give you shared political interests, but it is sometimes surprising to see how different those opinions are depending on what sort of woman we're talking about. 
>> Absolutely. Speaking in terms of the latino electorate, we know that a lot of latinos are catholics. Among catholicism is where we see a break against abortion. This is where we need to think about women's issues at large. We do care about reproductive rights. That is one base of coordination but also the economyecause women of color were the hardest hit during this recession. And we need to reach out to color in terms of latinos in particular, also immigration. So in terms of reaching the women, getting the women's vote, it's not just about the ovaries. It's about immigration, it's about civil rights, it's about the economy, it's about all of these different issues and bundling it to the. You can't win on one issue alone. 

[00:10:41]


>> I feel like we could show you political science data saying women tend to do better when a democrat is in office on all of these things. Are the democrats making the argument they need to make to these broad group of women? 
>> Republicans had a very specific strategy this year which is try to force white voters, including married white women, to really choose more an ethnicity and more their class and not pay attention to issues that would be considered women's issues. But what I think is interesting is how few republican women have been out front. Youu showed all those clips. Very few republican women, including white republican women, had been willing to do the vanguard for these issues about gender. Specifically about women. And they haven't been able to sort of create a coalition of republican women who will argue this. I think they're even offended by it. The republicans have been successful at least in cleving off a certain percentage of married women. But I question whether or not those polls are going to be sort of played out on election day the same way. I think a lot of women privately, including republican women, are deeply offended by the say sandra was treated by rush limbaugh. 
>> The whole foods moms who fiscally may go with romney but they think about their daughters and they say the hard turn to the right and maybe they're going to cross that line. 
>> Sandra, you started your year thinking it was just going to a congressle testimony, as big as that was. You ended up at the dnc. Before we go to our first break, tell me, if there was sort of one thing that you wanted to say to women voters in this moment, even beyond the issue of which presidential candidate, what is it that you see as that sort of tu chur thing that women voters ought to be thinking about? 
>> That it's time to make our voices heard. Make our voices heard this tuesday and make our voices heard in increasingly running for office after this tuesday. Because right now I'm focused on what comes next. I'm focused on what we owe women in this country after we talked so much about them this election cycle. It's time to deliver on their concerns in the next few years. 
>> Absolutely. So, thank you so much for joining us tonight. You know we have lots of fun playing around with different names for the show today. It's why women matter, which i think is what you articulated. I wanted women on top or ladies choice or that said, sandra fluke, thank you so much for being here. And rest are staying for more. 

[00:12:58]


>>> Up next, the body politic and why women and no one else must be the deciders about our own bodies. ??????

>>> You're wing a specialed addition of mrp. We're right here at rockefeller center in new york city. This is where we will have our election night coverage. Speaking of the election, let's be clear. Concern about reproductive rights and access is not a distraction from real issues. Women's health, educal opportunities, and economic equality are directly related to unfettered safe accs to birth control and abortion. In countries where women control their own fertility, they are more educated, less poor, and more likely to be engaged politically. But mitt romney prefer that supreme court kol women's choices. He would like to see rowe v. Wade overturned. President obama, on the other hand, has never waivered in his staunch assertion that women can be trusted to make their own decisions. Joining me on my panel here is author of "big girls don't cry." First, I want to bring in my very special guest from oakland, california, democratic senator barbara boxer. Senator, it is so good for you to join us this evening. Thank you. 
>> I'm delighted. Just delighted. 
>> Senator boxer, talk to me a bit about what we saw happen in 2008 on the one hand sort of women showing up in an amazing way as secretary of state clinton has said, putting all of those cracks in the glass ceiling and then rolling back right there in congress by 2010. What do we do to get our voices back? 

[00:18:04]


>> Well, I believe we're going to have our voices back on election day. I really believe that the women are going to break for barack obama. And, you know, it isn't like these issues are hard to follow. We look at the republican platform and what does it say? It says that no abortion, no abortion, you're a criminal if you get an abortion, even in cases of rape acest. The reason I po cuss on rape is how outrageous it is, melissa. It is a crime. It's such a vicious crime in half the states there no limitation. If there's dna found 10, 20 later, you go after the perpetrator. I think women get it. Mitt romney didn't lift a finger to change that platform. He said he would be delighted to sign a bill that overturns rowe v. Wade. He wants to get rid of planned parenthood. He's standing by richard murdoch who basically says somehow god is involved in a pe. 
>> Right. 
>> I just think women will come home to the democrats on election day. 
>> So, senator boxer, let me ask you this, becae the most lasting decision a president makes, the one that follows long after he or she is out of office are those appointments to the supreme court. 
>> Right. 
>> When we expect given the age of some of our justices that the next president, whether it's a re-elected president obama or, goodness help us, a president romney will get to make at least one, possibly two, nominations to this court. You're in the senate. What can folks in the senate do if you are, in fact, faced with someone who would overturn row v. Wade? 
>> Let me just say I'm a believer that we're going to win this election. I honestly don't want to go down that path of a romney president si. I can't picture it in my mind. I don't want to. 
>> Me, neither. 
>> I'll tell you the reason why. Everything is on the line. If you're an older woman, medicare is on the line, or a man. But mostly women are on medicare. They want to end it as we know it, turn it into a voucher system. Imagine an 80-year-old man or woman having to go hunt for insurance with a voucher. This is what they want to do. I want to say something about jobs because I think all of this talk by romney and ann romney about how only thing women care about is the economy. Let's say that's true. Do you know that under barack obama's leadership we have seen more private sector jobs created in the past three months than under george w. Bush in eight years? 

[00:20:46]


>> Yes. 
>> And mitt romney wants to take us back. So I can't even envision a romney presidency, but you're absolutely right. The supreme court is critical. Everything that, you know, our constitution protects for us is at stake. 
>> Let me bring in karen here. Karen, I know that part of what president obama has done so beautifully is to make this argument that senator boxer is making there, the reproductive rights are economic rights, they are pocket book issues. 
>> Tt's absolutely right. I serve on the board of pro choice america. One of the things I know, the senator knows this, we foundou out about a year ago and gallup foundell, in battleground states, high percent sage of women, access to abortion care is higher than the economy, higher than jobs because women understand, again, that if you don't have access to birth control, if you don't have access to abortion care, those are sort of gate issues to other things. That means -- they pacts your ability to work outside the home, to care for your family. And the president has -- 
>> one of the off-sided statistics is that women who seek abortions typically, or mostly actually already have a child. It's not that they don't know. It's that they do know sort of all the resources necessary. 
>> Women know how much they pay for their contraception and they know if I have to pay for contraception, that's money not going into my family. Women know if we go back to a time when just being a wan is a pre-existing condition, which would happen if we roll back the affordable care act, they know they're going to go back to paying more for their health care. That's money they're not using to help their parents who might be older or their kids who might be in college or just getting by day to day. 
>> Rebecca, I'm convinced that part of senator boxer was saying, the romneys keep saying, oh, don't think about these other issues. They're saying like, don't vote like a girl. Go vote like a man. 
>> They are. They're trying to fell minize the issues. That minimizes them. There are all of those double-sided ads you saw a few weeks ago, those things you're hearing about mitt romney and contraception aren't right, but don't worry, we know it's not what you care about anyway, it's not important. Why are you cutting a whole ad telling me the message is wrong if they aren't important? Of course, part of what we've seen in the republican language, including the extreme stuff, the stuff about todd aiken, the or of scientifically and intellectually stuff, sandra fluke and how much you pay for your birth control is about how much sex you're having, all of this inaccurate stuff that any woman knows has nothing to do with how she lives her life and takes care of herself reflects a profound -- one of the things that has come through this language is a profound lack of thought toward what -- what women's lives are actually like, not just girl stuff, life stuff. How you take care of yourself. Thus, how you take care of your family. How you get your job and go to your job and do your job and earn your money and spend it. They haven't -- that stuff clearly, the basics of female life in this country are not understood or considered by a lot of these guys we've heard talking. 

[00:23:51]


>> Or cared about. 
>> That's part of why you see the minization of it and in a sense push women from away from it by not being so girly. 
>> If there's an agenda item or two agenda items that women should be thinking abouts they head to the polls on tuesday, what should those agenda items be? 
>> I think the over arching theme that the president talks about so beautifully, are we going to go forward with him or backwards with mitt romney? And that covers the whole panaplea of issues. The economy, we don't want to go back to the days where we were losing 800,000 jobs a month and the banks count even lend. As a matter of fact, one republican senator said at the time, maybe we have to look at nationaing the banks. That's how desperate things were then. And if you look at women's health, you've covered it really beautifully. It an economic issue. It's a privacy issue. It'u a trust issue. It's a respect issue. Any issue you look at. It's are we going to go forward or are we going to go back? Look at the issue of climate change and all the problems we're seeing now with the obvious storms of great intensity here. It's all on the line. So I say to women and men within the sound of my voice, vote, vote, vote. It's so critical. It's one of the most important elections of my letime and yours. 
>> Thank you, senator boxer. You're right, the president is on the ballot but we are on the line. 
>> Yes. 
>> I greatly appreciate that. Senator barbara boxer in california, I appreciate you joining us tonight. 
>>> Which when we come back we'll talk about what the senator was just queueing up for us there, paycheck and pocket book politics.

[00:28:52]


>>> Welcome back to mhp. You're looking at the icon anything skating rink at rockefeller center, which is now democracy plaza. We're talking about why women matter in this election. If the economy is the major issue of this election, whether you're transgender man or woman, this election effects you. Yesterday october's job numbers show 117,000 jobs added to the payroll. The women still make an average less than their male counter parts. This is quickly becoming in many ways a woman's economy. A recent study shows a majority of american women are the primary breadwinners in their homes. And forecasters predict that by 2030 the majority of women will be out-earning men. So what does this so-called female dominated economy look like, how is it run by these male candidates? Let's talk about this. If women are the primary breadwinners, what happens to women, matters to families. 
>> Mitt romney has tried to connect with people. I'm a ceo. You're the ceo of my family, we can talk the same language. He hasn't given specifics. One troubling part with me is with regards to family medical leave. This is something, that, to be honest, democrats haven't tackled is that we know that women do not get paid medical leave in this country. 178 other countries do provide that. And even within those who do get that job ptection that's unpaid, half of the folks aren't even covered under that because you have to be working under a firm of a certain size and you have to be full time in is one of the core economic issues when we're talking about women because it doesn't mesh with our workforce. 
>> It feels to me awful like part of the why the whole union busing we have seen from republican governors is also a women's issue. It's often framed as a men's working on the -- but this is like the we don't have it nationally, it's only union who gets those kinds of rights for workers. 
>> Absolutely. Just as it's no coincidence that the first piece of legislation that president obama pushed through was the lily ledbetter act. Working on issues of fair pay for women. It's no coincidence in the states -2010 was a hidden blessing. When senator boxer says she can't imagine a romney world. You don't have to imagine it. 

[00:31:13]


-- Tea party but at the state leveloff had governors go after union rights and they specifically target teachers, which is a female-dominate prod fegs. And they carve out, specifically, police officers and firefighters as they did in wisconsin where they protect the male union workers and go right after teachers. 
>> When you look at the chart about sort of initially it was men who were hit, but in the recovery, women have been recovering more slowly. And that is primarily because of the loss of public sector jobs in republican states aroun things like teachers. 
>> Remember that it's for many middle class families it is because the woman works. It's heralary that keeps them in the middle class. When romney wants to have the conversation about the economy and he wants to have this conversation about how you manage your family, and then he starts, you know, not giving a lot of details but just enough details to know that in you're in the middle class you're probably going to get screwed. Women hear, again, when we talk about medicare and the way they impact women, the way they impact a woman's economy. One of the most important things that ought to come out of this year and hopefully going into the next political cycle, women have got to vote to our numbers. There's more of us than there are of them, ladies, right? We vote in higher numbers than they do. It is time that we take our power as political power and make sure -- we didn't even get to talk about things like access to capital of some of these other economic issues. 
>> We live across the whole electoral map. 
>> I want to talk specifically about when mitt romney was -- and barack obama were asked about pay -- the issue of pay equity in the final debate. If you remember part of the answer that mitt romney got the most attention for was women but the very telling part about how he views how women work in the world was that he explained very warmly that really women's priorities when they get in the workplace is to be able do leave at 5:00 to make dinner for their family. You could feel american women -- barack obama had just referred to them as breadwinners which i was were pleased about and talked about the holistic connection between pell grants and their well-being and participation in the workforce. Mitt romney was talking about the major concern ofen in the workplace is how to get home at 5:00 to get home to cook dinner. You could feel the united states citizens going what? 

[00:33:40]


>> What I loved about that, oh, yeah, when I was first governor -- dude, you were like 50 when you were first governor. It took you that long to realize what was going on with women? 
>> In all the years when you had a private business you were not doing that. 
>> He didn't know enough women to a point to the positions that he needed to fill. 
>> Women really don't want to work in these positions. We've got to get a binder full of them to not figure it out. It's not that I don't want to go home to cook but it's missing what women's lives look like. Speaking of which let's talk about the number of women run for congress this year. It is higher than ever before. And if you want some people in washington who know what women's lives look like, send some women to washington. ?????? ?????? 
[ Male Announcer ] IT'S TIME FOR MEDICARE Open enrollment. Are you ready? Time to compare plans and see what's new. You don't have to make changes, but it's good to look. Maybe you can find better coverage, save money, or both. And check out the preventive benefits you get after the health care law. ?????? ?????? medicare open enrollment. Now's the time. Visit medicare.Gov or call 1-800-medicare. ?????? ?????? 

[00:37:42]


>>> admit it, at some point we've all said it, that size doesn't matter. But, but, it sure does. Especially when it comes to the number of women in elected office. 17 women currently serve as u.S. Senators. 73 out of 435 is the number of women who are members of the u.S. House of representatives. In total, that means that roughly 17% of the 535 seats in the 112th congress are occupied by women. If women want to change that balanchey're going to have to run for office. This year 18 women are run for the senate. That's breaking the record of 14 set in 2010. On the housesaid, 163 women could win seats. The most since 2004 when 141 women made bids. So, could this be the new year of the woman? Is that possible? 
>> Again, I think this is another hidden blessing of 2010. I think when women -- I know my daughter viewed the obsession, almost the obsession of women's health, particularly a lot of young women up and so did the sandra floouk situation where we're see that just men, all of these men telling women what to do and telling women how to live their lives and what's best for them and what rape really is. I think it did wake a lot of women up. Question is, will women vote for women. That's always been an issue in electoral politics. 
>> I think, oh, you know, what we need is women and particularly women of color. Then I think take nicky y, carol martinez, jan brewer, right, these are women who are governors. If you think of a woman president you have to ask how many womennyovernors are there because those are the kind of people you elect to become president. It makes me pause on having a woman. 
>> In 2010 we saw an overall decrease of women in congress, but we saw a regard number of republican women across the board get elected. So that's -- so we're seeing this increasing republican women. That being said and looking at the numbers who are running, democratic women are going to make a comeback. Let me be a bit of a debbie downer. I look at the numbers throughout the years and we're stuck at 18%, 19% of congress. We're 50% of the population. At the state level we're still at 24%. You know, when is that big break. IN THE '70s AND '80s WE SAW THAT Break going from the low single DIGITS INTO THE 20s. When are we going to get into THE 40s? 

[00:40:05]


>> A lot of those we need to stay in the pipeline, run for senate, running for the a.G., A we have a great woman run for attorney general which is a lot of times stepping stone to run for governor. You get that stayed wide experience biological weapon need to pay attention to the welcoming up through the ranks because we need that pipeline. 
>> Joy reid and I basically -- 
>> come on. 
>> I get frustrated because when I look at, for example, rutgers, women in politics, their women 2012, it's for women over 45. It's for the baby boomers. The list is for gub doorial races and congressional races. What about the school districts, what about the state? That's where the hole the. 
>> I tell you about the republicans that was smart in 1994, a lot of those candidates got washed out two years later. They went right back home and started running for local races. We've got to get people to do the same thing, to get iolved in that local level. 
>> Let me speak up in defense of the republican women, not individually and not their policy. I think one of the other things that matters, comes off of 2008 when we had such prominent women run for president and vice president. The image of what leadership looks like changes every time we elect a woman. The other thank I want to make an argument for, if you're looking at getting toward jebder, you want to have women to vote against just as eagerly as you want women to vote for. You don't just want to be battling the white guys. 
>> I do think that matters. 
>> You know sarah palin t way that are most careful than most folks. Both representing what your policy disagreements are. 
>> There huge. 
>> Yeah. But also pointing out that she performs something interesting by being a relatively young woman with a young family and saying, you know what, I'm going to run for this high office. 
>> More models of female leadership we see, old, g, different races, different -- 
>> very feminine models, too. 
>> All kinds of models. It will get easier f women to get into the pipeline. 
>> Women when we become leaders we have to lead as women. We are more collaborative. We are more focused on how are we going to get something done. I got the tell you youuys will be shocked at how much craziness goes on in washington is about male he didn't call me. I wasn't invited. I sat in the back of the plane. Women would just be like, can we just sit down and figure this out. 

[00:42:24]


>> My pension is bigger than yours. 
>> Some of the women senators get together for dinner every once in a while because they need a break from all the testosterone and try to just sit around the table and say, okay, I need to get this bill through, how do I -- how can you help me? 
>> This is not a small point. In the same year we see a decrease in the number of women 30-year low, not a 30-year low but moving backward, we see the hyper partisanship. When we have seen folks coming together it was often moderate woor women who at least on certain kinds of issues were able to find common ground. 
>> Sorry, actually, president obama is holding a campaign rally in iowa right now. Let's take a listen to him. 
>> Feels good. Can everybody please give sandy a big round of applause for the great introduction? And give sandy's son a big round of applause for serving our country. Give it up for john mellencamp. It is wonderful to be here. You know, for the last several days, all of us have been focused on one of the worst storms in our lifetime what's been happening on the east coast. And I know I speak for the country when I say our thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost loved ones, people whose lives have been up ended. Folks here in iowa know something about flooding. You remember what happened just a few years ago. The recovery process is tough, but when I visited new jersey i told folks there that everybody all across the country feels the same way, we are going to be with people every step of the way down the long hard road of recovery. We're going to help them rebuild. We're going to do it together. That's what americans do. 
>> So that is president obama. He is there in iowa. I love my president but I can't believe he broke in on the women's chat. You know -- if he knew, he wouldn't have. But, right, that said. There he is talking apparently introduced by a woman named sandy, reminding us, of course, that sandy is the named srm that just hit here in the northeast. How big has this week been for the president in demonstrating start of what it means to -- we were just talking about working across lines. He and chris christie demonstrated that this week. 

[00:44:55]


>> Not only that, he got to show that wonderful moment where he hugged the woman at the tarmac where he could show that personal empathy. One of the pieces of barack obama's brand that was so helpful to him in '08 was this idea that he could be bipartisan. That's always good for a president to respond well to a catastrophe. 
>> Also that piece where, you know, of course, we had mitt romney saying, no more fema and we see exactly why we need it. Thank you, too, rebecca. The rest are back for more. Up next, the next generation. ??????

>>> no women will be more impacted by tuesday's relates than hour young women. What we sow with our votes, in three days they will reap. Joining the panel now to help represent generation next is julie zilinger, 19-year-old barnard university sophomore and author of "a little f'd up," feministed up. Is there a moment that we have seen this war on women who priding an opportunity for young women to see relevance of and importance of feminism in their lives? I think it has. It might be the one upside of this entire campaign. I think young women are coming to these conclusions. Previously we will be under t misconception that our rights had been won for us and this fight waser. I think seeing some of these outrageous comments that politicians are making about our bodies and rights in general are really allowing us to wake up. 
>> We had a student who was sort of busy during one of the big fights around birth control and said, I woke up and all of a sudden contraception was gone. A little bit of an over statement but stunning to see that happening. Is that the kind of thing that young women on college campuses are talking about head into on tuesday? 
>> It's definitely a concern. Like I said, it's very shock for a lot of us who thought these rights were going to be there forever. I think we are incredibly passionate about doing everything we can to keep those rights. 
>> What about run for office? It was the last thing we were talking about is this need for a pipeline. Do people -- I look at a young woman like you a say, okay, i got to tell you run for office at some point. Think about that as your career. Do young women look at our current politics and say, I am never jump nag that shark's nest? 
>> I think there are some wary a lot of the comments but i think especially looking at of the comments these men have been making and how they are trying to describe what it's like to be a woman and trying to make these decisions for us is inspiring in a lot of ways. I think we want to get in there in order to make things right. 
>> If there is one sort of economic issue that you hear young women talking about, what is that economic issue? 

[00:50:47]


>> I think definitely student debt in terms of young women my age. It's something definitely on our mind and especially when you hear things like the fact that romney would cut pell grant funding, it's incredibly concerning to young women. 
>> Absolutely. Julie, I so appreciate you joining the panel to remind all of us that we're in this fight but we're often in the fight for you and with you, and you have a right to have your voices heard, as well. So thank you for joining us tonight.

>>> In 1776 abigail adams wrote to her husband who was in the midst of the continental congress, I desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. In 1851 sir truth, a black woman, who was born into slavery, had her children sold from her, and endured physical brutality asked, ain't I woman. In 1895, women surfed the leader susan b. Anthony declaring, no man is good enough to govern any woman without her consent. When shirley chichl became the first woman to run for president 40 years ago this year, she argued, at present our country needs women's idealism and determination. Perhaps more in politics than anywhere else. In 2009 justice sonia sotomayor reminded us of the importance of having a wise latina on the america's highest court. These are the lessons of our american sheroes. These women cleared the path on which we now walk. They shoek when it was harder to speak. And we have a responsibility not to be silent.

>> For many of us, our first experience with mexican beer included a beach and a squeeze of lime, but for the next step, you got to go beyondo he beach. Now, tecate, for sure, is an iconic beverage here in baja, but what a lot of people don't know is that it's named after the town of tecate right here on the u.S.-Mexico border. Now, full disclosure, tecate is owned by cerveseria cuauhtemoc- moctezumo, which also owns bohemia, one of our show's sponsors. Back in 1944, alberto aldrete started making this crisp brew, and, well, right away, its popularity spread all across mexico and into the u.S. These days, mexican beer all over mexico is starting to expand into the smaller craft microbrews. In baja, there's an especially lively scene. There's this hip, little pub called ultramarino in ensenada. It's owned by chef alain genchi, and it's focused on promoting small breweries. Chef alain invited me to taste some of the local craft beers and to see how they paired with the area's stellar seafood. 

[00:02:20]


>> Well, rick, we're gonna try the cupaca clasica. This is an ale, ale beer. 
>> So we have a lager and an ale. 
>> An ale. 
>> Cheers. 
>> Cheers. 
>> Mm. Now, that's delicious. This is what I think of more as kind of the classic mexican beers. 
>> Uh-huh. It's more the mexican style. 
>> Mexican style, light, crisp. This is definitely a microbrew. So I think it's wonderful to have beer with light food, especially when you're thinking about beach kind of food and stuff like that. 
>> This is perfect with ceviche. 
>> Alian served 3 types of ceviche--sea snail with pasilla chili; scallop ceviche with salt, pepper, and lime; and some octopus ceviche that was made with dark beer. This was too light for that, I think. 
>> That's more, I think, for the scallop. 
>> For the scallop one. For me, the stronger flavors of the ale match beautifully with the octopus ceviche. The lighter lager beer went so well with the scallops. Our next pairing was a couple of fuller-bodied, more complex beers. 
>> Amarga. How do you say "amarga" in english? 
>> Bitter. Bitter. It's got that hoppy bitterness at the end. This is way lighter, even though the color is darker. Now, what kind of food were you thinking about going with this? 
>> I sgest the oyster taco for this. 
>> Now tell me which beer i should choose to go with my first bite of oyster taco. 
>> I suggest the chupacabras. 
>> Mm. That is delicious. That's delicious. Ok. Mm. You're a smart man. 
>> [Chuckles] 
>> you're a smart man. That bit of bitterness from the hops at the end, that's all perfect to cut through this one. So where are we gonna go from here? You have darker bes, heavier beers than these? 
>> We catry the bufadora from tijuana... 
>> Yes. 
>> And the obscura from cucapa. 
>> Ok. Let's go. N thought that some baby clams steamed in beer would pair well with those darker brews. Mm. 

[00:04:30]


>> Try the bread. 
>> I don't know whether to go to bread or to e beer. You think the stronger flavor beer? 
>> I think with this, could be the bufadora. 
>> That is a perfect combination. You knew exactly what you were going for. That's a great match. So do you tnk this is gonna catch on all through mexico? Do you think that we're gonna be seeing a lot of microbrewed beers in lots of places in mexico? 
>> Right now in ensenada, i think with the wine, it's very close, the idea for make wine and make beer. They are very close. So I think microbreweries in ensenada in 5 years are another thing. 
>> It's so wonderful how around ensenada, there are so many artisinal food products being made because it certainly the wine region of mexico, the beer region of mexico, and also so many food products, like olive oil and wonderful fish and shellfish, you know? This is a place that is just rich with great food. Warm clam ceviche sounds kind of unusual, but if you think about it as clams that are cooked with a little beer and then finished off with some lime juice, you sort of get the idea of where we're headed with this particular recipe. When you buy clams, you' want to store them in your refrigerator over ice just to keep them super cold so that you don't lose any of them, and then the second step is to put them into a bowl and cover them with cold tap water. Now, clams don't really like fresh water, so they'll sort of get stirred up a little bit, and over the next half-hour or so, they'll spit out all the sand that they might have inside of them. I'm gonna take them out of the water now, put them into a colander, and you'll see how much sand is at the bottom. Sometimes there's fair amount, sometimes just a little hint of it. There's just a little bit down in the bottom here. I can feel it. Now I give these guys a scrub just to make sure that they're clean before we put them into the pot and cook them. Now on to the cooking of these clams. The first thing that I'm gonna do is to melt a little butter into a pot that'll comfortably hold all of those clams, couple of tablespoons that I'll put over a kind of, oh, medium heat. Now, while that's melting, I'm gonna cut up some green chili and garlic... 

[00:07:47]


>> And with this jalapeno that I've got here, I'm gonna cut the stem end off of it, cut it open. I could cut out the veins and the seeds if I wanted to if i wanted to make it a little less spicy, but in this particular preparation, I want all of the spice of the jalapeno. So I'm just gonna cut it up veins, seeds, and all. All of that's gonna go into the pot with the butter here, and we'll cook it until the garlic is aromatic and the chilis begin to soften. That'll just take a minute or two. Now add a half a cup of beer. You're looking for something like a kind of crisp pilsner for this particular preparation. Remember, there's lime juice that's going in at the end here. D to that, I'm going to add about a half a cup of chicken broth. There's no need to do a homemade chicken broth for this. A good-quality store-bought one will do just fine. When that all comes to a simmer--and, boy, is it incredibly aromatic and delicious-smelling right now-- I'm going to add the clams to it. And these guys will go into the pot. Cover them, and it'll take about 3 minutes for them to cook, just enough time for me to juice some lime and chop up a little bit of cilantro. Yep. They have all opened up. I'm gonna take them out and divide them between 4 bowls while I let all this delicious juice reduce by about half. Ok. Now the final seasonings for this. I've got the lime juice, a handful of chopped cilantro, and I'll ladle that into the little cups with our clams there to make what I think is gonna be a great appetizer. I've recently been thinking a lot about trying my hand at beer making. So I asked jared rouben, the head pub brewer at goose island and one of my favorite brewmasters, to step me through the process from beginning to end. Ok, jared. Now, I have never brewed beer in my life. 

[00:10:54]


>> Ok. 
>> I've tasted some beer in my life, but never brewed it, and so I need to learn exactly what the steps are so I can appreciate it better. So walk me through it. Where do we start? 
>> Well, first thing we're gonna do is, we have to make a recipe. 
>> Ok. I'm good at making recipes. 
>> I know that. So the way we create a recipe is probably similar to how you create your salsa. You got your raw ingredient 
>> yeah. 
>> For us, our base malt here is gonna be pale. So I'll give you some of that, and it's really important that we taste everything before we start our process. 
>> Ok. So you just taste this in this raw state. 
>> Delicious. Like cereal. 
>> Like muesli. 
>> Like muesli. 
>> Ok. Ok. 
>> Like muesli. The pale is gonna be our base malt, and these chocolate and this caramel malt is a specialty so we don't have to really use as much. 
>> So this is your base, and then you add all these others to create different flavors. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> What's the next step? 
>> The next thing we do is, we use this auger right here, which is essentially a grain elevator. We pour our malt in there... 
>> Ok, the mixture that we've made. Ok. 
>> Absolutely, and we pour it in here, and it travels up to our mash tun over here. In the mash tun, we essentially make a giant pot of oatmeal. You've got your grains. You got your hot water. 
>> Ok. 
>> So you want to take a look? 
>> I do. I want to see what's going on in this tank. Ok. 
>> So this is all our mash. 
>> It does look like oatmeal. You're exactly right. 
>> It smells like some fresh grains and bread. What's going on here is the sparge process, and essentially-- 
>> sparge? 
>> Sparge, yes. 
>> Ok. Another one of the brewing terms I don't know. 
>> It's a brewing term for a hot shower, and so the grain gets a hot shower at a temperature of between 160 and 170, and that hot water trickles down through the vat of grain all the way down to the bottom, where there's a drain. It goes from that drain all the way back to our grant, our container, where you'll see the wort, or the malt tea. It transfers through this pipe right here... 

[00:12:57]


>> Right, right, right, right. 
>> All the way down into our brew kettle. 
>> Ok. The mash tun, the brew kettle. 
>> And it's actually a giant kettle. Underneath, you have a fire, a direct fire systir. 
>> Ok. 
>> So it'd just be if you had a giant pot. 
>> Ok. 
>> After we've transferred it to a certain level, we're gonna start our boil, and, similar to cooking, we're reducing. 
>> Concentrating the flavors. 
>> Absolutely, and our seasonings in the brewing world are hops. Ha ha! 
>> You guys are so simple. Even though you use strange words, it's so simple. 
>> So... 
>> Ok. 
>> There's some beautiful hallertau crude hops. 
>> Oh, my, the aroma. 
>> Beautiful. 
>> Oh, wow. That makes my mouth water. Jared explained that after the hops are added, once at the start of the boil for bitterness and once at the end for aromatics, everything then moves over to fermentation. So this is the fermeation tank. 
>> Yes. 
>> We got that boiled-down wort that is all hopped out, pumped over here. How does it ferment? 
>> Well, once we've transferred it over here, the yeast which were pitched in there is gonna a start eating the sugars which we got from the grain. 
>> But you have to add yeast to it to make that fermentation happen. 
>> Yes, but it happens within 24 hours. 
>> Oh, ok. After the fermentation, where does it go? The last stop is the bright tank. 
>> Bright tank? 
>> Bright tank, and that's where the beer is carboned. 
>> Oh, ok. Well, you lost me on that part of it because I was thinking about doing it at my house. I don't have, like, a bright tank. 
>> Ah, some home brew. 
>> Oh, you've taught me now, ok, so what would I use instead of a bright tank? 
>> Well, you don't need a bright tank. All you need is some bottles, and you'll transfer your fermented beer into bottles, and it's still actively fermenting. So once you seal it up, it's got a little bit of sugar in there, and in a couple weeks, you'll have some nice, sparkly beer. 
>> Now, one of the things that i think is really unique about your approach to beer making is, you're not just looking for a beer that's gonna taste good, but it's gonna taste good with food. 

[00:15:03]


>> Oh, yeah. We brew beer for food. So when we're coming up with a recipe, I think about what dishes do I want to have this with? 
>> Cool. That-- to me, as a chef, that's music to my ears. Two ex pats from colorado have started thr own microbrewery in mexico, and they pair their beers with pub food at baja brewing company. I was lucky enough to have the head brewer jordan gardenhire taste me through all the varieties that they have to offer. 
>> The first beer that we have in our lineup here is the baja blanc. 
>> Baja blanc. Ok. How is it made? 
>> This one is light malts, lightly hopped, and it's really the closest to a mexican style beer that we have. 
>> Now, the next one in this lineup is super dark, and i would've expected that to go at the very end, but why did you put it there? 
>> It looks like a really heavy stout, but it's actually the lightest-bodied beer we make. 
>> Even lighter than the blanc? 
>> It actually is. 
>> Ok. I want to do this one. Mm, I see what you're getting at with the ligness there, but it's also got some dark notes in the flavor. 
>> Very flavorful, a little bit toasted, coffee perhaps. Mm. Is our pele roja, or redhead red, and-- 
>> you named it after yourself? 
>> Well, somebody named it after someone. I'm not gonna point any fingers, but, yeah, I do make it. 
>> Well, this is super delicious. Now, there's a lot of flavor going on in that one. 
>> A lot of character. 
>> Yeah. 
>> This one you wouldnt want to drink so much on the beach, but maybe with dinner, maybe with a pizza, actually. 
>> I think that's what I want to do. That's really super delicious. They bake their pizzas in a wood-fired oven, and the cool thing is that they use some of the beer ingredients to make their pizza. 
>> This is my partner rob. 

[00:17:04]


>> Hey, rick. 
>> Hello, rob. 
>> Very good to see you. 
>> Rob does all of the restaurant side of things. 
>> And I can see we've got the iconic pairing of beer and pizza here, except this is beer pizza and beer, right? 
>> This is beer pizza because we actually use beer in the dough itself. We use our special beer yeast, and if you can see, there's seeds on the outside which is the grain that we use to actually make t beer, so-- 
>> so what you have on the outside is barley. 
>> Barley, exactly. Right. 
>> I don't think I've ever seen that before, but I don't just want to see it. I want to... 
>> Sure. Yeah. 
>> Eat it, too. 
>> Let's all get in there. 
>> Let's do it. It works. Super classic. The richness of the beer goes beautifully with the richness of the tomato that's on there. The fresh basil just kind of pops through the whole thing. Good stuff. One of my favorite things in the whole world is roasted tomatillo salsa. I just love the tanginess of it, the spiciness, and that little bit of sweetness that you get by roasting the tomatillos. I love the stuff so much, I even use it as a pizza sauce. Well, when you want to make roasted tomatillo salsa, the first thing you have to do is take your fresh tomatillos and take the husks off of each one of them. They have a kind of sticky substance on the outside of it that you'll want to rinse off, and I'm gonna put them onto a small baking sheet so that I can roast them under a broiler. Now, the chilis that are gonna go in here are serrano chilis, and all you have to do for those is to take the little stem end off. You can pop that off easily. Put those onto the baking sheet along with those tomatillos, and then just gonna run it under the broiler. You want to make sure that your oven rack is at its highest position, about 4 inches away from that broiler. After about 4 or 5 minutes, they'll be softening and blotchy black on the top. Pull them out. Turn them all over. Run them back under the broiler and let roast for another 4 or 5 minutes on the other side. Then let them cool to room temperature. Now, the cooled tomatillos and chilis I'm going to combine in the food processor, and to that, I'm gonna add a little fresh cilantro so they've got a fresh element in the salsa to combine with those roasty elements of the tomatillos and green chilis. When they get to be the consistency of a kind of coarse puree, I'm gonna scrape that into a bowl and check the consistency of it. Add some salt. Gonna stir that up. Last ingredient--a little white onion. So I'm gonna cut the top and bottom off and chop it into very fine dice. Add that to the bowl, give it a stir, and you got one of the best roasted tomatillo salsas in the world. I'm gonna show you what has become the bayless family favorite, favorite pizza, and it's gonna use roasted tomatillo salsa. Now, yesterday, I started what I think is the absolute easiest pizza dough. It's that noni dough that rises overnight. First, I measured two cups of all-purpose flour into a bowl and then added a quarter of a teaspoon of that instant, or rapid-rise, yeast and a teaspoon of salt. I stirred all of that together, then measured in a half a cup of room-temperature water and a third of a cup of beer. You just stir that until it sort of comes together but it still looks like a very rough mass. Then cover it with plastic and leave it on the countertop overnight. The first thing that we have to do is to cook the chorizo. This is mexican chorizo. It's not spanish chorizo, which is a cured product that you could just simply slice and use. This is more like an american breakfast sausage, and it has to be thoroughly cooked. So I'm gonna put it over about medium heat and then break up the sausage and cook it until it's completely cooked through and it's starting to brown. That'll take about 10 minutes or so. Now on to the pizza crust. I've got a rimmed baking sheet here and my overnight risen dough. Can see that it's-- well, it smells really good--all of that heady, yeasty aroma there--and it still looks a little bit rough, but it looks like bread dough. Now, on this baking sheet, I'm gonna splash on a bunch of olive oil, and then I'my dough and turn it out into the baking sheet. First thing that's gonna go on is roasted tomatillo salsa. Spread that in a thin layer over the dough. Now next, I'm gonna scatter on the cooked chorizo sausage--just give it a nice little coating all over--a couple of slices of red onion, really thin slices so that they'll cook in the oven... And then a little bit of fresh goat cheese. All over mexico, there's wonderful goat cheeses to be had. Now, I've had the oven on at 500 degrees for about half an hour because I want to make sure that it's really hot before I put the pizza in. Pizza should cook hot and really fast. I'm gonna cook it in the middle of the oven. Take 20 to 25 minutes. I'm gonna sprinkle on a little of this mexican queso anejo. Now, if you don't have that, you could use a little romano. It has a similar kind of flavor. I'm gonna take a few leaves of cilantro to sprinkle over the top. Pizza and beer.

Ntg on your clear eyes and full hearts to make sure we can't lose on tuesday. Than you so very much. 
>>> Just three days until election day and the candidates are crisscrossing this country, clamoring for the undecided vote. And, very good saturday afternoon to you fron the nation's capital. I'm craig melvin. You're watching msnbc, the place for politics. We're here in d.C. To cover this historic election and it comes at a time when millions are until trying to put their lives back together. We will dive into the latest news from the world of politics in just a moment but first, those let's get you caught up on the very latest on the aftermath of hurricane sandy. About 2.5 million people remain without power in the aftermath of that storm. 109 deaths nationwide have been attributed to sandy's wrath. Those numbers could rise. At least 40 of those deaths were in new york city. That's where mayor michael bloomberg relented and cancelled the new york city marathon. 40,000 runners were expected to compete sunday. Many folks around this country especially in that city believe holding the race, though, would be inappropriate and c delay --no, no, no, stop!

[00:03:32]


[ dog barks ] AAH! OH! 
[ Male Announcer ] NEW MR. CLEAN Select-a-size magic eraser. 
>>> We welcome back to msnbc. Let's go right now to chris jansing who is in ohio following the president. 

[00:05:33]


>> Good morning. Or good afternoon. It is quiet here but a big crowd for president obama just an hour ago. And there was a key message from the president and that vote. This is a state that, of course, is all about turn out, one of the key battleground state. In 2008, 76% of residents of this county voted and listen to the final numbers. Barack obama 49.58%. john McCain 48.74%. And the focus was on white working class voters. The president doing much better here in ohio than in any other battleground state and he talked a lot about the auto industry and the largely discredited ad by the romney campaign that the obama campaign thinks has backfired on them. But he also brought up hurricane sandy which he sees as an example of everyone working together. Here's what the president had to say just a short timeago. ???????????? 
>> neighbors helping neighbors cope with tragedy. Leaders of different political parties working together to fix what's br. 
[ Applause ] you know, it's spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is, no matter how tough times are, we're all in this together. 
>> Reporter: And the president also talking about ohio and how important it is and he's going to be here several more times over the next 72 hours. Mitt romney too, who is going to be in cleveland at the ix center, the largest convention center in this area, and one of the things that they are pointing to is that they say they had large and enthusiastic crowds. They were down near cincinnati last night. They had about 30,000 people. They also say they believe they have strength and independence. But on both sides they are getting serious about this final push to get out the vote, lots of people going door-to-door, making phone calls. There's a lot of mailings in people's mail boxes today and we'll see right now early voting is under way and one of the final messages from here was that there was still a polling place next door that was open for another hour after this event finished and the president urging people not only to go themselves and vote but bring your neighbor, bring your mother, bring your boyfriend, bring your girlfriend. Me slay. 

[00:08:02]


>> Chris jansing, thank you so much. We'll k back with you later. We'll take a quick break and then be back with craig melvin., try running four. Fortunately we've got ink. It gives us 5x the rewards on our internet, phone charges and cable, plus at office supply stores. Rewardwe put right back into our business. This is the only thing we've ever wanted to do and ink helps us do it. Make your mark with ink from chase. Up. A short word that's a tall order. Up your game. Up the ante. And if you stumble, you get back up. Up isn't easy, and we ought to know. We're in the business of up. Everyday Delta flies a quarter of million people while investing billions improving everything from booking to baggage claim. We're raising the bar on flying and tomorrow we will up it yet again. 

[00:11:17]


>>> Welcome back. Joining us from midtown manhattan is katie. You were at a gas station. We've been seeing these crazy lines. Police having to be brought in to break up fights at gas station. Tell us about the situation where you are. 
>> Reporter: Police are at every single gas station that's open both here in new york and new jersey. There was a reported fight out in queens yesterday a guy pulled a gun on some other guy who was tting him in line. The guy pulled the gun is facing serious charges and jail time. That's the worst fight we've heard of. Most stations I've been at, I've been at a bunch in the past few days have been pretty orderly because there are police. This one right now has a very long line. Hard to see how long it goes because it's literally far they are than the eye can go. We're at 44th and 10th in manhattan and at one point this lineown 26 streets. A lot of new york city blocks. That line is getting that long right now. This gas station right here filled up this morning at 5:00 a.M. By 10:00 a.M. They were completely out of gas. Closed. Re-opened just a moment ago they got another shipment and starting to go again. Over in new jersey, you're seeing the same sort of thing. Veryong lines. That's why governor christie has instituted rationing. Everybody who has a license plate that end in an even number can get gas on even number days. If you have an odd numred license plate you can get gas on odd number days. Here in new york, senator schumer said he's going open up some mobile gas stations where people can get 10 gallons per person. They are hoping that will ease some of the pressure. The lights are back on in much of manhattan including lower manhattan and they can open gas stations now and start pumping again. That should help as well. Governor cuomo here in new york said 8 million gallons were delivered. 28 million gallons are on the way. At its core, melissa, this is not a gas shortage, even though the rationing harkens back to jimmy carter and the gas shortage, oris is not a gas shortage, this is a power shortage. If you don't have power at the pumps you can't pump the gas. If you don't have gas you can't bring the gas in from other areas because the roads are blocked. The ports have just been re-opened in new york and the restrictions lifted. Hopefully once the power comes on and once the fuel lines are re-opened this will start to go away. Until then it will be tight in many areas. Luckily for the most part we've been seeing some pretty calm people although around new york and I'm sure you've seen this as you've gone out today around new york people are very tired. The guy behind the register looks like he hasn't slept in days even when you go out for coffee. 

[00:14:08]


>> He probably hasn't. New yorkers aren't known for being long on patience to start with, katie. >> They are not known for that but they have been patient. Everyone is work together. They are just tired and rather be at home sleeping with lights and power and clean water that's actually hot. 
>> Exactly. Thank you so much. Let's go now to msnbc's craig melvin in washington. 
>> Thank you so much. Had some technical problems but we're back online here in our nation's capital. We turn back to politics. Our political headlines, frenetic, frenzy final weekend with all the candidates and their surrogate out in full force right now. Mitt romney just wrapped up an event end dubuque, iowa a state where most polls gives the president a narrow lead. Paul ryan wind ul up a rally in pennsylvania where the romney campaign is trying to make a late pushed. The combined events of mitt romney and paul ryan will give the campaign in seven different states today. The president also had a whirlwind schedule today going to iowa, ohio, virginia, going to wisconsin as well today. Vice president joe biden has two events in colorado, one outside denv, other in pueblo. The candidates are also taking the fight to the printed page today with duelling op-eds in the "wall street journal." Meanwhile back in d.C. This morning president obama at fema headquarters where he met with officials and talked about disaster relief in the wake of hurricane sandy. 
>> Our heartsontinue to go out to those families who have been affected and have lost loved ones. That's obviously heartbreaking. But I'm confihat we can continue to make progress as long as state, local and federal officials -- 
>> so, one critical thing. One critical thing to watch in this very busy final homestretch here, the closing arguments that the candidates are making, the single big picture message is that they are hoping voters take to heart come tuesday. Here to talk abo that and a whole lot more bill schneider resident scholar at the washingtonshhink tank and our political reporter from "the washington post." Good afternoo both of you. Bill, let's start with you. Msnbc's first read called this statement the obama campaign closing argument let's put it on the screen. Quote, while governor romney promotes the same policies that failed our country and ran the middle class into the ground and calls it change president obama will point the way forward to real change that will boost the middle class and create a stronger future for all american couple of interesting things ng here, bill schneider pushing back against the idea that romney represents change and an appeal as well to the middle class. How effective is that closing argument?

>> Well, basically he's arguing don't go backwards we want to go forward. That's the theme of his campaign. But we're hearing something also interesting in these closing arguments. Both sides are claiming they can deliver unity. That's something that got president obama elected. Remember when he first gave a speech in 2004 at the democratic convention he said there's no liberal america, there's no conservative america, there's the united states of america. He's going back to that argument and the terrible storm sandy the hurricane actually helped him make that argument because he got praise from two republican governors of new jersey and virginia for his efficient handling of the relief effort after that storm. So it's helping him make the case that he can bring the country together even though most his critics say he failed to do that. 
>> That's interesting. Here's the thing. Even if the president is re-elected, it's not as if the house is going to change dramatically in terms of its makeup, he'll still have a narrow margin in the senate. How will he go about doing that? How does he bring about that change? 
>> Right. One of the things you might actually see here and you pointed to that is that this could be a status quo election if in fact president obama is re-elected, it's likely that the house will remain in republican hands and the senate will remain in democratic hands, very narrowly. Also it's very much back to the drawing board in terms of trying to forge some way forward in terms of big legislation. Big, big things on the list here to be done. The fiscal cliff. Looking at medicare. Looking at medicaid. Look at these huge deficits tha we have coming up. So the president, if he is re-elected will have some huge challenges. His theory all along has been if in fact he's re-elected that the fever among republicans to essentially say no to everything will break. That this election will be a referendum on the way they have governed or failed to govern over the last four to eight years and in that way they will be able to forging some compromise. I think one area that folks talk about that might actually people might be able to make headway around is immigration, especially if you have a situation after this election where republicans don't do well among latinos that could be some common ground that both of these parties could find. 

[00:19:19]


>> Bill, the romney campaign is arguing that the president's so-called midwest fire wall is in trouble. Take a listen, this is the campaign political the director, this is him on wednesday. Take a listen. The fire wall that I think they talked about was iowa, wisconsin and ohio. Right now their fire wall is burning. 
>> That's the romney campaign's political director, three states meioned wisconsin, ohio, iowa. The same three states that the president has decided to visit on his last day before the election. How worried is the obama campaign about those states? 
>> Well, I think they've been worried of all of those states because they are very close even though the polls shows obama slightly ahead by no means a safe margin. He does not have a strong lead anywhere. I think the romney campaign is really worried about ohio and that's why they suddenly turned up their visitsn advertising in pennsylvania, michigan, minnesota, states they don't have much of a chance to carry but they need ohio insurance because so far even if the lead is very small ohio is looking pretty good for the president. 
>> You know, I'm glad bill brought that up because I was going to get to that in just a few minutes. Ohio, governor romney hasn't led in a major poll in that state. Right now you take an average of all the polls that look at the buckeye state, the president enjoys a lead there, some of those leads more substantial than others. Is it at this point the buckeye state is it a wash for the governor? 
>> Well, you know, I think he certainly had some trouble there gaining ground. He tried a new tactic over these last couple of days talking about the auto bailout, not a good look for him because of that op-ed that he wrote in 2008 titled let detroit go bankrupt. So when he even mentions the auto bailout it only turns the focus back to him in a have all of these localapers there really point to the fact that he has this ad out alleging jeep is transferring zwrobs china basically calling it a flat out lie. This hasn't been a good look to him. He moved to pennsylvania. As we know over the last many elections pennsylvania has been a solidly blue state. You see republican candidates in the last minutes of this campaign, last stage of this campaign historically going to pennsylvania in a bit of a head fake but so far pennsylvania has been like a great white whale for republican candidates. It's a big fat state, 20 electoral votes. I don't think there's much of a chance for romney to takehat state out of obama's column and he needs to look elsewhere. I think it's been surprising that romney hasn't been able to expand the map very much to a place like -- to a place like pennsylvania, to a place like michigan. I think at this point he's really scrambling to figure out how he can get 270. 

[00:22:06]


>> Tomorrow paul ryan will be in ohio, colorado and minnesota. I'm curious about minnesota, that last tstate. Seems to be firmly in the obama column. Today the obama campaign announcing bill clinton will also be going to minnesota tomorrow. Is there a battle brewing for minnesota now? 
>> Well, there ought not be. Minnesota has voted democratic since 1972 because it voted for walter monday dale one of the few states that voted for walter monday dale. It's pretty reliably democratic although republicans have been competitive in state elections. Is there a battle brewing? I don't think so. Again what the romney campaign is doing is looking foro insurance. They have not been running ahead in ohio so they are looking every where they k-minnesota, michigan, pennsylvania to try to find some other state that can replace ohio. 
>> Bill schneider of the third way and emily from "the washington post." Appreciate your time. Thank you both. 
>>> The east coast starting to slow a pain staking process of recovering from the devastation of hurricane sandy. New york's staten island one of the areas hardest hit of the storm, 22 of new york's 40 fatalities were on staten island. Richard lui has been there for several days now.W. He joins me this afternoon. Richard earlier this week, the congress minnesota that represents that particular area describes to me as the forgotten borough. What's the latest on the recovery effort on staten island. 
>> Reporter: Very good day to you. The latest is they are still digging ou the issue at hand is healing. When you were here it was recovery and trying to determine what was the amount of damage now they are going through the healing phase here on staten island, specifically we're in the new door communities. This is a church. They brought together four groups, one group here is actually helping with health needs. They are giving out these toot paste napkins, towel here. They are mapping out where they want to go in the coming days. They have these items like towels, brought in water, clhes here. Bring those items in here. Trying to get it out to those who don't have places to stay. Don't have food. Simple things as you know just keeping clean. People bringing in food. Second ago we had some -- they are still here. These are still warm from dominick's next door. We had pizzaerlier. Spaghetti line. What's interesting here, craig, when you talk with the pastor who runs these four organizations today, he says the collection of people that he's got is quite interesting. Take a listen to what he said earlier. 

[00:24:51]


>> Not only have our own people contributed, we've had people who I've never seen before from the community, all different types of backgrounds come and say we want network with to help people. 
>> Like what? 
>> It's interesting. We're a christian church and the other day I was working shoulder to shoulder with a woman who was a muslim to help put together a bag. I thought that was pretty interesting. 
>> Forgotten, craig not in this spot here in new door, staten island. They had hundreds of volunteers, 12 our shifts, 3 1/2 days straight. A lot of good energy here right now. 
>> It's good richard lui to see folks coming together on staten island. Arguably the hardest hit of the areas affected. While I have you here I do want to ask you about something else not to put you in an awkward spot considering your location. There had been a fair amount of flack given to the red cross earlier this week from residents that I talked to from local officials as well who said t the response by the red cross was not as swift as they would have liked for it to be. What your hearing about that and your hearing anything from the red cross? 
>> Well, what we're hearing from those that are hear in staten island today, they are thinking out looking forward here, craig. There's still that overflow of, well disgruntlement. What will happen next. When will we have heat. When will we have electricity. That was the sentiment as people continued to wait in line for gasoline to take care of their generators. It's cold overnight. 30 degree weather. Sometimes you get sun. We saw about an hour of that earlier. I city think that is arc that's going lower. What we're seeing is energy start took more positive. People trying to think how to make things better. The pastor was clear in saying hey this is a is a lod bowl of volunteers that have come together from all over, new jersey, new york state and marathon runners are here today trying to help out because now they are not runng as you know. 

[00:26:52]


>> Richard lui, we will leave it right there my friend. Thanks very much for that, the very latest on the recovery effort on staten island. Thank you.

[00:30:57]


>>> Welcome back. As the candidates make their case to voters we are getting some new polling today from a pair of critical swing states. Ohio and florida. The latest nbc news "wall street journal" m.Arist poll shows president obama holding on a six-point lead among likely voters in the buckeye state. Meanwhile in florida an creamily tight race there two points separating the candidates with the president ahead in the sunshine states 49 to 47%. So much of this race, of course, depends on these two states. Ohio and florida. For some insight I want to bring in our nbc news deputy political editor. Let's start with ohio good friend. If mitt romney can't win in ohio what would his path to 270, what would his path to victory have to look like. 
>> Makes it very narrow for mitt romney. If president obama wins oo he's at 261 electoral votes based on our battleground map. If mitt romney gets virginia and florida he's stuck to 248. New hampshire where he owns a home but the president probably a finger on the scale now we're at 261-261 and we've been talking all along about the midwest and importance of ohio, wisconsin and iowa and the necessity for mitt romney to win two of those three. Look at that right there. You got those 16 electoral votes between those two and if somehow mitt romney or barack obama were pick up wisconsin, boom you've got president obama at 271 and even if mitt romney were to get iowa he's only at 267, craig the importance of the industrial midwest. 
>> All right. You mentioned florida. Let's dig a little bit deep near to florida. Based on that poll neck and neck race. If president obama, ife does not win florida what does that mean for his path to victory? 

[00:33:00]


>> Of course the president still can win even if mitt romney were to win florida and virginia and again it all comes down to ohio. Because like we just laid out that last path if it becomes very difficult for the president -- for mitt romney to win if he loses florida but with florida, again we got the ohio plus strategy, I like to call it because the president has to win ohio and then he needs one more. He could get colorado, he could get wisconsin and he's right over the top and wisconsin is the one right now that they are looking at, craig. 
>> For months, president obama winning pennsylvania that's been the theory. Romney campaign now says it believes it has a shot at winning that state. If governor romney pulls out a win at pennsylvania how does that shake up the electoral map? 
>> That would shake it up. Nnsylvania now we got ourselves a big state race, mitt romney opening up that pathway. The big problem for mitt romney has been ohio this entire time. That auto bailout messaging and right there is why we see mitt romney potentially needing something like pennsylvania but if he gets pennsylvania well now it's a race for these other electoral votes. If romney were to get florida you see that 255 in virginia, 268 but still short. So he could pick up maybe the four electoral votes in new hampshire where we have a toss up but maybe a finger on the scale for the president. Maybe if romney is able to pick up colorado then he suddenly is at 277. But president obama, we have seen in recent days be maybe, have a little bit of an edge in virginia and again where are we looking but right here again in the industrial midwest with wisconsin and iowa it's a big kebecause if we were to give romney now wisconsin he's over the top at 274 even if president obama were to get iowa, if the president were able to get wisconsin then now he's over the top. So you can see where we go. There's a lot of paths. If pennsylvania were picked up it changes things quite a bit. 

[00:35:04]


>> I love the map, my friend. Always good have you, especially good today since at any moment you'll be a new father. We appreciate you carving out some time fours. Good luck my friend. 
>> Thank you so much.

>>> In a tight presidential election the race can hinge on seemingly small things. It can hinge on a single county in a swing state, it can hinge on a key demographic or maybe on something like this in florida, republicans trying to oust three state supreme court justice accusing them of defending the president's affordable care act. "The washington post" calling it a high stakes political contest unlike any florida has seen with funding coming in in part from the billionaire conservatives the coke brothers. With me now, an msnbc political analyst and a professor here in d.C. At georgetown university and michelle bernard political analyst and founder of the bernard center for women, politics and public policy. Good afternoon to boston you. 
>> Hi there. 
>> Doug I'll start with you. We pay attention to the presidential candidates. Generally speaking how much of an impact can something like a fight over judges, how much of an impact can something like this happen when it comes to voter turnout? 
>> Kit have a huge impact especially on the local level and in this case on state level. What's at stake here are a couple of thgs. First of all to what degree will the supreme court remain independent from either political party. IN FLORIDA, IN THE '70s THEY Stopped voting for supreme court justice and they were being afrointd a nominating list that the governor then would appeal to in order to appoint the justices and then they stood for rention. The coke brothers another far right-wing group here have tar get these particular justices because they want to really impose willy-nilly their will upon florida. You know, they control the legislature, they control governor's office now they want will be overloaded with people who can be appointed by a republican governor. So that will have a huge impact on stand your ground laws and have a huge impact on what happens in that particular locale. Those local politic, tip o'neill said all politics are local will have a huge impact upon the people in florida and the rest of the nation will be watching as a litmus test to determine how the receivism of the coke brothers and far right-wing groups will have an impact on this kind of race. 

[00:37:57]


>> Michelle, this is a headline from the "wall streejournal" this week and I'm going to put it up here. Election may hinge on o latino turnout here. Barack obama's re-election hopes hinge more than any previous presidential contender on the latino vote. If the president is -elected, michelle how much of a role will that specific voting bloc play? 
>> It's going to have a huge impact on the election in just a few days. Latinos are the largest growing minority in the united states. They are also, you know, 16% of the electorate. They are particularly important in all of the battleground states we're talking about. Nevada, colorado, virginia, in particular and we have seen that there's been so much damage to the republican brand this year not only with, you know, with voting blo such as women andnd african-americans but particularly with latinos who by the way most people will remember voted in huge numbers for george bush in 2000. He received 35% of the hispanic vote in 2000. And in 2012 latinos no longer feel at home within the republican party of today. So barack obama, you can see it's a big part of his coalition. We'll be going out knocking on doors and doing everything he can to get the hispanic vote particularly in swi states. 
>> Michael let's broaden this thing out a bit. There's aeadline from politico that got myttention this morning. Obama's demographic gamble, quote obama is likely to get blown out among white voters on election day narrowly lose independents nationwide and yet may still win based on historic margins among groups that off ten lean democratic but don't vote in high waits. Latin jobs african-american, young people and unmarried women as well. Do you see this unfolding come tuesday? 
>> It's always between case as last time around obama never won the majority of white voters here but he won a significant enough margin in combination with latinos, with african-americans, of course, overwhelmingly voting for him, the female vote which continues to be a strong measure in his column. And of course unmarried whoerm a bit disgruntled with the first debate but now resigned so to speak. No question that kindd of, if you will, coalition that obama has been able to carve out will be a significant factor in his re-election. 

[00:40:29]


>> We'll have to leave it there. I wish I had more time. Thanks to you both on a saturday afternoon.

>> Any time. 
>> On this day in 1962 the world s reacting to the news that the united states and the soviet union had finally found a way to the end cuban crisis. If you had turned on a television 50 years ago today you may have seen this. 
>> There is one way you can indicate your devotion to freedom. There is one way in which we can show how strongly we believe in our democracy. Next tuesday november 6th is election day. I hope every american will turn out and vote. Every american, every member of his family. And show the world how strongly we believe in freedom, how strongly we believe in our country. really?

>>> The new details today on one of the more intriguing subplots of the 2012 presidential campaign, politico reporting today that new jersey governor chris christie was mitt romney's first choice for the vice presidential slot on his ticket, the story says romney paused his therebiations over of christie when he left for the olympics and he settled on paul ryan when he returned from london. We're not sure what happened in london. Joining us in our war room to talk about this, karen finny msnbc political analyst and democratic national communications directory and chip saltsman. Karen let's start there how different would this campaign had been had chris christie been mitt romney's running mate instead of paul ryan? 
>> The strategist in me says it would have been very different but the american ine is glad to see that both men were able to do the job they were supposed to do this week and I'm sure residents of new jersey are grateful for that. 
>> Chip what do you think? Hurricane sandy aside what do you think? 
>> Think these are great stories that's beyond inside baseball, inside the dugout stuff and it's always fun to speculate what if. Craig, I was always under the impression you were governor romney's number one choice. Couldn't get out of the msnbc contract. You never know. These are fun stories to talk about. I think at the end of the day governor romney got who we wanted. Governor romney feeds off of paul ryan's energy. 

[00:46:25]


>> Let's talk about tuesday here chip. Baseon the polling that we just reported out of florida, the polling that we've been reporting out of ohio for some time now,no it would seem at least, it would seem as if governor romney's path to 270 is far more narrow than it was a month and a half ago. 
>> I would even say a month and a half ago it was a steeper uphill climb. His campaign has done a read job. We can tell you we don't believe these polls. The bottom line is florida, we know he has to put in his pocket. He has to get virginia. If he gets those two there's a path with ohio a lot easier without ohio a narrow path. Got to go wisconsin, colorado and maybe iowa or new hampshire. So we got a lot of work to do in the next couple of days. He has the momentum going into tuesday right now. 
>> Karen finny I imagine you would disagree? 
>> I'm sure you're not going surprised to find I do only in that if you take one of the numbers that I've been looking sat our data point if you look at the early vote numbers in battleground states and look at the percentage of people who voted and where those votes are and the percentage that mitt romney has to win in states like ohio, florida, iowa in order to win the state it's over 50% and almost 60% in some of those case. So, you know, is there a path? Of course because there's always a path because human behavior is unpredictable. I want does look mighty tight. 
>> It would explain why we see governor romney in places like, surrogates in places like minnesota, in places like pennsylvania, in places like wisconsin at this point with 72 hours to go trying to expand the map. It seems at least a very odd strategy to a lot of folks. 
>> It's a a little bit of a head fake. It's a little bit of a, you know, trying to see if you can shake something loose at the last minute but I don't think that's going to happen. 
>> Karen, chip, thanks as well. Do appreciate your time folks. 

[00:48:27]


>> Yes, sir.

>>> Last weekend I was in florida for the start of in person early voting. Today is the last day of early voting in the sunshine state. And in that other all-important battleground as well virginia today chris christie encouraging new jersey residents to take advantage of early voting this weekend as their people have been casting their votes early in record numbers all over this country. So, what will the legacy of early voting be on this race? I want to go ahead and bring in the brain trust panel. We're here in d.C. We should have someone from "the washington post" within us. Thanks foror being with us. I want to start with you. What do you think, what will be the final story on early voting's role in this election? 
>> I think the story is going that republicans wound up turning out as many early voters as the president. And the reason I say that is that the restrictions on early voting in florida have produce ad lot of anger particularly in black churches wh took full advantage of the full days they had out of anger at the impression that republicans are trying to limit the right to vote. 
>> I know you did some digging specifically into some early voting numbers in ohio. Talk to me a little bit about that. What did you find? 
>> We found if you look at the counties that went for obama last time there's a lead before 900,000 to 400,000. If those voting patterns hold and they could break for romney you just don't know but if they hold it shows incredible mobilization among obama voters. I know we're short on time. There's a sentiment that was touched on last time they were trying to stop obama and this time they are trying to stop all of us. I think when that takes hold it's a strong geotv message. We'll see how that shakes out. 
>> Jennifer, you wrote in "the washington post" that the president's early voting advantage doesn't relly exist. Explain that to me. What states are we talking about? 

[00:54:05]


>> If you look at iowa, florida, colorado, the advantage that democrats enjoy in early voting simply is not there. Coming in early voting republicans are ahead in colorado which is almost unheard of. I think the numbers are going to speak for themselves on election day in those states like colorado, like florida, like iowa republicans tend to outnumber democrats on voting day. If they come in with less of an advantage in 2008 they are in very good shape. As far as trying to create a narrative that any vote success suppressed that's sour grapes in advance of tuesday and I don't think it help either side. 
>> Craig, if I could just say one quick thing. You know, the sense that I got about people feeling like voter suppression is happening or like they are being discouraged is coming from voters, talking to black churches who had souls for the polls taken away in florida. Just to give you a quick piece of data if you look at the early vote totals around people who voted in the last three elections, people who voted in two out of three and people who voted in only one out of three democrats are ahead. Republicans are turning out super vers early in florida but democrats are turning out infrequent voters. That's important because that means they are not just getting numbers they would get anyway on election day they are getting infrequent voters. 
>> Voting in florida is down from 2008. 
>> It's not. 
>> If you think democrats can youpt vote republicans on election day in florida you're in good shape. If not you're probably behind which is why the president is not there today. 
>> Just briefly to jennifer's point you don't have to te our word on it on sour grapes. The supreme court put back "today" tempt by ohio republicans to restrain early vote. It suldn't be a partisan issue. It's important you have as much voting as possible. 
>> We're going to have to leave it right there. I only had to ask one question. How about that. Big thanks to all of you, the brain trust. Big thanks to you as well. I'm craig melvin from here in washington, d.C. Stay with msnbc, a special edition of "the cycle" coming up live next from democracy plaza in the heart of new york city. You're watching msnbc.

It's well-balanced and a well-balanced tool is usually a signifier of good design and good craftsmanship. I've looked inside it. It's m tough, durable parts. Outside, also tough and durable, but the pieces go together easily. It operates easily, it makes perfect sense to u-- all that combines to make a high-quality, well-designed tool that's going to make your home improvement and home project life much, much easier.

>> Wow, look at that! It's fast, it's easy and it makes your yard look great. 
>> [Turns off trivac] 
>> whoo! Look at that. 
>> Now I get to use the worx trivac, I have the vacuum function and it just makes it so much easier because it sucks everything up. It gets underneath the bushes. It doesn't leave anything left behind, so it's great. 
>> This is what sold me on it more than anything, was the vacuuming, because I can come out here on the deck or around the pool and vacuum the leaves and I can just walk around and it sucks up all the debris. 

[00:05:28]


>> This is it! There's no extra pieces to it. There's nothing to fall off. Ere's nothing to get lost in the garage, there's nothing to run over with your tractor. It's one piece, so you don't have to change anything when you want to change from a blower to a vacuum. All you have to do is-- bang-- flip the switch and you've got it-- that's fantastic.

[00:10:50]


>> Folks, this is the best. My favorite feature of the worx trivac is the fact that on the fly I can change from a blower to a vacuum, just like that-- instantaneously from a blower to a vacuum-- show 'em, robin. 
>> I'd be happy to. You just blow the leaves into a pile... [Trivac whirring...] and at 210 miles per hour-- I mean, look at that power! Isn't that amazing? This is so powerful. It's so easy to use, it's so lightweight and on the fly, once again, I just flip this right over and now I just start vacuuming. And those leaves just wanna jump right in. It just sucks 'em right up. 
[Trivac whirring...] I'm just not working at all. One-handed, I can easily just get my yard cleaned up in no time at all. 
[Trivac whirring...] now let me get these leaves... There we go! >> Nice work! 
>> You like that? >> Nice work! 
>> Thank you very mu. 
>> So, as you were vacuuming up those leaves, they were all getting mulched. 
>> Exactly-- you can turn mounds of dry leaves into mulch in mutes-- perfect for compost piles or ground cover. 
>> Look at this, right here in the flower bed-- how 'bout that? 
>> That's incredible! 
>> And what do we mean by a 10-to-one ratio? We mean 10 bags of leaves down to one bag of mulch. 10 to one! 
>> You got the bag on your hip, so as soon as you're done, there's no dumping in the barrel, there's no having to bag it. You can take the bag right ove to your garden and dump it in, clean and easy. 
>> I'm nancy szerlag and I am a master gardener and I'm a garden writer, and I've been writing a weekly column for the detroit newsfor more than 15 years, and I take a lot of time going to tradeshows, looking for new products. That's one of the things that i specialize in and I specialize in tools. I'm here today because I have found a blower vac, the worx blower vac, that I think is a really special tool. It's got some features you aren't gonna find on any other blower vac on the market today. 

[00:12:52]


[Trivac whirs...] 
>> the worx trivac is also perfect for cleaning up all of your hedge trimmings. Look at that. How clean is that? And then, on the fly, I just switch it over to the blower feature, and it's powerful enough to clean up all of these wet leaves. Wow, 210 miles per hour-- look at that! 
>> And then, with our air flow regulator here, you can dial in just how much air you need. You wanna be careful in your flower beds, so you just dial it that way. 
>> Speaking of year-round outdoor clean-up, who hasn't had a family barbecue where some trash was leftehind in the yard, especially if the wind was blowing. 
>> What a mess we have here, and in the past, you used to have to walk all around the house, all around the yard, bending over, picking this up, bending over picking that up-- not anymore. 
>> No. 
[Trivacs whirring...] with the trivac, you can now have the yard clean in justin minutes without the hassle of bending over. You cat all that trash up without ever having to touch it. 
[??????..., Trivacs whirring...] remember when you got stuff underneath the chair, and now with the angled head, I can get up underneath patio furniture. In the past, in order to sweep up under there, I had to move the chairs. I don't have to move anything, I don't have to move it back. Not with the worx trivac. Boy, wasn't that easy? 
>> That sure was easy. We can invite your family back again. >> Well, thank you. 
>> All right. >> [Laughs] 
[trivac whirs...] 
>> the trivac is also lightweight. At 8.3 pounds, it weighs less than a gallon of milk. Anyone can use this machine. 
>> In fact, this is the only yard vac specifically designed to be used with just one hand. 
>> It's lightweight, it looks good, it feels foo and it's ergonomically designed so that when I hold it, I can leave my arm just in a natural position. I don't have to have a second handle on it. 

[00:14:57]


>> What that'll do is I can stand straight up without having to bend over and vacuum up my leaves and it grinds them up and I can just get rid of them that way, without putting stress on my back. 
>> It really does save your back. It saves you from any of the pain and in your arms from having to rake 'em all up, put 'em in a bag, take them to the curb. Here, I go where the leaves are, suck them up, put the mulch where I need it. 
>> I used to clean my porch off with a broom, and it never works because we've got all these little corners and the dirt gets stuck in the corners and it's impossible with a broom to get it out. So now I've got this blower and I can do it in just a few seconds and it's absolutely simple. You know, the nice thing about this is it really cuts my time in half, if not more. 
>> It's quicker than a broom because when you use a broom, it takes a while to get all the spots and in between all the crevices. You can use this tool and it will get in between all the cracks and you're done in about three minutes because it just blows it and you're done. 
>> Ask yourself, do you want to keep sweeping? No. You want to get the worx trivac, you want to save all that time and effort.

Ews "wall street nal" polls, pairist polls shows the president holding on to a six-point lead in ohio. You know the importance of that state by no and two points ahead of governor romney in florida. But within the margin of error. Also, early voting in florida ends today after the number of early voting days in that state is cut by half this year. 25 million people have already voted early in 34 states and washington, d.C. 
>>> And back to the frenetic pace on the campaign trail. Both candidates have already held rallies in new hampshire, iowa, and wisconsin. 
>> You do want to be ae to trust your president. You want to know -- you want to know that -- that your president means what he says and says what he means. After four years of president, you know me. You may not agree with every decision I have made. You may at times have been frustrated by the pace of change, but you know what i believe. You know where I stand. 
>> Made a lot of promises, but those promises he couldn't keep. And the difference between us, he made promises he couldn't keep. I'm making promises I have kept and I will keep them for the american people. I have a clear and unequivocal message, and that is america is about to come roaring back. 
[ Cheering ] 
>> joining me now, "washington post" columnist and msnbc analyst eugene robinson, marc caputo and mark murray. Thank you so much, gentlemen, for joining. I got to bring eugene in because he is right here and I have the pleasure of sitting alongside. When we heard or I heard governor romney say we're roaring back, instantly thought of the auto bailout, the auto industry. How many times we heard on the campaign trail from obama and others saying gm is roaring back. And I thought, wow, it all goes back to ohio and that auto bailout which was unpopular at the time, and now here we are. 

[00:02:05]


>> Right. So one of the big questions is will mitt romney kind of blur the lines on the auto bailout sufficiently to gain a little ground in ohio? Because that is a huge issue in that state. And arguably, we could be saying wednesday that that issue won the state for president obama and that it won reelection for president obama. 
>> Do you think we're talking too much about ohio? Listen, you've got the romney campaign saying they're looking at pennsylvania, minnesota, that they perhaps have some traction there. And we know the new numbers in florida. We'll talk with marc about that throe show at least a difference in polls from the nbc marist poll and local polls show romney is up more than we're indicating. 
>> First of all, I think both sides genuinely think they're going to win or certainly think they have a great chance of winning. That said, pennsylvania has always been fool's gold for republicans. It looks tempting at the end. They might go for it. 
>> Sounds good on paper. 
>> But they don't get it. Now if the new nbc marist poll is correct about florida, florida can decide it before we even, you know, do the late-night counting of the absentee ballots out of cleveland. I mean because florida, if that goes for president wbama, that's pretty much the story, I think. 
>> Mr. Caputo, let me bring new you've in on this. The poll shows two point ahead for governor romney in florida, that within the margin of error. My team and I were struck with looking at the lines of people early voting in that state today. 
>> Well, those lines are really going to be the indication of how this campaign is going to go. We've had ganusters early voting turnout in florida. About two million people in op week. Because of early voting, democrats have an edge and ballots cast of about 104,000 over republicans. Republicans usually do well at mail and absentee ballots. Democrats dominate early voting. But guess what? The legislature, rick scott shortened the early voting days. And relative to the early voting hours we had in 2008 in south florida, they essentially cut them by 22% or about 24 hours. So it's going to make a difference. What we're going to see on election day now is a lot of those folks who probably would have early voted, they're going to show up on election daynd cast ballots. So the qstion is how many of these people are actually voting for obama? How many are voting for romney? Obvisly we don't know. Indications are from our poll is that romney is winning the key demographic or the key swing voters or the key swing state, and that's the independent vote . He is marginal winning them. Hes also doing well with north florida democrats, certain crossover democrats, rural democrats. He pulls about 16% of them on our poll, where as obama only pulls about 5% republican support. So that crossover appeal so to speak of romney's in florida and the independent edge that he appears to have is making a differce. But good campaigns can change polls. They're not changed by polls. And the question is who turns out their voters and who does it best. We're going to find out today. Today is the last day of early voting. And then on tuesday that's when the ball game is. 

[00:05:23]


>> Mark murray, let me bring you in. Both men have these op-eds in "the wall street journal." We have the headlines. Real progress, but we're not done. That's from the president. And governor romney, a new direction for america. What are your thoughts on just the headlines alone, not even the content of the op-ed itself. But those two different headlines. 
>> Well, right. They're actually two different realities. Actually, when you look in all the polls, it doesn't matter what it is. Democrats seem to be a whole lot more optimistic about the country's direction, or people who are actually planning to vote for obama are more optimistic people who are more pessimistic, republican voters are the republicans. And so you end up having this dichotomy, or in some respects it actually almost has a 50/50 split which is actually mirrored by a lot of the nationalls at show this contest to be incredibly close. I would say, and when you actually add the ecoc data we saw on friday from the jobs report, mitt romney's task is a little bit harder because he is actually saying, look, this has been a rough last four years, and it's time to actually good days are ahead, but the argument when you actua look at all the statistics that are out there, things are moving in the right direction as far as things are much better than they were four years ago, and even if mitt romney ends up winning the presidency on tuesday, he will end up inheriting a much better econ y than president obama did four years ago. 
>> That's interesting, eugene. Several months ago was an article that said insiders in the obama team were mortified at the thought that if governor romney wins the white house, that he would get credit for the recovery put in place by actions and decisions made by them. 
>> Absolutely. That's exactly what would happen. And there is nothing anybody can do about it. The sitting president is going to get credit for the good and the bad. Look, governor romney promises to add 12 million jobs in his first term. Most economists believe that given the direction of the recovery, if it picks up as expected, we're goi the gain 12 million jobs anyhow in the next four years. So most agree that the economy is going to get better, and whoever is president is going to get the credit. 

[00:07:28]


>> Let me tk to you a little bit about speaking of getting credit, the response to sandy. Part of the president -- and gentlemen, you can all take a look, as well as folks at home. President obama went to fema and washington, d.C. This morning. And this is what he had to say regarding the response to sandy. Let's play it. 
>> Leaders of different political parties working together to fix what is broken. 
[ Applause ] now it's a spirit that says no matter how bad a storm is, no matter how tough times are, we're all in this together. We rr fall as one nation and as one people. 
>> If we c pull up the marist poll, the nbc "wall street journal," the president's response to sandy. 73% approve in ohio. 70% out of florida. Marc caputo, let me bring you in because 70% of the people in the home state of yours approve of his handling. Will that have an impact on perhaps not early voter, but on tuesday those who look back and may have heard comments from the republican primary that were made by governor romney regarding fema. We know fema is still popular in that state for the obvious reasons. 
>> I think it would. Florida is a big state. We're a tv state. Our electorate makes its decisions largely on what they see on television, not what they read in the newspaper or on the internet. The coverage for a while befo during and after sandy, especially after sandy has been very favorable to president obama. You would think that's going to help, and it's still going on. Having chris christie as a de facto unintentional surrogate doesn't seem to hurt obama one bit. It probably seems help him. 
>> What is so interesting, you said chris christie, de facto endorser of obama. You've got this new article exclusive from politico saying there were people on governor romney's team who believed that chris kri city was the vp choice almost until the very ending, and surprise it's ryan. Isn't the timing interesting? 

[00:09:34]


>> It's a little too interesting. Look, there are two ways to react. Governor christie says I'm doing job. The president is doing his job. We're working together and I'm being honest. You have to respect that. Look at two different examples. Haley barbour who went through katrina in mississippi says that's absolutely what governor christy ought to say, he is doing what he has to do and get off his back. And you have the underground voices of the romney campaign who were taking a different tack and kind of sniping at christie at different angles, in a fit of pique basically. 
>> You can't really blame them. This is game theory. You choose a, I chooseho b. If my guy looks like he is helping you, even if he is not truly helping you, and appearance has a tendency to be a reality, I don't blame the romney folks for being a little piqued or po'ed. 
>> You may not blame them, but for showing it. Some of the conservatives who backed governor romney showing that they were quite irritated with this and rather take the gh road, knowing that all eyes are on this storm and the sponse. So marc, looking at these numbers, 73% of the folks in ohio, who already approved the bailout and now approve the president's response to sandy, what do we make of that when you couple it with the chris christie hug heard around the world it seems. We can't stop talking about it. 
>> The final full week of the campaign was a very good one for president obama. It gave him a lot of momentum heading into the final stretch. Not only did he get that hug from chris christie, people end up proving his response to hurricane sandy. There were a sle of battleground state polls including in ohio that showed obama ahead. There did seem to be momentum that he had had. And I think most importantly when you actually look back at hurricane sandy, and of course we don't know how election night is going to turn out, but it did freeze the romney campaign in place. And there wasn't a lot of talk of mitt romney for two or three weeks. He was the candidate who had the momentum. He was beginning to make his closing argument. And then hurricane sandy hit, and it froze that. And then the campaign began just a couple of days later. 

[00:11:46]


>> Which is interesting, marc, because you often hear, and i want all of you to comment on this. Any sport they say you don't want to peak too soon. With the unknown variable of the storm allowing the president to peak at this time, you do wonder without sandy, where would this race be tonit? 
>> You mean this is like one of the football games where the last team with the ball wins essentially? 
>> Well, the overtime stats, the person with the first touch on the ball wins most of the time. 
>> If you take that metaphor further, though, it's because people are looking for answers, and they're looking for solutions. And they w to believe in something. They want to be in somebody. It may be the last candidate with the football wins. 
>> I do wonder in florida, most polls agree that romney is nominally up, and he is up almost in all of the surveys, or a majority of them among independents. Again, that makes a huge difference. In the end, our state has a gher home foreclosure rate, a higher unemployment rate than the rest of the nation. Yeah that. 
>> See this stufftu on television. But in the the race is going to come down to jobs and a lot of folks are going to make a decision on at. And the race comes down now to who turns out the base. I would not underestimate the romney campaign in florida. They've got a very good team and they'rdoing a good job. They're staying closese to president obama, who in 2008 just slaughtered the republicans in early vote. It's not happening now, albeit president obama is still up. 
>> Mark rray, marc caputo, ewe gene robinson, thank you so much for having all you have guys on. 
>>> Up next -- 
>> those are people actually cheering on the streets of manhattan because lights are back on. Not because they won the lottery, but I guess it's the same thing when you have been without power for so many days. Five days after hurricane sandy hit. Up next, what kind of impact will sandy have on election day voting? We've got some fresh new information on how it couven affect, of course, the popular vote in the race for president. 
>>> Plus have, you heard this one? Rush on the big, big screen. What hollywood star is making a new movie about rush limbaugh? It is just one of the things we thought you should know. Will it be a flattering movie or a takedown? 

[00:13:59]

>>> Those are screams of joy in lower manhattan this morning when the lights came on for the first time since hurricane sandy hit. But across the region, millions are still without power, and the temperates are expected to DROP TONIGHT TO THE 30s. In fact, the coldest night since that storm reported in. In new york, nearly 800,000 people are still without power. In new jersey more than 1.3 million have no power. Also today, new measures aimed at easing a desperate fuel crisis went into effect as thousands continue to wait for gas for hours. They include rationing based on your license plate number in a dozen new jersey counties. It's come to that. And in new york, governor cuomo announced the defense department will set up emergency mobile gas stations in the new york area. By the way, the gas is free with a 10 gallon limit. 

[00:18:58]


>>> Officials predict voter turnout will take a hit in the east as people deal with the lingering problems from the storm. They say president obama stands to lose as many 340,000 votes across new york, new jersey, connecticut, and rhode island. These heavily democratic states, of course, are unlikely to change the outcome of the election. But it's interesting to note that number. The team also notes a turnout drop could be the difference in a close national elect, and thus could shape the political discourse over important policy issues in a possible obama second term. Joining me on the phone is william diamante for elections committee in nassau, new york. Thank you so much for joining me. 
>> Thank you for having me. 
>> I just understand you got out a big meeting what is the update on your county? 
>> We have 350 polling places. As of two days ago we had more than half of our polling places basically totally shut down with no power and no chance of getting them on. The governor intervened and ordered the long island power to make these a priority. A situation has now become manageable because we have about 50 poll sites with no power. Another 50 that are temporarily generated by obviously electrical generators. And we're trying to move the existing 50 that have no power and have to chance of getting power by tuesday into ather site or to actually power generate those sites also. 
>> Get moving them to the other sites, are we talking locations near where they would have voted, or are you looking at people already in dire straights having to trek pretty far distances? 
>> We're trying keep as much normalcy as possible. The situation we're coming into, we have the long beach barrier island. The entire city is without power, without water, without sewage, which there is still 20,000 people there we're going to electrify three temporary -- I'm sorry, four temporary super polling sites across the barrier island that serves 40,000 voters. And each one will be a walkable site for anybody on the island. And where we have my community of oceanside has no power and no chance of getting power most likely by next tuesday. We're going to have to divide up our 13 polling sites into probably three or four polling sites that make it either walkable or a short drive that will not burn up a lot of gas for people. 

[00:21:29]


>> I'm curious. I don't want to put you on the spot. But percentage-wise, how many people do you believe will be impacted? So much so that they won't even vote on tuesday as a result of the problems they're dealing with. In many cases not even having a home? 
>> Well, I think that's going to be a large impact, because in long beach, we had -- we have 20,000 people there according to state homeland security there is 30,000 residents on the island. So 10,000 people are not there. A third of the people are not there. They either went to famies in different areas or are on shelters on the north shore or they're in other communities. We're not sure if they are willing to come back to the island that is in such bad shape to vote when they have to get their own lives together. Have I members of my own staff that lost their homes. 
>> Right. 
>> And they're not here because they have to put their lives back together. That's going on across the island. 
>> All right, william. Thank you very much. I greatly appreciate you this. Is nassau county, a glimpse of what is happening in that county. But it is a repeated story line in other areas throughout the northeast. Thank you so myoh. 
>>> And now I want to take you to milwaukee, wisconsin, the president speaking at yet another rally in that big state. Let's take a look. 
>> First came into office, asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more. So we could reduce our deficit and invest in the skills and ideas of our people. And you know, at the time the republican cgress and a senate candidate by the name of mitt romney vote -- they said that bill clinton's plan would hurt the economy and kill jobs. Does that sound familiar? That's what they said. It turns out their math was just as bad back then as it is now. Because -- because by the end of bill clinton's second term, america had created 23 million new jobs and a incomes were up and poverty was down, and our deficit had turned into a surplus. So wisconsin, we know what ideas work. We know our ideas work. And we know that their ideas don't work. We know it. And the reason we know it is we just tried it a few years ago. After bill clinton was out of office, they tried their ideas. We tried giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest americans. We tried giving insurance compies and wall street a free rein to do whatever they play. What we got is falling incomes, record deficits, slowest job growth in 50 years and an economic crisis that we're still cleaning our way out of. So -- so we know what works and we know what doesn't. And governor romney now is a very talented salesman. So in this campaign, he is trying as hard as he can to repackage the same old ideas that didn't work and offer them up achange. He is saying he is the candidate of change, lo and behold. Now here is the thing, though. We know what change looks like. And what governor romney is offering ain't it. Giving more power to the biggest banks, that's not change. Another $5 trillion tax cut to the wealthiest americans, that's not change. Refusing to answer details about your policies until after the election, that's definitely not change. We've heard that from politicians before. 

[00:25:04]


>> Again, a glimpse of the campaign speech the president has been giving to supporters all day long as he crisscrosses these battleground states. He is in wisconsin. Members of his team has said wisconsin is in play paul ryan, that is his home state. The president giving the stump speech he has prepare and passionately delivering across the country. I want to let you see some other battleground state newspaper headlines. You can see how this playing out at least in some of those papers. First, florida orlando sentinel. Get out the vote. Smart phones and cab lets are being used as weapons in the final battle. In the new hampshire valley news, they say the state braces for voter id. Those who don't have a photo id will be able to vote in new hampshire, they'll just have to sign an affidavit attesting they are who they say they are. An a headline in the telegraph herald, voter turnout already. 29%, 43% of early voters are registered democrats. 32%, republican. Joining us once again, nbc news senior political editor mark murray. We listened to the president's stump speech, that's the speech he has been giving now, the same speech throughout the country. Obviously the message the is interesting in that bill clinton is part of the president's sealing the deal. He is pointing back again to what mitt romney is offering up in his words are the same old ideas that we saw in the bush years. And we saw what happened with the economy. That's the story line that seems to be the finishing argument for the president. 
>> Well, that's right. And mitt romney, his closing speech, what he has actually been saying on the stump is that he is the candidate of change that if he is elected, things will change anange for the better. But you've actually see from president obama as well as former president bill clinton the message that mitt romney and the policies that he actually ends up standing for, and that's actually tax cuts for the wealthy, and also to get rid of a lot of regulations is the same thing that actually was practiced in the george w. Bush administration. President obama isn't using george w. Bush's name, but the message is actually pretty crystal clear. And you're seeing these two competing closing arguments at the very end. 

[00:27:13]


>> With that being the argument from the president that, you know, especially before hurricane sandy it was when mitt romney unveiled this notion that he is the change candidate here, how has his campaign, or have they effectively fought back that what he is offering back at this late game, 3, 2, 1, what we is a at the bottom, he offering anything that proves he would in fact bring in change? 
>> Well, he hasn't rebutted those criticisms of how his policies are different than george w. Bush's. The one he has pointed out, and he did this at the debate is he would actually balance the budget, something that george w. Bush didn't do. So that's where he says he would be different. But when you actually look at a lot of the advisers, a lot of the economic policies, they do seem the same. And he hasn't really rebutted that. But what he is actually doing is making the argument, look, if you've been unsatisfied in the last four years, if you're out of a job, if you're dissatisfied by the change of pace, vote for me. And that is change. That's what he is actually trying to sell. 
>> And quickly, I want to talk to you about the senate races, particularly those where there is a female candidate. Quickly, massachusetts rates, elizabeth warren is up 53% over scott brown, 46%. Wisconsin, we see tammy baldwin, 48% over thompson, 47, which is a surprise I think to a lot of people in that race in wisconsin. MISSOURI, claire McCaskill 49% ahead of akin. He has no backing from the establishment and the reprehensible comments that he made. Nevertheless, this is turning out to be an intesting story line with female senate candidates, mark. 1992 was billed as the year of the women. There were a ton of womenhat won election to the u.S. Senate. Tamron, I wouldn't be surprised if we see a whole lot of women both win election and win REELECTION COME NOVEMBER 6th. You mentioned some of the democratic women who are running. There are actually a lot of republican women. And even if they don't win their contests, they're running some of the best campaigns this cycle. Deb fisher in nebraska, linda lingle in hawaii there are lat of women running. 

[00:29:25]


>> Close to $100 million of her own money in one of her campaign ads. She points out she went through bankruptcy and pulled hlf up, which would certainly be an appealing message to some voters on either side. We'll see what happens in the races e we're keeping our eye on I guess the year of women 2.0, or whatever they call these things these days. Thank you so much, mark. Great pleasure. 
>>> Coming up, if president obama wins, could his victory be a template for democratic victories for years to come, a template maybe your kids' kids will be talking about? 
>>> Plus, no booze on election day? Wtf! Why there is a ban, yeah, I said it. Why is there a ban on alcohol in some states? Some people are going to need a stiff drink.

>>> More now on all the attention the campaigns are pouring in ohio. By the time elect day arrives, the candidates, including their running mates and wives will have held at least ten rallies this weekend alone. Msnbc's chris jansing joins us live from mentor, ohio, where president obama visited just a few hours ago. So chris, you have been able to talk with people. This is your home state. I love that unique perspective balanced with you being a journalist. What are folks saying there? What is important there? 
>> Well, it's not just my home state, tamron, this is my home county. I grew up not very far from here. And look, the president had two clear messages here. One is vote. In fact, he said bring your friends, bri your neighbors, bring your boyfriend, bring your girlfriend. But it also was an economic message, which is the one that has been resonating here for him in ohio. A very important audience for him, white working class voters, because this is an area that is 95% white. It was very, very tight election in 2008, less than 1%, although barack obama did win. They think they have an advantage this time around because of the resurgent auto industry. Remember, one out of every eight jobs in ohio is in the auto industry. The vast majority of counties, 82 of 88 have some jobs related to the auto industry. And the obama campaign think there's has been some backlash against that romney ad talking about the auto bailout that has been widely discredited. In addition to that, they believe that they've been seeing a lot of early voting here. Now the romney campaign is not conceding anything. They're going to be in obama territory tomorrow. They're going to be in cuyahoga county in cleveland, which is very strongly obama territory. But they believe, the romney campaign, if they can hold barack obama's margins down, if they can get what they call the occasional voter out, that they have a chance still here in ohio, even though the latest polls show advantage obama. And one last thing about cleveland. Today, so imagine this, you're at an early voting poll, a car drives up, and who gets out but stevie wonder. And he says come on and vote. And if you go to the pol and vote, I'll sing a song for you. So apparently some success for barack obama on that front. The president will also be back in ohio tomorrow. Tamron? 

[00:36:04]


>> That is the funniest. I don't know why I started to visualize me getting out of a car and seeing stevie wonder. It took me to a whole different place there thank you very much, chris. 
>> Imagine you're just thinking you're going to early voting and stev wonder shows up. That's not bad. 
>> Total dream come true. Thank you so much, chris jansing. Let's bring in the "newsnation" political pandemic, malika henderson, a stevie wonder panda fan, keith boykin, also stevie wonder fan, and not because we're all three people of color. Everyone loves stevie wonder. Let me put that out. I don't want people to say oh, they just love stevie wonder because of that. We all love stevie wonder. I digress. Speaking of race in this race, obama's demographic gamble. It says in part, obama is likely to get blown out among white voters on election day, narrowly lose independents nationwide, and may yet still win. Based on historic margins among people that often lean democratic, but don't necessarily vote at high stakes, latinos, african-americans, young people and unmarried women. Keith, basic point of this article is that the template, if obama wins, will be one that democrats perhaps will follow for years to come. But you heard there in chris's report in ohio, they believe a white working class voters. But it's an interesting article. What do you make of this template change or demographic change for democrats? 
>> Bill clinton had a word for, this and it's called arithmetic. And you know, that's what president obama has done in his campaign very wisely. He realized early on that the demographics in the electorate are changing. They've changed dramatically ll over the past four to eight years. We have a declining white vote and larger hispanic and african-american vote. And that's starting to make a fference in terms of the outcome you need. 38 to 40% in order to win the white vote. But there is a problem here for mitt romney and the republicans, because they haven't really focused on the latino vote. They haven't really focused -- they actually conceded the african-american vote. And you can't win elections in the future if you give up the quote/unquote minority vote. Beuse sooner or later it's not going to be the minority. 

[00:38:18]


>> Let me bring you in on this. Listen, keith brings up the african-american vote. It probably is not a surprise that governoromney would concede that base for obvious reasons. But the latino vote, particularly in nevada, another key state that we're watching here. There was jucouple of days ago that the romney campaign ran this ad attempting to link the president to hugo chavez and fidel castro that is probably not a way to get latino voters to I guess appreciate your economic plan since he says he's got this five-point plan. 
>> Well, one of the things that is interesting here, that is an ad that actually might work in florida. The hispanic community in florida is made up of cubans and venezuelans. If you look at the polls that. 
>> Do care about this administration's policy in terms of some of these countries and in terms of south american countries. So that's a ploy I think will work in florida. Noto much in nevada where there are more mexicans. You're right. This idea of focusing on foreign policy rather than on economic policy, not a good play. You saw mitt romney try to do that early on. He was in texas, for instance, early on in this race, and talking about those issues. But, again, in texas, that's a state he is going to win. Have I been quite surprised that you haven't seen mitt romney out on the stump with people like susana martinez. He hasn't been out with brian sandoval. 
>> You've named those names. And to that point the ad i referred to might appeal to cuban americans in florida. But we know he has to extend his reach to the latino community beyond florida. With that said, I don't know what he would present on the table with immigration, but he has allies that are available to him, successful latinos within his own party that he has not reached out to broaden a message of, I don't know, economic recovery or whatever, the american dream story that susana martinez forever offered up at the rnc. 

[00:40:19]


>> Yeah, very powerful message. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> You heard from that governor. And inreality, the republicans have a very deep bench when it comes to latino statewide officials. Marco rubio, of course. And you had seen early on that mitt romney was stumping in florida with marco rubio. They had cut an ad linking marco rubio to medicare and sort of trying to take off some of the negative aspects of paul ryan's plan. But I don't think they -- in my sense -- 
>> I got to transition us real quick because the bottom of my screen says betting on the buckeye. And ijoe, thank you for joining us. Former psident bill clinton on these jeep ads that have been running from governor romney. Let me play it. 
>> When I was a kid and I got caught with my hand in a cookie jar, I sort of slug mid shoulders, my face got red, and I took my hand out of the cookie jar. This guy gets caught with his hand in the cookie jar, he digs down and gets some more cookies. I mean they -- they actually -- they actually increased the ad on an ad they knew was false because they think you're dumb. I think you're smart and I think obama will be the next president. 
>> Owill have beenly the former president referring to the ads where the romney ads where jeep and gm were moving jobs to china, the leadership of these auto companies have said that's not true. How is that all playing out in ohio? I'm curious. 
>> I think it's one of the things that is hurting him down the stretch. You know, if there are seven or 70 or 7,000 undecided voters in ohio, I can't imagine this would be helping him with it. Especially like you say you've had not just the fact checkers who the romney campaign said they're going to ignore that this is false and editorial pages like ours pointing out these ads are false. 

[00:42:23]


>> Right. 
>> You actually have the heads of these two major companies who really, these people try to stay out of politics, especially in a very close election. For them to come out and say very strong things about the falseness of these allegations and the things that are in the ads is pretty startling. And I don't think it can hp him. 
>> And joe, as I i understand it, there were even workers who called in to their plant bosses and said am I losing my job because they had heard this story, that jobs were going to be going out to china that would be upsetting in itself. But do we -- I guess what I'm asking is when you have bill clinton saying they think you're dumb. Do the people the that you've spoken to feel as if they're -- maybe the come any campaign is trying to trick them with these ads? That's a very powerful word to say. They think you're dumb. That's what former president bill clinton set on the stump. 
>> It's a very hard thing to figure. I've been trying to figure out who the audience for this ad is supposed to be. There are some who think it's really about firing up the base, although all we've heard for months is how fired up the republican base. So it's a little hard to figure there are republican -- the republicans know that this whole car issue has been hurting them. They have tried in recent weeks constantly in ohio on the stump. They talk about it. And they bring it up in several contexts. One is he just did what romney said, which isn't exactly true. But they have made that argument. They have also made the argument, well, it really hasn't been all that good, because look, some plants have closed. Some dealerships have closed, which igno, sir it for about a decade. Anybody who looked at the auto industry said that they were vastly over capacity and designed for a world marketplace that no longer existed. And now they're trying to say well, gee whiz, the wolf is back at the door. It's hard for me to figure out what this strategy is about. Maybe it's about basin sitement. These people don't want to believe anything the president has done has worked. 
>> We're out of time. Keith, we'll talk more and have you on in the next few days. Thank you, keith, thank you nia-malik henderson and thank you joe as well. 

[00:44:32]


>>> Here is a bit of what mill maher had to say on his show last night. 
>> This is the tipping point for people believing in global warming. 
>> Well, it is? Up next, I'll talk to a "huffington post" writer who says no matter what sandy's link to climate change is, does it matter? 
>>> But first, there is a lot going on day. Here are some things we just thought you who know. Have you heard this one? Jo cusack is set to play rush limbaugh in a new film. Yes, the actor's production company is said to be putting the finishing touches on the script or the movie. The production slated to start next year. Any resemblance there? 
>>> Voters in kentucky and south carolina are going to have a sober tuesday. Those interest only states with laws on the books banning the sale of alcoholic beverages on election day. That means liquor stores, restaurants, everywhere. The laws, by the way, a holdover from the prohibition era. 
>>> And a programing te. Chris matthews will interview vice president joe biden on a special edition of "hardball" tomorrow night, 7:00 eastern on msnbc. ???????????? swenson today. So, I'm happy. Sales go up... I'm happy. It went out today... I'm happy. What if she's not home? 
(Together) she won't be happy use ups! She can get a text alert, reroute... Even reschedule her package. It's ups my choice. Are you happy? I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. 
(Together) happy. I love logistics. 

[00:48:55]


>>> Welcome back. In endorsing barack obama this week, new york city mayor michael bloomberg cited the president's record on climate change. Quote, the devastation that hurricane sandy brought to new york city and much of the northeast in lost lives, lost homes and lost business brought the stakes of tuesday's presidential election into sharp relief. Bloomberg compared the two candidates saying one sees climate change as an urgent problem that threatens our planet. One does not. I want our president to place scientific evidence and risk management above electoral politics. As bill maher pointed out last night on his show, the business of bloomberg put this I this week even more bluntly. 
>> It's global warming, stupid. I want to ask this question that I asked james. Is this a tipping point for people believing in global warming? 
>> "Huffington post" senior writer tom zeller jr. Asks a different question. Sandy's link to climate change, does it matter? He joins me now. What were you thinking when you posed that estion? 
>> Well, I think to a lot of minds, this storm when it came through was sort of a teachable moment as it results to climate change. But there was also this internal quibbling over does this -- can we tie this particular storm to climate change? Do we have proof that climate change is happening. I think a lot of folks kind of got caught up in that debate. And a lot of climate scientists that I spoke to thought it seemed a bit of a distraction. We have a climate that has fundamentally changed. It's a wmer planet. The baseline is different now. But we don't quite have the ability to say this particular storm is attribute to climate change. So it's a distraction. 
>> One of the things I love about your piece, I don't know how many scientistious have on speed dial, but se of the best in siness. He says some people would like people to believe because we don't know everything, we know nothing. Because you cannot answer all of the questions, you have a group of people who say then we know nothing. It's still not proven. 

[00:51:00]


>> I think that's true there are different motivations there. Some people have a vested interessowing doubt. There is a lot of uncertainty. It seems like a faraway problem. 
>> How is it such a faraway problem. I believe it was cuomo, this notion of 100-year storms, hen they happen every year, you can no longer call them that. And you have another scientist that pointed out the ravages of sandy may be helping to refocus political and popular attention to the problem. Whether or not that attention will sustain after a long cleanup is ove unclear that was jennifer morgan, the director of climate and energy problem for world energy institute. 
>> We have very short memories, right? It's not just as it relates to climate change. It relates to a lot of things. I think the success of storms, the storms we had last year, hurricane irene caused a lot of damage here. We had the freak snowstorm. I think a lot of this is sort of solidifying in people's minds that something is happening, you know, whether or not any particular storm, it has the fingerprint of climate change on it, we don't know. But it's certainly what I think it was oppenheimer in the piece said it's a teachable moment in a lot of ways, no matter where the storm came from. 
>> But it's only teachable if people want to learn. 
>> People want to listen. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> Sure. 
>> It's a great piece. I so suggest people go on and take a look at it. 
>>> Ow "newsnation" gut check is up next. Do you think the candidates are focusing too much on ohio? That is our gutcheck question. Does ohio matter as much as everything thinks it is? 
>> Democracy plaza is powered by windows 8. ] time drop? Campbell's has 24 new soups that will make it drop over, and over again. ?????? ?????? from jammin' jerk chicken, to creamy gouda bisque. See what's new from campbell's. It's amazing at soup can do. gray, but kate -- still looks like...Kate. Nice'n easy with colorblend technology gives expert highlights and lowlights. For color that's true to you. I don't know how she does it. With nice'n easy, all they see is you. , 

[00:55:52]

They're all hard workers, putting together what I think is an extraordinary setup, the best technology available. Accurate technology, which is most important on that night.

And of course the ladies on the team as well who worked so hard to make it pretty awesome to work here. Time for a second saturday edition of the news nation gut check. This is a busy weekend for the presidential candidates as may make their final push before election day. We told you earlier a lot of their time spent in ohio.. We've talked exhaustively about ohio, a phenomenal state, we know, that a state that matters. What does your gut tell you? Are the campaigns focus together much on ohio? There are some who believe that maybe the math has changed. Go to facebook.Com/newsnation to cast your vote. And thank you so much for this special edition of "newsnation." We greatly appreciate your time. "Newsnation" will be back monday, 2:00 p.M. Right here on msnbc. And we are live from democracy plaza through election day. Now with alex wagner is up next.

With just three days left to election day, a week of crisis management has put the president in poll position, while the romney has begun to hear whispers of doubt. Plus, planned parenthood's cecil richards joins us to discuss the gender gap, and why a romney presidency could put women in the aback machine. And arizona senate candidate richard carmona.

We play a little bit of sound from the candidates in the last 24 hours. Everybody is making their final pitches. However, given the week that we have just had, it seems like mitt romney has more of an uphill climb that perhaps he even thought he would at this point in the race. I will call to your attention a tweet from rupert murdoch who tweetsow christie, while thanking o., Must redeclare for romney or take blame for next four dire years. 
>> Which to me is the kind of hysteria on that side that oh my god, I mean I get the interim republican problem with chris christie appearing like a rational person with the president. But really, to suggest that that -- that his recommitment to romney will have any serious affect to make up the space that they're apparently behind says to me they're deeply concerned. 

[00:04:02]


>> We've talked about how this whole thing is balancing on a knife's edge, right, eric? That the polls are close and so forth. But it's also republicans have worked for mitt romney. If a big gust of wind comes, it's like the whole party gets knocked down. I will also point out karl rove saying if you hadn't had the storm, there would have been more of a chance for the romney campaign to talk about the deficit, the debt, when there is a stuter in the campaign, when you have attention drawn away to somewhere else, it is not to romney's advantage. Which is fairly obvious, but he doesn't need to be saying that right now. 
>> It really started a month ago when the republicans started looking for someone to blame. It really started a little while ago. They got a little wind under their sails and that died down a little bit. But really four or six weeks ago you started seeing this happen there is no question what is going to happen if romney loses is the far right is going to blame tonight middle. They're going to say see, this is what happens when you don't run a true conservative. And that's going to be their narrative. And limbaugh and company previewed that a month ago. We already know what that narrative is going to be like. But if t fact that they're looking for someone to blame already is not a good sign. 
>> The weather, chris christie, it doesn't matter. 
>> The storm, but also I was going to say jumping on eric's point, chris christie will probably be in the bull's-eye. Rush limbaugh I think yesterday or two days ago already unleashed a whole torrent of abuse on chris christie because as kurt said, he was rational as a republican governor of a state that had been decimated by a horrible, horrible storm, and working with the president to ensure that the people of his state got the help that they needed. And yet that's not good enough for rush limbaugh. And -- 
>> I think it was an athema to rush limbaugh. 
>> He is a fat fool, the ultimate pot calling the kettle black. 
>> Well, I think it really goes to a larger point of how bizarre this all is, where the thing that interrupted the campaign, the thing that sort of made, you know, everything sort of fall off the rails was reality, right. The thing that -- actually governing. Having our government and our leaders do what they're supposed to do that. Is what is making everything so insane. Well got off message. We can't talk about the deficit and the debt and all these imaginary numbers. 

[00:06:27]


>> In a vacuum about our ideology. 
>> Exactly. 
>> It sort of runs straight on to actual reality. I do want the talk a little bit about chris christie because politico has a new story out today talking about the romney choice of christie and how it all went down. Politico rates romney was so close to picking christie that some top advisers believe that the governed had been offered the job. Then he settled on ryan the day after returning. Now look. I'm sure everybody in this campaign is going to have a story aboutt all shook down. But the fact is, if they somehow alienated chris christie, perhaps that is some explanation independent of t fact that i think chris christie really believes in the job he has to do and showing leadership in a time of is. You got to think there were a lot of bear hugs given to the president while he was in new jersey touring the damage. And I don't begrudge him for doing that. But it had to make the romney team uncomfortable, especially at this point in time. 
>> No, absolutely. I think the problem is that we're seeing everyone start to sort of reorient towards the postmortem on this campaign. And I think that's a real problem. We've got, you know, chris christie actually just being the lead they're the people of new jersey elected him to be, and that's this sort of time bomb for the campaign. It's very strange. 
>> Here is why the romney campaign in boston probably is uncomfortable with what chris christie was doing. He was their number one attack dog. Remember, he was the keynote speaker at the convention. He was the one that was able to not only throw the red meat and then stand in front of the crowd an just tear it apart and everyone would cheer and scream. And hurricane sandy comes threw, and he is gone. He is not filling that role anymore hi, see also the guy who in that keynote speech could barely bring himself to say mitt romney's name. It wasn't like he was the most ardent romney lover. 
>> And even when he was -- he was one of the first guys out of the gate to endorse romney, which I think is surprising. Constitutionally they seem like such different people. I have been saying for a while on the show, and I believe this is true. You know, part of my problem with mitt romney's candidacy is I feel he has an incredibly crass view of the american ic, and really doesn't hold them in particularly high regard in so far he has changed his position on all of these issues numerous times. He has felt no need to give us any specifics on any of his policy prescriptions. And his assumption is they won't notice. The "washington post" in their editorial board of wch you are a member writes through all the flip-flops, there has been one consistency in the campaign of republican presidential nominee mitt romney, a contempt for the electorate. Mr. Romney seems to be betting that voters have no memories, poor arithmetic skills, and a general inability to look behind the curtain. We hop the results tuesday prove him wrong. Eric, jonathan, jonathan, why don't we go to you first. 

[00:09:20]


>> The problem we have had as an editorial board with mitt romney, it's encapsulated in that editorial. Read it online and it will be in the paper tomorrow. 
>> Www washingtonpost.Com. 
>> Where the problem with mitt romney is he says something on monday. It's something different by monday afternoon which is completely different or gone back to where he was on monday by tuesday. He won't tell us anything about his tax plans. We know he is going to reduce the rates by 20%. But at the debate he said let's just say $25,000. He pulls figures out of thin air. And he thinks he can be elected president of the united states. On vapor, really. 
>> Yes, yes. 
>> And so it got under the skin of us on the board. We endorsed the president last week for reelection. It wasn't a sis boom-bah rah-rah ra. We have a genery where he wants to take the country. Mitt romney not so much. 
>> Saying you know me. You know what I'm about. You may not agree with everything I have done in the past four years, but you know me. And post sandy speaking with a renewed enthusiasm. David axquoted yesterday in lima ohio. This might be one of my favorite quotes of the campaign. Says I've known him for 20 years. We've worked closely for ten years. I've never seen him more exhilarated than he is right now. You can see in this speech that he I delivering that this is coming from his loins. 
>> And loins isn't a word that gets into the public conversation. 
>> Not enough. 
>> It's interesting. I've been interested to see the republicans, the sensible reasonable moderate republicans like david fromm yesterday who explained on the daily beast who explained why he is voting for romney the republican party is irrational, destructive, I don't want obama care repealed. He goes on and on this whole list of things. And that's why I'm voting for obama. To me, if indeed governor romney loses, the -- how this fissure between the mainstream and the tail that is wagging its dog, the tea party, how that's going to play out. As you say, eric, there will be conservatives saying oh, we should have nominated santorum. But it's obviously a more complicated problem for them than that. And it's going to be, again, if indeed the president is re-elected, the republican arguments afterward are going to be fascinating. 

[00:12:00]


>> You know what they need? They need an impassioned centrist in the repcan party that can speak from his or her loins. I just wanted to say the word loins again for everybody watching this broadcast.

>>> With all the iss??es facing the country, governor romney has focused on for the last three months, he is going to get rid of planned parenthood. By the way, he doesn't even know he doesn't control planned parenthood. He should talk to big bird. He is gone. 

[00:16:15]


>> That was vice president joe biden earlier today taking aim at governor romney's vow to eliminate funding for planned parenthood. Thisear single ladies could play the deciding role, with 55 million of them eligible to vote. According to a recent pugh poll, president obama is whomping, i believe that's a technical term, mitt romney by 25 points among that group. In many respects, the election has become a choice between the past versus the future, ahoice between a bygone e and a brave new world. Joy reed explores this dynamic, writing it takes for granted that billy might have two moms or two dads, or that the ceo might be a she. It could care less if guys serve in the military. It can't imagine abortion or conservatives being illegal. I thinks madmen is a good tv show, but so is the walking dead. Cecil richards is the president of planned parentho. And today she is joining us behalf of the obama campaign. Part of my favorite thing is how much I get to see you. Thanks for joining the program, as always. 
>> Thanks for having me back. 
>> Cecil, the numbers on women voting in this election, and the number of women who are single, I quoted that, 25% is a shocking margin. I wonder what you make of that. And then let's talk about this gender gap clothing, the myth making in the romney campaign, which "the huffington post" says really was at end of the day just a little bit of residual bump from the first debate performance. 
>> Yeah. The gender gap isn't closing. If anything, I'm out here in ohio today. And what we're seeing, I think this election is coming down to who do you trust. And women know they simply can't trust mitt romney. I mean he is obviously willing to say anything to get elected. And every woman has met a guy who will tell you one thing and do another. And that really is I think why we're seeing this -- particularly with young women, they're saying president obama has been there for them. He has been on health care issues, on equal pay issues, and he is a guy you can trust with your future. 

[00:18:20]


>> Cecil, I wonder what you make of him. We talk a lot about mitt romney's late stage pitch to the middle. A politicalcientist at ohio state says as far as mitt romney and his strategy to be a more sort of lovable candidate, at this point in the campaign, we're switching from who we're going to line up with -- who we're going to line up with you to get at your supporters to turn out. Romney didn't start running that compassionate strategy until it was probably too late. Too many people have probably already made up their minds. Could he ever have embarked on a compassionate strategy? Is there run in the republican party for someone who doesn't want to defund planned parenthood or does believe in a woman's right to choose? 
>> That's just not who mitt romney is. He has pledged repeatedly he would be delighted to sign a bill overturning roe. He wants to get rid of planned parenthood. Just hope to goodness that women don't know his position. This is where we're seeing the enthusiasm is on the president's side. Frankly, I'm in columbus, ohio. And I've been to phone banks. I've been to canvas operations. And there are women everywhere coming out of the woodwork who are volunteering for president, and who are turning out to vote. 
>> Heather, I want to bring you in here. You know, part of the problem that romney has had, he has not tried the say too, too much on anything related to women. But then he appears in ads with people ike richard mourdock, and the republican party is filled with these whackos that say the things they do and can't help themselves. Bill clinton had plenty to say about richard mourdock yesterday. Let's take a listen to what he had to say. 
>> The nominee who defeated him said he wanted to go to washington to bring more partisanship, that his idea of a happy day was enforcing his opinion on someone else. I don't want and governor romney endorsed the guy. We cannot afford to put the white house and the congress in the hands of people who say it is my way or the highway. 

[00:20:25]


>> Now he -- clinton is of course focusing on mourdock's partisanship. But calling attention to the relationship that the two men have. And romney has not disavowed richard mourdock or walked back his endorsement in any way. 
>> I think it's very clear. People say oh, he was misconstrued, mourdock was. But he is reflecting what was an incredibly extreme policy position that is in the republican party platform, which is saying that there should be no abortion even in the cases of rape or incest. And that's something honestly as a young woman, I never thought we would be having that conversation actually at this point in time. So of course. I think mitt romney has to walk this line of sort of recalling his former massachusetts moderate ways, playing the way he did during the primary, which was incredibly right-wing on these issues, and then saying that, you know, I'd be happy to sign a bill outlawing roe v. Wade, but then he also said around the first debate when we saw the new etch a sketch romney, he said he didn't know of any bill that he would want to pass to limit abortion. It was really quite shocking. And with no information there, you have to go with where the heart of the party is. 
>> Right. 
>> Because that's actually where laws are generated is in congress. And that's a very scary place for women. 
>> Cecil, you've been at the helm of this stuff for a while. Why in your opinion is the heart of the republican party where it is right now as far as women's reproductive issues? How did they get to this point? WE KNOW IN THE LATE '70s AND EARLY '80s THEY BEGAN TO COURT Social conservatives. It feels like we are literally ving arguments that were settled on 50 years ago. 
>> Oh, absolutely. That's what women are saying to me out here in ohio. They can't believe we're fighting about whether women should get access to birth control. But that's actlly what is happening. Mitt romney has taken a position he wants to allow employers to refuse to allow birth control in insurance plans. Alex I don't think that is the heart the republican party. I think that mitt romney and the folks that are running, some of the folks that he is supporting, todd akin, richard mourdock, these interest mt extreme part of the republican party. Because the bedrock of the republican party was historically small government and keep government out of your personal lives. That's why I think they are on completely the wrong tangent, and that's why republican women, many are going to cross over this november. 

[00:22:43]


>> I do think you're right there. I think this is an issue that women cross the aisle on. Thank you as always to planned parenthood, cecile richards.

>>> The stakes are high, arizona. I urge you to send jeff flake to the senate and he'll help get america back on track. 
>> That was a new ad for arizona senate candidate jeff flake, featuring mitt romney. The gop initially thought it had buttoned up the race to replace republican senator jon kyl, but in the days leading up to the election, democrat richard carmona, a moderate democrat with puerto rican roots has turned this into one of the most hotly contested races in the unto can. One reason? He is highlighting the difficult and troubled relationship with arizona's changing demographics. According to the national association of latino elected and pointed officials, latino turnout in arizona is expected to jump by 23% this year. A boost that could help carmona become the first democrat to represent arizona in the senate in nearly two decades. Joining us now from phoenix is the man himself, dr. Richard carmona. Dr. Carmona, thanks for joining us in this home stretch. I know you have a lot of work. I wanted to talk to you first about the contours of this race, which a lot of republicans thought was basically buttoned up, that jeff flake would be the inheriter of jon kyl's seat. I want to know to your mind, how much has the latino vote in particular and the policies put in place by governor brewer and sheriff joe arpaio and maricopa county, how much of that has made this a much closer than expected race? 
>> Hi, alex. It's a pleasure to be with you. I think it's very close because of some of the extremist potics that you are alluding to. Whether it's the sheriff, the senator, russell pearce, all with those extreme views that are very, very painful, hurtful, and vitriolic, and I think it's inspiring the hispanic community as well as moderate democrats and republicans across the board that they're rejecting that, because that type of discussion doesn't really represent us in arizona. 
>> Well, the other thing it seems to be doing is really creating a lot of enthusiasm among the latino population in terms of turning out the votes, I think. Community groups say they have register in order than 34,000 latino voters. 

[00:32:35]


>> Right. 
>> Due to the arpaio reelect race and your race. 
>> Well, it has. I mean I think a lot of the people who were sitting on the sidelines are irate now. They're tired of this. They're tired of being marginalized. They see me as a reasonable candate. They've known me for decades as a police officer, as a doctor, as a professor, and as surgeon general of the united states. They trust me, and I am latino as well. And they're very proud that they may have the opportunity to elect the first latino u.S. Senator in arizona. 
>> I want to open this up to our panel a little bit. Eric, we were looking at this electoral college map which has reds and blues and so forth. We talk about the direction of each party. And in reality, the gop, regardless of where it ends up on november 6th I think understands behind closed doors that they ve a problem. In terms of the long-term prospects for the party, unless they figure out a way to build a bigger tent that. 
>> Don't have a future past 2016. 
>> It's really remarkable when you look at their strategy that they're trying to eek out one more election on the old game plan, basically. And the game plan's got to change. And they've got to know that long-term. They're playing the short-term ga here. What is interesting, and what i would be interesting in hearing dr. Carmona comment on, he is from the state that really gave us the godfather of that game plan, barry ldwater. A lot of what is going on now is a legacy of his failed '64 campaign that reagan took forward and made real. So what has changed in arizona obviously besides the shifting demographics? Is there anything else there? Is it the aging population? What is it that has arizona so close to tipping the other direction, finally after soany years? 
>> Dr. Carmona? 
>> Yes, I mean I think you're hitting the nail right on the head. The demographics are changing. I think the people are rejecting the extremism. The latinos are starting to speak up and not allowing themselves to be marginalized. They want a seat at the table. They want to help and determine their own destiny. So you're seeing the people rise up. And I think it's a very unique time in arizona. We see it throughout the southwest. People are rejecting this extremist approach to politics, and they want moderation. I represent that I'm resonating with them. We have a great gup of republicans, moderate republicans, women republicans especially who don't want their reproductive rights legislated by a group of men who don't understand the issues. So all of that is playing very positive for me. 

[00:34:51]


>> Heather, we talk about how the top of the ticket influences down ballot. But in arizona in particular, because you have sheriff joe on the ticket, it's almost a reminder. And could actually in a weird way be the -- show the inverse of that, which is someone at the bottom of the ticket influencing how you vote at the top of the ticket. Oh, sheriff joe, he represents these sort of draconian policies around immigration. I'm not going to vote for his party at the top of the politics. 
>> Yeah, politics can be really local. I think you're seeing that with christie as well. When it comes down to it, the things that really come close to home are what ends up being symbols for this larger conversation that we're having at the national level. And I was thinking actually about arizona being a state, dr. Carmona, where you have actually, it's one of the few states where you have clean elections in the state. So the statewide candidates are actually funby sort of citizen-owned campaign finance, which is a really fantastic reform that we really could be seeing at the federal level. And I just wonder, I feel like campaign finance reform is one of those sleeper issues that might sort of explode in the next few years in the new congress. I wonder if youe anything to say about sort of bringing that kind of clean election system to washington with you. 
>> Well, I think that it's an important point that you're making. I think the biggest problem we see today, though, the election financing is really the citizens united issue. People are very concerned that there is an influx of a huge amount of money by people who have no reason other than they want to control seats here, congress and senate. And look, in my race just to speak of that one, where just last week they poured in about $6 million in negative ads from external sources, all to attempt to discredit me. This race should be about arizonans for arizonans, and not influenced by people outside who simply want to control a seat to get control of the senate or in some cases congress. 
>> Thank you to dr. Richard carmona. We know you have a tight race ahead, and we'll be following it closely. Thanks for your time, sir. 
>> Thank you very much. Pleasure to be with you.

>>> Six billion. That is how much money will be spent on all the races in the 2012 campaigns, according to a new report from the center for responsive politics, with about half of that dedicated to the top of the ticket battle royale between president obama and mitt romney. The romney campaign and its main allies have raised $1.13 billion this cycle, compared with $1.08 billion for the obama campaign and its top supporters. This morning the obama campaign revealed its strategy in the final days, telling politico, quote, we placed our final advertising buy of the elon, the overwhelming focus of which was to double down on florida and virginia. But in the buckeye state, the two campaigns are spending a combined $30 million on television ads this week. According to the wesleyan media project, over one million presidential campaign ads have run in the last five months. That's a lot of presidential campaign ads. Which means if you live in denver, las vegas, or orlando, you have either thrown your television set out the window, or are in the process of doing so right at this very minute. Please wait in the show is over. The three cities have born the brunt of the onslaught. Other hot spots like cleveland, cincinnati, tampa. Which reached a new high or a low depending on how you look at it this cycle. Of the more than $800 million! Spent by these groups through mid-october, roughly $1 in $4 was dark money, meaning the groups spending it don't have to disclose their donors. The surge in spending of the supreme court's citizens united decision has been extraordinary. In this week's issue of "time" magazine, michael sherer writes explicit political ad spending by outside groups in 2012 is on track to double the combined total spent by outside groups in each of the four elections since 2012. Jonathan capehart, that is a lot of money. Thrown away? Used for good? Totally unclear. 

[00:42:13]


>> That's a lot of cheddar. 
>> It is a lot of cheddar. Another official term. 
>> Yes, exactly. People are marveling at the fact that president obama's campaign put out there a long time ago that we're going to raise a billion dollars. People thought wow, we've never seen that before. Now we're looking at citizens united that a billion dollars now might be the floor from now on. 
>> Right. 
>> And those poor people in ohio. You know, I was down in florida, and just commercial after commercial after commercial, you know, romney, then obama, then obama, then romney, nonstop hitting people in the face. I begin to wonder whether -- you know, it's great you can raise all this money and spend all this money. But at some point, the people will rebel against the person who is spending all this money. Putting their candidates in their faces and say you know what? Enough is enough. I can't go this -- I can't go there with you. 
>> There is also the question of how effective it is too. If you've seen an ad 25 times in a week, how much -- you sort of get numb to it at a earn is point. I think that might be true for the presidential races, at least. 
>> I think actually where the rubber hits the road is actually not in the spending, but it's in the giving. Because what has happened is okay, this is all going to be sort of a wash in all ofhese negative ads, people turn off THEIR TVs. AND AFTER NOVEMBER 6th, WHEN THE New congress is elected, when the president is elected, they're going to be favors. 
>> Right. 
>> That are called in. That's the issue. It's not about the spending, it's about the giving. So now you've got basically about a thousand millionaires and billionaires who have just financed a lot of these campaigns and whose phone call the president and congress people are going to have to take. And that's a really scary thing for our democracy. 
>> I think that this is really interesting. In terms of how they're raising money and how they're spending it, the "washington post" ports that nine of every ten pro obama ads has been sponsored by the president's reelection campaign. Romney, by corast, has not had control over most of the tying run in his favor. Over half were aired by crossroads and other well funded conservative groups. I wonder how much that's played into thisto narrative that has been developing around romney not having a central core message to his campaign, or not being as focused perhaps as the president. I don't know. 

[00:44:27]


>> I think there are a lot more coordinated than we like to say. I think they really are controlled. They're kind wf conference calls all the time where it's very clear what the sort of republican pro-romney, the same on the democratic side message is going to be. What is different about outside spending versus their own presidential campaign is the outside money can be secret. And that's a serious problem. 
>> Right. 
>> We don't know who those donors are. 
>> In fact, some of these groups constituted themselves just a couple of months ago, waited until right after the deadline for disclosing their donor. 
>> Exactly. 
>> And then ran a barrage of ads. 
>> Right. 
>> It's clearly a very intentional way of funneling the money past the deadline so we wouldn't know until december when the dust cleared who had actually done it. 
>> Yep. 
>> Is it worth it? If we're talking about $5 billion in potential tax cuts over the next ten years, $500 million a year, spending a billion dollars this year to get that? That seems like a reasonable investment. 
>> Right. I think the terrifying concept is one day we may look back on 2012 and oh, they only spent a billion dollars on that? I do want to talk about the substance of these ads. Because the notion that these are not partisan or specifically made in service of one candidate's campaign to me is like totally ludicrous, which is really very mellifluous way of putting it. Let's look at the crossroads gps ad, not in coordination with the romney campaign at all. Let's take a look at it. 
>> You cannot help but know that he is caring. He cares about people and about their needs. I think he is going to be able to get us back otrack. I really do. 
>> Crossroads gps is responsible for the content of this advertising. 
>> What? Please vote mitt romney for president. The question is, eric, you know, the president has sort of made allusions to get reversal on citizenses united that is, the idea that that is not somehow absolutely a romney campaign ad is preposterous. But the question is are we going to be able to change this? Is there any hope? 

[00:46:31]


>> Well, in some ways I wonder if the reelection of the president will hurt efforts to change it. And people will say see, it didn't prove to be such a big deal. If you look at it, I think it's interesting because the republicans were basically running to a large extent on three ideas. One is that the economy would be so bad that they wouldn't have to have a plan of their own. That didn't prove to be the case. The numbers have been ticking up at exactly the wrong moment for them. The second was a whole philosophy about big government. Sandy really hurt them there because that was a big government moment if ever there was one. And the third is they could just outspend the president by an incredible margin. When you look at how close the president is to matching their money, even though he lost wall reet by something like five to one, that's remarkable. He basically neutralized one of their main campaign strategies by being able to do that. 
>> And you have to wonder how all the lunatic conservatives spending their millions on this are going to feel if their guy doesn't end up winning? Let's be honest. That wouldn't seem like the best investment. But what do I know? 
>>> Good morning romney is getting ready to hold a campaign rally with his wife ann. Here is a look at colorado springs where the republican nominee is expected to speak in just a moment. We'll bring you his remarks live, just ahead. More from democracy plaza right after the break. ambulance and I was told to call my next of kin. At 33 years old, I was having a heart attack.

[00:51:18]


>> That was rudy giuliani yesterday at a romney rally in westchester, ohio, attacking the president for his economic record and his hand 8ing of the attack in benghazi. With just three days left in the campaign, welcome to the silliest of the silly season. Jonathan, I mean, look, rudy giuliani, it's been a minute since we've been able to play some rudy giuliani on this. But the indignation that he should resign when the economic growth is so bad not taking into consideration the trajectory of the economy since the president took office. 
>> Here's the thing. Rudy giuliani is filling the void left by chris christie. We haven't seen rudy giuliani in a long time. That's something you would have heardhris christie say prehurricane sandy. Mayor giuliani, it let into that void willingly, happeningly, explodingly. 
>> I will say this, head explosions aside, there is a lot of indignation and a lot of keyed up romney supporters but the candidate himself is taking the stump in colorado springs right now for a campaign rally with his wife ann. Let us take a listen. 
>> It makes me believe we can win colorado. It has been quite a journey. It's coming to a close. We have the more days. 
>> Three more days! Three more days! Three more days! 
>> I have to tell you, it is quite emotional, I must say, to pbe in this room.

>> My first job when I came into office was making sure we didn't get into a great depression. 
>> A leader driven to make history. 
>> Health care reform cannot wait. 
>> He doesn't just want to be another president. He wanted to be a great president. 
>> Cool under pressure. 
>> It was a huge risk that the president took. 
>> The united states killed osama bin laden. 
>> His presidency marked by political division. 
>> Speaker boehner, he says you flinched. 
>> I'm sure that's his version of events. 
>> I think the biggest failure is the president's unwillingness to listen to the american people. 
>> A man whose style would both help him and hurt him as a leader. 
>> When I'm making decisions, i try to not get caught up in the emotions of the moment. 
>> "Obama revealed: The man, the president." 
>>> I can't wait to tell my children about it. 
>> But-shirts! 
>>> It was an historic moment. 
>> Prepare to take the oath, senator? 
>> I am. I, barack hussein obama, do solemlty swear -- 
>> so help you god? 
>> So help me god. 
>> Congratulations, mr. President. 
>> A new day with towering expectations. 
>> He looked at me and said, it's been an incredible ride, hasn't it? And he said, yeah, and it's just beginning. 
>> On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord. 

[00:02:00]


>> For many, barack obama and his presidency symbolized much more than political change. 
>> Obama! Obama! Obama! 
>> I'm still crying for the sons and daughters of slaves, their offspring, for people who have built a capitol. It means so much to every human being that live in this country. 
>> May god bless the united states of america. 
>> Hope is what led me here today. 
>> Candidate obama ran on a message of hope and change. It's not just the size of the crowds, but there's something different. People come and wait for hours for him. Sometimes they start crying when he talks. 
>> Barack obama! 
>> I need you to stand up! 
>> We want change! We want change! We want change! 
>> Do you think people saw in him what they wanted to? 
>> There was some projection on to him perhaps more than anybody could ever live up to. 
>> The country needed help and in a hurry. 
>> Today we learned that our economy shrank in the last three months of 2008. That's the worst contraction in close to three decades. 
>> Rahm emanuel would be the president's chief of staff. 
>> Slightly like rolling thunder because you cohave taken the economics, you could taken the auto, you could have taken the financial, you could have taken afghanistan, you could have taken iraq. Usually, there's an "a," a "b." What happens when all five are As? 
>> It was basically awful. 
>> In the months leading up to inauguration, economic adviser austan goolsbee watched in horror as the stock market dropped more than 500 points in a day. 

[00:04:09]


>> There was a bottle of bourbon sitting there in the campaign. It had been there for a year and a half and I said, man, if there ever was a day to have a drink of this emergency bourbon, it's today. 
>> And then it got worse. 
>> The next day dropped another 500 points. And then late in tpaign, it happens again and somebody says, where's the bourbon? I said, the bottle's empty. 
>> The emergency bourbon was gone, and the economy was in dire shape. One month before his inauguration barack obama called an urgent meeting during a chicago blizzard. 
>> The president meets for the first time with all his economic advisers as a group for four hours. Everybody in the room is struck with the gravity of the situation. 
>> I said, mr. President, this is your holy bleep moment. You are facing the worst downturn since the great depression. We're going to have to hit this with everything we have. 
>> The president is very clear. We need to act. We need to make our mistakes on side of pulling the band-aid off fast. That was the phrase he used. He made the decision that day to go for a massive stimulus program. 
>> When the briefing's over, i go up to the president-elect and I say, you know, that's got to be the worst briefing that the president-elect's had at least since 1932 and maybe since abraham lincoln in 1860. And the president says, goolsbee, that's not even my worst briefing this week. 
>> My first job when I came into office was making sure we didn't get into a great depression and the economy could start growing again. 
>> Also high on the president's agenda, his campaign promiseo heal the natjon's bitter partisan divide. 
>> We are more than a collection of red states and blue states. We're the united states of america. 
>> After a month in office, a whopping 76% of americans approved of the new president's job performance, though he was only just beginning. 

[00:06:22]


>> You could create whatever you wanted out of him. He was a folklore figure right out of the gate. 
>> What do you think people expected him to do? 
>> I think people didn't know. The problem with change is change for what. 
>> The passionate speaker who electrified crowds on the campaign trail -- 
>> ladies and gentlemen, the president of the united states and michelle obama! 
>> -- Would become a calm, cool leader once in office. A lot of people describe you as cool. That cuts both ways. Fair description? 
>> People who know me well and people on the campaign trail, i don't think they'd describe me that way. I am in a lot of ways an extrovert when it comes to folks outside the beltway. I'm not sure it's hurt except maybe for some of my relations i think inside of the beltway here in washington. 
>> He's not easily categorized in any way. He wants it all. He's rational, first of all. He's a little bit deliberative and cautious. But then once in a while he'll go for the bold stroke because he wants something larger. 
>> The president's next decisions would move the right to anger. 
>> You better wake up, america! 
>> The left to disappointment. And leave a nation more polarized than ever. 
>> I think he came in feeling his own exceptionalism. And then the realities of washington smacked him in the head. ahead career. How do you get from here... to here?

[00:11:11]


>>> January 2009. The president's promises of hope and change would be put to the test by the worst financial crisis in modern history. 
>> You look at any important economic statistic. They were collapsing faster in the fall of 2008 than they had collapsed in the fall of 1929. 11 million americans unemployed. 13 million homes in foreclosure. The president's chief economist saw an unprecedented hole opening in the economy. 
>> We were hanging on the edge of a cliff. In fact, we were starting down that, down into the abyss. 
>> For once, most in washington agreed. Something had to be done. 
>> Things were bad. It needed to be big. It needed to be bold. 
>> But there were vast disagreements on how bold. Some in the president's party wanted a rescue plan close to $2 trillion. 
>> It's a funny thing to say, but every $100 million helps. So by doing a bigger program than what had been on table absolutely meant we were getting more job creation, more help for the economy. 
>> Republicans balked at anything approaching even half that. 
>> I don't believe our colleagues have the sense that another $108 billion will solve the problem. 
>> Ultimately, the president decide to try to rev the economy's engine with an $787 billion stimulus plan. The president felt he needed bipartisan support so he met with republican members of congress. Before he took office, days after inauguration, and on super bowl sunday. He was pitching a bill that would give tax cuts to almost all americans. Pay salaries for teachers and cops. Build roads and bridges and more. Republicans objected to the spending and to the president's tone. 
>> We outlined other ideas that we thought would help get the economy moving again and put people back to work. Those issues were rejected. And the president at that same meeting said, you have to understand that, you know, when we disagree, you have to remember that I won. 

[00:13:28]


>> A phrase like "i won" wasn't winning the president any friends. But the president says he was listening to republicans. 
>> If anything, I think i received a lot of criticism from my own party for going out of my way to try to solicit republican cooperation. And the fact of the matter was that politically there was a decision that was made fairly early on among some of their leadership that said working with the president is not good politics. 
>> I think he came in sort of feeling his own exceptionalism. And then the realities of washington smacked him in the head. 
>> By the time the president went to sell the bill to congress, republicans seemed to have made up their minds. 
>> On my trip up to the hill, they released an e-mail saying, we're going to be voting against it, before they'd even heard our presentation. 
>> In a stinging rebuke, every house republican voted no. 
>> The bill that was supposed to be about jobs, jobs, jobs has turned into a bill that's all about spending, spending, and spending. 
>> Two months after the election, the republicans said this is your problem. We're going to start planning for four years from now. 
>> The president scrambled his team to the hill to try to save the bill in the senate. When the stimulus finally passed -- 
>> and that's it, dana. 
>> That's it. 
>> It came with the nearly $800 billion price tag and the support of only three senate republicans. One of them was olympia snowe. 
>> He just got off to a poor start and rtunately the wrong foot and set the tone for the remainder of his administration had only begun. 
>> She believes the president missed a crucial opportunity to engage republicans early on. 

[00:15:30]


>> I'm not so sure that he truly understands the relationship and the interaction that occurs between the president and the legislative branch. 
>> With hindsight, his closest aides admit room for improvement. 
>> There wasn't a whole lot of time left over for sort of hand holding and schmoozing. Perhaps we should have made more time for it. But at the time it seemed like he was spending his waking hours doing what he was supposed to do. 
>> Republicans howled the spending was too much. And when unemployment blew past the administration's 8% projection -- 
>> I made a bad forecast. 
>> -- Republicans slammed it as a failure. 
>> It turned out that the hole we were trying to dig ourselves out of was deeper than we had anticipated. 
>> Years later the nonpartisan congressional budget office would find that the stimulus, or recovery act, saved or created more than 3 million jobs. But by then the battle lines were drawn in a clash of ideas that would dominate the president's term. 
>> Between the belief that government is going to solve your problems to belief that the era of big government is over. 
>> The president had lost control of the message and the hopes for partnership with republicans. 
>> They were kind of coming at it like the old east german judge at the olympics where it doesn't matter what -- you know, the president could be doing a triple flip lutz and they're giving him a 2. The card's already filled out. Ones I've made. Ones we've all made. About marriage. Children. Money. About tomorrow. Here's to good decisions. Who matters most to you says the most about you.

[00:20:21]


>>> Preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the united states. 
>> So help you god. 
>> So help me god. 
>> Congratulation, mr. President. 
>> The first 100 days traditionally gives an incoming president a soft start. 
>> At the end of every day, we would either be in the oval office or we'd take a walk. 
>> President obama and his chief oftaff rahm emanuel kept close tabs on their to-do list. 
>> Then we made sure we had our -- he and I used this word interchangeably, our north stars. You know, it's easy in these jobs day to day to get thrown off course. What's your north star, what do you need to get done? 
>> Did you expect there to be a honeymoon period? 
>> I don't remember walking the halls saying should we get a honeymoon or shouldn't we? I don't really -- we got problems to solve. I don't have the luxury of looking at oil paintings and talking to them. 
>> Even as the stimulus fight was at fever pitch, the auto industry was falling fatally ill. 
>> Literally, they were talking about two weeks and bust. There was not two years. There was not, we have a problem here. We think we can keep it alive for two weeks. 
>> If general motors and chrysler had been liquidated, in all likelihood, other automobile companies would have collapsed. An entire supplier network. The consequences would have been felt in every community in the country. 
>> The car companies had squandered their first cash infusion from president bush. Months later when gm and chrysler asked for more taxpayer money, congress refused. So the president did it on his own. 
>> We cannot and must not and we will not let our auto industry simply vanish. 
>> And he went against the advice of his own -- some cases, his own advisers. 
>> He bailed out the auto industry anyway in a wildly unpopular move opposed by nearly three quarters of americans. As well as his future republican opponent mitt romney. At first the restructuring of the industry cost thousands their jobs. 

[00:22:34]


>> When you look at everything from the auto bailout which was very unpopular at the time. And I'd been leading with emotions or had my political hat on, we might not have done, but saved a million jobs. 
>> Ultimately, the bailout saved jobs and it provided the industry a safety net. But the president was not effective at selling it. 
>> It would be great if you were sitting down for an hour-long lecture in a classroom but not necessarily trying to sell it to the public. He doesn't think in sound bites. 
>> While the president pushed forward on his agenda, his critics reacted to what they saw as one liberal program after another. Stimulus. Auto rescue. Homeowner relief. 
>> Lenin and stalin would love this stuff. 
>> Then inebruary 2009 a defining attack on cnbc that tapped into a rich vein of rage. 
>> You know, cuba used to have mansions and a relatively decent economy. They moved from the individual to the collective. Now they're driving '54 chevys. We're thinking of having a chicago tea party. 
>> The tea party was born. Conservatives would see each new program as an ominous sign of the encroachment of big government. 
>> The economy's terrible because I think president obama is practicing a lost decade economics. More borrowing, more spending, more demand side economics. A massive amount of uncertainty on regulations, on taxes, on interest rates. 
>> The president had angered the right. But he also riled the left when he asked for another $300 billion for the wall street banks. 
>> Bail out working families! Bail out working families! 
>> Then staggering news. Failing insurance giant aig had received $170 billion. In taxpayer dollars. Now it paid millions in bonuses to the very executives who wrecked the place. 

[00:24:35]


>> What happened with these bonuses was a mugging on wall street. 
>> Privately, advisers say the president was outraged. 
>> And I think it offended people's values and it offended his values. 
>> But publicly the president was slow to respond. 
>> I think people are right to be angry. I'm angry. 
>> The administration let the bonuses stand. And the president missed an opening to champion the change he had promised. 
>> You get out of this president a lot of butter knife routines. You know, these some abusers on wall street. Who? Name the names. He doesn't want to do that because he doesn't like conflict. 
>> Aides say it's just not his style. 
>> Is he going to, like, get up on the sofa and yell and scream and stomp his feet? I don't think so. I think people misconceive the expression of emotion with the idea of having emotion. 
>> Ten months later, when more wall street bonuses were revealed, the president finally channeled his inner rage during an interview on "60 minutes." 
>> I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of, you know, fat cat bankers on wall street. 
>> The bank bailout helped keep wall street alive and credit flowing. Eventually the government recouped that $300 billion plus a profit. And the president got his wall street reform through congress. But before his first 100 days were over, he had upset constituencies across the spectrum. 
>> Well, he's either found the golden mean or the brass mean. Either one. Because you're right, the heads of the banks hate him. A lot of other people think all he's done is protect them. He's both a socialist and advocate for the 1%. Go figure how you are both a socialist and an advocate for the 1% simultaneously. 
>> I thought that would be hard work but that proved remarkably easy to find ways to make everybody mad. 
>> Out of the gate, the president seemed disconnected from the public and ready to tackle his own agenda. 

[00:26:38]


>> All the work we did with the recovery act and giving people tax cuts and saving the auto industry all were designed to make sure that we righted the ship. But as I reminded my staff, we ran in 2008 not only to get back to the pre-crisis situation but also to solve problems that had been, you know, hurting middle class families for a decade or more. 
>> In other words, the president wanted to get on with the work he went to the white house to do. And that meant the biggest battle of his presidency. 
>> Let there be no doubt, health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait and it will not wait another year. Introducing the all-new completely re-imagined 2013 chevrolet malibu. Sleek new stylin..

>>> Back in january 2008, the hottest place for politics was in one of the coldest places in the country. A crowd of presidential hopefuls was in iowa. 
>> Fired up. Ready to go. 
>> Including the junior senator from illinois. 
>> Let's go change the world. 
>> We sat down on the cnn bus to talk for our first interview. When you're sitting in the oval office and you're the decider, how can you still be the change agent from that position? 
>> Let's take the issue of health care reform. The way we're going to overcome the drug and insurance companies AND HMOs WHO MAY BLOCK REFORM IS Not by name calling and yelling at them. It's going to be to mobilize the american people so that they know it's in their interests. 
>> Reform health care. An ambitious promise. From a candidate who hadn't yet won a single primary. A year later, it topped president obama's to-do list. 
>> So let there be no doubt, health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait and it will not wait another year. 
>> Many in his inner circle felt he needed to tackle other issues first, like creating jobs and growing the economy. 
>> You're going to dedicate a minimum year of your presidency. And has real implications on what else can't get done in that year. Even when you do that, the chances of success is like 1 out of 1 million. 
>> He was advised and he knew going in that the politics of it weren't going to be very good. 
>> The status quo is not working for you. 
>> But the president believed he could succeed where others before him had failed. 
>> Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. 
>> With health care, I think it had to do with the fact, he doesn't want to be just another president, he wants to be a great president. 
>> The president launched his fight to reform health care and largely outsourced it to congress. Members were left to hammer out details on their own. 

[00:33:00]


>> I just want to make sure i don't get in the way of all of you moving aggressively and rapidly. 
>> And the president wanted bipartisan support. 
>> This time, we will not fail. 
>> The result? Total impasse. 
>> I want to show you a chart. 
>> A deadlocked congress produced nearly a half dozen plans. 1,990 pages. 
>> And a growing swell of resistance. 
>> Poorly designed for a government takeover of our health care system. 
>> The reforms -- the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally. 
[ Audience member shouts "you lie" ] 
>> that's not true. 
>> You don't see barack obama browbeaten. He might say, those republicans are unbelievable. But he constantly feels he's child of destiny. That self-confidence is his strong suit. It also can lead you to overthinking you can move mountains when mountains move very slowly. 
>> As the bill sat in congress -- 
>> no more obama! No more obama! 
>> -- Rage exploded across the country. 
>> This is a vehicle to take us down a path of total socialism and totalitarianism. 
>> When it came to explaining health care, the president seemed to play the role of professor in chief. 
>> He seems to lack that emotional bit when he's talking about the politics. He's very wonkish. Which surprises people. Because on the campaign trail, he seemed to be a different person. 
>> In a final blow, a crucial democratic seat passed into republican hands. 
>> Ted kennedy's seat in the u.S. Senate, which he had occupied for 46 years until his death last year, has been won by a republican. 

[00:35:02]


>> The president had lost the votes he needed to pass health care reform. His staff told him to scale back the bill or pause and return to it later. 
>> One of his senior advisers said to him, you know, mr. President, unless you're feeling lucky, I just don't think this is going to happen. 
>> I was making a yoke to them, I said, look, my name's barack obama and I'm not oval office, I've got to be lucky. You know, I felt that we still had an opportunity. Although it was going to be more difficult, to try to get it done. 
>> By all accounts, when the politics seemed lost -- 
>> it is the right thing to do and at's why I'm fighting so hard to get it done. 
>> -- President obama decided to double down on health care. 
>> Caution, deliberation. And then occasionally making this incredibly bold move. That's just the way he operates. 
>> Here's what I ask congress though. Don't walk away from reform. Not now. 
>> The president personally lobbied democrats to back his plan. Then the bill was forced through the senate with a procedural end-run. 
>> The patient protection and affordable care act is passed. 
>> When it was over, president obama had accomplished something that had eluded democratic presidents for 75 years. 
>> It may have been a bloody road to success. He nevertheless had the political acumen to get this passed. 
>> The president, I believe is the ultimate three-pointer shooter with a second left on the clock. To his credit, he's got a lot to show for it. 
>> Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the united states of america, barack obama. 
>> In vice president biden's now infamous words -- 
>> this is a big deal. 
>> For the president's, an ambition realized. 
>> Today, health insurance reform becomes law in the united states of america. When I think about all the seniors who are seeing more discounts on their prescription drugs and when I meet people who say, you know what, my brother, my uncle, my father, have a pre-existing condition, couldn't get health insurance, and now they feel more secure. The effort was worth it. 

[00:37:22]


>> He got his historic victory but at a tremendous cost. During the year the president was focused on health care, more jobs and homes were lost. And frustration mounted. Even at town halls like this one on cnbc. 
>> I'm one of your middle class americans. And quite frankly, I'm exhausted. I'M EXHAUSTED OF DEFENDING YOU.yet? Yeah, I'm walking in right now. CHILEAN GRANITE... Chilean granite...

>>> I'm vk tor blackwell. Here's what's happening. Three days until election day. And the candidates are setting a dizzying pace. President obama wrapped up the day in virginia governor romney started in new hampshire, spoke in iowa and ended with two campaign stops in colorado. 
>>> Because of last week's storm, people in new jersey can vote electronically on tuesday. The governor's office says it's widening the fax and e-mail programs used by absentee voters and military. The storm wiped out so many structures, officials wanted to ease the pressure on temporary polling places. 
>>> The tomorrow clean-up continues. At least 106 u.S. Deaths are blamed on the storms and emergency workers are still looking for victims. Almost 2.5 million people are still without power. The damage is estimated at $30 billion to $50 billion. 
>>> Don't forget to set your clocks back one hour. For most, daylight savings time ends at 2:00 a.M. Ben franklin came up with the idea back in 1784. It was formally adopted in 1966. I'm victor blackwell. "Obama revealed" continues right now. 
>>> We're done. 
>> President obama had won a hard-fought victory on health care but the country was still hurting. 
>> Some economists are predicting that the unemployment rate could go higher. 
>> This is the first time ever that repossessions have topped 100,000 in a single month. 
>> As I've said from the start, there's no quick fix to the worst recession we've experienced since the great depression. 
>> By the summer of his second year in office, even some supporters seemed to be losing patience. Like velma hart at this cnbc town hall. 
>> I'm one of your middle class americans. Quite frankly, I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted of defending you, defending your administration, defending the mantle of change that I voted for, and deeply disappointed with where re right now. 

[00:43:44]


>> What made you ask the question? 
>> At the time, it was a burning issue. I had conversations with friends, colleagues, family members, who were out of work. We were all talking about, you know, year and a half in, were we feeling the change we were all so excited about? 
>> Change wasn't coming fast enough. Not for velma hart. Not for those voters who swept the president into office and expected him to champion their causes. Latino voters were looking for the change candidate obama had promised on the campaign trail. 
>> We will have in the first year an immigration bill that i strongly support and that I'm promoting. 
>> While the president got credit in the latino community for appointing sonia sotomayor to the supreme court, he lost points for deporting more undocumented immigrants than any administration in history. And for failing to pass the immigration reform he promised. When republicans blocked a bill that would let the children of undocumented immigrants stay in the u.S., The president did not use his power to make them legal on his own. 
>> I think a lot of people came in with that sort of narrower focus on what he would do for them. Not really understanding that he's more pragmatic perhaps than they expected. 
>> We deserve -- 
>> we deserve -- 
>> full equality -- 
>> full equality! 
>> For gay americans, different issues, same response. 
>> We are -- 
>> repeal "don't ask, don't tell"! 
>> Now, it's good to see you. 
>> Yes, we can! Yes, we can! 
>> Thank you. 
>> Candidate obama had promised a repeal of "don't ask, don't tell." But as president, he asked gay americans to wait patiently. 
>> As commander in chief, in time of war, I do have a responsibility to see that this change is administered in a practical way and a way that takes over the long term. 

[00:45:51]


>> He went through a process because he wanted to get by him. He didn't want to just repeal "don't ask, don't tell." He wanted to make sure that gays could serve in the military proudly and without being alienated or ostracized and would have the support. 
>> The repeal would pass congress but after almost two years. It was change on the president's time frame. 
>> That's why I believe this is the right thing to do for our military. That's why I believe it is the right thing to do, period. 
>> I think that the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell" was one of his largest civil rights accomplishments. And the fact you haven't heard any stories about any problems is an indication that sometimes it's better to do it over a slower process than to do it expeditiously. 
>> As the nation's first black president, barack obama has been expected to tackle race in ways other presidents have not. He told "black enterprise" magazine, quote, I'm not the president of black america, I'm the president of the united states of america. 
>> Everything he's done, both short, medium and long-term to get our economy back on track, all of that benefits the african-american community. 
>> Harvard's randall kennedy has written about the president and race. 
>> There have been some black americans who have been quite critical of the president. The great masses of black americans have been quite realistic and have understood the special burdens that barack obama faced. 
>> I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that. 
>> Early on, the president created an uproar by commenting on the arrest of black harvard professor henry lewis gates jr by a white police officer outside his own home. 
>> Number one, any of us would be pretty angry. Number two, that the cambridge police acted stupidly. 
>> Immediately, immediately, there were people who said, ah, this shows barack obama's resentfulness. This shows barack obama has a problem with white culture. This shows that barack obama doesn't like white people. 

[00:48:04]


>> The president doused the controversy in the rose garden with gates and the police officer at the so-called beer summit. 
>> Well, he's trying to negotiate the dangerous shoals of race in america. It's not easy for any president. It's particularly more sensitive and subtle for a black president. 
>> Sensitive. Both personally and politically. 
>> His memoir's all about race. That's the lens through which he saw his life. So I think it's very deeply part of how he views the world. And w he views himself. But I think that politically he doesn't want to get stuck there. 
>> Does he make a conscious decision not to talk about race in office? 
>> Periodically, he's spoken to it in ways that are very, very powerful. I n't think he sees that as the defining issue of our time. The defining issue of our time is how all americans can live in a country where if they work hard, they can get ahead. 
>> But as the midterm elections approached, millions of americans feared they'd never get ahead. AND ON NOVEMBER 2nd, 2010 -- 
>> Cnn is noready to make a major projection. The republicans will take control of the house of representatives. 
>> Can you hear us now! 
>> Bolstered by the tea party, six republicans claimed seats in thsenate and 63 swept into the house, giving the gop the majority. 
>> I'm not recommending for every future president that they take a shellacking like i did last night. 
>> It seemed the american people were having buyer's remorse. Rejecting the president they'd embraced so warmly just two years earlier. The president would have to find a way to get back in the game. 
>> When things get challenging, HE'S AT HIS BEST.ltzer Plus PRESENTS THE Cold Truth. I have a cold... I TOOK DayQuil, BUT I STILL HAVE A RUNNY Nose.

>>> Reggie love knows the president as a strong midrange shooter. 
>> He'll take his midrange jumper and he'll attack the basket. He'll knock down open shots when he's got them. 
>> The kind of guy you want on your team. And love has been on the president's team since the campaign days. What's he like when he's just hanging out? 
>> He's like a guy, you know. He likes the bulls. He likes the bears. He likes sports. Likes cards. Like most guys I know. Which can sometimes be hard for some people. They're like, oh, wait, he's just like me. But he's the president. 
>> As his personal assistant and confidant, love's seen the president as few others have. 
>> He's very much a person who enjoys the simple things in life. Enjoys watching a good game. Enjoys a good cocktail. Is competitive at everything he does. If it's bowling or pool or shuffle board. There isn't anything I think he'd be okay losing at. 
>> The republicans will take control of the house of representatives. 
>> And even when he wasn't winning with his policies, the president seemed to score with his popularity. 
>> Most americans, polls show, like barack obama. ?????? I'm so in love with you ?????? 
[ cheers and applause ] 
>> when he sings a little song and he acts a little cool or he shoots baskets or he tells a joke, people still swoon over him. 
>> His cool demeanor plays as hip to some. 
>> Why? 
>> Here on "saturday night live." 
>> I keep it cool. I take my kids to school. I don't lose my temper. It's my only rule. I keep it cool. 
>> Aides call it one of his greatest assets. 
>> There's no doubt that he is cool under fire. When things get challenging, he's at his best. He's at his coolest. So that coolness is a great quality in a leader. 

[00:56:02]


>> Cool as president but passionate about his role as father in chief. 
>> It has to be a balance. Bill clinton was imbalanced. So he needed those strangers. So he would spend the hours between 6:00 and 9:00 talking to people in congress whereas president obama's basically with his family during those hours, which is sort of a balancing to do. But not necessarily good for a president. 
>> When working in town here in washington, in the evenings, 6:30, we wanto be at the dinner table with our kids. And I want to be helping with their homework. I think that's sometimes interpreted as me not wanting to be outre slapping backs and wheeling and dealing. And it really has more to do with just the stage we are in our lives. 
>> If you're reelected, your girls will be older. They'll probably have their own weekend plans. Might not want to hang out with mom and dad. 
>> It's already starting to happen. 
>> Do you think you might do more outreach or what you call back-slapping with members of congress? 
>> My hope is that getting past this election, people I will have an opportunity maybe to step back and say, you know what, the differences that divide us aren't as important as the common bonds we have as americans. And some of that, I'm sure, will require additional effort on my part. Hopefully we'll see more effort on the other side as well. 
>> Though being a family man isn't always an asset in office, it ia priority for the president. 
>> Well, you have to remember, this is someone who grew up raised by a single mom and his grandparents whose father abandoned him and he's lived with that kind omissing piece in him. And at a very young age, he decided he wasn't going to be the kind of father he had. He wanted to be a present father. 
>> And a partner in parenting to his wife, michelle. 
>> Barack and I really do share the same values. Respect, empathy, hard work, decency. We're constantly telling our kids the most important thing they can be is good, decent people who treat other people with kindness and respect. 

[00:58:12]


>> He's a guy who really loves his wife. She's obviously a great source of personal strength to him. 
>> Michelle obama's role has been to keep him grounded. To make sure his ego isn't a macy's float that takes off. 
>> She keeps me straight every single day. She is the best mom in the world. And she's cute. 
>> The president has called you the best mom in the world. He says the girls are grounded and great. But no kid is effect. So when the time calls for it, which one of you plays the heavy? 
>> This is the thing I like about barack. He is not the happy dad. He is very good at reinforcing the rules and boundaries that we set. We never get into that, but dad said -- we're very good at not letting the kids play off of us. 
>> But clearly on the court, the girls listen closely to what dad says. You coach your daughter's basketball team. 
>> There you go. That's sasha's team, the vipers. This has been so much fun. I don't coach them full time. I'm sort of like an assistant coach/adviser. 
>> So what does the president's own game say about his leadership style? 
>> He's a competitor. You know, sometimes you get a bad call. From an efficiency standpoint, you can cry about the call or you can look to the next play. 
>> Calm and cool. Assets that would prove invaluable when facing high stakes, high risks and the nation's greatest enemy.

>> President obama was doing stand-up at the white house correspondents dinner. As halfway around the world, a GROUP OF NAVY S.E.A.L.s WAS Moving into position to target the world's most wanted terrorist. 
>> Some people now suggest I'm too professorial. I'd like to address that head-on. 
>> If he was anxious, he didn't show it. 
>> By assigning all of you some reading that will help you draw your own conclusions. 
>> The planning had started in secret months before. 
>> He asked each and every one of us in the small group of the nation security council what our opinion was. And there was disagreement. So it came down, as it does in these stigs situations, with the hard decision having to go to the president. 
>> When I'm making decisions, i try to pull back a little bit and take the long view. 
>> There were easier options. And the plan on the table risked hostages or casualties. 
>> I think for me to be able to step back and say, all right, what's best for the country, and not get caught up in the immediate fears, risks, concerns and pressures that you're feeling right then has probably been helpful. 
>> The president gave the order. 
>> He wanted to go for it. You know, he has that self-confidence. He has a sense of luck being on his side. 
>> The next day, the president and his national security team WATCHED AS NAVY S.E.A.L.s RAIDED The compound where osama bin laden was believed to be hiding. 
>> We were following it in real time. So it was a roller coaster of emotions that we were living through. 

[01:05:22]


>> The president described it as the longest 40 minutes of his life. Then came the news. 
>> We got the word geronimo. What that meant is, we got him, we saw him, it is bin laden. But we had to get our guys out. I'm not sure any of us breathed until we got word they had crossed back into afghanistan. 
>> The president normally known for his caution had chosen the riskiest course possible and it paid off. 
>> I can report to the american people and to the world that the united states has conducted an operation that killed osama bin laden, the leader of al qaeda. 
>> Usa! Usa! Usa! 
>> To those on the left who watched how the obama presidency played out, the surprise was his aggressiveness. To those on the right, the surprise was his aggressiveness. They kept thinking he was a community organizer from chicago who had no concept of how to use american power. 
>> Since then, president obama has pulled troops from iraq. Created a plan to leave afghanistan. And drastically expanded the use of armed drones to target terrorists. 
>> He may be known as the drone president. The president who relied on technology to do the business of troops. 
>> My most sacred duty as president and commander in chief is to keep the american people safe. Drones are one tool that we use. 
>> Even if the target is an american. In 2011, one of those targeted for death was anwar al awlaki, an al qaeda leader living in yemen and also an american citizen. Are the standards different when the target's an american? 

[01:07:37]


>> When an american has made a decision to affiliate itself with al qaeda and target fellow americans, that -- there is a legal justification for us to try to stop them from carrying out plots. 
>> Many of his supporters are quite concerned because they view this as basically a form of targeted assassination. 
>> Do you struggle with this policy? 
>> Oh, absolutely. If you don't, then it's very easy to slip into a situation in which youp bending rules thinking that the ends always justify the means. 
>> Another new frontier? With israel, the president is believed to have launched a devastating cyber war against iran's nuclear program. Still, the president's been plagued by tensions with israel's prime minister that's prompted an election year defense of his dedication to the jewish state. 
>> Our commitment to israel's security must not waver and neither must our pursuit of peace. 
>> For the president, it's a nuanced approach. When america's threatened, the president doesn't hesitate to act on his own. 
>> Where he determined that we would act unilaterally, it was all about those people, those groups, that threaten us. 
>> But in a humanitarian crisis like syria's, the president prefers company. And until he has it, he won't act. 
>> Syria has created great outrage and terrible humanitarian anguish but we don't have any international consensus about the way forward. 
>> It all adds up to what some call the obama doctrine. 

[01:09:38]


>> The obama doctrine is less blood, less treasure, less intervention of a lengthy kind. 
>> Though governor romney calls him reluctant to lead. 
>> The administration has characterized their foreign policy as leading from behind. I call that following. 
>> These days, his critics have more ammunition with the deaths of ambassador chris stevens and three other americans in libya. It happened on 9/11, raising questions, why wasn't security ramped up? And why were protests initially blamed for the attack? A month later, the president addressed these questions on abc news. 
>> As information came in, information was put out. The information may not have always been right the first time. 
>> The president says the fog of war crted confusion. What is clear, as commander in chief, the president can fly solo. To solve the country's domes problems, he needs a partner. 
>> The president was going to have to deliver half the democrats. I was going to have to deliver half the republicans. I was confident I could do that.

>>> A gorgeous june day. The nation's capital. But this is no ordinary golf game. For president barack obama and house speaker john boehner, this is a chance to be partners rather than political foes. By june 2011, it had been eight months since the republicans won control of the house and the senate's top republican declared -- 
>> our top political priority over the next two years should be to deny president obama a second term. 
>> Eight months since the midterms when a chastened president promised a new way forward. 
>> We were in such a hurry to get things done that we didn't change how things got done. 
>> And eight months since a bipartisan debt commission offered a host of painful solutions. Solutions washington ignored. By the time both men hit the links, the looming crisis over the debt ceiling threatened to make a bad economy even worse. 
>> It would be two to three times worse of a recession than the one that we were facing as the president comes into office. 
>> The stakes were high. And the republicans emboldened by their midterm victories. 
>> Thank you, pennsylvania! 
>> The republicans were essentially saying, ha, ha, the president will get nothing and like it. 
>> So the president looked to a new partner. 
>> The president and I like each other. I mean, we actually do get along. 
>> I think he felt like boehner, of ohio, that he would be able to deal with him. That he was a kawanis club republican, that I could do business with a ke that. I think obama saw him as the great hope. 
>> The president and speaker boehner began fertive meetings with their parties world apart. Republicans wanted to cut spending. 

[01:16:39]


>> We got to stop growing government, hoping to grow jobs, and instead we got to start cutting the federal deficit. 
>> Democrats wanted to limit tax giveaways to the wealthiest americans. 
>> What we've heard from our republican colleagues is they're not willing to close one special interest tax loophole. 
>> The president and speaker boehner came up with an ambitious solution. They'd craft a grand bargain to raise the debt ceiling. It would also include changes to social security, medicare, policy and defense spending. For both sides, it meant lots of pain. But for the nation, it could mean lots of gain. 
>> I think he genuinely thought there was an opportunity to do something big and meaningful to deal with our long-term debt and had what he considered productive discussions with john boehner. Ew urgency this morning. 
>> The clock ticks. 
>> We've been here before but not quite this close to default. 
>> Was there ever a time in that meeting when he said we have a deal? 
>> Yes, ma'am. About a week before the debt ceiling was to expire, the president asked mr. Cantor and i to come in the oval office where we basically sealed the deal. 
>> It seemed the president had bridged the partisan divide could count reining in the deficit as part of his legacy. But then in the final moments, the so-called grand bargain collapsed. 
>> I have offered ideas -- 
>> and finger-pointing began. 
>> Not one time, not one time, did the administration ever put any plan on the table. 
>> It is hard to understand why speaker boehner would walk away from this kind of deal. 
>> For speaker boehner, the problem was a last request to alter the deal. 
>> I said, mr. President, you know I can't do this. We've been talking about this for months. I'm already as far out on a limb as I can get. You know this. Why are you doing this? It's unfortunate. He basically blew up the deal. 

[01:18:43]


>> Not true, says the white house. 
>> I think personally speaker boehner probably wanted to do something. He just couldn't control his caucus. 
>> But the speaker says hi people were never the problem. 
>> I got into some tough negotiations with ted kennedy. He didn't flinch. He didn't back away from the deal. He went straight forward. That's courage. 
>> Speaker boehner, he says you flinched. 
>> Yeah, well, I'm sure that's his version of events. I was prepared to make some cuts and some changes that were very unpopular in my base and among democrats, if I got a little bit of compromise from the other side on revenue. 
>> Both men seem burned by the experience. 
>> If I look back over the year and a half or so that I've been speaker, my greatest disappointment is the president and I couldn't come to an agreement on solving our debt crisis. 
>> The final deal brokered by vice president biden was far smaller than the president wanted. For president obama, it was a turning point. 
>> It took him I think two years to the debt ceiling debate to understand that he was not going to be able to be the conciliatory president, the mediator in chief. 
>> Now, more than a year after that golf game, the president says of republicans -- 
>> where I can work with them, i will. Where they don't want to compromise, I'll work around them. 
>> And he set out on a path of go for the jugular politics. He laid out his jobs plan, championed the popular payroll tax cut -- 
>> tell congress to pass this tax cut without drama, without delay. 
>> And took executive actions without the support of congress. 
>> We can't simply wait for congress to do its job. 
>> The republicans fired back. 
>> Now we have our own modern day great train robbery. 
>> Probing the bankruptcy of the taxpayer-funded solar firm solyndra. And relentlessly pursuing fast and furious, anti-gun trafficking operation that cost a border agent his life. The bitter partisan divide was back out in the open. ?????? ?????? believe broader mix of energies. That's why we're supplying natural gas to generate cleaner electricity... That has around 50% fewer co2 emissions than coal. And it's also why, with our partner in brazil, shell is producing ethanol

[01:24:52]


>>> We're fired up. Ready to go. 
>> Barreling into the 2012, the president turned his attention to a new battle. 
>> Four more years! 
>> The election. 
>> I think his naivety has been finally squashed. I don't think you've see that naive, "yes, we can" man of 2008 ever again. 
>> Now a candidate, he's shifted focus from wooing the other side to winning back disappointed supporters, like women. 
>> I for one am spending a lot of time out there talking to women to make sure they understand that's all the line and we don't want to see everything that we worked and fought for to go away. 
>> And then gays and lesbians saying this on "good morning america". 
>> I think same-sex couples should be able to get married. 
>> Next, latinos, an electoral voting bloc. 
>> No more lies! 
>> After initially failingo press for immigration reform, in june, the president temporarily halted thedeportation of the children of documented immigrants. Campaign 2012 had begun. 
>> To be the transformational president he wants to be, you have to have two terms. You can't do it in one. So everything is riding on this election for barack obama. 
>> The president has framed this as a battle over opposing economic visions. 
>> You cannot grow this economy from the top down. You grow this economy from the middle class out. 

[01:26:54]


>> His campaign launched an assault on governor romney's record. 
>> Mitt romney mad$20 million in 2010 but paid only 14% in taxes. 
>> In the final days, president obama is making a closing argument that's part jab -- 
>> I think it's called romnesia. 
>> Part promise. 
>> I will spend every waking hour trying to make your lives a little bit better. 
>> I'm counting on you -- 
>> leaving the two men in a close race to the finish with a tiny margin of undecided voters likely to make all the difference. Ultimately, it will be up to voters and historians to assess the president's term in office. Among his accomplishments, the killing of osama bin laden, the passage of landmark but controversial health care reform, restructuring of the american auto industry, averting a great depression and keeping his promise to withdraw from iraq. 
>> The last 3 1/2 years will probably be viewed as one of the most tumultuous periods in american history. And having that steady hand that the psident has, I think has really benefited our country. 
>> On the other side of the ledger, millions of americans still unemployed. Millions of homes still under water, a ballooning national debt, a broken promise to close guantanamo bay. The killing of ambassador chris stevens in libya and a nation more divided than ever. But isn't that what you ran on in 2008, promising to bridge the divide? 
>> What I promised was that we were going to look out for the american people and that I would do everything I could to break through some of the old ideological gridlock and just focus on what works. And that's actually what we did. 

[01:29:09]


>> Despite the challenges, president obama says he can still do more. 
>> What I hope is is that post-election, if the american people are willing to see me here for another four years, that members of congress are going to remind themselves what they're sent here to do. And that is ultimately to work for the people who sent us here. 
>> As the clock runs out, the president is pitching the same advice he gives his daughter's basketball team. 
>> Just always worry about doing your job, doing your best, getting better and thinking like a team.

=======================================================

S a choice not just two candidates or two parties. It is a choice between two fundmentally different visions of america. It is oice between going back to the top down policies that crashed our economy or assessing the kinds of policies that will make sure we have got a strong and growing middle class. That is the choice. 
>> I think if people look to the future they realize the last four years haven't worked and that mitt romney is the only one with a plan to turn things around. 
>> I want the election over with us I want to win it. I want to start moving forward. I want to stop this regression that we are in. Economic recession. The silly transformation of america obama has undertaken. We want to get busy and start reversing this. The enthusiasm and momentum there is no question where it is. It is for romney. 
>> Presidential elections unlike any other come down to character. Character. Character. Character is the most important ingredient a president must possess to lead a great nation and lead the world and it is clear who has character and it is clear who doesn't have character. 
>> My guy, be barack obama, he's got characteristic. 
>>> We need a leader to clear the barriers. We need a ler to get behind our people. To get behind progrowth proven solutions to get people bac to work. Real recovery and that means we elect mitt romney the next president of the unid states. 
>> They are excited today because unemployment didn't go back to 8%. It is 7.9%. They should be ashamed of themselves! 
>> I believe in america. I believe in the american people. And if there is any one worried that the last four years are the best we can do, if there is any one who fears that the american dream is fading, if there is any one who wonders whether jobs and pay checks are things of the past i have a clear and uneconpetitive cal message. 

[00:02:06]


>> He has been disaster. The worst president for our economy in our lifetime. He doesn't want a second term. He wants a second chance. Because he screwed it up the first time. And you know what stands in his way? You know what is going to stop him? Ohio! 
>> Greta: You know who that was. That was former new york city mayor rudy giuliani hitting the campaign trail for governor romney in ohio today. He joinss from cincinnati. Nice to see you, mr. Mayor. 
>> Nice to see you, greta, how are you? 
>> Very well. Before we get to your statements just a second ago and looks like you are not taking any prisoners on that. You were at a rally tonight for the governor. I'm curious who else was there and how many people. Did you you get a look at the crowd? 30 to 35,000. There for three, three and a half hours in kind of cold weather. Didn't bother them at all. Just about every republican you can think of was here. john McCain. John kasich the governor, senator portman, senator graham. Republicans from all over the country. They are all going to leave here and fan out over the country in support of mitt romney. I will be in wisconsin tomorrow. Florida the next day. Maybe pennsylvania. They are going to probably decide that as we move along. But the idea was all of the supporters here tonight supporng mitt romney and paul ryan and starting tomorrow morning they will all be in the different parts of t country probably mostly in the swing states. 
>> Greta: Is there any way to when he sure, ohio tonight? I know that everyone on the republican side says governor romney is going to win and everybody on president obama's side says he is going to win. How do you measure it tonight? 
>> I mean you know obviously, i guess an obama rally you would feel differently. At this rally it seems like he has enormous enthusiasm. This has the feeling of a winning campaign. The enthusiasm here tonight was tremendous. If this s a is swing state i feel good about it even if the polls about even and even if obama has a lead of one or two I suspect the undecided votes are going to go to mitt romney. I have a pretty good feeling about ohio. And if he wins ohio, I think he wins and maybe president obama could feel the same way about it. This is probably the key state. 

[00:04:33]


>> Greta: Why do you all leave, ohio, and spread out across the country? Why don't you all just stay in ohio if that is so important, got to get every vote there. 
>> Because you got to make sure you win the others too. You have to make sure you win, virginia, and win colorado and win wisconsin and you win florida. Florida you can't take for granted. Florida is just as critical. Maybe more in ohio. We all feel I think. 
>> Greta: It looks like we have some satellite trouble. We have lost the mayor. We -- the governor, of course, you see on the screen here. Just to give you sort a heads up what has been going on in ohio today. Westchester, ohio and this is supposedly one of the biggest rallies that governor romney has had as they sort of move into the closing part of this campaign. At the campaign today -- at the rally, speaker of the house BOEHNER, SENATOR john McCain, mayor giuliani, senator rubio. They brought out all of the stars of the republican party because there is no doubt everybody thinks this is the key state. The fbi is finally on the ground in tunisia thanks to two republican united states senators. President obama didn't make it happen. It was republican senators saxby chandlis. Tonight the fbi is finally in tunisia to question in person the man caught on video during the attack. How can two republican senators get done in two days what the president of the united states could not get done in weeks? Senator lindsey graham joins us. Good evening, sir. 
>> Good evening. 
>> Greta: What what is the explanation? I would think with all due respect to the united states senate that in you are the president of the united states you have more muscle than you do if you are a member of the u.S. Senate and the fbi has been trying to talk to this man in tunisia. Tunisia has said no and then you and senator chandliss got into it two nights ago and voila, you could talk to him. 

[00:06:42]


>> I wrote a letter three days ago to the ambassador, u.S. Ambassador, tunisia ambassador to the united states saying this is a defining moment in our relationship. I know tunisia well. I know the prime minister. And within two days we were able to get the fbi on the ground. I want to thank the tunisian government for making this person available to be interviewed by our law enforcement occasions, our investigative team. It is not enough to write questions. You have to be on the ground to look people in the eye and too yearia came through and two days after the letter here we are. 
>> Greta: And it is quite extraordinary because the investigation has been stuck and my hat goes off to you forgetting it down, for picking up the ball and running with it. But the president of the united states I suspect has just as much influence if not more than two u.S. Senators so what is your explanation for the fact that you guys had to jump into this? 
>> My belief is that this administration is trying to run out the clocking when it comes to benghazi. This is a story that changes by the day. What do we know. We know that before the a i tack in april and june of this year the consulate was attacked twice. We know that the british withdrew their -- closed their consulate after the british ambassador was attacked in june. We know the red cross closed their office in benghazi after the attack on the red cross office. We know that on august 15 ambassador stevens and his security team met and discussed the fact that ten al-qaeda groups have been identified to be roaming around benghazi and that they told the state department secretary clinton august 16 if there is a coordinated al-qaeda attack the consulate will be overru that is what we know before the attack. During the attack we know that 7-8 hours goes by and not one litary person was able to help these poor people for over 7 hours on september 11. R the attack they blamed it on a video, a mob and riot that never existed. The president has been awol when it comes to benghazi. They have been denying and deceiving the public. 

[00:09:08]


>> Greta: It is absolutely extraordinary because you said that he was going to get us answers. And I'm not suggesting -- 
>> yeah, right. 
>> Greta: And I'm not suggesting that the fbi interrogation be made public but makes a lot more sense to get him in a time close to the event rather than waiting three years or three months or whatever. And it is -- I mean it is extraordinary that we would not have wanted to get in there quicker orven in the fbi or the fbirector I'm surprised he didn't hound the president. Want to find out what happened in this murder, let's move fast now especially since anybody else who is involved is going to scatter. 
>> This has been the story of libya for months. The people on the ground in libya are beg gd and pleading for additional security. They are being denied additional security. Military and civilian security, u.S. Security because we wanted to "normalize relationships with libyan government that didn't exist in beng." This has been a travesty of errors and income pa tensecy and a la of leadership by the president. Al-qaeda is aleve and well throughout the mid east. They are counting attacking and our attack on the consulate in libya is exhibit a of a failed foreign policy of leading from behind. You could see this coming for months. The people on august 145 had a meeting and said we could not withstand a coordinated attack. 
>> There is that and all of this sort of alarms or red lights whether it is the attack in june or whatever in terms of yurt. Then stage two as to what has happened since then. It was that no one bothered to see this too niece yan guy. There is even more than that. Is that the fbi did visit benghazi after the attack sometime and left. But then fast forward to last week, october 26, be foreign policy journalists go in there after people have been walking all over the place and looking at that time and they he recovered documents is that are critical to this investigation. Like the fbi didn't even bother. Like nobody be even cared that four americans are dead. It is a snap by investigation. Four people died. You you wouldn't even see that kind of investigation in a local homicidese. 

[00:11:43]


>> I hope the people ofe united states who really do care about our national security will understand the poor leadership by this president. Governor cristie stays I was called three times by the trees what did I do to help the people of michael jackson. The president has taken on acorn show. This has really been no effort by this administration to help the people when they were underattack. This administration ignored many warnings coming from benghazi, libya about the state of play. They have been telling us and the entire world al-qaeda has been dismantled. It was clear to anybody who was listening that was peaking benghazi over. During the apack, he said he reported people to help those in libya to come to the aid of the people in libya. Not one person came to his aid. Did he ignore the order or never make the order? The person I blame above all else is president barack obama. He has oversold the dismantling of ail quaid. He spiked the ball when bin laden was killed and created a seps of security that doesn't exist and he let these poor people in libya go into a death trap and didn't do anything about it. 
>> Greta: But go back to my point that once all that happened and these and the americans want to know what happened to the murder -- any murder investigation if he doesn't pore to say to the vector of the fbi look, if you have double pleating 450 tunisia 88' get the call. 
>> Howard would it have been for the president to pick up the to the prime minister of tunisia and say we are not asking you to turn him over to us. We just want access to this witness. We want to be good allies. We are helping your country get back on your feet. Four americans were murdered the first ambassador in 3 years. I want tophet to the bottom of this, I need your hope. One, a and 48 hours later the nib is on the ground. There is knosps of urgency about this investigation. They are trying to run out the clock. 

[00:14:13]


>> Greta: You say it is no sense of urgency. I frankly don't think -- i don't think he cares. Fy were in charge of the investigation -- 
>> I'm not going to say that. 
>> Greta: If you want to get the facts, he is a lawyer. You move in really fast. If you have got someone who s a suspect on the scene who is part of this, you know the spm is in custody. You don't sit around and say let's talk to him next year. Any detective in any homide case is going to tell you don't just ignore. 
>> They didn't want the truth to come out, if it does come out and becomes crystal clear to the american people it will show that the foreign policy is not working, that al-qaeda has not been dismantled, they are very much on the rise and leading from behind is not a viable strategy to make it safe in a dangerous world. That is why they are not pecking up the phone and calling people. What any other person would do if they wanted to get to the bottom of it. They don't want to get to the bottom of libya before the election. They want the heat election to come and then they will worry about libya later. Thank goode for fox news. Thank god for other outlets like a press and people in the house and senate we wouldn't know big about libya. This president promised transparently and the only way to find out anything is to have brave americans come forward and tell you the truth in spite of what the administration is trying to do. 
>> Senator, I am going to take the last word on that. Thank you, sir. 
>> Thank you you. 
>> Greta: Straight ahead, back to former new york bayer rudy giuliani. Wore, next.

>> Greta: Is the final push for the swing states. Now, let's go back to former new york city mayor rudy giuliani in ohio who h has been braving the cold for us patiently. Thank you for the little technical problem anda bearing , bearing with us talk about benghazi. A man who the cia identified as a tunisian at the scene on the day of the attack. He was picked up in turkey and turned over to tunisia and they had him and we didn't interview him because the united states it reports couldn't get aqcess to the man. That went on for quite is some time and two u.S. Senators two nights ago decide they will make a phone call and also send a letter and now the fbi is on the ground in tunisia with access to them. Would you ever in a million years have not pushed forward to get access to him the minute you heard of him? 

[00:21:05]


>> Greta, I don't understand anything about benghazi. I think this is a -- this is so perplexing and it is a real scandal. The reality is the fbi took two weeks, what, two, three weeks to get in after the murders took place? I mean that is totally crazy. We had -- we had our consulate personnel in a city that is so dangerous that the fbi can't get in for two weeks? So that by the time they do the investigation pretty much a useless homicide investigation two weeks later. You know that, I know that. Lindsay graham and john McCAIN GOT ACCESS TO THE GUY And the fbi couldn't get akron IS 70s TO HIM? I was is with lindsay all night tonight. We had a long time to talk about this. The whole situation with benghazi is completely perplexing and what we get for electing a man who wasn't ready lead this country, barack obama. That is exactly whey feared four years ago when got eledged. Wasn't prepared to lead this country. We still don't have an answer to the the simple question did the president of the united states know about the two prior attacks on that consulate. If he did know about the two prior att then what the heck did he do about it? Why didn't he give more security to the council and why was he ignoring the fact that the british had to pull out? Why was he ignoring the prior attacks. It would be a tragedy if this election takes place and the president isn't required to answer those questions and then we get some kind of answer later that we are going to be very unhappy with. 
>> Greta: I don't understand even though and I know you have respect for the fbi and so do i and they didn't get in for two or three weeks in the area but now we he learn that last week foreign policy journalists go back to the scene after it has been tampered with, walked through, contaminated or whatever and find two draft letters by the ambassador of the united states in which he talks about his fears but also talk about that morning seeing what they think is an inside job they see their own place, libyan security across the street taking pictures inside. That is october 26. Why didn't the fbi seize that? This is a murder investigation. 

[00:23:17]


>> I don't know. I mean the only thing I can say is there was no urgency placed on this from the top by the campaigner in chief barack obama who treated this with a bunch of phoney stories for about two weeks. Apparently for three or four months was ignoring the situation in benghazi with clear warnings. I mean there was -- there was an attack on the consulate and there was a hole in the wall 12 feet wide. What, did somebody have to hit him on the head to wake him up? And the president of the united states didn't give the consulate more security? This is -- I don't have the answers to this ex-is september this s a president that was so desperate to paint this picture that he had dehe feeted al-qaeda that -- defeated al-qaeda that he got bin laden and therefore everything is over and not to worry and libya was a big success that he was ignoring facts that nobody else would ignore. 
>> Greta: And I don't want to beat a dead horse but these are americans. They were murdered. They have families. Some have kids. And I have never seen a murder investigation where it looked like people just didn't give a damn because everybody in this country knows how you do murder investigations. You do everything you possibly can to get the facts very early on. You don't look the other way. You don't make up phoney stories. You don't have a rush to judgment. You don't come up with a theory. You actually get in there and talk to e people who know something. We knew where someone was who had some information and we didn't push to interview him and then we have to have the immediatey turn up startling documents after the fbi has been there and left and who knows what else is there. It is the most disgraceful murder investigation I have ever seen in my life. 
>> Second or third day I kind of smelled a coverup and if this isn't a coverup I don't know what is a coverup from the very beginning this administration has been lying about what happened. So exactly why I don't know. They are going to have to answer it. And ex-is september for now, you know -- except for now, you know, fox and a little bit, a few other media outlets, most of the main media -- 

[00:25:30]


>> Greta: I guess there is that wonderful technical problem again. So we have lost mayor giuliani. I don't think we will make him stick around again because it is freezing cold in ohio and he was brave enough to stick through the last technical problem. I will say thank you to the mayor in case he is able to hear me. Actually I'm now told he is back. Let me switch gears before i lose you again. In terms of you said today that he is the worst president for our economy in our lifetime. The economy is making some movement up. So why do you say he is the worst? The trend is not downward. Go ahead. 
>> Our unemployment rate got worse today rather than better the reality is -- and 7.9% unemployment. Last month it was 7.8% unemployment. This is pathetic. 1.2% growth, 2% growth for our economy our size. The president of the united states promised us growth two or three times this andold us if he didn't get it he wasn't going to run for are reelection. Based on his own analysis of himself this has been a failure. This is an anemic recovery with policies holding back the ity of this economy to really recover. Is why I so strongly support mitt romney. The policies he has put into effect will allow our now recover. It is trying to recover and the policies are barack obama are holding back be that recovery. 
>> The controversy of governor chris christie. Some said he should redeclare his support for governor romney prior to tuesday. Do you think that is important? Would you like to see that? 
>> No, I know who chris supports. He supports mitt romney. I understand what happens when the president came there. The reality is the president did in the first couple of days of hurricane sandy the president did keep his eye on the ball and did h help, new jersey, and new york and elsewhere. Last couple of days, awol on that as well while people are suffering. Bodies being discovered. Gas lines where people are shooting my goodness and the president of the united states runs off to nevada once again being the campaigner in chief rather than the commander in chief. Which s what happened in benghazi. The president's focus is on the cam tape and not on protecting american lives and not getting to the answers of what happened to those people who were slaughtered in benghazi. He s campaigning rather than acting as commander are in chief. 

[00:28:05]


>> Greta: You bring up benghazi again. I note that governor romney isn't talking about benghazi. Some of you brought it up. Why isn't governor romney speaking about benghazi? 
>> Wel I mean I think the reality is that the campaign, the romney campaign believes it will all bedecided on the economy and probably any time spent on anything else isn't really going to register with voters and the way the mainstream media has sort of covered up benghazi sometimes you feel like you are talking to yourself when you are talking about it. 
>> Greta: Mayor, thank you and -- 
>> it is a shame because i think -- okay. 
>> Greta: Go ahead. 
>> I said it is a shame because I think this is beyond republican/democrat, beyond this election. These people died. I don't believe they had to die. I think when the full store arery of this comes out this is going to be a really unbelievable scandal. 
>> Greta: Mayor, thank you, sir. I know it is cold so especially a big thank you. Thank you, sir. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Greta: Coming up, a republican running for congress. Also the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat. What does she say is the real war on women? She is here to tell you next. Also, has the presidential race already been called? Really. One analyst has already counted for destroyed. To a little girl who lived through it, this is more than a teddy bear. It's a step towards normal. IT'S WHY Allstate CATASTROPHE TEAMS Not only have hot coffee and help for grownups... They've also handed out more than twelve thousand teddy bears to kids. Ople come first... Everything else is second. THAT'S Allstate's STAND. ARE YOU IN Good Hds? 

[00:32:58]


>> Greta: Martha mcsally is a woman on a mission. The air force veteran was the first female pilot to fly in combat, flying into iraq and actually throughout the middle east. Now, her new mission, she is running for congress. The arizona republican candidate running for former representative gabrielle giffords seat. We invited cgressman barbour to join us tonight and he declined due to a scheduling issue. Right now, martha joins us. Dean. 
>> Thanks for having me on. 
>> Happy to have you on and i wanted to have you on because i wanted to discuss the topic of war on women because you are a republican and the democrats talk about war on women and i have seen an ad which talks about all of the things that you doll, negative ads and both sides run negative ads. I'm curious as to your thoughts on the war on women. 
>> This is a distraction to what is really needed and what is going on in the country. My opponent is playing right out of the party playbook. First trying to scare seniors and the latest a sexist attack on me. This is just ridiculous. M a woman warrior. I have been fighting for womens rights aroundquality my whole life both in the military and in the middle east. I asked him why don't you walk a mile in my shoes down the streets of kl and riyadh where women are honor killed after they have been raped and a 14-year-old girl is nearly assassinated for standing up for girl's education. This is a real war on women. At home the women in my community and around the country are look for jobs. They are looking for affordable healthcare. They are looking for social security and medicare that is going to last for them and the next generation and a good education foeir kids. That is what people are looking for and th is a distraction in order to scare women and get votes. 
>> Greta: Interesting this war on women. I where have been lucky enough to travel the world. You have done it out of duty and admire any one who is serves in the air force. When you travel the world you see -- I'm not saying the american men don't need a little hp sometimes and we need to set them straight. For the most part this war on women when you see what goes on, the 14-year-old girl that was shot in pakistan because she dared to defy the taliban and work for education. And by the way, you actually sued the military as a lieutenant colonel when you were active. Tell me what happened. 

[00:35:30]


>> Well, it is an 8 year story but jor six years I tried to take on the pentagon and have them change a policy where the made the u.S. Service women wear muslim garb off base in saudi arabia. I stood up against it and put my career on the line. From the day I entered the air force academy my oath of office is to the constion only and leadership means standing up even if you have to stand alone. I filed a lawsuit and used what I learned as a legislative fellow and got the legislation written sponsored on both sides of the aisle and passed a law to overturn the policy for once and for all. That was just totally wrong, unconstitutional and bad for the mission. 
>> Greta: That might have been a war on women. What did you fly? 
>> It I flew the 810 warthog which is the world's best attack war plane. We show up when americans are on the ground and under fire and we he deliver firepower so they can live to fight another day and get home to their families. 
>> And that is single see the aircraft. Up there as a fighter pilot alone just as the men are, right? 
>> Exactly. 325 hours in combat and I had the privilege to be the ft woman to command a fighter squadro combat in u.S. History. I commanded my squadron in a very difficult time. 
>> We will be anxious to see what happens on tuesday. 
>> We are neck and neck and we are going to fight to the finish. I still need people's help out there. We got to fight down to the wire. It will be a sprint and i really appreciate you having me on. We're going to win. 
>> Greta: Coming up, it is so close, the battle for wisconsin. In 2008 the badger state went for president obama big time but governor scott walker says he has good reason to think that has changed. You will hear from governor walker and our political panel next. And in two minutes a change of course. Big news about the new york city marathon. Will the race go on in the storm ravaged city. We will bring you the latest eight princesses. I'm an expert on softball. And tea parties. I'll have more awkward conversations than I'm equipped fo because I'm raisin two girls on my own. I'll worry about the economy more than a few times before they're grown. But it's for them, so I've found a way. Who matters most to you says the most about you. Massmutual is owned by our policyholders so they matter most to us. Massmutual. We'll help you get there. Hurricane sandy about you the a stop to theorld's largest marathon. Tonight the mayor announcing the new york city marathon canceled. The r reversing course after a giant backlash over plans to allow the race to go on. Earlier this week, sandy hit new york city hard and right thousands still without power. Some struggling get food and even water. Many insisting police should not be used to protect a marathon during a time of crisis and generators should not be used to power finish line tents when so many are without water andlectricity. Under mounting criticism the m set selling the race. Was it the rightsion to cancel the marathon? Go to greta wire .Com and tell us.

[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. 

[00:42:45]


>> Live from america's news headquartersm marianne rafferty. The lights are on again in lower manhattan, four days after monster storm sandy knocked them out. Power returning to most of the city tonight. Nearly 4 million people in new york and surrounding states are devastated by the storm and still don't have electricity t. Could be weeks before the hardest-hit areas get it back. Thousands are in need of water, food and fuel. Sandy claiming more than 100 lives across 10 state there are reports of increased case of cholera in storm-ravaged haiti. Doctors without borders has seen nearly a thousand patients at the cholera treatment centers. Haiti was spared a direct hit. But 54 people were killed. For latest headliance, go TO foxnews.com. RAFFERTY. Now, back to "on the record." 
>> Greta: Wisconsin is in play and governor scott walker insisting the romney ryan ticket will benefit from the governor's groundwork during his recall election. 
>> You take all of the work that was done early this year when we made four and a half million voter context in a state of 5.7 million. Tens of thousands of volunteers help us in my election erlier this year and that excitement continued on. 
>> Greta: Does governor walk veronica moser a point? Joining us our political panel in new york, rick klein and here in washington the hills managing editor bob cusack and john mccormick. , First to you, governor walker have a point, in 2008, president obama won by 14 big points. 
>> That's right. If you look back at wisconsin in 2000, 2004 two of the tightest races you can imagine. Both of those cases you had a very, very narrow democratic victory. 2008 I think was an anomaly and then you have governor sidewalker's successful effort to beat the recall this year and you have some evidence of wisconsin voters listening to a republican message and most importantly this year outperforming the polls. Governor walker did much better than any one thought he did. He was able to easily withstand the national attentio and naonal money. Makes it a target rich environmenr mitt romney. Althou only been in the last couple of weeks he made a big effort there. They haven't put a lot of resources into wisconsin except in the last couple of weeks. 

[00:45:09]


>> The recall effort helped republicans because the ground game, obama's ground game across the country is better an romney's. And so I think because of the recall effort the republicans are running neck and neck. I think the republicans mitt romney has a better chance to win wisconsin than he does nevada. Nevada the ground game, harry reid's political machine, i think obama is going to win, nevada. 
>> Greta: You are from wisconsin, john, and you were just there. 
>> I was. Everywhere you go you meet people who voted for obama the last time and are going to vote for mitt romney this time around. You have a lot of people switching sides over there. The scott walker recall energized republicans and brought independents into the republican party who liked what scott walker was doing. There are couple of problems facing mitt romney. One is that the recall electorate that gave scott walker a 7 point margin of victory supported obama. There is still a problem there of 500,000 voters who came out in 2008 who didn't come out out in the recall. People think those are obama voters and if they come out that could spell bad news. 
>> Greta: Bart star now endorsed governor romney and in wisconsin he is a big deal. Does is it have any impact? 
>> He is a big deal. But president obama had charles woodson the other day. If aaron rodgers had been there on the ground probably a 20 point holdout for mitt romney. 
>> Standing by for brett favre. 
>> Thatle be the big get, that's right. 
>> Let's remember that john kerry called lambeau field lambert and he won wisconsin that year. 
>> I think thought he won wisconsin that year. 
>> Greta: When said lambert you can hear everyone gasp. 
>> That hurt obviously. 
>> We have much more straight ahead. One political analyst just called the race for president. Find out hot analyst is and who he -- who the analyst is and o hehehehehe ] pro. Governor of getting it done. You know how to dance... With a deadline. And you...Rent from national. Because only national lets you chse any car in the aisle... And go. You can even take a full-size or above, and still pay the mid-size price. This is awesome. 

[00:47:30]


[ Male Announcer ] YES, IT IS, BUSINESS PRO. Yes, it is. Go national. Go like a pro. million veterans living in the united states. We depend on the disabled american veterans to fight for benefits and rights that we earned. Don't forget america's disabled veterans, and remember the dav. 

[00:51:00]


>> Greta: Still four days to go but michael barone looking at the map, analyzing it and concluding governor romney will wind handily. Barone predicting governor romney will get 315 electoral votes and president obama will get 223. We are back with the political panel. Rick, this is going out on a limb. Did analysis and spent a lot of time on this one. 
>> He is in the minority o thinking this is a blowout for either candidate particularly for mitt romney. The momentum in the last couple of days has been on obama's side. I think since sandy hit it stopped mitt romney in his tracks and kind of paused the race for a couple of days. I have a hard time seeing all of the ses break in one direction. It can happen certainly within the margin of error in all of the states but you look at the national map and battleground map that has president obama running fairly strongly and leading in most of the battleground states including critical, ohio. And it is hard to see how he gets blown out of the water by mitt romney. I don't see this as being a 300 plus electoral right for mitt romney. 
>> Greta: He hangs his hat largely on the independents. That is why he says this is going to break for romneyly think the independents will break for romney. I doubt it will be that much. I agree with rick it will be tighter than that. I don't see romney winning, pennsylvania. I think he has got to win, ohio. The problem for romney is numbers among hispanics very poor. They were aiming for 38% of hispanics and they are in the LOW 20s NOW. Can he win in the midwest where there aren't a lot of hispanics? Yes. He has to win, ohio, and virginia and he has got to win florida. 
>> I think we are heading into a 2004 nail biter. Look at the polls in ohio, today barack obama is almost exactly where george w. Bush was in the polls in ohio 8 years ago. Look at the job approval ratings, barack obama's job approval rating is almost exactly where george w. Bush's approval rating is. The only thing looking better for romney at this point is obama is worse off in the polls. George w. Bush had a 1.5 percentage-point lead going into election day and right now it is even. 

[00:53:08]


>> Greta: Rick what is the best thing politically that governor romney is looking at right now, when looks at this and what is the best thing politically president obama is looking at when they look at what is winding down between now and tues 
>> romney looks at the number among independents and also looks at the possibility of building this national lead and I think closing on theconomy. Closing with what works for him in terms of making the argument he is the candidate of change. He has to hope for a big weekend to turn things around a little bit in terms of the close and I think president obama has to feel good about how things developed the last couple oays and point out the independents are not like independents in previous cycle. Losing among independents may not be the same as it was four or eight years ago. 
>> Greta: Bob, what about benghazi. Governor romney doesn't mention it, his surrogates do and we certainly discussed it here. Any ing at all on this? 
>> I think slight. Not a lot. If you are on the fence benghazi certainly does not help the president. The president has been focusing on osama bin laden and the fact that he is dead. Beng if you are on the fence maybe you vote against the president. But one way or the other a lot of people are for romney or obama and nobody is changing their mind. 
>> Coming up, vice president biden taking a stab at late NIGHT TVoohooo..Hahaahahaha! Oh...there you go. Wooohooo....Hahaahahaha! I'm gonna stand up to her! No you're not. I know. You know Ronny folks who save hundreds of dollar switching to GEICO sure are happy. How happy are they Jimmy? Happier than a witch in a broom factory. Get happy. Get GEICO.

>> Did you ever wonder why you often end up with dry food from your conventional oven? That's because dry heat takes a long time to penetrate into the food and as it does, it pushes out moisture, so you can end up with dry meat, poultry and fish. Restaurants and professional chefs have solved this problem using steam-infused roasting ovens. Ninja has taken that same steam-infusion technology and made it available in your home for the very first time. 
>> Mark, I'm going to demonstrate this. We have this beautiful prime rib here. Now, I have just simply seasoned this with a little salt and pepper and now I'm giving it a really good sear to get that beautiful color that you see here. So now I'm going to take this out, put it on my rack. 
>> Got it. 
>> And this is where the magic's gonna happen. A little beef stock. You could actually do this, use your imagination, do whatever you want to do. I use a little red wine. You could throw herbs in the. 
>> O.K., So this is going to give the steam infusion that we were just talking about and it's also gonna give the flavor infusion at the same time. 
>> You can't do that in an oven. That's the beauty of this. Come here and take a look at this. This is a prime rib that we cooked for less than an hour. Take a look at this. 
>> Wow, that looks perfect. 
>> Let me cut you another piece. Look at the juice in that. Is that amazing? 
>> That is definitely cooked perfectly. 
>> But the fact that this cooked in under an hour, absolutely perfect. When I say goof-proof, taste that. Right? 
>> That tastes awesome. Now remember, unlike your big oven at home, with the ninja, no preheating is required, so no wasting time for oven to heat up. 

[00:13:44]


>> Stephanie: And look what else you can do with steam roasting. Check out these ribs. 
>> Mark: Wow! 
>> They are so tender. The meat literally falls from the bone. 
>> You know, I know that if you try to cook ribs like that in a conventional oven, they can come out pretty tough and dry. 
>> I steam roasted a whole chicken. All I did was add lemon and rosemary for a little seasoning. Then I put the chicken broth underneath. 
>> So that's the steam infusion. 
>> That's that beautiful steam infusion. 
>> Also a flavor infusion coming through that. 
>> And 40% less time this took to cook than a conventional oven. Wait till you see how juicy this is. Look at this! Absolutely... 
>> That looks perfect. 
>> So juicy. 
>> That is definitely one juicy chicken. 
>> [Women laugh] 
>> take a look at this salmon with the apricot-mustard glaze. 
>> Mark: Beautiful. Love the apricot mustard. 
>> Cooks up quick and moist. Take a look at this. 
>> Really, in just 1015 minutes? Awesome. 
>> Announcer: No other kitchen appliance gives you ninja's revolutionary steam-infused roasting. Juicy meats and poultry, perfectly tender fish, all done in as little as half the time with less fat. Forget greasy take out and serve ninja fast healthier homemade meals that are juicy and taste great. Your family will thank you every time you steam roast their favorites with the ninja.

>> Steam roasting in the ninja is so easy. I don't even like to cook and even I can do it. 
[???...] 
>> our next cooking solution is searious slow cooking. Most recipes have you searing your meats in a skillet, then transferring them to your slow cooker pot. But that means you lose all that flavor in the bottom of the skillet. Only the new ninja cooking system allows you to actually sear, then slow cook in the same professional, non-stick pot, keeping all that delicious flavor in, so your favorite recipes taste better than ever and cleanup is easier because there's just one pot. 

[00:16:13]

>> Peas, love the peas. 
>> Frozen peas, right out of the freezer. 
>> Frozen, no problem with frozen, o.K.

>> What happens after that? 
>> Eight hours later, mark, you're home, you're hungry. No problem.! The ninja cooked all day while you were at work. 
>> That is terrific. That looks like a beautiful, home cooked meal. That is terrific. Our slow cooking feature is totally programmable, so you're able to prepare dinners in the morning, let them slow cook all day so they're waiting for you when you get home and because it's a professional, non-stick pot, you can even put the ingredients in the pot in the fridge the night before so they're ady to cook in the morning. You can't do that with crockery because it might crack. 
>> I've got chicken wings. Chicken wings with a nice brown caramelized setting. The fact that I could brown them first with the stovetop setting and then put in my ingredients, put the lid on, set it to slow cook and came home hours later to chicken wings that fall right off the bone. 
>> That looks perfectly caramelized, delicious. 
>> You know, mark. The last four years, I've truly used every make and model on the market a this blows out the competition. It is a fantastic machine and it is my new family favorite. Thank you.>> You know what, thank you for saying t stephanie. It is so much more than a slow cooker as you've seen. You have all those different cooking solutions. 
>> Announcer: After a long day, wouldn't you like more quality family time? Now you can. The ninja does more for you than any ordinary kitchen appliance and it's also a revolution in slow cooking technology because now you can sear and saute, then slow cook all in the same pot.

In just a few minutes we're going to compare apples to apples. Looking at original medicare, supplements, andhumana medicare advantage plans. But first, I want to tell you a little more about the fitness program. Humana gives you membership at a local fitness center where you have access to all the center programs and equipment. The silver sneakers program has made me feel a whole lot better. I've lost some weight. I feel a lot more comfortable in public because I'm not as heavy as I used to be.

Knowing that silver sneakers is all across the united states, that if we do start this traveling, we know we can find a cire that has silver sneakers and continue on with the swimming and exercising. And we'll make new friends someplace else. Let's take a look at some of the most frequently used benefits. Things like do 

[00:12:07]


visits and prescription drugs. Let's take a minute and compare apples to apples between the different kinds of medicare coverage. Let's start with doctor visits. Something most of us use at least a couple times a year. With original medicare, you pay 20% of the medicare approved doctor's fee. Now, a medicare supplement will cover that 20%, but keep in mind the high monthly premiumyou have to pay. Now, what about prescription drugs? With original medicare, you have to pay extra for a part d prescription drug plan. Medicare supplement plans are the same way. Drugs are extra. But, with the humana medicare advantage plan, you don't need a separate drug plan. It's the all in one plan that includes prescription coverage. Humana has been talking to people all across the country about the changes to medicare, and we've been getting a lot of questions. But what it comes down to is this, you can purchase a separate prescription drug plan that covers nothing but prescription drugs. Or, you can sign up for a humana all in one plan that has prescription drug coverage already built in. Let me repeat that. With a humana medicare advantage plan there's no need for you to purchase a separate prescription drug plan. And remember, the medicare prescription drug benefit built into humana's medicare advantage plans covers brand name and generic drugs. In just a moment you'll see the number to call for the free decision guide to help you with this important ch. You need to pick up the phone now and make that call. Are you paying too much and getting too little with your current medicare plan? As a medicare beneficiary, you have an important choice to make. You can purchase a separate drug plan for an additional cost, or better yet, you can choose a humana medicare advantage plan, an all in one plan that includes your health benefits

I think you'll find it's very worth your time. Now is the best time to call. I feel that I can read peopleairly well and i, I read these people as being the kind of people that truthfully care about our health. And that, to me, means a lot. The fact is, there are a lot of companies out there right now offering medicare plans. But, as you know, the company behind the plan is very important when it comes to service and stability. But, before I tell you about humana, I want to call your attention to the number on your screen. You can call this number at any time for this free decision guide. Humana has been in the health industry for more than 50 years and is one of the nation's largest health benefit companies. Humana provides 

[00:16:09]


insurance to millions of people across the country. Over the years, humana has been a pioneer in health benefits and member wellness. So humana is a strong company serving millions of people. But, of course, the only person who really matters is you. Listen to what others have to say about their personal experiences with humana. Have you ever been somewhere where people just treat you so nice and they've done so much for you that when you walked out you felt like you'd stolen something? Well, that's the kind of way we feel about humana. They've been so good to us. A humana medicare advantage plan is a different kind of medicare plan. It's not a medicare supplement plan where you may have to purchase a drug plan separately. This plan delivers the 3 things you care most about; prescriptio drug coverage, doctor visit and hospitalization coverage, plus cost savings on your plan premium. In fact, humana contracts directly with the federal government to provide this coverage. So, the actual monthly health plan premium often surprises people. Some people even find that a humana medicare advantage plan can help them control their monthly heth care costs. Now, let's take just a moment to see how a humana medicare advantage plan compares to medicare supplement plans and to original medicare. This bar represents original medicare. As you can see, it covers hospitalization and doctor office visits when you're sick. Keep in mind, you have to pay a deductible for each hospital stay and for doctor visits. Next, let's look at medicare supplement plans. As you cee, they cover the same things as medicare alone, but they also cover your medicare deductibles and co-insurance. Medicare supplements cover more, but you pay more. And remember, if you want drug coverage with medicare supplements or original medicare, it will cost 

[00:18:09]


you extra. Now, let's take a look at humana's medicare advantage plans. Hospitalization, office visits, covered deductibles and of course, the humana plan includes prescription drug coverage. And coverage when you go to ctor or specialist. It looks good on the chart, right? But, will it work for you? Well, let's just take a quick moment to review some of the comments humana members made earlier in the program. I love that feeling. I don't worry about anything when it comes to my medical anymore. Not a thing. Humana's probably the best thing that's happened to us. I think I'm more than an insured person with humana. The dimension that silver sneakers has added is being able to socialize with people within my age group. A humana medicare advantage plan includes a fitness program that includes a fitness center membership. It's the chance you've been waiting for to improve your health, get active and start to get back in shape. I have attended the silver sneakers classes. They are wonderful. It's just a good thing to have people around u, you know? Get off that rocking chair. I love going to the heallub, going to silver sneakers and we've met so many nice friends there. It's just been a great experience. You want to live to be older but you want good quality of life to go with it. And we got that. And we're joying life. The fitness program is great. But, I want to make sure we don't forget aboutthe core benefits and savings of a humana medicare advantage plan. You are covered for office visits. You pay nothing for many preventive services such as mammogramsand prostate exams. Plus, you get the prescription drug coverage that covers generic and brand name drugs. And I want to make sure we really clarify what this means and how it differs 

[00:20:10]


from original medicare. If you use original medicare and you visit the doctor, you have to first meet your annual deductib. And then you're still responsible for 20% of the charges. This means your out of pocket expenses can vary depending on the cost of the service. With a humana medicare advantage plan you have no deductible to worry about so costs are predictable and easy to budget. That's why it's so important for you to call now and request your free copy of the decision guide. You can call the number on your screen, right now. Whatever you do,don't put this off.

Here's the biggest difference between kids parties and mexico and those in the u.S. In mexico, we're outside. Mexico city has fabulous weather year-round, so whenever we want to celebrate anything with the kids, we just head outdoors. If you want to see how much we love celebrating outside, take a peek at a park on a saturday or sunday. In any city with a big mexican population here in the u.S. Or back in mexico, you will find plenty of families gathered together there. Bouncy houses on public property, something delicious on the grill, a pi??ata hanging from a tree, that's probably us continuing our tradition of mexican-style kidrties. I'm pati jinich, and today we're gonna make some of the fun foods that you generally find at a typical mexican kids party. We'll get a little crazy with corn, create a couple of snacks on a stick, and finish with an ooey gooey dessert. So come join me. Let me take you on a mouthwatering journey that begins right here at "pati's mexican table." 
- ?????? Dame, dame     dame tu chocolate       dame, dame       dame tu piloncillo       dame, dame       dame cafe caliente       dame, dame       dame tu corazon     ??????

mexico: The place you thought you knew. This program is proudly sponsored by the mexican association of protected horticulture. Fresh, smooth, authentic. Pass avocadoes from mexico. Tajin, for a mexican kick to your life. Kids parties make me think about my sister. I'm the youngest one of fougirls, so we hand plenty of celebrations growing up. Even today, we still talk about the friends, the family, the games, and, of course, the food. Every single year, my sisters and I had surprise birthday parties, and every single year, we pretended to rprised. I would tell my parents, "hey, I t know if I wanna have a birthday party, but if I do, can I please have some crazy corn?" It was, and still is, one of my favorite foods. Now, regarding which corn to use, in mexico, we tend to use the cacahuazintle corn, which has really big and thick corn kernels. They're really meaty. But you can't find them here that easily. And we do use all sorts of other kinds of corn. You can use the bi-colored, the yellow, the white. I tend to go for the white because it's less sweet than the yellow. But when push comes to shove, I go for the freshest. So look for some crisp leaves, some, you know, thin, clean hair, and then give it a good rinse. As far as cooking, as always, you have options. And you know crazy corn is really mexican street food at its best. And we love bringing that street food into our homes because kids and grownups are crazy about it. So you find that crazy corn food stand, 

[00:06:16]


and they usually have these he pots with many, many, many already cooked corn in th and you will go and pick which one is winking an eye at you, and then you will go ahead and dress it up. Just simmer it in hot boiling water. Don't add salt, because it will toughen the corm. Some people like to add a little bit of sugar. And you just cook it for about 5 minutes or 6 minutes. Just until it's do, because if not, it will get too mushy and mealy. And mushy in... Not such a good way. The other choice is to use an indoor griller pan, just like this one. And all you do is rub the corn with some butter or a little bit of oil and just let it sit there and...Flip it once you see that one side has charred-- so you have a wonderful, wonderful combination of charred and rustic flavor with the sweetness of the corn. Now the fun part begins because you can dress it up. So, in mexico they will usually give you the corn on big wooden sticks. I like to give the corn to my boys with some corn holders. So there you go. On one side... And then it goes on the other. And then you just tailor it to your taste. So, I'm going o add, first, some butter. So I'm going all over the corn. And then I'm going to add some mayo. Some people choose to add cream. You can do cream. You cano mayo. So here it goes. And then us can use any kind of crumbly, salty cheese. I love using the queso fresco. In mexico we use the qufresco or the queso cortija or the queso a??ejo, which is a aged cheese. And then I'm going to go ahead cover the corn in its entirety. 

[00:08:18]


All over. Just like that. And then you add some salt... To taste. Now, my middle son stops right here. But my oldest son and m youngest one and myself add a lot of ground chile piquin, which is punchy and citrusy and has so much depth of flavor. Then the last thing you do is drizzle some lime juice on top. But it has to be freshly squeezed, and you do it right at the moment. Now, my littlest one, and I think he takes after me, after we dress the corn in its entirety with everything, he goes ahead and then sprinkles a little bit more salt and a little bit more chile and a little bit more lime juice after each and every single bite. There you go. This is the last thing. A drizzle of fresh squeezed lime juice. Can I tell you how good this is? Oh, my gosh. It's unbelievable. This i this is messy goodness that the whole family will love. Mexican kids parties are all about having your family spoil you with good food. And I know because I was one of those lucky kids. Typical mexican children love going to outdoor and indoor neighborhood markets. It's like a toy box filled with amazing flavors, colors, textures, and smells. There is an endless variety of foods to try, including flautas, rolled corn tortillas that are stuffed with things like cheese or meat or veggies and then fried. 

[00:10:18]


Chicken flautas are easy, and the best part of it is that they're great finger foods that everybody loves, kids and grownups. And I'm using corn tortillas. The first thing I'm going to do is heat them up so they will become even more soft and pliable, so that when I roll them u they're not gonna crack or break. Thcomal has been heating for about 10 minutes over low-to-medium heat, and I have to put the tortillas on there when the comal is hot so they won't stick. After I place the tortillas, I'm gonna let them brown a little in the bottom before I flip them. I have just grilled chicken breasts that I shredded. I have the warmed-up tortillas. And then I'm gonna show you how to roll them up into flautas. So you just have to pack up the filling much more tighter than if you were doing a regular taco. So you know when you make tacos, you have the choice of how chubby you want them. Well, with flautas, which translates to "flute," I usually... Thin and packed. And then the traditional way to prepare the flautas is to deep fry them in very hot oil. But you have options. You can toast them as well. I'm gonna show you. So after you roll them, so these won't happen, you're going to run a toothpick through them. Through 2 or 3, depending on how thinly you packed them, and you're going to run the toothpick through the opening. And then you know to test your oil, you don't need any fancy thermometer or anything you've chosen to check the mood of your oil. 

[00:12:20]


If it is bubbling super-happily when the food touches it, like now, that means it's ready. Happy bubbles. And then the other choice is to just place the tacos in a hot comal or a pan and just wait until they start to toast and flip them around. Now, I can see the bottom of the flautas are already crisp, and they have a beautiful golden brown color, which is what I'm looking for. So I'm gonna flip them, gently. Ooh. Perfect. And then I'm going to do the same with the comal now. Usually the comal takes longer as they're toasting, but they will both be tasty and super crispy. Now, don't worry about the flautas soaking too much oil. If you have the oil at the right temperature, then the oil is just going to make these taquitos nice and crisp, and the tortillas will not be soaking that much oil. So they are ready. That was fast. You can make them ahead of time, and just keeered. I'm letting them drain in here a little. Then I'm gonna let them drain over the paper tel on the plate. And let me show you what's going on with these other tacos. See how they're toasting? So you will have two different flavors and two different textures. This will taste like a more rustic griddle flavor, which is also delicious, and these will be like your regular crispy taco in the thin shape of a flauta. So just grab a plate and dress up your flautas. So I'm gonna have in here those that I fried. They've cooled down. 

[00:14:21]


And you have all these choices. You have the lettuce, which is so green and fresh and pretty. And then the tangy and slightly salty crema fresca. You can use creme fraiche, you can use latin creams, salvadorian cream, heavy or sour cream. But if you find mexican crema, it really has an incredible flavor. Then I'm going to add some of this green salsa. Mmm. Right on top. You make these foods for kids parties, and the grownups just jump all over it. It's really fun to see. And then I'm just adding a little bit of that queso fresco on top, and you have a plate that looks like a party for a kids party. So you have the kids that will love, you know, either grabbing one and eating it as a finger food. You will have other kids that will love dressing it up. In any case, you will have tasty bites to go. If you've mastered the art of the pi??ata and want to try another authentic mexican party game, get ready to peel an onion. First, kids sit down, one in front of the other, in a long line. They hug the person in front of them tightly. One child stands up and tries to peel them apart, one by one, just like a long green onion, a cebolleta, which has layers and layers of skin. If they succeed, then they get to go sit at the end of the line, and the person they just unpeeled has to try and pull the rest of the onion apart. Who wins? It doesn't really matter. It's all about how much they enjoy the game. 

[00:16:23]


Cakes, or a little something sweet, are a given at any kids birthday party. When I was growing up in mexico city, the place to go get your cake was sanborns. ! That's a mexican chain that dates back to 1903. It's a restaurant, department store, and pharmacy all rolled into one. The flagship store is housed in an 18th century palace known as la casa de los azulejos, the house of tiles. It's also famous for its pastries, and especially it's elaborate, traditional mexican birthday cakes. Cupcakes are all the rage in america, and I'm so lucky, because my sister alisa is here. She has her bakery in miami, and she has given the american cupcake the mexican twist that it was begging for. Yeah, we did. Show me how to do it. Let's get going. Ok. Now, the first thing that you're going to do is help me put all the wet ingredients in here: The eggs, the buttermilk, the vanilla, and I'm going to work on the dry ingredients. This is bringing me back to my childhood because she was always elling me what to do. This was a good thing because I was ways getting in trouble. Yeah, she was. Ok, so, eggs... Nobody knew that you had a big sister. Now they're going to see who's boss. Get it moving. Get it moving. [Laughs] two eggs. Wait, alisa, we have 3 es, and then I'm adding buttermilk. Tablespoon. I have vanilla from papantla. Ok, so tell me when to stop. Just like if you were adding, like, half a teaspoon of vanilla. Ok. She tells me what to do, and she tells me when to stop. That's a good thing. You got your wet ingredients, and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to work on the dry-- the other thing we're going to do also is add just a little bit of salt. Maybe a quarter teaspoon of salt. 

[00:18:27]


Ok. We're going to get the machine working here. So we're going to add the butter first. It has to be at room temperature. Ok. The whole... So you have the butter at room temperature, and you have the sugar. Yes, we do. Ok. We're going to get this moving. Ok. Don't forget to always start with a very low speed. Because if not, sugar's going to be flying everywhere. Pati: Ok. Crank it up. Crank it up, woman. So, when do you stop? Until it's very soft? You just have to see that when you whisk it, it looks vcreamy. Like fluffy, fluffy... Fluffy. [Pati laughs] I'll start with the dry. Ok. Ok. And then I'm going to add a little bit more. So, all of it? All of it. All of it. Ok. And into the whisk. Ok. I'll clean up for you. Thank you. My pleasure. It's off. It looks beautiful. Hot water. Hot to the touch, but not burning hot. And this is because? And I'm adding it. The cupcakes have to have like a more silky consistency, andt makes it look silky, and it gives more moisture when you're baking the cupcakes. So in the end. Ok. So this is the last part, and then we're done with the batter. P perfect. 

[00:20:28]


I think it looks very nice. You seet looks very smooth and creamy. Mmm! Very... Runny almost. And you want it that runny, right? A little bit runny, yes. Ok. Um, if you take a scoop-- with an ice cream scoop. Ok. And it gives you that right amount of batter that need to pour into the cupcakes. Ok. My sister always has the best tricks. I would have never thought of this, and I would have just scooped with a big, uh... I'm going to put this here. ...Ladle. Just--because I'm left-handed. She's left-handed. I'm right-handed. Yes. And yore filling them all the way to the top? About 3/4, because they're really going to rise. You're going to see. Now, alisa, as you do this, can I get your ganache going? Why don't you get the chocolate started. Very low temperature. Very low. I have your water pan. Do it slow. I want to make sure that the chocolate doesn't burn on the side. No burning. You have to take care of it ok, so I have the chocolate, bittersweet chocolate. Bittersweet chocolate. Beautiful. Ok, so we have these over low heat. And you're still scooping these. S, I am. Ok. And there... Si. Ok. And then just start moving it around, so whatever sticks on the corner-- it'll start to burn. Ok. So you don't want the chocolate to burn around the edges. No. Ok, so the chocolate is meltin do we need to get this in the oven? I think we're ready to put this in the oven. Let me just clean a little bit the sides, because it's going to burn. So, she has a sweet tooth, but I have a big mouth. I love eating. We're going to put this in the oven now. So the temperature, pati-- yeah?350? And I think...20 minutes. 

[00:22:29]


20 minutes. Alisa, a little more? You have to whisk it a little bit more, to make sure that you have most of it-- then we can finish it up here outside. Ok. Ok. So, do you want to stir? Now we're going to finish-- so now you can start adding the... The milk? No, no, no, it's not milk. It's heavy whipping cream. Heavy whipping cream. So this is your basic ganache, right? Ok. So I'm moving it slowly, because I don't want it to splatter everywhere. But once I get this going-- yeah? It's going to be really creamy. I think it's perfect. Now we're just going to finish our ganache. With the sugar. Ok. All of it? Yeah, all of it. Ok. Um, your butter. Butter. Which is so, so, so, so almost melted. It looks shiny. It gives it, like, a very shiny texture. It looks like a chocolate mirror almost, it's so shiny. Now we're just gonna wait for the cupcakes to be ready and baked. Ok, so they're cool. It smells good. It smells fabulous. Now teach me. What do we do next? I'm going toeach you a little trick. Ok. This is how we make the holes to do the filling in our cupcakes in my store. Isn't this like an apple corer? It's a simple apple corer, and it's very simple to show you. Like, right in the middle, because you want to have the filling in the middle, and just to feel that you're not going all the way down. Right. And then, you see? The center comes out. And then you give it to the kids. And then you eat. So you want to start doing this? Mm-hmm. Ok. Ok, so I made the holes. 

[00:24:29]


I think we have enough to... To get started. And then this is very easy, because if you do it with a spoon, it's a little bit more messy. So in my store we use a pastry bag, and then just fill it in with a yummy cajeta. It looks delicious. And now we're going to... Glaze them. This is just the last part, but it's the most delicious part. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to try to tilt, a little bit, the bowl. Ok. And I'm going to drip it, and I'm just going to-- very, very softly twirl it around to make sure that I don't have any drops. Did I do a very good job? Beautiful. Can I do one? You want to do one? So you go on the side, but you don't want the cupcake to fall in their, either. So you go around-- very fast. You have to be fast. But swift. But gentle. All at the same time. But careful. All at the same time. Stop dripping the cupcake. And then just make sure at the end-- to eat it at home, this is yummy because you can just grab this... Mmm. Mmm. The sides. And then usually you let them dry? Or you can eat them like that? It hardens a little bit after a couple of hours. I'm going for this one, just because I want to make up for eating all her bananas when we were growing up. I'm taking the little one. And I'm taking the other one here. We're going to make a sister toast. [Laughs] and not because she's my sister and I adore her, but if you are going to try a cupcake at home, any cupcake, this has to be the one. Cheers. Cheers. The paper. Ah! Ah! Ah! Pati: I didn't know what cupcakes were growing up. 

[00:26:31]


But I did know that my family made parties special because of the love and attention they gave. And the food. As a grownup, it's fun to mix and match all the new recipes, mexican and american. So thank you for joining us here at my mexican table, discovering recipes we adored as kids and still adore as grownups.

Staten island neighborhoods homeland security secretary janet napolitano toured the area, vowing to do everything she could to help. Plus, after insisting this sunday's new york city maratn would go on, mayor bloomberg canceled the race. Many were outraged the city would take valuable efforts away from the recovery efforts for the marathon. Tonight, city hall and race officials have called it off. Meanwhile, look at this. Cars lined up for miles to get gas. Drivers in some cases waiting 20 hours as the supply dwindles, fighting with each other. There's one report that a guy pulled a gun at one gas station. Tonight the military is delivering fuel to the disaster zone, sending 24 million gallons of extra gas, a welcome sign. The obama administration is hiring trucks to bring the gas to staging areas. All this is unfolding four days before the generion. President obama and governor romney fighting it out for every last vote, especially in the key state of ohio. Today the latest cnn poll shows obama with a very slight edge there, but there's everything to play for. Today, the last jobs report before election day was released. Unemployment ticking up to 7.9%, but at the same time, 171,000 jobs were created. No surprise, both candidates reacted differently to the news. 
>> Today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs. This morning we learned that companies hired more workers in october than at any time in the last eight months. 
>> He said he was going to lower the unemployment rate down to 5.2% right now. Today, we learned that it's actually 7.9% and that's ne million jobs short of what he promised. Unemployment is higher today than when barack obama took office. 
>> Mitt romney earlier today. You're looking at live pictures now from westchester in ohio, where rudy giuliani, the former mayor of new york, has given a blistering speech attacking barack obama. In a few minutes, he will be on this show live and exclusive to tell me why he feels so strongly why the president should leave the office. Let's start with these long lines for gas. Susan candiotti is at one gas station in new jersey. I have been following your travails for most of the day. You have been joining endless lines for gas in your car. Most of the time coming up against a blank. Where are you now and how does it allnd? 

[00:02:20]


>> Reporter: Well, it all ended with us not getting any gas. It looks like a ghost town here. You can see they were open for a good nine hours. They had the supply but those lines just sucked it all up. Too many customers and eventually they had to shut down tonight. So a lot of people were turned back and yes, piers, we went to two different places, spent the whole afternoon in two different lines, and came up dry. That's happening to a lot of people. Some are luckier than others but I got to tell you, it's been very impressive at least here in parts of new jersey where I was, to see how many people were helping each other, sometimes pushing cars to get to the fuel pump, and other people being as calm as they possibly could and saying look, we know that it's a bad situation, we know that they're trying to do the best they can, and we just have to go with the flow here and come back and try again tomorrow. But a lot of people were hitting up 15, 16, 20 stations and still not finding anything. 
>> Nate silva, the "new york times" pollster of pollsters, tweeted just now that his cab driver just told him he waited 20 hours for gas, which is a familiar kind of story I think for a lot of cab drivers now. What is the real problem? Lots of misconceptions I think that there is a lack of gas but actually, that's not the real problem, is it. It's more to do with no power means they can't pump the gas. 
>> Reporter: You're right. It's all those things rolled up into one. You've got a lot of different things at play here. First of all, some gas stations actually have the gas in their tanks below ground and would love to pump it but as you said, they don't have the power to do it. Other places can't get it in fast enough, even though the fuel supplies are starting to flow more rapidly, because it's taking so long to fill up the tanks. They only have so many terminals to get it and that's why there is more hope tonight that with this announcement that obama, president obama has asked the defense department to free up some extra fuel, you mentioned it already, upwards of 24 million gallons to get more of it out here and transported more easily so that it can get out faster to the gas stations that do have power. 

[00:04:32]


>> Yeah. It's a hell of a struggle. Su thank you very much indeed. 
>>> Joining me now from columbus, ohio, is general wesley clark, an obama supporter, former nato supreme allied commander. General, welcome back. 
>> Thank you, piers. 
>> All the action now is heading to ohio. Almost everyone who is anyone down there, including your good self. The polls are very, very tight, showing very marginal lead for the president in most of the ones I've seen but with the margin of difference, you could almost say it's a tie. How are you seeing it down there on the ground? 
>> Well, there's a lot of emotion, there's just thousands of volunteers out here. There's a ground game. We feel very good about the ground game, by the way. Our volunteers are charged up. We've been working this for three and a half years. We knew it would come down to this. We were prepared for it. And we've fought to keep the polls open and make the ground game possible. 
>> I read yesterday, I think again it was nate silver who said that if romney was to lose ohio, he would have just a 3% chance of winning the election. Conversely, if barack obama lost ohio, he would only have an 8% chance of victory. That shows you just how incredibly important ohio may turn out to be. 
>> Well, it's an important -- it's critical. It's a very diverse state. But you know, barack obama's very firm stand in saving the american automobile industry has paid important dividends in ohio. This morning I was in youngstown and youngstown, we produced the chevy cruz. That's a gm product that is the direct result of the president's intervention to bail out the automobile industry. 
>> As a former commander yourself, how do you think the president's done this week in 

[00:06:32]


>> I think he's done extremely well in terms of his sympathy and empathy for the groups, his visit. I think he was smart not to go into new york city, where it's too congested, too many problems. I think he's also done well in terms of showing the power of the office by just the latest move of having the military assist in delivery of fuel. It also shows up the hollowness of governor romney, his flip-flopping. For example, on the issue of fema, he was suggesting months ago that maybe you don't need a federal emergency management agency, maybe you can just let each state fend for itself. Now, imagine where we would be if someone had actually taken that advice and killed fema. You would have new york, new jersey, each fighting with each other for scarce resources, for fuel, for power, for electric line repair, competing against each other to bring in assistance from other states instead of having someone to coordinate it and push it. 
>> We obviously saw the extraordinary scenes this week in many ways of governor christie in new jersey, sort of metaphorically putting his arm around the president, telling him what a great president he was. Last thing you would have expected say two weeks ago. What did you make of that? 
>> I thought it was a fair appraisal. Look, governor christie and new jersey has a real problem. Jersey shore devastated, plus all the electric outages and problems throughout a large part of the state. Of course governor christie needs help. This is what happens when governors need help, they come to washington. And americans expect washington to help. There is a role for the commander in chief, for the president of the united states, when disaster strikes at home. That's what americans expect of their leader. 
>> Were you pleased that the marathon was canceled? 
>> Yeah. I think it was a smart move. I do. It's been -- new yorkers have been really terrific about this. People downtown in manhattan have been ur days without light or power. The streets are dark. It's like sarajevo during the siege in the balkans and the thought of more people coming in on top of the people that are already there and the people in and out of hotels, trying to find places to get showers and restauraclosed, basically all of manhattanion was jammed north of 40th street, makes sense given the uncertainties of this and the pressure on services in manhattan and the discomfiture of people there, don't do the marathon. 

[00:09:05]


>> General wesley clark, thank you very much indeed. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> Coming up, rudy giuliani joining me from ohio. What happens when you cancel the marathon. Dumb luck? Or good decisions? Ones I've made. Ones we've all made. About marriage. Children. Money. About tomorrow. Here's to good decisions. Who matters most to you says the most about you. Massmutual is owned by our policyholders so they matter most to us. Massmutual. We'll help you get there.

[00:12:21]


>>> I believe some americans who might not have asked to have died may have died because we had incompetence in the white house. 
>> Very strong words tonight from -- about the benghazi attack from rudy giuliani, former new york mayor. He joins me now live from the romney rally in ohio. Welcome, rudy. 
>> How are you, piers? Nice to talk to you. 
>> You sounded pretty fired up tonight. Giving four barrels to the president. When you said that some american lives may have been lost because of incompetence, do you lay the blame squarely at the president's door? 
>> Last time I checked, piers, he's the commander in chief. I CAN'T IMAGINE A john McCain not sending the american military in at the earliest possibleent and not worrying about what libya or libyans might have thought. It was clear for months that libya was incapable of protecting our diplomats. The british pulled out. The red cross pulled out. Our diplomats were begging for more security and that consulate had been attacked twice, once with a hole 12 feet wide. What else did the president of the united states need? Did somebody have to bang him on the head? What did he need to go in there and make sure that our people were properly protected? This is what happens when you elect someone president of the united states who isn't ready to lead. Who wants the lead by following. 
>> Do you believe as some republicans do that the white house or certainly people close to the white house were aware of what was happening on that fateful night and decided not to do anything? 
>> They either were aware of it and decided not to do anything or they were asleep at the switch. Either one leads to incompetence. It didn't have to happen. It's a tragedy that could have been avoided with proper leadershipch is now lacking in the white house, and mitt romney would bring the kind of leadership I believe that would stay on top of something like this. 

[00:14:25]


>> Let's turn if we may, mr. Mayo to the situation in new york. Obviously we'll come to the storm in a moment. Right off the top, your view really of what's happened with the new york marathon, you i think were in agreement with the mayor as indeed I was for quite awhile that it should go ahead, it would be a morale boosting exercise, it would rally perhaps new yorkers a way that many events after 9/11 did. I came round before the decision today to thinking actually, i don't think it's a good idea and I did that because I saw what ppened in staten island and the fury and the reaction and i changed my opinion. Did you change your opinion when you saw that overnight and this morning, or were you still of the view you know what, we should get on with it? 
>> I was in staten island this morning, actually. I started the day in staten island, because people there feel very abandoned, they feel very alone and we were trying to raise money to try to help people so it will directly go to people in staten island, breezy point, and the rockaways. I believe, you know, you could have gone either way on what the mayor decided. I don't think this is the time to be criticizing him. I think his instinct was the right instinct. Try to get things going, try to get people to lift their eyes up. Apparently people are still suffering so much that maybe it would have been impossible to do. I think it was a close call. You could have gone either way. I support the mayor in making those decisions. This is not a time to be criticizing mayor bloomberg, governor cuomo, governor christie. They're doing the very best that they can. I think they're doing a pretty darned good job. 
>> The president himself has been getting a lot of praise, not least from governor christie, which surprised people, the sheer level of the praise that he gave him for doing a very, very good job of leadership through this crisis. Do you go along with that? Do you think the president has been an outstanding leader? 
>> I don't know what the heck he was doing in nevada while people were still being discovered dead in new york. If I were the president of the united states, I sure wouldn't be flitting around the midwest and the west and my job would be making sure this thing was followed through to the very end. Maybe the first couple of days, he was keeping his eye on the ball but we got gas lines now that are a mile long. We got bodies still being discovered and we got a president who is playing campaigner in chief. This has been the story of barack obama from the very beginning. 

[00:16:44]


>> You think he's deserted really the area that's needed his attention? 
>> Don't you think he has? What the heck is he doing, flying all over the country and not keeping his attention on what's going on there, making sure people don't have to wait until november 11th or november 12th for the power to go back on. I sure as heck wouldn't have done that when I was mayor. I would have been all over them going crazy, let's do it a little faster, let's get more relief there, let's keep complete concentration on this. I understand he's still running for re-election but his first responsibility is as commander in chief and I think he's taken his eye off the ball at least for the last couple days. Maybe the first couple days kept concentration on it. But I feel pretty darned offended seeing my president floating around campaigning while people are suffering the way people in new york, new jersey and elsewhere are suffering. 
>> It's a heavy charge to level at him, rudy. Wouldn't people just say straight away well, if mitt romney is campaigning over the last 48 hours, then surely the president who only has four days left until the general election, has to campaign, too, doest he? 
>> Sure he can but he could divide his time, couldn't he? I don't see how he's spending any time focused on this. Mitt romney has no responsibilities here. He's the challenger. He actually cut off his campaigning. At every one of these rallies he asks for contributions. Nobody can substitute for the president of the united states. Nobody. He's the commander in chief. It's his responsibility. What we have here is a commander in chief who is constantly putting the responsibility elsewhere. The economy, it's george bush's fault. Benghazi, hillary clinton's fault. Well, the buck stops with the president of the united states. He asked for the job. It's his responsibility to stay on top of it and he right now is not staying on top of this recovery. 
>> Rupert murdoch has tweeted tonight that he thinks that governor christie should now publicly declare very loudly and clearly, redeclare his support for mitt romney given all the praise he's lavished on the president and if he doesn't, then he would bear the blame, according to mr. Murdoch, for the next four years in barack obama gets in. What do you make of that? 

[00:18:59]


>> Oh, I don't go that far at all. I think at the point at which chris christie was saying that it was all quite legitimate. I think president obama at the beginning of this did keep his concentration on this and i think he was entitled to what chris christie said about him. What I'm saying is in the last couple of days, he has been 100% devoted to running for office. He has taken his eye off the ball and in some parts of new york, some parts of new jersey, things are getting worse. They're not getting better. The president's got to keep part of his concentration on this. And he hasn't been doing that. There is no substitute for the president not concentrating on. 
>> Should he now come to new york, the president? 
>> President hasn't been to new york. President hasn't been to breezy point. President hasn't been to staten island. People in staten island feel abandoned. He hasn't been there. 
>> He's obviously been to new jersey with the governor. Do you think he should now come directly to -- 
>> he has been to new jersey but he hasn't been to staten island. He hasn't been to breezy point. Hasn't been to rockaway. These people lost 80 homes, they lost lives and we're still finding bodies there. I think the president has to devote some of his time to concentrating on that. I'm not saying he should completely end his campaigning. At least maybe he could divide his time in half. I also think the president is evading answering questions about benghazi. It's a tragedy that we may go into this election and we don't know the answer, did president obama know about the prior attacks on that consulate. Did he know about the attack in june, when there was a hole drilled through the wall that was 12 feet wide. If that didn't wake him up to the fact that we needed more security in benghazi, then there's something seriously wrong. But this man has now evaded for six weeks answering that simple question. I don't know how you people in the press let him get away with it. 
>> Final question for you, rudy. You're in ohio. Many people think it's the absolutely crucial state that both sides have to win. Can mitt romney become president realistically if he doesn't win ohio? 

[00:21:05]


>> Either one can win without ohio. Simple fact is probably the man who wins is going to win ohio. Is it theoretically possible for either one of them to win without ohio, yeah. We can go through scenarios with wisconsin and colorado, pennsylvania slipping the other way. But believe me, this rally was in ohio for a very very special reason and I think president obama was here either yesterday or today. This is a crucial state. 
>> Rudy -- 
>> whoever wins ohio wins the white house. 
>> While you've been talking, general wesley clark who was on just before you has been listening and actually wants to come back at you. So I'm going to let him have his say now. General. 
>> Thanks, piers. I did want to come back, because I think the politicization of what's happened in benghazi deserves an answer. First of all, as the mayor well knows, after 9/11, democrats did not politicize this tragedy. Not the first day, the first hour, not the first week, not the first month. But with respect to benghazi, i think we're all going to have to wait until the full investigation's done and the information comes out. There has been a lot of fragmentary reporting. Now, I just want to say from my own experience inside the national security system, when i read the fragmentary reporting i get an entirely different picture than wmayor giuliani's portrayed here. What I get is a very responsive chain of command that deployed military assets from europe down to sicily, they were ready to go. They deployed a drone overhead, diverted it from another location. They had all kinds of backup plans. The truth was the assault on the annex itself was over before anybody could have responded with anything other than maybe a ballistic missile, and the people were then evacuated to another annex where the battle was also over until four mortar ro landed and killed our two people on the roof. Now -- 

[00:23:10]


[ speaking simultaneously ] 
>> none of that -- let me say, none of that, general, answers the question did the president of the united states know t the two prior attacks on that consulate, one that drilled a ho in the wall of 12 feet wide, and if he didn't know about it, why didn't he know about it and if he did know about it, why wasn't our ambassador given more security? The president was trying to paint a picture in libya of success. We weren't having success in libya and he fell asleep at the switch. For months, not just that day, but for months before there were warnings. The british pulled out. The red cross pulled out. There were numerous attacks and the president of the united states didn't increase security. There were even some reports that he reduced security. The president hasn't answered that question. It's intolerable that we will have this election and the president will get away with not answering did he know about the prior attacks. Thank you very much. 
>> I don't think it is intolerable. I think it's essential that we do the investigation. There are classified assets in play. That position was in place for classified reasons that don't need to be discussed right here. 
>> General -- 
>> just the edge of it has come out rion television and in the "wall street journal" today, you've just seen the edge of it. The real purpose of that, by the way, that's not where the ambassador lived, that was an annex that was designed to be there to serve a specific classified purpose to help us work against al qaeda in the region. 
>> General, we'll have to leave it there. The mayor has left the building, as they say. So we are going to leave it there. Thank you very much for coming back on and that was a lively exchange. Thank you. 
>> Thanks, piers. 
>>> We'll be back after this short break. With a panel to discuss the axing of the marathon here. ?????? ?????? ?????? Hi dad. Many years from now, when the Subaru is theirs... Hey. You missed a spot. ...I'll look back on this day and laugh. Love. It's what makes a Subaru, a Subaru. running hard, try running four. Fortunately we've got ink. It gives us 5x the rewards on our internet, phone charges and cable, plus at office supply stores. Rewards we put right back into our business. Thiss the only thing we've ever wanted to do and ink helps us do it. Make your mark with ink from chase.

>>> it's with incredibly heavy hearts today, tonight, that we share that the best way to help new york city at this time is to say that we will not be conducting the 2012 ing new york city marathon. 

[00:29:13]


>> It's official. Sunday's new york city marathon is off, canceled in the wake of hurricane sandy. I have two of the runners with me who would have run. Michael weisman is a marathon veteran but his house was wiped out by sandy. Michael, welcome to you. Obviously you're looking forward to the race. You've run it four times before. But there's your wife and two children and house in manhattan beach, long island which was completely destroyed by sandy. The that happened on monday night, did you think and assume that the race would get canceled? 
>> I had to assume. First of all, I no longer have running shoes or running clothes to use. But the amount of devastation on our front porch which is about 10, 15 feet higher than the ground floor, and watching the water overlap our cars, transformers blowing and you're seeing people fleeing from porch to porch trying to help each other out, you're saying there's no way this marathon will occur because we can't recover from this that fast. 
>> When you heard it was going ahead, what did you feel? 
>> I was actually a little bit shocked. I was angry, I wondered whether any of the people making the decision had actually been to these areas which were affected. My neighborhood was destroyed but so was breezy point. Staten istroyed as many othereighborh seagate, and you look at the devastation, you see what you're going to do the next day and you hear thearathon is going to go on and you wonder how are volunteers going to be there handing out water and gatorade when my neighbor doesn't have anything to drink and I'm handing them bottles of water. 
>> I'll be honest, I changed my mind. When I first heard about it i thought you know what, go ahead with it. The show goes on, especially if it's a huge charity fund-raising event. I thought it would be good for new york to end this terrible week. But I changed my mind this morning after the staten island reports and the breezy point, all that. Let me come to you, maria. You're from paraguay. You flew in especially for this race. You feel it should have gone ahead. Why? 
>> Well, I think it's probably the right decision but it seems to be the wrong timing. We were waiting for the organizers to say if it was going to go on or not and when we received the go ahead on wednesday, we took a flight to come here as probably thousands of people from abroad. So it's probably the wrong timicancel it. 

[00:31:29]


>> You think they should have done it immediately. 
>> Of course. 
>> And no one would have flown in. 
>> Actually, everyone was -- i think everyone when we knew sandy was going to come and hit new york everyone knew it was a possibility the marathon would be canceled. It seems a little bit out of timing to cancel it at this point. 
>> Michael, what do you think? 
>> I have no horse in this race. No pun intended. I have no reason -- position at this table with people who would have been -- participated in the ce except that I am a new yorker, and I look at this in an old-fashioned sense that there is a greater civic purpose. This is an event, it's an important event, and you rise to the occasion. You don't say oh, we have a problem, let's not do it, let's cancel, let's quit. 
>> But let me take you up on this. How can you start a marathon in staten island with huge generators to power the start, to all the people that would be there, there were generators for the media, for example, right where so many people, new yorkers, fellow new yorkers, are suffering so badly? That's what really jarred me. 
>> Let's look at this. There's a host of practicalities and I would assume, that goes to the point about timing, that the city, the organizers, the mayor, looked at this and said hey, we can deal with this, we can approach it, we can rise to the occasion. It will be different, it will be 
-- we'll patch it together which is a great way of looking at something. But suddenly it turned so they thought they cou do it. They knew they could do it. And then it turned and it turned because, let me say just I think an air of defeat or an air of something else, this assumption that every time that all civic projects are suspect -- 

[00:33:35]


>> I don't think -- you and i are pretty active on twitter. I think social media played a huge role in this, because I saw the tide turn in public opinion from neworkers on twitter yesterday. I saw it after the staten island news reports. 
>> I actually agree. 
>> People were saying you know something, these people, they're still pulling out their . How can you -- it's a fact that symbolically you would be starng this great happy event right where people are possibly still lying in basements drowned from this hurricane. 
>> Would churchill have canceled the marathon? 
>> I think if the people of london, if we had had one of these -- 
>> that's actually very important. The people of london. Many people at many times during many disasters have come together and said let's do something, something more, something higher, something symbolic. Instead, at this poin time, it was let's not -- this is suspect. They're doing something dirty. The marathon is -- it reflects badly on us. And I think it's just an interesting moment in time. 
>> The death toll is now 106. I've just been told. Many of which were in staten island. I think it's simply a casef it just jarred too much, that people were just you know what, there are too many people found dead there. 
>> I didn't have to jar. People could have said this is shoulder to the wheel. We are going to overcome this. We are gng to do something larger. We are going to get on with it. 
>> Let's take a break. Thank you both for coming in. I'm sorry you won't be running. It's an interesting debate. I have gone both ways on it so i totally get the dilemma the mayor was in. I happen to think he came down the right way which is on the grounds of humanity for people who are suffering. 
>> If the show doesn't go on there can't be a happy ending.

>>> Desperation is growing in staten island as devastation is hard to imagine and tonight, people there are really struggling, coping with this catastrophe as best they can and finding help coming very slowly indeed. Congressman michael grimm represents many in the borough and joins me now. Congressman, thank you for joining me. 
>> Yes, thank you for having me. 
>> It seems that finally, the attention is centered on staten island where it should have been, many would argue, three, four days ago. Why has it been so belated, the help that you so desperately needed? 
>> You know, I don't know exactly, but take the red cross for an example. They called three days ago and they started to drive, they have very big trucks that they bring up that are packed with gear and they did drive from down south, it took them three days to drive through the night, they drove straight through but it takes two, three days for them to get those trucks here. That's one example. Right now at this point, we're not worried about why they didn't get here. We're just glad they're here and we're helping them to coordinate so they can be as effective as possible immediately and get these people that are suffering all the things that they need. 
>> Did you expect the red cros to do more? Many people up there have been angry about the red cross taking so long. You don't appear to share that anger. 
>> No, there's no question that there was certainly disappointment. We didn't feel we had the resources that we needed as ickly as we needed but like i said, they are here now. They are on the ground. Fema is on the ground. Red cross is on the ground. Salvation army is he even secretary napolitano, homeland security, was here today and that was a big boost because she was le to come in, hold a meeting with all of us and coordinate some things between the agencies to make sure that staten island is not going to be forgotten now and i got to tell you, I feel a lot better tonight than I did yesterday. And I actually see it, I see fema going door to door, I see people now getting some of the relief. Don't get me wrong, we still have a lot to do. My office is working 24/7 around the clock. There's a lot to be done. But it is now started officially and things are being coordinated for the first time. So I'm very grateful. And the outpouring, I got to tell you this, neighbors and people around the country sending their thoughts, their prayers and sending clothes and supplies. The people havbeen tremendous. The citizens have really stepped up. 

[00:42:03]


>> What is your reaction to mayor bloomberg canceling the marathon? 
>> Well, I think that the mayor did the right thing. I absolutely believe that he showed tremendous leadership in recognizing that it was wrong to allow that marathon to go forward while so many people are suffering and while we need so many resources like generators and a police presence. So I think he absolutely did the right thing. I know it was hard for him to do because now he's got it from both sides. Those here tare hurt so badly by this devastation were upset that he allowed it to go on, now the runners that are coming in from all over the country are upset that it's canceled. So he really showed a lot of leadership to be in such a tight spot and I appreciate it. I know that we here on staten island appreciate it. 
>> Congressman, best of luck with the continued rescue and i guess revival mission you have there, trying to get things back to some kind of normality. We wish you all the very best with it. 
>> Thank you very much. Appreciate it. 
>>> On the phone now, the president of the american red CROSS, gail McGovern. Thank you very much for joining me. 
>> Thank you for having me on, piers. 
>> There have been criticisms that the red cross was a bit slow off the mark with staten island. Do you accept that criticism and what reassurance can you give the people there now that they're getting your full attention? 
>> Well, first, let me say that my heart goes out to the people on staten island and the people up and down the ean seaboard. This has been a devastating, devastating disaster. We have about 14,000 people in shelters. Weserving 250,000 meals already. And it's a massive operation. And I completely understand why the people in staten island are frustrated. We're frustrated, too. We had sent out emergency response vehicles before this cry for help came but i completely understand why folks are frustrated and we were able to bre through yesterday. The roads are snarled. There are fuel issues. We're sending volunteers from all over the country, almost all 50 states. We've got two-thirds of our emergency response vehicles going from the west coast all the way across the country to the eastern seaboard and it took awhile for us to break through and get there. And I'm just grateful that my teams made it. They are handing out meals, they're driving up and down the streets alerting people that we're here, and I spent the day in staten island with the borough president and i completely understand his frustration. 

[00:44:48]


>> If people are watching and wish to contribute to the red cross for this, what's the best way of doing that? 
>> They can visit our website, redcross.Org, or they can call 1-800-red cross and as always, the american public has just been so generous and we are grateful for every single donation. 
>> You guys do a terrijob. I'm a huge admirer of the red cross. I can only imagine this being utter chaos all over the area for the last four days. Please continue to do the excellent work that you do. I'm just very glad the staten island people are getting the help so obviously so urgently need. Thank you very much.

>>> A year of campaigning down to four crucial days. We have republicav strategist. And a democratic stat gist.

Blowing out of town and we see the devastation, it doesn't look good for the president. Probably should be spending a little more time and I think for rudy giuliani to say that is pretty significant. Might be good advice for the president. 
>> To be fair, mayor bloomberg made iclear he didn't want it him to come to new york. Let me ask you, jamaal simmons. Would it be prudent to say i will come to staten island and stand with the people suffering? 
>> No. What rudy giuliani did is despicable. Awe tack barack obama campaigning from a campaign rally. He's at a campaign rally while he's attacking him. I think what he did, the height of being despicable. The president was there, the first few days, went out to new jersey with the governor. The mayor thought it would strain resources to have the mayor come to new york. I think he did his job, and everyone knows when you are president of the united states, the presidency moves with the president. He can sit on the airplane, sit on his car, walk off an event stage and do whatever he needs to do to take care of whatever he needs to take care of. And janet napolitano, the homeland security director was actually in staten island today. So they are doing their job. And rudy was so far out of line. 

[00:51:40]


>> Michael, who is going to win this election? 
>> Barack obama, and he's going to win it because of the last several days. Let's put aside what's right or wrong or who is going to solve the problem of getting my power back, but he -- he was a remarkable moment in this campaign for barack obama to go to new jersey and to just suck christie's support. You could see it leave christie's body. 
>> Were you surprised by the sheer scale of enthusiasm that christie showed? 
>> Totally. It was two guys playing a very astute political game, and they both played it brilliantly and effectively, and I think -- think barack obama is the deal. 
>> You have written a biography of rupert murdoch. Didn't really like it very much. When you saw his tweet tonight about chris christie, bait of a warning, saying you better put up for mitt romney in the next few days, or if he loses, you will be the guy that gets the blame. If you're rupert murdoch, pretty ominous warnings to chris christie. 
>> Except I know how dispeptic rupert has been for quite some time about mitt romney. So I think rupert is positioning himself too. Rupert knows that mitt romney is going to lose, governor christie knows that mitt romney is going to lose and they are all positioning themselves. 
>> I'm sorry. 
>> The governor for four years from now. And rupert murdoch -- 
>> I think y see you champing at the bit. 
>> It's a bridge too far. This race is tied, we know it+s tied. And polls all over the place, and with some certainty. 
>> Who is going to break the tie. 

[00:53:42]


>> To say with certainty, the last few days, a president went to a crisis -- did his photo op, did what he had to do. You are giving him a lot of credit. It usually goes to the governor. Christie credit. 
>> There were experts here. Rupert murdoch knows what's going to happen, and I suspect governor christie knows pretty well what's going to happen. 
>> I don't understand why you are saying that. You don't know that. 
>> I know the two men. Read the tea leaves here. 
>> Sir, I'm reading the polls. A dead tie. Looking at the battleground states. I don't read tea leaves. I read politics. 
>> And a 30% chance -- 
>> either way here -- 
>> and barack obama has a 70% chance of winning. That's the way nate silver is calling the poll of all the polls. 
>> Piers, yeah, either way, let's talk about the politics. This is a tragedy. The governor doing his job as governor. But at the same time there, is nothing about a mitt romney presency that really helps chris christie, he's in a democratic leaning state in new jersey. Having -- running being friends with the current democratic president is helpful for him when he's running for re-election in 2013, and if he wants to run for president, he can't do that if mitt romney is president. 
>> You could all -- you could all be very, very -- 
>> in fact, he didn't need the praise. 
>> You could all just be -- you could all just be too cynical. May just be that chris christie, who I know well and admire very much, he genuinely feels very moved with the way the president helped him in his state. Take it for what it is. And good to see. 
>> Very fortunate that genuine feelings -- 
>> if you believe that -- 
>> okay. 
>> Very fortunate that your genuine feelings coincide with your political needs. 
>> Got to leave it. We'll be right back.

=======================================================

Today the death toll climbed to eople. Staten island neighborhoods swept away. Homeland security secretary janet napolitano toured the area, vowing to do everything she could to help. Plus, after insisting this sunday's new york city marathon would go oor bloomberg canceled the race. Many were outraged the city would take valuable efforts away from the recovery efforts for the marathon. Tonight, city hall and race officials have called it off. Meanwhile, look at this. Cars lined up for miles to get gas. Drivers in some cases waiting 20 hours as the supply dwindles, fighting with each other. There's one report that a guy pulled a gun at one gas station. Tonight the military is delivering fuel to the disaster zone, sending 24 million gallons of extra gas, a welcome sign. The obama administration is hiring trucks to bring the gas to staging areas. All this is unfolding four days before the general election. President obama and governor romney fighting it out for every last vote, especially in the key state of ohio. Today the latest cnn poll shows obama with a very slight edge there, but there's everything to play for. Today, the last jobs report before election day was released. Unemployment ticking up to 7.9%, but at the same time, 171,000 jobs were created. No surprise, both candidates reacted differently to the news. 
>> Today, our businesses have created nearly five and a half million new jobs. This morning we learned that companies hired more workers in octhan at any time in the last eight months. 
>> He said he was going to lower the unemployment rate down to 5.2% right now. Today, we learned that it's actually 7.9% and that's nine million jobs short of what he promised unemployment is higher today than when barack obama took office. 
>> Mitt romney earlier today. You're looking at live pictures now from westchester in ohio, where rudy giuliani, the former mayor of new york, has given a blistering speech attacking barack obama. In a few minutes, he will be on this show live and exclusive to tell me why he feels so strongly why the president should leave the office. Let's start with tse long lines for gas. Susan candiotti is at one gas station in new jersey. I have been following your travails for most of the day. You have been joining endl lines r gas in your car. Most of the time coming up against a blank. Where are you now and how does it all end? 

[00:02:24]


>> Reporter: Well, it all ended with us not getting any gas. It looks like a ghost town here. You can see they were open for a good nine hours. They had the supply but those lines justucked it all up. Too many customers and eventually they had to shut down tonight. So a lot of people were turned back and yes, piers, we went to two different places, spent the whole afternoon in two different lines, and came up dry. That's happening to a lot of people. Some are luckier than others but I got to tell you, it's been very impressive at least here in parts of new jersey where I was, to see how many people were helping each other, sometimes pushing cars to get to the fuel pump, and other people being as calm as they possibly could and saying look, we know that it's a bad situation, we know that they're trying to do the best they can, and we just have to go with the flow here and come back and try again tomorrow. But a lot of people were hitting up 15, 16, 20 stations and still not finding anything. 
>> Nate silva, the "new york times" pollster of pollsters, tweeted just now that his cab driver just told him he waited 20 hours for gas, which is a familiar kind of story I think for a lot of cab drivers now. What is the real problem? Lots of misconceptions I think that there is a lack of gas but actually, that's not the real problem, is it. It's more to do with no power means they can't pump the gas. 
>> Reporter: You're right. It's all those things rolled up into one. You've got a lot of different things at play here. First of all, some gas stations actually have the gas in their tanks below ground and would love to pump it but as you said, they don't have the power to do it. Other places can't get it in fast enough, even though the fuel supplies are starting to flore rapidly, because it's taking so long to fill up the tanks. They only have so many terminals to get it and that's why there is more hope tonight that with this announcement that obama, president obama has asked the defense department to free up some extra fuel, you mentioned it already, upwards of 24 million gallons to get more of it out here and transported more easily so that it can get out faster to the gas stations that do have power. 

[00:04:33]


>> Yeah. It's a hell of a struggle. Susan, thank you very much indeed. 
>>> Joining me now from columbus, ohio, is general wesley clark, an obama supporter, former to supreme allied commander. General, welcome back. 
>> Thank you, piers. 
>> All the action now is heading to ohio. Almost everyone who is anyone is down there, including your good self. The polls are very, very tight, showing very marginal lead for the president in most of the ones I've seen but with the margin of difference, you could almost say it's a tie. How are you seeing it down there on the ground? 
>> Well, there's a lot of emotion, there's just thousands of volunteers out here. There's a ground game. We feel very good about the ground game, by the way. Our volunteers are charged up. We've been working this for three and a half years. We knew it would come down to this. We were prepared for it. And we've fought to keep the polls open and make the ground game possible. 
>> I read yesterday, I think again it was nate silver who said that if romney was to lose ohio, he would have just a 3% chance of winning the election. Conversely, if barack obama lost ohio, he would only have an 8% chance of victory. That shows you just how incredibly important ohio may turn out to be. 
>> Well, it's an important -- it's critical. It's a very diverse state. But you know, barack obama's very firm stand in saving the american automobile industry has paid important dividends in ohio. This morning I was in youngstown and youngstown, we produced the chevy cruz. That's a gm product that is the direct result of the president's intervention to bail out automobile industry. 
>> As a former commander yourself, how do you think the president's done this week in terms of his role as commander in chief in what was really a national crisis? 
>> I think he's done extremely well in terms of his sympathy and empathy for the groups, his visit. I think he was smart not to go into new york city, where it's too congested, too many problems. I think he's also done well in terms of showing the power of the office by just the latest move of having the military assist in delivery of fuel. It also shows up the hollowness of governor romney, his flip-flopping. For example, on the issue of fema, he was suggesting months ago that maybe you don't need a federal emergency management agency, maybe you can just let each state fend for itself. Now, imagine where we would be if someone had actually taken that advice and killed fema. You would have new york, new jersey, each fighting with each other for scarce resources, for fuel, for power, for electric line repair, competinggainst each other to bring in assistance from other states instead of having someone to coordinate it and push it. 

[00:07:32]


>> We obviously saw the extraordinary scenes this week in many ways of governor christie in new jersey, sort of metaphorically putting his arm around the president, telling him what a great president he was. Last thing you would have expected say two weeks ago. What did you make of that? 
>> I thought it was a fair appraisal. Look, governor christie and new jersey h a real problem. Jersey shore devastated, plus all the electric outages and problems throughout a large part of the state. Of course governor christie needs help. This is what happens when governors need help, they come to washington. And americans expect washington to help. There is a role for the commander in chief, for the president of the united states, when disaster strikes at home. That's what americans expect of their leader. 
>> Were you pleased that the marathon was canceled? 
>> Yeah. I think it was a smart move. I do. It's been -- new yorkers have been really terrific about this. People downtown in manhattan have been four days without light or power. The streets are dark. It's like sarajevo during the siege in the balkans and the thought of more people coming in on top of the people that are already there and the people in and out of hotels, trying to find places to get showers and restaurants closed, basically all of manhattan's population was jammed north of 40th street, so it only makes sense given the uncertainties of this and the pressure on services in manhattan and the discomfiture of people there, don't do e marathon. 
>> General wesley clark, thank you very much indeed. 
>> Thank you.

>>> I believe some americans who might not have asked to have died may have died because we had incompetence in the white house. 
>> Very strong words tonight from -- about the benghazi attack from rudy giuliani, former new york mayor. He joins me now live from the romney rally in ohio. Welcome, rudy. 
>> How are you, piers? Nice to talk to yo 
>> you sounded pretty fired up tonight. Giving four barrels to the president. When you said that some american lives may have been lost because of incompetence, do you lay the blame squarely at the president's door? 
>> Last time I checked, piers, he's the commander in chief. I CAN'T IMAGINE A john McCain not sending the american military in at the earliest possible moment and not worrying about what libya or libyans might have thought. It was clear for months that libya was incapable of protecting our diplomats. The british pulled out. The red cross pulled out. Our diplomats were begging for more security and that consulate had been attacked twice, once with a hole 12 feet wide. What else did the president of the united states need? Did somebody have to bang him on the head? What did he need to go in there and make sure that our people were properly protected? This is what happens when you elect someone president of the united states who isn't ready to lead. Who wants the lead by following. 
>> Do you believe as some republicans do that the white house or certainly people close to the white house were aware of what was happening on that fateful night and decided not to do anything? 
>> They either were aware of it and decided not to do anything or they were asleep at the switch. Either one leads to incompetence. It didn't have to happen. It's a tragedy that could have been avoided with proper leadership which is now lacking in the white house, and mitt romney would bring the kind of leadership I believe that would stay on top of something like this. 

[00:14:25]


>> Let's turn if we may, mr. Mayor, to the situation in new york. Obviously we'll come to the storm in a moment. Rioff the top, your view ally of what's happened with the new york marathon, you i think were in agreement with the mayor as indeed I was for quite awhile that it should go ahead, it would be a morale boosting exercise, it would rally perhaps new yorkers a way that many events after 9/11 did. I came round before the decision today to thinking actually, i don't think it's a good idea and I did that because I saw what happened in staten island and the fury and the reaction and i changed my opinion. Did you change your opinion when you saw that overnight and this morning, or were you still of the view you know what, we should gn with it? 
>> I was in staten island this morning, actually. I started the day in staten island, because people there feel very abandoned, they feel very alone and we were trying to raise money to try to help people so it will directly go to people in staten island, breezy point, and the rockaways. I believe, you know, you could have gone either way on what the mayor decided. I don't think this is the time to be criticizing him. I think his instinct was the right instinct. Try to get things going, try to get people to lift their eyes up. Apparently people are still suffering so much that maybe it would have been impossible to do. I think it was a close call. You could have gone either way. I support the mayor in making those decisions. This is not a time to be criticizing mayor bloomberg, governor cuomo, governor christie. They're doing the very best that they can. I think they're doing a pretty darned good job. 
>> The president himself has been getting a lot of praise, not least from governor christie, which surprised people, the sheer level of the praise that he gave him for doing a very, very good job of leadership through this crisis. Do you go along with that? Do you think the president has been an outstanding leader? 
>> I don't know what the heck he was doing in nevada while people were still being discovered dead in new york. If I were the president of the united states, I sure wouldn't be flitting around the midwest and the west and my job would be making sure this thing was followed through to the very end. Maybe the first couple of days, he was keeping his eye on the ball but we got gas lines now that are a mile long. We got bodies still being discovered and we got a president who is playing campaigner in chief. This has been the story of barack obama from the very beginning. 

[00:16:45]


>> You think he's deserted really the area that's needed his attention? 
>> Don't you think he has? What the heck is he doing, flying all over the country and not keeping his attention on what's going on there, making sure people don't have to wait until november 11th or november 12th for the power to go back on. I sure as heck wouldn't have done that when I was mayor. I would have been all over them going crazy, let's do it a little faster, let's get more relief there, let's keep complete concentration on this. I understand he's still running for re-election but his first responsibility is as commander in chief and I think he's taken his eye off the ball at least for the last couple days. Maybe the first couple days he kept concentration on it. But I feel pretty darned offended seeing my president floating around campaigning while people are suffering the way people in new york, new jersey and elsewhere are suffering. 
>> It's a heavy charge to level at him, rudy. Wouldn't people just say straight away well, if mitt romney is campaigning over the last 48 hours, then surely the president who only has four days left until the general election, has to campaign, too, doesn't he? 
>> Sure he can but he could divide his time, couldn't he? I don't see how he's spending any time focused on this. Mitt romney has no responsibilities here. He's the challenger. He actually cut off his campaigning. At every one of these rallies he asks for contributions. Nobody can substitute for the president of the united states. Nobody. He's the commander in chief. It's his responsibility. What we have here is a commander in chief who is constantly putting the responsibility elsewhere. The economy, it's george bush's fault. Benghazi, hillary clinton's fault. Well, the buck stops with the president of the united states. He asked for the job. It's his responsibility to stay on top of it and he right now is not staying on top of this recovery. 
>> Rupert murdoch has tweeted tonight that he thinks that governor christie should now publicly declare very loudly and clearly, redeclare his support for mitt romney given all the praise he's lavished on the president and if he doesn't, then he would bear the blame, according to mr. Murdoch, for the next four years in barack obama gets in. What do you make of that? 

[00:18:59]


>> Oh, I don't go that far at all. I think at the point at which chris christie was saying that it was all quite legitimate. I think president obama at the beginning of this did keep his concentration on this and i think he was entitled to what chris christie said about him. What I'm saying is in the last couple of days, he has been 100% devoted to running for office. He has taken his eye off the ball and in some parts of new york, some parts of new jersey, things are getting worse. They're not getting better. The president's got to keep part of his concentration on this. And he hasn't been doing that. There is no substitute for the president not concentrating on. 
>> Should he now come to new york, the president? 
>> President hasn't been to new york. President hasn't been to breezy point. President hasn't been to staten island. People in staten island feel abandoned. He hasn't been there. 
>> He's obviously been to new jersey with the governor. Do you think he should now come directly to -- 
>> he has been to new jersey but he hasn't been to staten island. He hasn't been to breezy point. Hasn't been to rockaway. These people lost 80 homes, they lost lives and we're still finding bodies there. I think the president has to devote some of his time to concentrating on that. I'm not saying he should completely end his campaigning. At least maybe he could divide his time in half. I also think the president is evading answering questions about benghazi. It's a tragedy that we may go into this election and we don't know the answer, did president obama know about the prior attacks on that consulate. Did he know about the attack in june, when there was a hole drilled through the wall that was 12 feet wide. If that didn't wake him up to the fact that we needed more security in benghazi, then there's something seriously wrong. But this man has now evaded for six weeks answering that simple question. I don't know how you people in the press let him get away with it. 

[00:21:00]


>> Final question for you, rudy. You're in ohio. Many people think it's the absolutely crucial state that both sides have to win. Can mitt romney become president realistically if he doesn't win ohio? 
>> Either one can win without ohio. Simple fact is probably the man who wins is going to win ohio. Is it theoretically possible for either one of them to win without ohio, yeah. We can go through scenarios with wiscsin and colorado, pennsylvania slipping the other way. But believe me, this rally was ohio for a very very special reason and I think president obama was here either yesterday or today. This is a crucial state. 
>> Rudy -- 
>> whoever wins ohio wins the white house. 
>> While you've been talking, general wesley clark who was on just before you has been listening and actually wants to come back at you. So I'm going to let him have his say now. General. 
>> Thanks, piers. I did want to come back, because think the politicization of what's happened in benghazi deserves an answer. First of all, as the mayor well knows, after 9/11, democrats did not politicize this tragedy. Not the first day, the first hour, not the first week, not the first month. But with respect to benghazi, i think we're all going to have to wait until the full investigation's done and the information comes out. There has been a lot of fragmentary reporting. Now, I just want to say from my own experience inside the national security system, when i read the fragmentary reporting i get an entirely different picture than what mayor giuliani's portrayed here. I get is a very responsive chain of command that deployed military assets from europe down to sicily, they were ready to go. They deployed a drone overhead, diverted it from another location. They had all kinds of backup plans. The truth was the assault on the annex itself was over before anybody could have responded with anything other than maybe a ballistic missile, and the people were then evacuated to another annex where the battle was also over until four mortar rounds landed and killed our two people on the roof. Now -- 

[00:23:10]


[ speaking simultaneously ] 
>> none of that -- let me say, none of that, general, answers the question did the president of the united states know about the two prior attacks on that consulate, one that drilled a hole in the wall of 12 feet wide, and if he didn't know about it, why didn't he know about it and if he did know about it, why wasn't our ambassador given more security? The president was trying to paint a picture in libya of success. We weren't having success in libya and he fell asleep at the switch. For months, not just that day, but for months before there were warnings. The british pulled out. The red cross pulled out. There were numerous attacks and the president of the united states didn't increase security. There were even some reports that he reduced security. The president hasn't answered that qion. It's intolerable that we will have this election and the president will get away with not answering did he know about the prior attacks. Thank you very much. 
>> I don't think it is intolerable. I think it's essential that we do the investigation. There are classified assets in play. That position was in place for classified reasons that don't need to be discussed right here. 
>> General -- 
>> just the edge of it has come out right now on television and in the "wall street journal" today, you've just seen the edge of it. The real purpose of that, by the way, that's not where the ambassador lived, that was an annex that was designed to be there to serve a specific classified purpose to help us work against al qaeda in the region. 
>> General, we'll have to leave it there. The mayor has left the building, as they say. So we are going to leave it there. Thank you very much for coming back on and that was a lively exchange. Thank you. 
>> Thanks, piers. 
>>> We'll be back after this short break. With a panel to discuss the axing of the marathon here. 

[00:28:58]


>>> It's with incredibly heavy hearts today, tonight, that we share that the best way to help new york city at this time is to say that we will not be conducting the 2012 ing new york city marathon. 
>> It's official. Sunday's new york city marat is off, canceled in the wake of hurricane sandy. I have two of the runners with me who would have run. Michael weisman is a marathon veteran but his house was wiped out by sandy. Michael, welcome to you. Obviously you're looking forward to the race. You've run it four times before. But there's your wife and two children and house in manhattan beach, long island which was completely destroyed by sandy. The moment that happened on monday night, did you think and assume that the race would get canceled? 
>> I had to assume. First of all, I no longer have running shoes or running clothes to use. But the amount of devastation on our front porch which is about 10, 15 feet higher than the ground floor, and watching t water overlap our cars, transformers blowing and you're seeing people fleeing from porch orch trying to help each other out, you're saying there's no way this marathon will occur because we can't recover from this that fast. 
>> When you heard it was going ahead, what did you feel? 
>> I was actually a little bit shocked. I was angry, I wondered whether any of the people making the decision had actually been to these areas which were affected. My neighborhood was destroyed but so was breezy point. Staten island was destroyed as many other neighborhoods, seagate, and you look at the devastation, you see what you're going to do the next day and you hear the marathon is going to go on and you wonr how are volunteers going to be there handing out water and gatorade when my neighbor doesn't have anything to drink and I'm handing them bottles of water. 
>> I'll be honest, I changed my mind. When I first heard about it i thought you know what, go ahead with it. The show goes on, especially if it's a huge charity fund-raising event. I thought it would be good for new york to end this terrible week. But I changed my mind this morning after the staten island reports and the breezy point, all that. Let me come to you, maria. You're from paraguay. You flew in especially for this race. You feel it should have gone ahead. Why? 

[00:31:09]


>> Well, I think it's probably the right decision but it seems to be the wrong timing. We were waiting for the organizers to say if it was going to go on or not and when we received the go ahead on wednesday, we took a flight to come here as probably thousands of people from abroad. So it's probably the wrong timing to cancel it. 
>> You think they should have done it immediately. 
>> Of course. 
>> And no one would have flown in. 
>> Actually, everyone was -- i think everyone when we knew sandy was going to come and hit new york everyone knew it was a possibility the marathon would be canceled. It seems a little bit out of timing to cancel it at this point. 
>> Michael, what do you think? 
>> I have no horse in this race. No pun intended. I have no reason -- position at this table with people who would have been -- participated in the race except that I am a new yorker, and I look at this in an old-fashioned sense that there is a greater civic purpose. This is an event, it's an important event, and you rise to the occasion. You don't say oh, we have a problem, let's not do it, let's cancel, let's quit. 
>> But let me take you up on this. How can you start a marathon in staten island with huge generators to power the start, to all the people that would be there, there were generators for the media, for example, right where so many people, new yorkers, fellow new yorkers, are suffering so badly? That's what really jarred me. 
>> Let's look at this. There's a host of practicalities and I would assume, that goes to the point about timing, that the city, the organizers, the mayor, looked at this and said hey, we can deal with this, we can approach it, we can rise to the occasion. It will be different, it will be 
-- we'll patch it together which is a great way of looking at something. But suddenly it turned so they thought they could do it. They knew they could do it. And then it turned and it turned because, let me say just I think an air of defeat or an air of something else, this assumption that every time that all civic projects are suspect -- 

[00:33:26]


>> I don't think -- you and i are pretty active on twitter. I think social media played a huge role in this, because I saw the tide turn in public opinion from new yorkers on twitter yesterday. I saw it after the staten island news reports. 
>> I actually agree. 
>> People were saying you know something, these people, they're still pulling out their dead. How can you -- it's a fact that symbolically you would be starting this great happy event right where people are possibly still lying in basements drowned from this hurricane. 
>> Would churchill have canceled the marathon? 
>> I think if the people of london, if we had had one of these -- 
>> that's actually very important. The people of london. Many people at many times during many disasters have come together and said let's do something, something more, something higher, something symbolic. Instead, at this point in time, it was let's not -- this is suspect. They're doing something dirty. The marathon is -- it reflects badly on us. And I think it's just an interesting moment in time. 
>> The death toll is now 106. I've just been told. Many of which were in staten island. I think it's simply a case of it just jarred tothat people were just you know what, there are too many people found dead there. 
>> I didt have to jar. People could have said this is shoulder to the wheel. We are going to overcome this. We are going to do something larger. We are going to get on with it. 
>> Let's take a break. Thank you both for coming in. I'm sorry you won't be running. It's an interesting debate. I have gone both ways on it so i totally get the dilemma the mayor was in. I happ to think he came down the right way which is on the grounds of humanity for people who are suffering. 

[00:35:33]


>> If the show doesn't go on there can't be a happy ending. 
>> I disagree. Stick around. We'll talk white house and politics. The suffering on staten island. A growing rage over the slow response. I'm live with the congressman representing the borough, coming up. cream gone... But what about your wrinkles? Neutrogena???? rapid wrinkle repair visibly reduces fine lines and wrinkles in just one week. Why wait if you don't have to. Neutrogena????. ?????? ??????

Fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more. ??? 

[00:38:28]


>>> Desperation is growing in 
>>> desperation is growing in staten island as devastation is hard to imagine and tonight, people there are really struggling, coping with this catastrophe as best they can and finding help coming very slowly indeed. Congressman michael grimm represents many in the borough and joins me now. Congressman, thank you for joining me. 
>> Yes, thank you for having me. 
>> It seems that finally, the attention is centered on staten island where it should have been, many would argue, three, four days ago. Why has it been so belated, the help that you so desperately needed? 
>> Youw, I don't know exactly, but take the red cross for an example. They called three days ago and they started to drive, they have very big trucks that they bring uphat are packed with gear and they did drive from down south, it took them three days to drive through the night, they drove straight through but it takes two, three days for them to get those trucks here. That's one example. Right now at this point, we're not worried about why they didn't get here. We're just glad they're here and we're helping them to coordinate so they can be as effective as possible immediately and get these people that are suffering all the things that they need. 

[00:41:01]


>> Did you expect the red cross to do more? Many people up there have been angry about the recross taking so long. You don't appear to share that anger. 
>> No, there's no question that there was certainly disappointment. We didn't feel we had the resources that we needed as quickly as we needed but like i said, they are here now. They are on the ground. Fema is on the ground. Red cross is on the ground. Salvation army is here. Even secretary napolitano, homeland security, was here today and that was a big boost because she was able to come in, hold a meeting with all of us and coordinate some things between the agencies to make sure that staten island is not going to be forgotten now and i got to tell you, I feel a lot better tonight than I did yesterday. And I actually see it, I see fema going door to door, I see people now getting some of the relief. Don't get me wrong, we still have a lot to do. My office is working 24/7 around the clock. There's a lot to be done. But it is now started officially and things are being coordinated for the fi so I'm very grateful. And the outpouring, I got to tell you this, neighbors and people around the country sending their thoughts, their prayers and sending clothes and supplies. The people have been tremendous. The citizens have really stepped up. 
>> What is your reaction to mayor bloomberg canceling the marathon? 
>> Well, I think that the mayor did the right thing. I absolutely believe that he showed tremendous leadership in recognizing that it was wron allow that marathon to go forward while so many people are suffering and while we need so many resources like generators and a police presence. So I think he absolutely did the right thing. I know it was hard for him to do because now he's got it from both sides. Those here that are hurt so badly by this devastation were upset that he allowed it to go on, now the runners that are coming in from all over the country are upset that it's caed. So he really showed a lot of leadership to be in such a tight spot and I appreciate it. I know that we here on staten island appreciate it. 
>> Congressman, best of luck with the continued rescue and i guess revival mission you have there, trying to get things back to some kind of normality. We wish you all the very best with it. 

[00:43:08]


>> Thank you very much. Appreciate it. 
>>> On the phone now, the president of the american red CROSS, gail McGovern. Thank you very much for joining me. 
>> Thank you for having me o piers. 
>> There have been criticisms that the red cross was a bit slow off the mark with staten island. Do you accept that criticism and what reassurance can you give the people there now that they're getting your full attention? 
>> Well, first, let me say that my heart goes out to the people on staten island and theeople up and down the eastern seaboard. This has been a devastating, devastating disaster. We have about 14,000 people in shelters. We're serving 250,000 meals already. And it's a massive operation and I completely understand why the people in staten island are frustrated. We're frustrated, too. We had sent out emergency response vehicles before this cry for help came but i completely understand why folks are frustrated and we were able to break through yesterday. The roads are snarled. There are fuel issues. We're sending volunteers from all over the country, almost all 50 states. We've got two-thirds of our emergency response vehicles going from the west coast all the way across the country to the eastern seaboard and it took awhile for us to break through and get there. And I'm just grateful that my teams made it. They are handing out meals, they're driving up and dowe streets alerting people that we're here, and I spent the day in staten island with the borough president and i completely understand his frustration. 
>> If people are watching and wish to contribute to the red cross for this, what's the best way of doing that? 
>> They can visit our website, ress.Org, or they cacall 1-800-red cross and as always, the american public has just been so generous and we are grateful for every single donation. 
>> You guys do a terrific job. I'm a huge admirer of the red cross. I can only imagine this being utter chaos all over the area for the last four days. Please continue to do the excellent work that you do. I'm just very glad the staten island people are getting the help so obviously so urgently need. Thank you very much. 

[00:45:30]


>>> Coming next, my political stars take on the election and the crucial fight for ohio. Big words from rudy giuliani. ?????? ??????

>>> A year of campaigning down to four crucial days. We have republican strategist. And a democratic stat gist. Very critical, surisingly critical of the president, saying that he basically disappeared when he should have been staying othe east coast, and masterminding a better recovery what did you make of that? 
>> Rudy giuliani is a guy to be talking about this honestly after you look at what he did after 9/11. Tremendous. The president went in, had great photo-ops. Blowing out of town and we see the devastation, it doesn't look good for the president. Probably should be spending a little more time and I think for rudy giuliani to say that is pretty significant. Might be good advice for the president. 

[00:50:17]


>> To be fair, mayor bloomberg made it clear he didn't want it him to come to new york. Let me ask you, jamaal simmons. Would it be prudent to say i will come to staten island and stand with the people suffering? 
>> No. What rudy giuliani did is despicable. Awe tack barack obama campaigning from a campaign rally. He's at a campaign rally while he's attacking him. I think what he did, the height of being despicable. The president was there, the first few days, went out to new jersey with the governor. The mayor thought it would strain resources to have the mayor come to new york. I think he did his job, and everyone knows when you are president of the united states, the presidency moves with the president. He can sit on the airplane, sit on his car, walk off an event stage and do whatever he needs to do to take care of whatever he needs to take care of. And janet napolitano, the homeland security director was actually in staten island today. So they are doing their job. And rudy was so far out of line. 
>> Michael, who is going to win this election? 
>> Barack obama, and he's going to win it because of the last several days. Let's put aside what's right or wrong or who is going to solve the problem of getting my power back, but he -- he was a remarkable moment in this campaign for barack obama to go to new jersey and to just suck christie's support. You could see it leave christie's body. 
>> Were you surprised by the sheer scale of enthusiasm that christie showed? 
>> Totally. It was two guys playing a very astute political game, and they both played it brilliantly and effectively, and I think -- i think barack obama is the deal. 

[00:52:25]


>> You have written a biography of rupert murdoch. Didn't really like it very much. When you saw his tweet tonight about chris christie, bait of a warning, saying you better put up for mitt romney in the next few days, or if he loses, you will be the guy that gets the blame. If you're rupert murdoch, pretty ominous warnings to chris christie. 
>> Except I know how dispeptic rupert has been for quite some time about mitt romney. So I think rupert is positioning himself too. Rupert knows that mitt romney is going to lose, governor christie knows that mitt romney is going to lose and they are all positioning themselves. 
>> I'm sorry. 
>> The governor for four years from now. And rupert murdoch -- 
>> I think you see you champing at the bit. 
>> It's a bridge too far. This race is tied, we know it's tied. And polls all over the place, and with some certainty. 
>> Who is going to break the tie. 
>> To say with certainty, the last few days, a president went to a crisis -- did his photo op, did what he had to do. You are giving him a lot of credit. It usually goes to the governor. Christie credit. 
>> There were experts here. Rupert murdoch knows what's going to happen, and I suspect governor christie knows pretty well what's going to happen. 
>> I don't understand why you are saying that. You don't know that. 
>> I know the two men. Read the tea leaves here. 
>> Sir, I'm reading the polls. A dead tie. Looking at the battleground states. I don't read tea leaves. I read politics. 
>> And a 30% chance -- 
>> either way here -- >>nd barack obama has a 70% chance of winning. That's the way nate silver is calling the poll of all the polls. 

[00:54:27]


>> Piers, yeah, either way, let's talk about the politics. This is a tragedy. The governor doing his job as governor. But at the samme there, is nothing about a mitt romney presidency that really helps chris christie, he's in a democratic leaning state in new jersey. Having -- running being friends with the current democratic president is helpful for him when he's running for re-election in 2013, and if he wants to run for president, he can't do that if mitt romney is president. 
>> You could all -- you could all be very, very -- 
>> in fact, he didn't need the praise. 
>> You could all just be -- you could all just be too cynical. May just be that chris christie, who I know well and admire very much, he genuinely feels very moved with the way the president helped him in his state. Take it for what it is. And good to see. 
>> Very fortunate that genuine feelings -- 
>> if you believe that -- 
>> okay. 
>> Very fortunate that your genuine feelings coincide with your political needs. 
>> Got to leave it. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.????@R??o hazard today? Think again. The spot you missed could be a killer. That spot on your skin could be skin cancer.

>> In this the last show before the election. I want to make it special. We may have a new president by tuesday? 
>> We won't. 
>> Greg: That is true. Go away. Such a jerk. Let's welcome our guests. Look at her. She is so cute she is mistaken for a beanie baby. Check out the website, the and jill. And zamboni I would ride him before and after a hockey game. A cultural news editor. And in seattle he is considered a coffee grinder. And he is so sharp they call him bernie, in the last minute filling in. And the executive producer imus in the morning program producer. 
>> And he missed his train, bernie says he I am going sit in? 
>> I was in the joint down the street and I was having a couple of pops. 
>> Greg: You are so wasted right now? 

[00:02:00]


>> Happy. I can say anything. 
>> Greg: How I pops doing anyway? 
>> Doing all right. 
>> Marathon won't go on. An after insisting the marathon would take place this sunday, mayor announced hours ago that the 335 mile race woulde scrapped. We went for a runner for comment but he would bore us to death. 
>> They are amazing people. 
>> Greg: Shut up. Argued it was wrong many people had no power and struggling on to find food and water in the wake of sandy. The city was united in anger after they reported that two huge generators were running day and night to power a media tebt for the race and people that didn't have power were forced to leave hotel rooms to make room for incoming marathoners probably from other countries. Indeed having a marathon was as dumb as this is the light bulb. 
>>> Wow. 
>> Greg: I like that. All you ru thinking what about the hourgs and weeks that that guy did to do that dog do it. To put that dog throu it. I'm voting libertarian. You were out raged the race was cancelled and you felt bad for the runners? 
>> I did. I think it should go on. We should have the st. Patrick's parade on sunday. What the hell. Why not. This guy didn't even visit staten islan, michael bloomberg he is rich punk. I'm sorry he isallous and i think we should storm gracie mansion and get his stick on the head and run through the streets. 

[00:04:22]


>> Greg: I have to disagree i don't think you were sorry about it. 
>> He wanted to have it manhattan for the 9/11 terrorists in manhattan. He has a pattern of this sort of insensitivity. It's not the first time. 
>> Greg: He doesn't like regular people and he feels he knows better and very paternal like banning sodas. How is a big gulp more self-indulgent are than running 26 miles. All you are doing I eating fiber so you can run longer. 
>> Carbs. 
>> Greg: This then you complain and everybody has to put up with your 26 mil. How important is. That is worse than big gulp. Have you ever seen new yorkers so united in their opinion about the hatred for bill schultz? 
>> You mean the bloomberg one? 
>> Greg: I think the marathon eclipsed schultz. He can relax for a bit. 
>> I was downtown when the lights were out and people were still talking about schultz. Maybe the guy from hogan's heroes but john banner. 
>> Greg: I know nothing. 
>> Yeah, it's aazing it's heartening in some sense during the salt business and the soda business, the people that i talked to that were in the circlat has I know about, they are who are elbow people. They were thinking this is great idea. Bloomberg is saving us from smoking. This is actually about times that new yorkers, mike bloomberg like he deserves it. 
> This was mistake on his part. Big events or like oscars or like your y are rehab when problems arise? 

[00:06:26]


>> Not a bad idea. At least make the deision before today. I'm their shur there were hundreds that arrived in new york today and turned on their phones. The race I came over here just got cancelled. 
>> Greg: There was a huge group of runners from some country but they were blocking the crosswalks. You know what this really is it's a war between the endomorph is won. Ectomorphs are the skinny people. 
>> We both 17 magazine. Body types. 
>> They are taking over. We have won a victory. Chunky freaks like me. You ran a marathon? 
>> So this is where the venom is coming from? Won't turn the tables. You are a weight lifter. What does that entail. 
>> Not anymore. 
>> I did one marathon about ten years ago let's use that. All you do is work out all day and pose in front of a mirror. Marathoning every day of the week, the only people that wear tighter clothing is people that weight lift. 
>> When I was weights I do it in front of older men. There are know audiences, however when I am squatting over a mirror there are seven or eight men paying hundred to $200 to watch. 
>> No, that is called family. 
>> I watch it. I get on my treadmill and i pretend I'm running with them. Once a year. 
>> I I'm going back to the bar guys. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> what the hell. 

[00:08:27]


>> Bloomberg wanted to have this marathon, endorsement of president obama because who would have won the race, a kenyan. 
>> And I think the real victor is chris christie. My cozying up to president obama who recognized him, bruce springsteen. You know how bad he wanted to say, you are great mayor or governor -- whatever he is, city councilman -- finally obama by being with christie has made springsteen recognize him. 
>> You are buying into this plot that obama and christie conspired to sort of derail the romney campaign. This was sandy, the october surprise, manufactured by christie and obama to screw romney. 
>> Iranian hostage crisis with bruce springsteen. 
>> All I'm saying. Obama is next to christie it's like a biracial ten. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> no, I'm joking. 
>> The critz at this hing. 
>> Greg: Christie doesn't have an ideological bone in his body. He does what he wants is there he was helping his people out. That is what he was doing. People on the light he was conspiring with obama, that is about helpful for homicidal that is like mahmoud ahmadinejad endorsing him. 
>> And they can't blame sanity did I on the anti-islam video -- I was talking to jill but let's talk about the elections. Election day is just a year away and pundits. Dick morris says romney will win in a landslide. New york times poll and they are betting on bam, short for barack. What about the electoral popular vote split? It could happen. That is what my pectoral captain hard shell and he is never wrong except for vietnam. If someone could make sense of it all someone like joe biden. 

[00:11:01]


>> There is never been a day in the last four years I've been proud to be his vice president. Not one single day. Not one single day. 
>> Greg: He is national treasure and mitt romney is making a final pushn swing states. And they released a tv ad that will get heavy play in ohio. Day can a look. 
>> I'm mitt romney and aapprove this message. 
>> Greg: As an entertainment reporter all you care about is bradley cooper's dating habits. Are you aware of an election going on. I want your bre diction. Who do you think who is going to win next year? 
>> I'm counting down the 355 days. I can't answer your question. I am a world-renowned journalist and I strongly believe journalists should not share who they are voting for. I don't even tell my husband. My parents keep calling me. Make sure you vote. I'm going to vote for the other guy. They want me at the polls. They keep reiterating it's 355 days from now. 
>> Greg: I can figure out by voegt who you are voting by asking you. Are you voting for romney? 
>> Maybe you should give me water to drink. 
>> Greg: Bill put something in there. You won't remember anything. Is it possible that obama and romney could both win and split running the country on alternating days? 

[00:13:03]


>> It's happened in a number of times. IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE 40s. Fdr governed with grandfather's friend. Nobody knows that. Rick, an unknown rascal. No. It's like a beatles record not a herman hermit's record. Obama is going to win. I think piling nate silver and all these people. It seems like he is right. 
>> Greg: Do you think it's close or not even close? 
>> I think it's close but not as close as lot of pundits are letting on. Dick morris says it's going to be landslide for homicidal. I don't know what planet dick morris is living on. I just choose the opposite. I know he is friend of yours. 
>> Greg: We go wai back, we lived in a camper for six years, it didn't work out. Bernie, do you agree? 
>> Now that governor christie has stuck his share in mitt romney it's going to be an obama landslide. I just wonder this nate silver came out of no one. Not only is dork but degenerate gambler and probably not. I'm sure he does. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> thank you for helping us. 
>> That was better. 
>> According to you, he is. 
>> Taught me how to say things. 
>> Does he x, not that he doesn't. 
>> And I've been doing this show for five years. 

[00:15:06]


>> Great version of the journalist question. 
>> I think you use a period after that. 
>> All right. 
>> Before I get to you bill, i want to bring in political correspondent mike, I think we have him here he usually covers this sort of thing. Is he there. 
>> With just a few weeks before the election the race is really close. Most polls show them splitting the national vote the battleground states favor obama slightly. Here isbama and hire is romney. Don't forget our old pal gary. And estimated 263 electoral votes 210 for romney. You know what this reminds me and this is like new hampshire. The fact that the election if romney can win states like ohio and colorado it could really draw them closer. Think we'll see this race get closer and closer and closer and closer, so close you can -- whoa 
>> we're cutting that. To about 30 seconds. Bill, you cut your teeth on the dukakis campaign. 
>> First of all I have to correct on that. I cut the teeth by saying the word dukakis and it was painful. You go with dick morris who wrote the column saying it's going to be a landslide. He likes being on tv and you go to nate silver, who is usually right. And he is usually right. 
>> Let me say something of nate silver. Idea that he wants to make friends, he can actually swing any votes towards obama is ludicrous. In the business that you are in, it's not a good thing. Why would he cook the books if he knows he is wrong. He is going to look like a slub. 

[00:17:32]


>> I was going to say that. 
>> He didn't steal your thunder. He made no sense at all. He is a flawed. Dick morris is the world's greatest genius. I think he is adorable. We have great conversations. 
>> Jill dobson and why she became a spokeswoman. But first, can you not do this story? Yes, because we're doing the other story. So instead we'll do the other one. 
[ Laughter ] ???????????? ???????????? 

[00:21:34]


>> will the country burn if there is no second term? All right. Let start over here. Ooflg radio host that if romney defeats obama that there will be mobs and bloodshed. He took a cue following hurricane sandy and claimed it was just a preview if obama loses the election. Have a look at the rest of the rant. 
>> People out there saying governor romney is going to take all this away from us. Governor romney is going to take away our lollipops. Barack obama the election has been stolen from us. 
>> Good to see john gibson and besides looting and bloodsh. What else can we expect? 
>> Told you. Gay marriage. There is a connection. Gay marriage and kittens going into trashcans. Predictions coming from both sides mostly from the left. I remember from twitter, if obama wins, it's baloney. 
>> I believe it's a bunch of crap. I don't believe the country is as polarized as it once was. I just don't think it exists anymore. We had a black president. THIS IS NOT THE 1960s OR THE 50s. And giving guys like this attention is giving attention of the new black panther party that consists of eight people. It amplifies something that really doesn't exist. That is the case with this guy. Idiot who burns the quran and causes problems but they were just a minuscule number of people. 

[00:23:38]


>> Greg: You have to fill the bucket with things that not matter. Are we thisarized or just the polish people? 
>> I don't think so, but I do think, you could create something here. You could create a self-fulfilling prophesy. I'm starting to get angry. I am going to move the green room. 
>> I want you punch bill in the face. 
>> I have a new manager. Maybe at the end of the show. 
>> Greg: You were saying the green room you agree with everything that the evangelicals said. 
>> I edit his column. I don't want to take credit. Speaking punching people in the face I would love to punch this guy in the face. There is reason for that. This is ridiculous. A lot of people are pumping this stuff. Been on drudge and go to info wars which is not a real website but a website run by a lunatic but he yells a lot. Chris matthews. What is the evidence of this? 
>> Greg: It's like calculating twitter tweets that say they are going to kill you. There are 350 million people in new york alone, right? And five people that want to kill you. It's all garbage. 
>> I put as much stock that people are going to leave if a candidate doesn't win like canada. 
>> Greg: One thing they see united on that all the stupid violence falls on your head. The fact is that everybody hates you means I don't need a question. Hold on a second. 
>> Hi, mom. 
>> Yes, she hates you. 

[00:25:39]


>> The phone was not on. Your phone is not on. I know that. 
>> That was the fake phone call. 
>> This guy, is back-up is that he said, look at the looting in new york. That is just a preview. Considering what we've gone through the looting has been pretty minimal but he would never known that because he never been to the city. I would like to invite him and meet him on corner of 125th and malcolm x boulevard and have a lovely peaceful time. Join me, won't you? 
>> There are people on the left and on the right that are talking about like an ending after this election, this is what happens. Child doesn't get his first birthday. People get very emotional and life goes on. 
>> Exactly. There will be hard feelings, but there won't be kind of like l.A. Riot type violence. 
>> If only there was a guy, the kind of outrage that erupts when you get upset somebody named greg gutfeld. 
>> What does ignite do? 
>> He runs a talk show. 
>> You wouldn't be german, would you? 
>> No, I'm dutch. I've made a few in my time. I have a video of your animal doing something strange. Go to foxnews.Com/"redeye". And vevy is coming up. 
>> We're sponsored by elvis. American cultural icon often to be considered the most influential musician of the 20th CENTURY.@@ @ pp P 

[00:31:19]


>> Greg: We're back, if we got anything wrong so far, let's go to andy levy. 
>> Good news. 
>> Greg: Wt are you talking about. 
>> A buff. 
>> I don't know. He is canadian. 
>> He is moving. 
>> Bernie you referred to mayor bloomberg as a rich know it all punk. I want people to know I am a huge fan of mayor bloomberg's but I have to agree you may have blown this one. 
>> He this had to cancel it. He didn't feel bad for the dead bodies recovered. He is humiliated because he had to cancel his marathon. He is park avenue clown, that has no feelings for the average person that suffering out. He hasn't been to the staten island or breezy point. So a rich punk. 
>> I don't think I understand how strongly you feel about it. Other than all of that he has done a great job. I'm kidding. He is jerk. 
>> Thank you. 
>> You noted that during the soda business you thought those were good ideas but bloomberg is awful but remember the winter storm back in 2010 when there were no plows on the street and he was in bermuda. 
>> That means basically they are going to think he is great again? 
>> Everyone was saying at that time, it was christmas for me. This the end of his political career. 
>> And he started banning things. 
>> They said, okay, thank you, sir. 
>> Do you think the way he does things he is right. He is extremely paternalistic. You don't know how to eat or smoke or drink or take care of yourself. I guess people are okay with that. 

[00:33:28]


>> People seem to like it. 
>> These are the same people that lament the so-called new york. It used to be great but I love you can't get fries after 3:00 a.M. 
>> I want more people to start pointing on the saturday before the storm hit, it's not going to be a big deal. 
>> Is that true? 
>> People aren't pointing that out enough. 
>> They claim it's a bad viacra commercial. Construction sites were inspected and sure enough they went. 
>> It happens to all the cranes. 
>> When I go by the crane I hear a great george thorogood songs. 
>> I don't care about that stuff. Say, pooh pooh the idea that obama caused the storm with his weather machine. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> wake up man. 
>> I told you I was having a couple of beers. 
>> You were at pops. 
>> And beat option elderly men. 
>> Greg youd anti-muslim clerics bme on the video. I assume you mean muslim clerics. 
>> Where did they learn that point. 
>> Way to ruin my narrative. Kenya. 
>> And jill you said journal it'sists shouldn't share who they are voting for. Journalists shouldn't share who they are voting for? 

[00:35:29]


>> It's same sad state of affairs. 
>> It's two words, gary johnson. 
>> You said obama is going to win. I got it 275-263 obama. 
>> You do? That is exactly what I have it but I didn't say it as zbloud I'm 50-48 at obama vote. I'm looking at split. 
>> Have you placed a wager on this? 
>> No, I just go to beting. 
>> Nate silver, he was upgraded by the public editor by placing a $2,000 bet I guess he would donate to staten island to make it all okay. 
>> Greg: And officially heard nate silver more than my entire life. 
>> Bernie you asked who is nate silver. It's been more all of a sudden. He picked 49 out of 50 states. That is what made him famous. 
>> In fairness to andy I think dick morris did the same thing. 
>> I want to point out nate silver is usually right. But I want to point out, I know, I want to point out absolutely nobody will, in 2008 I got the electoral vote and republicans would gain in the house. 
>> But you are a nobody. 
>> Are you on record. 
>> I did both on the show. They called me crazy. 
>> Because it's "redeye", nobody cares. 
>> People call me crazy but not for that. 
>> And that was crazy. I predicted that. 
>> Was it. 
>> No, it wasn't. 
>> Everyone is wearing hamster suits. Brian fischer post election riots. Aren't you supposed to predict riots if your guy loses? You are not encouraging people to vote for your guy if he wins there is g to be riots. 

[00:37:43]


>> Very good point. 
>> I predict riots every time a detroit team wins there. 
>> I don't know what that means. 
>> This island earth reference. Come on people. 
>> Why do we have to be as nerdy as you? 
>> You are the one. 
>> Famous movie. 
>> You are masturbating the hummels. 
>> Moving it in. 
>> Your name on the show. Michael, and what about alex jones? 
>> I couldn't remember his name. I covered the website to see what the chem trails. 
>> And he wanted you to punch bill in the face and you didn't. So I wanted to give you another chance. 
>> Oh, yeah. 
>> I think my nose is a little crooked. 
>> I connected. 
>> Can we edit that? 
>> Greg: It's some kind of weird thing that didn't work out. 
>> You know why it was weird because bill enjoyed it. 
>> It wasn't violent or erotic. 
>> He maded a deadbolt to make it work. 
>> I have something else. 
>> Famous removal. They call this kids don't do it museum. 
>> Neil cavuto it's not like he ever cared. Which colleges are offering a course of civility. They used for something horrible. 

[00:42:52]


>> Greg: Not bei cute. Led to dispute amount chinese man, reportedly sued his wife for giving birth to an ugly baby neither he nor his wife were unattractive. They are laughing how i pronounced his name. He is the woman but they did resemble mommy before she spent hundred thousand dollars on plastic. They were married under false pretenses and awarded him $120,000. 
>> Anyway, the baby being fed. 
>> Greg: By the way that was the new movie starring linda hunt. You don't know who linda hunt. She was the beauty and truly the beast. Remember living dangerously? 
>> And linda hamilton. 
>> Linda hunt. Let's focus on linda hamilton. 
>> You are siously not an entertainment reporter. 
>> This is deceptive. You call it a bait and switch. I would call it a nate and switch. I said it so you couldn't say that. 
>> Thank you for taking my line. I had that in my notes. I e-mailed that five hours ago. I do find thtory fascinating. I would like my children to resemble me. That was my idea. Don't get plastic surgery because if your child grows up a weirdture of yours, well mom is awesome. 

[00:45:11]


>> Why not when your baby is born immediately have plastic surgery on the baby? Why do you have to give up stuff. You brought the kid on the planet. 
>> You are totally right. 
>> I wanted to themll to look like robert conrad. 
>> Or behind did a hunt. 
>> And wild, wil west. 
>> Robert cobmad. 
>> And made by ross martin and the little midget that later killed himself. 
>> Do you remember michael dunne played the evil midget in wild, eyewitness wild west. I believe it was kenneth brana and guy you are talking about. He was delight. 
>> Michael dunne, played the midget. Is this story real or fake. 
>> It's like the sign in china 'if this is true. It is clearly not. There is no more after this. But if it were true. 
>> I would say for you china needs tort reform in the worst way. 
>> The guy is yang fang and he got the hunk of chi. 
>> He can call on me. 
>> Bill, the weird g about bill. You had plastic surgery which means your spouse one day would be pleasantly surprised by your better attractive children. 

[00:47:11]


>> Sadly the ugly as sin. I should have better taste in women. I love the sub text. This ruling could be bad for chinese women. I don't think so. When you got three chinese women to every 3,000 chinese men. Nothing is going to be bad for them. If she stayed as litigate for them. It would be in a land run by men. 
>> I don't know what means. Maybe I don't want to find out. 
>> We're going to have another story we're going to do. Stick around. We'll be back. ?????? ?????? you can help others along the way. ?????? ?????? A portion of every bottle that they sell goes to fight ?????? ?????? breast cancer and I think that's swell. ?????? ??????

[00:51:49]


>> colleges and universities parental bad behavior. Associated press report that schools across the country are responding by promoting more civility as a public health epidemic on par with meese will out briajs. At university of tennessee they have a civility committee for freshman orientation the time that you usually filling out you are going to sleep with. And mike I go to you first. Why teach young adults how to act just kick them out of school. 
>> This is another fake story but it's not your fault. You went to the fake website. This is fake because there are fake people that make up epidemics like shingles and stuff but it's like people creating a problem because they have a solution for one. There is no problem for incivility. Of course they are. They are in college. 
>> They are incivil and incompetent and incurable. 
>> Is this really about the speech they are creating this issue so they c tel people what to think and not to think? 
>> It's told pcbs, how is that. It starts with mom when you are kid. Kids are half animals, remember lord of t flies. But by the time they get to college, wasting time to teach kids civility is waste of time. 
>> It's lord of rings, not lord of flies. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> it is lord of flies. Lord of the rings is movie, lord of the flies is the novel. >>. 

[00:53:58]


>> Linda hunt. 
>> Forcing civility they are punishing civility makes it pointless. Civility is something you should do on your own. 
>> Hey, I wouldn't say it is punishment. Those of us that know how to be civil we could get an easy "a". When I took broadcasting speaker and I had to speak like someone from middle america, it was easy everybody is like it's an "a". 
[ Laughter ] it really happens. I love you. But I appreciate it. This poor girl. It was like an hour long. 
>> What was wrong with her? 
>> It was like da. 
>> And I have a question for you. 
>> Let's talk more abou the class.

>> You have to be more circumspect. You have to be more careful with your words. You know, you just the have to be very, very careful. And it'unate that even, you know, people I think only think of mitt maybe through his business lens. And for me, you know, that is just 1% of who he is. 
>> And who is he really? First and foremost, a romney. The romney name has been in the public eye for the last half century. A family of great wealth and business achievement, political success as well as failures. Mitt was the last and fourth child for george and lenore romney. Born march 12, 1947, some recall him as the favorite. George wrote to the family in september 1956. Mitt is growing like a weed, as full of ideas and energy as ever. tom McCaffrey grew up with romney. 
>> Mitt as a child was extremely energetic. The kind of kid that could never sit down. His mind was going 100 miles an hour. 
>> George was much the same way. You know, he's just got that energy. 
>> Phillip maxwell lived down the street from the romneys in a wealthy detroit suburb. 
>> George would go out on the golf course. He had fluorescent golf balls, and he would hit the ball and he would run after the ball jogging, hit he ball again. And that was his exercise. 
>> Young mitt not only had his father's energy -- 

[00:04:03]


>> there seems to be a special bond between george and mitt. 
>> -- Michael kranish and scott helman co-wrote the book "the real romney." 
>> Mitt absolutely idolized his father in a way you can see drawn out in the way he's run his life. Following the same footsteps of the career. 
>> George romney was a ceo who saved american motors by betting on smaller cars. It gave his son a first look at business. 
>> George was a turnaround artist at american motors, taking a company that had lost focus for whatever reason and fixing it. 
>> And once george made his mark in the auto world, he switched gears to politics. He was the republican governor of michigan for three terms. And young mitt was a fixture on the campaign trail, schooled early in issues, strategies and the possibility of losing. 
>> And dad's pollster said, george, you can't possibly win. I was a kid in high school, and I thought, oh, no, you know, we're going to lose, I'm going to be embarrassed at school, these little things that a kid thinks. And my dad said -- it was clear, he said, I'm not in this because I worry about winning o losing. I'm here to make a difference. He he's not a man defined by elections. He's been defined as a man of character throughout his life. 
>> Then there was mitt's mother lenore. 
>> My mom had a softer side. She used to read to me when i was a boy and gave me a love of culture and literature. 
>> Once a screen actress, lenore met george in 1924. Their courtship became an often told part of the family story. 
>> He left what he was doing and traveled west to hollywood to convince her to marry him as opposed to going into the movie business. He knew what he wanted and was not going to stop until he got it. 
>> Mitt's courtship of ann was in its own way no less intense. They were just teenagers at neighboring elite private schools in detroit. It was mitt's senior year when he spotted the 16-year-old ann davies at a dance. 

[00:06:11]


>> I did fall madly in love with him very quickly. Actually. But I aloof, very cool. 
>> She was very cool she always had other plans. She went on a date with someone else while I was pursuing her. Made me just crazy. 
>> He was so much fun. Captivating. It was just fun, fun, fun to be with him. 
>> There are lots of stories of good-natured practical jokes. 
>> At kron brook, he was kind of swimming around, trying to find his place. One of the consequences was he would get involved in these pranks, which were really attention getting devices. 
>> But maxwell remembers one incident he says crossed the line. A younger classmate returned from break with long bleach-blond hair, and a group of guys, including romney, confronted him. 
>> He was taken down, and mitt had scissors, and he cut his hair. It was an ugly scene, and it was a long time ago. But I'll never forget it because of the look on this boy's face. He was absolutely terrified when they took him down. 
>> Others, as you know, who went to cranbrook with you remember some different stories that they say were over the top and maybe even cruel to some students. Do you remember it that way? 
>> No, I don't. And I know that comes up during the campaign season, but it's the first time I've heard that. I'm sure -- 
>> the hair cutting story. 
>> I think that's the only story I've heard of that nature. But, you know, the pranks that we pulled were designed to be funny and to have fun, and I can imagine that now and then things that I did in high school are not things that I would want to become part of a presidential campaign. 
>> That was decades ago. One incident when romney was a teenager without focus and direction. Something he would find later in a very surprising place.

>>> It was fall 1965. Stanford university. The counterculture movement was growing. A different world for freshman mitt romney, straight from a michigan boarding school and his conservative roots. 
>> He has this exposure I think to all these new ideas, all these new people, these new experiences. 
>> But all romney could think about at first was ann back in michigan. Mark marcus was romney's roommate. 
>> A lot of guys come to college and have high school girlfriends, but you could tell for mitt it was different. He could not stop talking about ann. 
>> We were so much in love. I went off to college, and I got a job there to earn a little money so I could pay for an airplane ticket to go home and see her. And I didn't tell my parents. 
>> This was at stanford. 
>> While I was at stanford. We didn't tell my parents about this. 
>> So you snuck home? 
>> I flew home, snuck home, would take her on a date. 
>> But as the year wore on, the politics on campus became inescapable. 
>> He's very affected by this world in which he sees an antiestablishment strain growing. 
>> As the protest at stanford grew, romney stood with the esent and for the war. 
>> His father at that time was strongly for the vietnam war and he was finding his political footing. Really the first time we see mitt romney emerge as his own man in a political sense is when he does lead this protest against the antiwar protesters on the campus of stanford. He's standg up with a sign saying "speak out, don't sit in." 
>> But romney never went to vietnam hi exempt as a student and with a high draft lottery number. 
>> He's protesting the antiwar protesters, but he does not volunteer to go serve in vietnam. He would have been eligible to serve, certainly. 
>> At the end of his freshman year, romney would be called to serve, not his country but his faith. As a mormon missionary in france. It was a tradition he considered breaking. 

[00:13:38]


>> He was concerned, according to his friends, that he might lose ann, and so he talked to ann about this. And she told him, you know, if you don't go, you'll always regret it, and I'll be here. 
>> And when he left, I had a very brave face, went to the airport with his entire family. We all said good-bye. I was driven home with his family, and then I walked into my home, opened the door, my I fell flat on the ground and just dissolved in tears. And she could not console me. 
>> For 2 1/2 years in the TURBULENT '60s, ROMNEY WAS Living abroad, working every day to convert the skeptical french to his mormon faith. So this is this kind of neighborhood that you used to knock on doors in, all day. 
>> This -- yes, 45 years ago. This is fairly typical. 
>> Mike bush took us back to the streets of bordeaux where he and romney spent 60 hours a week spreading their faith in french. 
>> Did you have a specific message? 
>> Well, we would talk to them about our believes. We would talk about jesus christ. We would talk to them about the book of mormon. 
>> You're out talking to people day in and day out about your faith and your religion will and differences between it and other faiths. 
>> Getting doors slammed in your face. 
>> Most of the time. This was a time when a lot of people were not happy about america in france. So it was a time of great deal and rejection. 
>> But romney kept at it. In a rare conversation about his faith, he reveals how the constant rejection led to some surprising soul searching. 
>> But you say, okay, wait a second. What's important here? What do I believe? What's truth? Is there a god? Is jesus christ the son of god? These are questions that are no longer academic, they're critical because you're talking about that day in and day out. 
>> As mitt questioned everything he was raised to believe in, his father tried to get his son back on track. 

[00:15:43]


>> Your father sent you this letter when you were in france. And he quoted robert lewis stevenson to you in trying to sort of get you not to feel discouraged. He said, despair not but if you despair, work on in your despair. And then he wrote, so persist. 
>> My dad, what a guy. What a guy. I mean, he's always been there for me. Look, I remember my dad's advice throughout my life. Every time I had challenges of one kind or another, he was there with counsel. An extraordinary man. 
>> Who happened to be running for president while mitt was a world away, isolated, depending largely on newspaper accounts of his father's fight for the republican nomination. 
>> I have decided to fight for and win the republican nomination and election to the presidency of the united states. 
>> The war in vietnam was issue number one. George romney had been a hawk but turned against the war and said so. 
>> Well, you know, when I came back from vietnam, I just had the greatest the brainwashing that anybody could get. 
>> By the general? 
>> When you go over to vietnam -- well, not only by the generals but also by the diplomatic corps over there. 
>> Months after george romney's now infamous brainwashing comment, his campaign collapsed. An early political lesson mitt romney would never forget. 
>> Mitt's sister, jane, has said for example this really deeply affected mitt and that he's more careful in what he says, more scripted in what he says because he saw how just one phrase could just torpedo a presidential campaign. 
>> Thank you, governor romney. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> If george's failure turned romney into the cautious candidate he is today, he won't admit it. 
>> Some people say you've learned from or overlearned from his mistakes. 
>> I do that, too. I tell the truth, too. He used to say -- one of his favorite sayings was being right too early is devastating in politics. But, still, it's being right, and you tell people what you believe. 

[00:17:55]


>> What a night! 
>> What romney believes has become an issue throughout his political career. And while the message was clearer in france, his mission would almost cost him his life. 
>> I was at home, and I had word that he was killed. calcium is efficiently absorbed in small continuous amounts. Citracal Slow Release Continuously releases calcium plus d with efficient absorption in one daily dose. Citracal Slow Release. clean witothpaste.

[ Male Announcer ] POLIDENT. Cleaner, fresher, brighter every day. ???????????????????????????????????????????????????? 
>>> in 1968, france was a dangerous place to be for a 21-year-old american. But mitt romney was right in the middle of it. 
>> There were protests and there were blockades and there were marches all over the country. 
>> The streets of france were in chaos. 

[00:22:16]


>> There was no train service. There were no buses, no newspapers. The electricity would go off from time to time. There were no letters from home. The money at the time came via check. That was our lifeline, was getting those letters from home. 
>> You were totally isolated? 
>> Totally isolated. 
>> They were out of touch pretty much with 200 missionaries they were responsible for. 
>> Andy anderson's father was leading the mormon mission in france. By the time the riots ended, romney had been promoted to become president anderson's assistant, and they had an urgent assignment. 
>> They had gotten word there was some little dispute in this southern city in this mormon congregation so they decided to drive down to try to resolve it in person, and mitt was driving. 
>> It was a warm summer day in june when they began a six-hour drive between paris and the south of france. Romney was driving anderson and his wife leola. 
>> They, I believe, were in the town of beaulac, and, they come north to the top of a hill, at the top of the hill and in their way was a mercedes. They had no time to react. The car was on the wrong side of the road. 
>> The mercedes driver, apparently drunk, slammed into them at full speed. Both cars crushed and mangled. Mitt romney and leola anderson, unconscious. 
>> George called me on the phone and said, we have some bad news about mitt, but he didn't tell me what and he came and picked me up and took me to his home. I had word that he was killed. 
>> The policeman on the scene apparently thought I was in worse condition than I was and wrote in french "he is dead" on my passport. 
>> We waited for hours and hours, most of the night, to get word from france that he was actually alive. 
>> I was knocked unconscious and only recall waking up for a brief moment in the ambulance, going to the hospital. 
>> It turns out that romney had a severe concussion and broken bones, but leola, the mom away from home to 200 young missionaries, was dead. 

[00:24:25]


>> It was a great time of challenge and soul searching for all of us. 
>> Romney, anderson's assistant, was now left to lead a struggling mission. 
>> The person who had been leading our mission there, a wonderful man, was so injured that he had to return to the united states for surgeries. And during that time, I and one other fellow took responsibility for overseeing the affairs of the 200 or so men and women -- or boys and girls -- that were serving there as missionaries. 
>> This was a critical moment. 
>> It was. 
>> Morale must have been -- 
>> morale was low. By september, we were only halfway toward our yearly goals. 
>> Romney kept the mission going and set an ambitious new goal, more than doubling the target for conversions. 
>> Mitt said, we've got to have people do things different from how they've been doing them. 
>> So they did just that. 
>> We were dressed up in vaudeville outfits that we'd found in the basement of the mission home there. It brought the house down and lifted people's spirits and they were laughing again. 
>> Spirits were high and so were the number of converts. 
>> We were at 80. 
>> You were at 80. 
>> Which means doubling it in the last four months. COME DECEMBER 31st, WE HAD 204 Or 205 new converts that had happened. So the goal was accomplished. 
>> And by the end of his mission, romney had cemented his faith. 
>> These things drew me closer to the ernal and convinced me that, in fact, there is a god, that jesus christ is the son of god and my savior. These are features that continue to be important in my life. 
>> He was a young boy when he left, prankster and liked to play jokes and probably didn't take life too seriously. He came back much more studious, much more serious. I think discovered a little bit about who he was and what was important to him. 
>> Mitt romney was ready to return home, but an unexpected letter sent him reeling. 

[00:26:29]


>> I was just sort of telling him before he came home, you know, I haven't seen you for 2 1/2 years, you know, and I'm dating other people. What about updated equipment?

>>> It might be called "the city of lights," but mitt romney's last months in paris felt pretty dark. He had gotten word from his girlfriend, ann davies, that she was dating another man. But tt had to wait unt the end of his mission to see her. 
>> He walked off that airplane, and we only had eyes for each other. 
>> Christmas eve 1968. 
>> He walked right by his mother, his father, right to me. And it was as though time had stood still. It was an amazing moment where nothing -- it just dissolved, ose 2 1/2 years dissolved, and we were right back to where we were exactlyhen he left. 
>> And he proposed. 
>> On the car ride home, he was, like, oh, my gosh, I've waited so long for you. Let's just get married now. I'm like, why not? Let's do that. Of course, that was not good news to either set of parents. 
>> Ann was 19, mitt 21. Their parents wanted them to wait, but they wanted a valentine's day wedding. 
>> What did you guys do when you got this? 
>> Yea! All right! 
>> CLOSE FRIEND, dane McBride, remembers the telegram he received with the news. 
>> Boom, february 14. And you knew exactly what he was talking about. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> At lenore romney's request, they waited a month. 
>> It was beautiful. 
>> You were in the wedding. 
>> I was. There was the civil wedding that was performed by a bishop of our church in bloomfield hills, michigan, at the davies home, ann's parents' home. 
>> The next morning they flew to utah for a second ceremony in salt lake city's mormon temple, where they were sealed for eternity, as the church calls it. Ann's parents couldn't attend because they weren't mormon. Ann herself was a relatively new convert. Romney biographer scott helman and michael kranish. 
>> When ann davies meets mitt, I think she's searching a little bit for a religious home, the way a teenager does. What does this mean and what do I believe. 

[00:32:18]


>> Early on when mitt was going out with ann, he did give her some lessons in what was the mormon faith all about. 
>> But ultimately ann's conversion was overseen by george romnewhile mitt was in france. 
>> And he would pick me up every sunday for church. The reason I think it was so easy for me to talk to him even on a spiritual level like at is because he respected me as his complete equal. 
>> Ann and mitt settled in provo, utah, in this $75 a month basement apartment, starting a family and getting serious about school. The mission experience in france had clearly refocused romney. 
>> Life was very different in america than life for the french. And I thought, boy, I've got to work hard in school, I need to be responsible, I need to get back and work. And I began to long for the chance to go back to school and prepare for my life going forward. 
>> Brigham young univey was as far from stanford as romney could get. He seemed at home in this conservative environment, yet in the midst of his new life, mitt took off again on the campaign trail in 1970. 
>> She isn't sold a lie to a political ideology. 
>> This time for his mother. 
>> Lenore romney, candidate for the united states senate. 
>> Lenore, the dutiful candidate's wife, was now the candidate running for the u.S. Senate seat in michigan. 
>> I bece so concerned about the direction our country has been going. 
>> Her youngest son, mitt, was by her side. Romney crossed the entire state with lenore. 
>> They felt there was a need for the moms and dads to have a community center. 
>> Her style, a cautious, elegant diplomat, distinctly different from her husband's bull in a china shop approach. 
>> She was just a very gracious woman, but nuanced, careful, and I see that in mitt. 
>> I think he had a very advanced and mure understanding of politics at a pretty young age. And lenore romney ended up getting killed in that senate race. You know, you take away lessons from victories and from defeat. 

[00:34:37]


>> From both parents. George thrives on candor. 
>> There's a growing aimlessness and flabbiness in our american society. 
>> Lenore more cautious. Their son looked for a path somewhere in between. But george romney steered his son away from politics and toward business first and graduate degrees in both business and law at harvard. 
>> By now, george romney had seen what it took to succeed and what kind of skills you needed and what kind of credentials you needed. And so he was encouraging his son to kind of go beyond where he had been. 
>> So in 1972, mitt, ann and their two baby boys moved to massachusetts. But their move from utah would not be easy.

[ Male Announcer ] UNISOM NATURAL NIGHTS. 
>>> Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man, bake me a cake as fast as you can. 
>> It was a full house for the ROMNEYS THROUGHOUT THE '70s HERE In belmont, massachusetts. 
>> It was a lot of fun. I was the oldest of five boys so there was a lot of chaos. 
>> Your mother once said that your father was kind of like having another teenager in the house. 
>> Yeah. We thought of him as a really big older brother for a long time. He was just a lot of fun to be around. 
>> Life was also busy. Romney was starting a lucrative and intense financial consulting job in boston. Ann was running things at home. 
>> People describe him as the energizer bunny. 
>> My kids joke and say that I'm the mitt stabilizer because whenever mitt might start winding up and getting really highly energetic, they know that I have a very calming influence. 
>> IN THE '70s AND '80s, ROMNEY Was also spending a lot of time with his church, which saw him as a rising star. Energetic, devoted, generous with both time and money. 
>> Everybody was well aware of mitt romney. There was some star power even when he wasn't running for office. 
>> Phil barlow first met mitt romney at church in 1979. Like most in the church, he already knew the romney name but not the romney work ethic. 
>> A person that busy and successful might tend to pull out their pocketbook rather than take their time, and he did both. 
>> For more than a decade, romney was part of the leadership of the mormon church in his hometown. The church has no paid clergy. So at the age of 34, romney was asked to lead his congregation. 

[00:41:24]


>> Talk about a growing up experience and a learning experience. 
>> It is a time he rarely talks about but was surprisingly open with us. 
>> I was like the pastor. And that meant if someone was in the hospital, I needed to see them. And if someone had lost their job and couldn't afford to meet their rent payments, I was responsible for helping get them the financial aid they needed. If there was someone contemplating a divorce and they wanted counseling, they'd come to me. 
>> One of the toughest times for the church came in 1984. Led by romney, the congregation was building a new meetinghouse in belmont. For years, there was a good deal of local opposition. You got a call in the middle of the night? 
>> Yes, yes. This building was under construction. 
>> Grant bennett, romney's right-hand man in the church, members the call from the fire department. The building had burned to the ground. They suspected arson. 
>> The clergy in the town of belmont, the catholics, the episcopalians, the congregationalists, the jewish le, came out in force and essentially everyone offered for our congregation to meet in their building. 
>> Instead of picking one congregation, romney picked all of them. 
>> I think he very much saw this as a bridge builng opportunity to get to know our neighbors. 
>> Romney was less successful bridging another divide. 
>> The mormon church is the archenemy of women's rights in this country. 
>> THE '70s WAS THE DECADE WHEN The e.R.A. Was being pushed, and the mormon church came out in the early '7 took a very active position against the e.R.A. 
>> Judy dushku was a member of romney's congregation and a feminist fighting for women's rights in the mormon church, like having more of leadership role or being able to deliver a sermon. 
>> There we were, suddenly faced with a church that we'd all loved and grown up in. And suddenly it was taking this unusual and we thought strange position. 

[00:43:36]


>> So what about when mitt romney became bishop? 
>> I expected a comforter, somebody who would protect women and have an inclusive attitude and be equally interested in the peace of mind of all of us. And I did not feel that in his congregation. 
>> Well, I'm sure we all have differing memories. 
>> Romney recalls a meeting he led with more than 300 mormon women. 
>> I adopted many of the recommendations that they offered. 
>> Not all. 
>> But not at all. Because the doctrine of my church is not something I'm in a position to change. 
>> I look at that as a time i saw mitt soften and change. It was a learning experience for all of us. And, you know -- but I saw a person that was respectful and listening and caring. 
>> But dushku didn't think he was sympathetic at all and believes he bears a grudge against her to this day. 
>> I think it's indicative of the way mitt sees the world. There are certain people who matter and certain people who he approves of and other people that he doesn't approve of. And if he doesn't approve of them, he thinks they don't have the same kind of standing, they don't have the same kind of merit, they don't have the same kind of right to function and to hold opinions and to participate. 
>> Something others around him at the time fiercely deny. 
>> I would call him open and welcome to new ideas. If there's a better way, absolutely, let's do it the better way. 
>> In business, romney would invent the bain way, something that would pay off in years to come. ] here to volunteer to help those in need. When a twinge of back pain surprises him.

>>> IT WAS THE HEADY '80s, BIG Money, corporate buyouts and dramatic takeovers. Mitt romney was knee-deep in it. A rising star at a boston consulting group, bain & company, which had a great pitch -- help businesses make money by cutting costs. 
>> By all accounts, mitt romney was very successful in advising companies how to improve their business operations. 
>> But soon romney's boss had a better idea. Instead of just advising companies, why not buy them with investor mo generate huge profits. And bain capital was born. Early partner, jeffrey rennart. 
>> It was a lot of long hours, a lot of late nights, and a lot of learning but a lot of success. 
>> So what kind of a leader was mitt romney during those early years? 
>> I would say in the early years, mitt was a lead by example kind of leader. He -- you know, he dug in, did, you know, analysis side by side with us. 
>> And it paid off. Bain capital invested in more than 100 companies, nearly doubling its returns for clients annually. 
>> How you doing? 
>> Romney made a lot of money. And he would later claim, created a lot of jobs. But a former bank colleague who talked off camera about whether the company's emphasis was on job creation told cnn, quote, we were in the business of creating value for investors. 
>> Was job creation or making money the goal? 
>> Well, every business is organized to create a return for the people who invest in the business. And as businesses are successful and profitable, they're able to hire people. And they can hire more people the more successful they are. Businesses are created to provide a return to the owners or the investors, and it has a wonderful byproduct. It employs more and more people. That's the nature of american enterprise. >> Ten years into his run at bain capital, romney decided it was time to leave business for politics, just as his father had done. 

[00:51:29]


>> I will work very hard to make sure that everybody gets a good job. 
>> How are you feeling? 
>> Energized and enthusiastic. 
>> Romney's target, senator ted kennedy. Not exactly starting at the bottom of the ladder there. 
>> I told my colleagues at work, don't clean out my desk or move into my office. I'll be spending time away from work, and it will be a leave of absence. But I really believed someone needed to run against ted kennedy. 
>> Kennedy was vulnerable. His personal life seemed out of control. And, as his son patrick remembers it, the contrast with romney was glaring. 
>> And opposite my dad was this really great-looking guy who was a whiz at business, beautiful family, kind of the picture of self-discipline. And next to my dad, he was like the perfect polar opposite. 
>> How are you? Yes! 
>> Except during that race on social issues -- 
>> let me ask you a question -- 
>> -- mitt romney sounded an awful lot like ted kennedy. 
>> I'm absolutely committed to achieving universal coverage and doing so for our children. >>U a liberal? 
>> No. 
>> Were you a moderate? 
>> You know, anyone can call me whatever they like but people can look at my policies and make their own determination. 
>> Ted divine worked kennedy campaign. 
>> Mitt romney ran as a strongly pro-choice candidate. He told a newspaper in boston, the gay newspaper in boston, that he'd be better on gay rights than kennedy. 
>> Are you saying romney is just an opportunist? 
>> I think he looks at politics the way he does business deals, that this doesn't represent an ideological path for him. I think anyone who looks at his position on issues has to come to that judgment, that for romney politics is a means of obtaining power to do things that he wants to do. 
>> By the fall of 1994, it was a dead heat. And the kennedy campaign was looking for a silver bullet. They found it in bain capital. 

[00:53:34]


>> I don't like romney's creating jobs because he took every one of them away. 
>> The ads featured workers for a paper company in indiana. After a bain-owned company took it over, many of its workers lost their jobs. Romney says he wasn't at bain at the time. His opponents say his actions led to the job cuts. 
>> If you think you'd make such a good senator, come out here to marion, indiana, and see what your company has done to these people. 
>> It worked so well the obama campaign is using the same indiana company, even the same people, again. 
>> He doesn't care anything about the middle class or the lower class people. 
>> If we are successful -- 
>> romney's religious beliefs played a part as well. Senator kennedy's nephew joe at one point attacked the mormon church for not allowing blacks to join the priesthood, a policy that had changed 16 years earlier. Romney went on the offensive, citing the speech john f. Kennedy gave addressing his roman catholic faith. 
>> In my view, the victory that john kennedy won was not just for 40 million americans who were born catholics. It was for all americans of all faiths. And I'm sad to see that ted kennedy is trying to take away his brother's victory. 
>> My son's position is the same as jack kennedy's position. 
>> Even romney's father, george, entered the fray. 
>> I think it's absolutely wrong to keep hammering on the religious issue. 
>> Mr. Romney -- 
>> then in october, a critical debate. 
>> Senator kennedy and his family have a multiple real estate empire across this country. 
>> Romney accused the kennedy family of financially benefiting from real estate deals. 
>> Senator, 15 seconds. 
>> Mr. Romney, the ken not in public service to make money. We have paid too high a price in our commitment to the public service. 
>> Ted kennedy began pulling away, and mitt romney lost. 

[00:55:38]


>> He was back at work the next day. The election was tuesday night. Wednesday morning he was back at his desk. 
>> We kind of expected it. It was -- it's interesting. Ann was more upset by it than i. Losing put me back into business and I was more successful than i had been before. 
>> But not long after, something that would make political defeat seem trivial. 
>> I think my diagnosis was probably the roughest thing we had to go through as a couple. Up. A short word that's a tall order. Up your game. Up the ante. And if you stumble, you get back up.

>>> It was just before thanksgiving 1998. 
>> She began to see some numbness on her right side. It began spreading larger and larger. She was having more difficulty getting up stairs. And we went to a neurologist. 
>> Romney's life was about to take an unexpected and unhappy turn. 
>> We went into his office, and he performed an examination. And it was very clear she was flunking the examina. She couldn't stand on her right foot without falling over and so forth. He stepped out, and she began to cry and I welled up tears as well. We hugged each other, and she said, something's terribly wrong. 
>> At age 49, ann romney was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, an incurable disease that can shut down the central nervous system. 
>> You don't know how much is it going to chew me up and spit me out. Where and when is it going to spit me out? How sick am I going to get? Is this going to be progressive? Am I going to be in a wheelchair? And it's a very, very frigening place to be. 
>> And I know ann was really distraught and distressed with the diagnosis, particularly as time went on, because she was really ill for quite a while. 
>> I really just was having a very, very hard time and was very depressed and had kind of given up a little bit. 
>> It was a tough moment for both of them. It was interesting to see the way he treated her as they went through that. Very caring, very loving. Very frustrating for him not to be able to step in and fix it, but it was -- you know, they drew even closer. 
>> Even when I was as sick as that, he would curl up in the bed with me. 
>> Take a minute. 
>> So you just knew that that's where he was. It was like he was going to do anything he could to jt say, I'm here, you're okay, just stay right there, and we'll be okay. 

[01:01:00]


>> As the romneys were struggling to get ann's m.S. Under control, they were about to face a challenge of an entirely different sort. 
>> Could the scandal over salt lake's olympic bid shatter our city's quest to host the olympic games? 
>> The 2002 olympics were in trouble. Salt lake city was embroiled in a bribery scandal that threatened to bring down the games. So the search was on for someone to repair the damage. Romney knew finance, politics and was a mormon. And that made him the top choice. 
>> They called me instead of mitt because they knew mitt would turn them down flat. 
>> She called me at work and said, I want you to -- don't say no, mitt. I think you ought to go run the olympics. Don't be ridiculous. That's absolutely crazy. I'd never do that. But over time she convinced me. 
>> So despite ann's health issues, the romneys left bain and moved to utah in 1999. But when romney really left bain capital is now controversial. On paper, he remained chief executive officer, raising the question of his responsibility for companies that laid off workers when he was in utah. He says that he was gone from the company completely, that the olympics were all-consuming. 
>> When he got there, it was a disaster. And he was panicked. He really seriously considered saying, it's not going to work here, there's just too many problems. 
>> Romney needed help so he rallied an old friend from bain capital, fraser bullock, to be the games' chief operating officer. 
>> Mitt did describe it as stepping into an empty elevator shaft because you're falling and you're not sure when you will hit ground. 
>> Bullock joined the team that tried to do damage control. They created an operating plan and tried to convince sponsors to stay on board and took a critical look at the nearly $400 million budget deficit staring them in the face and even got rid of the usual catering at olympic board meetings. 

[01:03:12]


>> We had domino's pizza, and it was a dollar a slice. Because he knew he could buy a pizza for five bucks, cut it into eight slices, sell them for a dollar a slice, get $8 of revenue for every pizza at a cost of $5. Turned the lunches from a cost center into a profit nter. 
>> The olympics is like putting on seven super bowls a day for 17 days straight. 
>> And he became the public face of the games, even becoming and amateur participant, seen here on the skeleton. So did he say one day, I think I'm going to try the skeleton? 
>> Yeah. He said, I'm going to go try this. He got better and nd better so he could get going 70 miles an hour, which is crazy. 
>> But hidden from the public was the continuing personal struggle. 
>> Mitt was always just constantly worried about ann. She was really deteriorating. 
>> And she battled through it. She got good help from wonderful physicians. 
>> By august of 2001, it looked like they had ann's m.S. And the olympics under control. But then -- 9/11. 
>> Billowing into the sky. 
>> There's smoke everywhere. 
>> Unspeakable sorrow and a very real fear of terrorism at the olympics. 
>> It's a time for us to make sure that everyone in the world recognizes that we don't stop as a nation, that the characteristics of honor and courage, sacrifice and devotion, which is represented by the olympic athletes, is a message more important today than perhaps ever before. 
>> Over the next five months and with the help of some money from the federal government, security was beefed up. And the games began. 
>> We had about 2,500 athletes that came in, did the parade of nations, walked all the way around. 

[01:05:13]


>> It was a great moment for him, I think. Ne political pollster in utah said at the time, mitt romney could walk on water at that point. 
>> But not everyone agreed. 
>> Mitt and I often had disagreements about how or what we thought the games were about. And I wasn't on his team, so to speak. 
>> It's a gold medal day for utah. Ken bullock, no relation to fraser bullock, was on the organizing committee of the salt lake city olympics before and after romney was brought on board. He was a sort of my way or the highway kind of guy? 
>> Absolutely no question. To me, the games were about utah. It wasn't about mitt. 
>> Bullock claims romney made the problems look worse than they really were, a calculated political move to ensure public success. Did we need to raise revenue? Yes. Were we three years out? Yes. Big difference of the games being around the corner. 
>> You think he overstated the problems? 
>> Dramatically. Dramatically. 
>> It's a charge the romney camp fs at. And in the end, the 2002 olympics were profitable and one of the most successful winter games in history. 
>> He had pulled off this big success. He had rescued these games. And now it was a question of what he would parlay that into. 
>> It wouldn't take long for that question to be answered. . ?????? Introducing the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, ?????? with the stunning Retina display. ?????? For the Pro in all of us. Questions?

>>> Hello, I'm victor blackwell. With just the three days to election day, president obama and mitt romney are setting a dizzying pace. President obama stum pd today in wisconsin, ohio, and iowa. And he wraps up in virginia. Governor romney started in new hampshire, spoke at ohio and wraps up with two campaign stops in colorado. Will. 
>>> Because of last week's storm, people in new jersey can vote electrically on tuesday. The governor's office says it's widening the fax and e-mail program used by absentee voters and deployed military. The storm wiped out so many structures officials want to eesz the pressure on polling places. 
>>> At least 106 u.S. Deaths are blamed on this massive storm and emergency rockers are still looking for victims. Almost 2.5 million people are still without power and damage estimates are $30 billion to by billion ldz. An update on the recent meningitis outbreak, dozens of new meningitis outbreaks due to those injectable steroids. We return you now to "romney revealed." 
>>> The opening ceremonies for the 2002 winter olympics were still more than a month away, but mitt romney already had other plans. Beth myers remembers getting a call from romney in january. 
>> I'm thinking about running for governor, and would you have any interest in helping me run my campaign? 
>> Massachusetts had a republican governor, jane swift, but party leaders saw her as weak so they came to romney in a panic. >> Jane swift gets wind of this, and two days later she bows out. She's out and mitt romney is in. He flies back to belmont with his wife, ann, they're both wearing olympic jackets and give a press conference and the campaign's begun. 

[01:13:20]


>> Campaign spokesman fernstrom. 
>> It was like being launched out of a rocket. 
>> How you doing? 
>> As you know, this is a very democratic state. The legislature is 85% democrat, very few republicans make it into statewide office. So we had a fight on our hands. 
>> He ran as a moderate on social issues, vowing to clean up state government. Ld you raise your right hand, please? 
>> It worked. 
>> Congratulations, governor. 
>> Thank you. 
>> From the beginning, romney relied on a small set of advisors. Beth myers, who has never spoken on camera before, was chief of staff. 
>> People call you romney's romney. 
>> For four years, we sat in offices that had a door between us, and we popped back and forth between each other's offices all day long. We talked about faith. We talked about the issues of the day. 
>> First order of business, treat government like a business. 
>> We had a huge budget deficit. So every morning, we'd come in and we'd have stacks and stacks of budget books, and line by line -- and mitt would meet in his staff office every morning with the cabinet secretaries. 
>> It was the way he had always done it. At bain. At the olympics. But here, not everyone was on romney's team. 
>> I will agree he was a different cat than what people on beacon hill were used to. I think that's probably a pretty good thing. 
>> I got better over time. I know I made mistakes in how i alt with others in the legislature, but we started off pretty well. 
>> Then, two years into his term, he set his sights on something bigger, something that would mean a legacy. Health care. 
>> He had not had a major achievement that he could point to as some big political success in a future campaign. He needed something to say I had done this and it was a big deal. 
>> Romney decided to push for health care to cover everyone in the state. But that meant mandating most residents to buy health insurance. 
>> The governor felt that it would be wrong for the economy and wrong for our business sector to impose a mandate on employers, to require them to provide insurance to their employees. But he felt it very important that people take responsibility for their own health care. 

[01:15:36]


>> It was romney's big moment. But now a liability. Republicans bitterly oppose any kind of mandate in today's presidential race. 
>> I think the politics of it have been so complicated that it's ironic the biggest thing he achieved as governor is something he almost never talks about. 
>> No less complicated, the politics of abortion. While romney was personally opposed to abortion, he ran for governor supporting abortion rights. But once in office and presented with stem cell legislation that would, in romney's view, have the potential of destroying embryos, he changed his mind. 
>> I realized that what sounded good in a campaign, when i actually became the governor and was going to be the person who would sign a piece of legislation which coultake human life, I simply couldn't do that. 
>> Democrats say it was about ambition. 
>> He wanted to run for president of the united states, and he understood that within the republican nominating process somebody that was pro choice or pro gay rights or anything in terms of a progressive stance would lose. 
>> I didn't ever see it as a flip-flop. I think that what you saw was the tension between personal beliefs and a public persona. 
>> None of this would slow romney down. His sights were already set on the white house in 2008. But there were doubts about his convictions and questions about his mormon faith, a religion some evangelicals call a cult. 
>> Mormonism is the most colorful and controversial, politically toxic and dangerous because people pull out strands and skewer them. 
>> There was no avoiding it, though, so romney decided to give a crucial speech on his faith early in the primaries. 
>> He wrote it. He really wrote every word. 
>> He wrote every word of it. You very rarely hear that about a politician. 

[01:17:40]


>> He did. 
>> I am an american running for president. I do not define my candidacy by my religion. A person should not be elected because of his faith, nor should he be rejected because of his faith. 
>> Ultimately, 2008 was not mitt romney's year. IT WAS john McCain's. A brutal loss for romney and his family. 
>> I feel I have to now stand aside. 
>> For me, I was like, that's it. Okay, we did that. That's fine. Never again. eight princesses. I'm an expert on softball. And tea parties.

>>> You guys are great. Almost but not quite. 
>> I will never do this again. And I just made sure it was very emphatic. 
>> The romney family seemed done with politics in 2008 and didn't keep it a secret. 
>> It was again a very bruising thing. I think people forget these are real families with people that they love that are going through these hard times. 
>> So why the change of heart? 
>> It was a change of heart. What this m.S. Has taught me is do what is right in pursuing. 
>> I'm mitt romney. I believe in america and I'm running for president of the united states. 
>> But it was a different environment this time around. Very anti-establishment. So romney was reborn as an outsider. 
>> I served in government but i didn't inhale. 
>> It became his mantra. But the tea party, full of contempt for health care reform, never trusted romney, the man who reformed health care in massachusetts. Erick erickson is the editor of redstate.Com, a conservative website. 
>> You sit in a room with conservatives behind the scenes without cameras on and ask them how many really believe mitt romney is going to fully repeal obama-care, I don't think a hand will go up in the room. 
>> And when romney calls himself this -- 
>> I was a severely conservative republican governor. 
>> -- He gets this. 
>> That's not a line you hear conservatives say about themselves. That's something you hear democrats say about conservatives. 
>> This is not the time to be doubting people's words. 
>> One by one, the old demons reappeared. 
>> Romney-care. 
>> Pro-abortion. 

[01:24:48]


>> Bain capital. 
>> Handing the democrats a primer on romney's vulnerabilities. 
>> I will release multiple years. I don't know how many years. 
>> On bain, flip-flops, taxes, secrecy, his wealth. But romney finally crawled across the finish line of the republican primaries and into the general election. And his new junior republican paul ryan gave reluctant conservatives some hope. 
>> I want to hear what he has to say on this topic. 
>> But presidential politics is more than just piecing together coalitions. It's also about telling a story of who you are, what you believe and why you can be trusted. 
>> He's very professional. He's got a bit of new england in him. When he's out doing a job, he's going to do it professionally. But he's not the caricature the media or democrats want to portray. He's a very warm, caring guy. 
>> My job is not to worry about those people. 
>> Romney painted his own unflattering portrait and the damage endured. 
>> His problem during this campaign, if you look at the polls, is that a significant majority of people do not believe he understands their problems. And when he talked about the 47%, that only seemed to compound that problem. 
>> I think the first, most important thing is recognize that that's not an accurate perception, that he's obviously running for 100% of the americans. 
>> The first presidential debate became the most important job interview of romney's career. A moment for him to fix things. 

[01:26:55]


>> As soon as he gets on stage, the first thing he does, takes off his watch and puts it on the podium. But then he writes "dad" on a piece of paper. And that's amazing because he loves his dad, respects his dad, doesn't want to do anything that would not make his father proud. And just a reminder that, yes, I'm here, but, dad, I love and respect who you are, what you've taught me, what kind of a person you are, and I'm going to hono that. 
>> Middle income families are being crushed. 
>> Romney attacked. Obama wilted. 
>> You've been president fourees. You said you'd cut the deficit in half. It's years later, we have trillion-dollar deficits. 
>> It was a romney turnaround recasting romney from the right to the middle during the next two debates. 
>> Regulation is esseial. You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation. 
>> Opening the door for the opposition to ask, who's the real romney? 
>> We've got to name this condition he's going through. I think -- I think it's called romneysia. 
>> People say you're secretive, out of touch, you play by a different set of rules. 
>> I know the obama campaign is going to do everything they can to try and deflect from the economic record of the president and his failure to come up with the plan to get the economy going in the future. 
>> No doubt romney is on message this time. He wants us to believe he can fixhings like the economy and won't give up until he does. But that's the easy part of his story. The rest is harder to tell. He's a devout mormon who still worries it will be held against him. He's more matist than ideologue, more private than public, and in the end more cautious than candid, possibly the ult will mat lesson he learned from his father's life. 

[01:29:02]


>> He cared about the passion for the mission he was in the middle of fighting for and win being or losing didn't change who he was. He's been defined as a man of character throughout his life. Elections don't change that. 
>> Is that how you feel during the election, win or lose? 
>> Absolutely. This is up to the american people. Who I am has long been decided by my wife, my five sons, my grandchildren and sons in law and people who know me best. 
>>> I, barack hussein obama --

=======================================================

>>> A man born to wealth, cs. 
>> I'm mitt romney, and I'm running for president of the united states. 
>> I think my dad has always felt like he wanted to be true to his dad's name and legacy. 
>> A savvy businessman who made a fortune at bain capital and turned around the 2002 winter olympics. 
>> He has two spds, asleep or wide awake and fixing things. 
>> Good to see you! He is a mr. Fix-it. 
>> A man driven by faith in himself, his family, and his mormon religion. 
>> You try your very best to know what god might say and of course you look to get direction from the church as well. 
>> A warm, caring man. 
>> He was going to do anything he could to just say, I'm here, stay right there and we'll be okay. 
>> Or a cold, calculating politician? 
>> He's made decisions knowing that they could resurface 30 years, hence, under the glare of a political campaign. 
>> Mitt romney isn't pro-choice, anti-choice. He's multiple choice. 
>> A political opportunist -- 
>> he changed his position on a broad range of issues for a simple reason, he wanted to run for president of the united states. 
>> Or a true believer. 
>> I know his core. Honesty, integrity, decenc intelligence, conviction to doing the right thing. 
>> We're going to bring back america. Thank you so much. 
>> Now, "romney revealed: Family, faith and the road to power." Ann and mitt romney's summer home sits on lake winnipesaukee in new hampshire. A private, large and lived-in family retreat for the entire clan. All 28 of them. 

[00:02:04]


>> They all just left. A lot of them left last night. I ran through 12 loads this morning. A lot of towels. A lot of sheets. But it's a joyous thing. It's a joyous thing to have them all here. 
>> Even in the midst of a presidential campaign. Tell me a little bit about the mitt romney that's here, at the lake. 
>> Nonstop. Nonstop. He is going every minute. He's loving it. He pops out of bed the fir thing in the morning, and he's just going. 
>> Here, inside the lake house, romney is more camp counselor than candidate. 
>> Fun loving, warm, spontaneous. Get him out of the public eye, put him in here, he is as loose and funny and spontaneous as you'd ever want to see. And just so much fun to be with. 
>> So what happens when you get in the public eye? 
>> You just have to be more circumspect. You have to be more careful with your words. You just have to be very, very careful, and it's unfortunate, i think, that even -- people, i think, probably only think of mitt maybe through his business lens. And, for me, you know, that is just 1% of who he is. 
>> And who is he really? First and foremost, a romney. The romney name has been in the public eye for the last half century, a family of great wealth will and business achievement, political success as well as failures. Mitt was the fourth and last child for george and lenore romney. BORN MARCH 12th, 1947, SOME Recall him as the favorite. George wrote to the family in september 1956 -- mitt is growing like a weed, a full of ideas and energy as ever. tom McCaffrey grew up with romney. 
>> Mitt as a child was extremely energetic, the kind of kid who could never sit down. His mind was going 100 miles an hour. 

[00:04:07]


>> George wach the same way. 
>> You know, he's just got that energy. 
>> Phillip maxwell lived down the street from the romneys in a wealthy detroit suburb. 
>> George would go out on the golf course. And he had fluorescent golf balls, and he would hit the ball and he would run after the ball, jogging, hit the ball again. And that was his exercise. 
>> Young mitt not only had his father's energy -- 
>> there seems to be a special bond between george and mitt. 
>> -- Michael kranish and scott helman co-wrote the book "th real romney." 
>> Mitt absolutely idolized his father in a way you can see drawn out in the way he's run his life, following the same footsteps of the career. 
>> George romney was a ceo who saved american motors by betting on smaller cars. It gave his son a first look at business. 
>> George was a turnaround artist at american motors, taking a company that had lost focus, for whatever reason, and fixing it. 
>> And once george made his mark in the auto world, he switched gears to politics. He was the republican governor of michigan for three terms. And young mitt was a fixture on the campaign trail, schooled early in issues, strategies and the possibility of losing. 
>> And dad's pollster said, george, you can't possibly win. I was a kid in high school. I thought, oh, no, you know, we're going to lose, I'm going to be embarrassed at school, these little things that a kid thinks. And my dad said -- it was clear, he said, I'm not in this because I worry about winning or losing, I'm here to make a difference. He's not defined by elections. He's been defined as a man of character throughout his life. 
>> And then there was mitt's mother lenore. 
>> My mom had a softer side. She used to read to me when i was a boy and gave me a love of culture and literature. 
>> Once a screen actress, lenore met george in 1924. Their courtship became an often told part of the family story. 

[00:06:14]


>> He left what he was doing and traveled west to hollywood to convince her to marry him as opposed to going into the movie business. He knew what he wanted and was not going to stop until he got it. 
>> Mitt's courtship of ann was, in its own way, no less intense. They were just teenagers at neighboring elite private schools in detroit. It was mitt's senior year when he spotted the 16-year-old ann davies at a dance. 
>> I did fall madly in love with him very quickly. Actually. But I was very aloof, very cool. 
>> She was very smar she set the hook deep. And I'd call and say, let's get together. She was too busy. She went on a date with someone else while I was pursuing her. Made me just crazy. 
>> He was so much fun. Captivating. It was just fun, fun, fun to be with him. 
>> There are lots of stories of good-natured practical jokes. 
>> But at kranbeck, he was kind of swimming around, trying to find his place. One of the consequences was he would get involved in these pranks. Which were really attention getting devices. 
>> But maxwell remembers one incident he says crossed the line. A younger classmate returned from break with long bleach-blond hair, and a group of guys, including romney, confronted him. 
>> He was taken down, and mitt had scissors and he cut his hair. It was an ugly scene, and it was a long time ago, but I'll never forget it because of the look on this boy's face. He was absolutely terrified when they took him down. 
>> Others, as you know, who went to cranbrook with you remember different stories that they were over the top and maybe even cruel to some students. Do you remember it that way? 
>> No, I don't. And I know that comes up during the campaign season. But it's the first time I've heard that. 

[00:08:15]


>> The hair cutting story? 
>> I think that's the only story I've heard of that nature. But the pranks that we pulled were designed to be funny and to have fun. I can imagine that now and then things I did in high school are not things that I'd want to become part of a presidential campaign. 
>> That was decades ago. One incident when romney was a teenager without focus and direction. Something he would find later in a very surprising place. light. Outdoors, or in.

>>> It was fall 1965, stanford university. The counterculture movement was growing. A different world for freshman mitt romney, straight from a michigan boarding school and his conservative roots. 
>> He has this exposure, i think, to all these new ideas, all these new people, these new experiences. 
>> But all romney could think about at first was ann, back in michigan. Mark marcus was romney's roommate. 
>> A lot of guys come to college and have high school girlfriends. But you could tell for mitt it was different. He could not stop talking about ann. 
>> We were so much in love. I went off to college, and got a job there to earn a little money so I could pay for an airplane ticket to go home and see her. I didn't tell my parents. 
>> This was at stanford. 
>> While I was at stanford. We didn't tell my parents about this. 
>> So you snuck home? I flew home, snuck home, would take her on a date. 
>> But as the year wore on, the politics on campus became inescapable. 
>> He's very affected by this world in which he sees an anti-establishment strain growing. 
>> As the protests at stanford grew, romney stood with the establishment and for the war. 
>> His father at that time was strongly for the vietnam war, and he was finding his political footing. Really the first time we see mitt romney emerge as his own man in a political sense is when he does lead this protest against the anti-war protesters on the campus of stanford. He's standing up with a sign saying, speak out, don't sit in. 

[00:15:00]


>> But romney never went to vietnam himself, exempt as a student and with a high draft lottery number. 
>> He's protesting the anti-war protesters, but he does not volunteer to go serve in vietnam. He would have been eligible to serve, certainly. 
>> At the end of his freshman year, romney would be called to serve. Not his country but his faith, as a mormon missionary in france. It was a tradition he considered breaking. 
>> He was concerned, according to his friends, that he might lose ann. So he talked to ann about this and she told him, you know, if you don't go, you'll always regret it. And I'll be here. 
>> When he left, I had a very brave face, went to the airport with his entire family. We all said good-bye. I was driven home with his family, and then I walked into my home, opened the door, my mother was there. I fell flat on the ground and just dissolved in tears. And she could not console me. 
>> For 2 1/2 years in the turbulent '6romney was living abroad, working every day to convert the skeptical french to his mormon faith. So this is this kind of neighborhood that you used to knock on doors in, all day? 
>> This -- yes, 45 years ago. This is fairly typical. 
>> Mike bush took us back to the streets of bordeaux, where he and romneypent 60 hours a week spreading their faith in french. Did you have a specific message? 
>> We would talk to them about our beliefs. We would talk about jesus christ, talk about the book of mormon. 
>> You're out talking to people about your faith and your religion and differences between it and other faiths. 
>> Getting doors slammed in your face. 
>> Most of the time. This was a time when a lot of people were not happy with america in france. It was a time of a great deal of rejection. 

[00:17:00]


>> But romney kept at it. In a rare conversation about his faith, he reveals how the constant rejection led to some surprising soul searching. 
>> But you say, okay, wait a second, what's important here? What do I believe? What's truth? Is there a god? Is jesus christ the son of god? These are questions that are no longer academic, they're critical because you're talking about that day in and day out. 
>> As mitt questioned everything he was raised to believe in, his father tried to get his son back on track. 
>> Your father sent you this letter when you were in france. And he quoted robert lewis stevenson to you in trying to sort of get you to not feel discouraged. He said, despair not but if you despair, work on in your despair. And then he wrote, so persist. 
>> My dad, whaa guy. What a guy. I mean, he's always been there for me. Look, I remember my dad's advice throughout my life. Every time I had challenges of one kind or another, he was there with counsel. An extraordinary man. 
>> Who happened to be running for president while mitt was a world away, isolated, depending largely on newspaper accounts of his father's fight for the republican nomination. 
>> I have decided to fight for and win the republican nomination and election to the presidency of the united states. 
>> The war in vietnam was issue number one. George romney had been a hawk but turned against the war and said so. 
>> You know, when I came back from vietnam, I just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get. 
>> By the general? 
>> When you go over to vietnam 
-- not only by the generals but also by the diplomatic corps over there. Months after george romney's now-infamous brainwashing comment, his campaign collapsed. An early political lesson mitt romney would never forget. 

[00:19:05]


>> Mitt's sister jane has said for example this really deeply affected mitt and that he's more careful in what he says, more scripted in what he says because he saw just how one phrase could torpedo a presidential campaign. 
>> Thank you, governor romney. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> If george's failure turned romney into the cautious candidate he is today, he won't admit it. Some people say you've learned from or overlearned from mistakes. 
>> I do that, too. I tell the truth, too. He used to say -- one of his favorite sayings was that being right too early is devastating in politics. But, still, it's being right. And you tell people what you believe. 
>> What romney believes has become an issue throughout his political career. And while the message was clearer in france, his mission would almost cost him his life. 
>> I was at home, and I had word that he was killed. ??????

>>> In 1968, france was a dangerous place to be for a 21-year-old american. But mitt romney was right in the middle of it. 
>> There were protests and there were blockades and there were marches all over the country. 
>> The streets of france were in chaos. 
>> There was no train service, there were no buses, no newspapers. The electricity would go off from time to time. There were no letters from home. The money at the time came via check. That was our lifeline, was getting letters from home. 
>> So you were totally isolated? 
>> Totally isolated. 
>> They were out of touch pretty much with 200 missionaries that they were responsible for. 
>> Andy anderson's father was leading the mormon mission in france. By the time the riots ended, romney had been promoted to become president anderson's assistant, and they had an urgent assignment. 
>> They had gotten word there was some little dispute in this southern city in this mormon congregation so they decided to drive down to try to resolve it in person, and mitt was driving. 
>> It was a warm summer day in june when they began a six-hour drive between paris and the south of france. Romney was driving anderson and his wife leola. 
>> They, I believe, were in the town of beaulac. As they come north near the top of the hill and in their way was a mercedes. They had no time to react. The car was on the wrong side of the road. 
>> The mercedes driver, apparently drunk, slammed into them at full speed. Both cars crushed and mangled. Mitt romney and leola anderson unconscious. 
>> George called me on the phone and said, "we have some bad news about mittut he didn't tell me what and he came and picked me up and took me to his home. I had word that he was killed. 
>> The policeman on the scene apparently thought I was in worse condition than I was and wrote in french "he is dead" on my passport. 

[00:25:49]


>> We waited for hours and hours, most of the night, to get word from france that he was actually alive. 
>> I was knocked unconscious and only recall waking up for a brief moment in the ambulance, going to the h 
>> it turns out that romney had a severe concussion and broken bones, but leola, the mom away from home to 200 young missionaries, was dead. 
>> It was a great time of challenge and soul searching for all of us. 
>> Romney, anderson's assistant, was now left to lead a struggling mission. 
>> The person who had been leading our mission there, a wonderful man, was so injured that he had to return to the united states for surgeries. And during that time I and one other fellow took responsibility for overseeing the affairs of the 200 or so men and women -- or boys anrls -- that were serving there as missionaries. 
>> This was a critical moment. 
>> It was. 
>> Morale must have been -- 
>> morale was low. By september, we were only halfway toward our yearly goals. 
>> Romney kept the mission going and set an ambitious new goal, more than doubling the target for conversions. 
>> Mitt said, we've got to have people do things different from how they've been doing them. 
>> So they did just that. 
>> We were dressed up in vaudeville outfits we had found in the basement of the mission home there. It just brought the house down and lifted people's spirits, and they were laughing again. 
>> Spirits were high and so were the number of converts. 
>> We were at 80. 
>> You were at 80. 
>> Doubling it in the last four months. COME DECEMBER 31st, WE HAD 204, 205 new converts that had happened. So the goal was accomplished. 
>> By the end of his mission, romney had cemented his faith. 
>> These things drew me closer to the eternal and convinced me that in fact there is a god, that jesus christ is the son of god and my savior. These are features that continue to be important in my life. 

[00:27:58]


>> He was a young boy when he left, a prankster and liked to play jokes and probably didn't take life too seriously. He came back much more studious, much more serious. I think discovered a little bit about who he was and what was important to him. 
>> Mitt romney was ready to return home, but an unexpected letter sent him reeling.

>>> It might be called "the city of lights," but mitt romney's last months in paris felt pretty dark. He had gotten word from his girlfriend, ann davies, that she was dating another man. But mitt had to wait until the end of his mission to see her. 
>> He walked off that airplane, and we only had eyes for each other. 
>> Christmas eve 1968. 
>> He walked right by his mother, his father, right to me. And it was as though time had stood still. It was an amazing moment where nothing -- it just dissolved, those 2 1/2 years dissolved, and we were right back to where we were exactly when he left. 
>> And he proposed. 
>> On the car ride home, he was, like, oh, my gosh, I've waited so long for you. Let's just get married. Now. And I'm like, why not? Let's do that. Of course, that was not good news to either set of parents. 
>> Ann was 19, mitt, 21. Their parents wanted them to wa. But they wanted a valentine's day wedding. What did you guys do when you got this? 
>> Yeah! All right! 
>> CLOSE FRIEND dane McBride remembers the telegram he received with the news. Boom, february 14. And you knew exactly what he was talking about? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> At lenore romney's request, they waited a month. 
>> It was beautiful. 
>> You were in the wedding? 
>> I was. There was the civil wedding that was performed by a bishop of our church in bloomfield hills, michigan, at the davies home, ann's parents' home. The next morning, they flew to utah for a second ceremony in salt lake city's mormon temple, where they were sealed for eternity, as the church calls it. Ann's parents couldn't attend because they weren't mormon. Ann herself was a relatively new convert. Romney biographers scott helman and michael kranish. 
>> When ann davies meets mitt, i think she's searching a little bit for a religious home, the way a teenager does. What does this mean. And what do I believe? 

[00:34:08]


>> Early on, when mitt was going out with ann, he did give her some lessons in what was the mormon faith all about. 
>> But ultimately ann's conversion was overseen by george romney while mitt was in france. 
>> And he would pick me up every sunday for church. The reason I think it was so easy for me to talk to him even on a spiritual level like that is because he respected as his complete equal. 
>> Ann and mitt settled in provo, utah, in this $75-a-month basement apartment, starting a family and getting serious about school. The mission experience in france had clearly refocused romney. 
>> Life was very different in america than life for the french. And I thought, boy, I've got to work hard in school, I need to be responsible, I need to get back and work. And I began to long for the chance to go back to school and prepare for my life going forward. 
>> Brigham young university was as far from stanford as romney could get. He seemed at home in this conservative environment, yet, in the midst of his new life, mitt took off again on the campaign trail in 1970. 
>> She hasn't sold a lie to a political ideology. 
>> This time, for his mother. 
>> Lenore romney, candidate for the united states senate. 
>> Lenore, the dutiful candidate's wife, was now the candidate, running for the u.S. Senate seat in michigan. 
>> I became so concerned about the direction our country has been going. 
>> Her youngt son, mitt, was by her side. Romney crossed the entire state with lenore. 
>> They thought there was a need for the moms and dads to have a community center. 
>> Her style, a cautious, elegant diplomat, distinctly different from her husband's bull in a china shop approach. 
>> She was a very gracious woman but nuanced, careful. And I see that in mitt. 
>> I think he had a very advanced and mature understanding of politics, you know, at a pretty young age. Lenore romney ended up getting killed in that senate race. You know, you take away lessons from victories and from defeat. 

[00:36:23]


>> From both parents. George thrives on candor. 
>> There's a growing assness and flabbiness in our american society. 
>> Lenore more cautious. Their son looked for a path somewhere in between. But george romney steered his son away from politics and toward business first and two graduate degrees, in both business and law, at harvard. 
>> By now, george romney had seen what it took to succeed and what kind of skills you needed and what kind of credentials you needed. And so he was encouraging his son to go beyond where he had been. 
>> So in 1972, mitt, ann and their two baby boys moved to massachusetts. But their move from utah would not be easy. 
>> It was destroyed by fire in august of 1984. And the fire department indicated that it was most likely set. They categorized it as of suspicious origin. ?????? ?????? ??????

>>> it was a full house for the ROMNEYS THROUGHOUT THE '70s HERE In belmont, massachusetts. 
>> It was a lot of fun. I was the oldest of five boys and so there was a lot of chaos. 
>> Your mother once said that your father was kind of like having another teenager in the house. 
>> Yeah. We thought of him as a really big older brother for a long time. He was just a lot of fun to be around. 
>> Life was also busy. Romney was starting a lucrative and intense financial consulting job in boston. Ann was running things at home. 
>> People describe him as the energizer bunny. 
>> My kids joke and say that I'm the mitt stabilizer because whenever mitt might start winding up and getting really highly energetic, they know i have a very calming influence. 
>> IN THE '70s AND '80s, ROMNEY Was also spending a lot of time with his church, which saw him as a rising star. Energetic, devoted, generous with both time and money. 
>> Everybody was well aware of mitt romney. There was some star power even when he wasn't running for office. 
>> Phil barlow first met mitt romney at church in 1979. Like most in the church, he already knew the romney name but not the romney work ethic. 
>> A person that busy and successful might tend to pull out their pocketbook rather than take their time. And he did both. 
>> For more than a decade, romney was part of the leadership of the mormon church in his hometown. The church has no paid clergy. So at the age of 34, romney was asked to lead hingregation. 
>> Talk about a growing up experience and a learning experience. 
>> It is a time he rarely talks about but was surprisingly open with us. 
>> I was like the pastor. That meant if someone was in the hospital, I needed to see them. And if someone lost their job and couldn't afford to meet their rent payments, I was responsible for helping get them the financial aid they needed. If there was someone contemplating a divorce and they wanted counseling, they'd come to me. 

[00:43:46]


>> One of the toughest times for the church came in 1984. Led by romney, the congregation was building a new meetinghouse in belmont. For years, there was a good deal of local opposition. You got a call in the middle of the night? 
>> Yes, yes. This building was under construction. 
>> Grant bennett, romney's right-hand man in the church, remembers the call from the fire department. The building had burned to the ground. They suspected arson. 
>> The clergy in the town of belmont, the catholics, the episcopalians, the congregationalists, the jewish temple came out in force and essentially everyone offered for our congregation to meet in their building 
>> instead of picking one congregation, romney picked all of them. 
>> I think he very much saw this as a bridge building opportunity to get to know our neighbors. 
>> Romney was less successful bridgingnother divide. 
>> The mormon church is the archenemy of women's rights in this country. 
>> THE '70s WAS THE DECADE WHEN The e.R.A. Was being pushed and the mormon church came out in THE EARLY '70s AND TOOK A VERY Active position against the e.R.A. 
>> Judy dushku was a member of romney's congregation and a feminist fighting for women's rights in the mormon church, like having more of leadership role or being able to deliver a sermon. 
>> There we were, suddenly faced with a church that we'd all loved and grown up in. Suddenly, it was taking this unusual and we thought strange position. 
>> So what about when mitt romney became bishop? 
>> I expected a comforter, somebody who would protect women and who would have an inclusive attitude and be equally interested in the peace of mind of all of us. And I did not feel that in his congretion. 
>> Well, I'm sure we all have differing memories. 
>> Romney recalls a meeting he led with more than 300 mormon women. 
>> I adopted many of the recommendations that they offered. 

[00:45:49]


>> Not all. 
>> Not all. Because the doctrine of my church is not something I'm in a position to change. 
>> I look at that as a time i saw mitt soften and change. It was a learning experience for all of us. And, you know -- but I saw a person that was respectful and listening and caring. 
>> But dushku didn't think he was sympathetic at all and believes he bears a grudge against her to this day. 
>> I think it's indicative of the way mitt sees the world. There are certain people who matter and certain people who he approves of and other people that he doesn't approve of. If he doesn't approve of them, he thinks they don't have the same kind of standing, they don't have the same kind of merit, they don't have the same kind of right to function and to hold opinions and to participate. 
>> Something others around him at the time fiercely deny. 
>> I would call him open and welcome to new ideas. And if there's a better way, absolutely, let's do it the better way. 
>> In business, romney would invent the bain way, something that would pay off in years to come. ] 100. 100% New. 100% Mmm... Wow, that is mmm... It's so mmm you might not believe it's a hundred calories. New Yoplait Greek 100. It is so good. 

[00:51:06]


>>> IT WAS THE HEADY '80s. Big money, corporate buyouts and dramatic takeovers. Tt romney was knee-deep in it. A rising star at a boston consulting group, bain & company, which had a great pitch 
-- help businesses make money by cutting costs. 
>> By all accounts, mitt romney was very successful in advising companies how to improve their business operations. Oon romney's boss had a better idea. Instead of just advising companies, why not buy them with investor money to generate huge profits. And bain capital was born. Early partner jeffrey rennart. 
>> Well, it was a lot of long hours, a lot of late nights and a lot of learning but a lot of success. 
>> So what kind of a leader was romney during those early years? 
>> I would say in the early years mitt was a lead-by-example kind of leader. He -- you know, he dug in, you knowdid analysis side by side with us. 
>> And it paid off. Bain capital invested in more than 100 companies, nearly doubling its returns for clients annually. 
>> How you doing? 
>> Romney made a lot of money, and he would later claim created a lot of jobs. But a former bank colleague, who talked off camera about whether the company's emphasis was on job creation told cnn, quote, we were in the business of creating value for investors. 
>> Was job creation or making money the goal? 
>> Well, every business is organized to create a return for the people who invest in the business. And as businesses are successful and profitable, they're able to hire people. And they can hire more people the more successful they are. Businesses are created to provide a return to the owners or the investors. And it has a wonderful by-product. It employs more and more people. That's the nature of american enterprise. 

[00:53:11]


>> Ten years into his run at bain capital, romney decided it was time to leave business for politics, just as his father had done. 
>> I will work very hard to make sure that everybody gets a good job. 
>> How are you feeling? 
>> Energized, enthusiastic. 
>> Romney's target, senator ted kennedy. Not exactly starting at the bottom of the ladder there. 
>> I told my colleagues at work, don't clean up my desk or move into my office. I'll be spending time away from work, and it will be a leave of absence. But I really believe someone needs to run against ted kennedy. 
>> Kennedy was vulnerable. His personal life seemed out of control. As his son patrick remembers it, the contrast with romney was glaring. 
>> And opposite my dad was this really great-looking guy who was a whiz at business, beautiful family, kind of the picture of self-discipline. And next to my dad, he was like the perfect polar opposite. 
>> How are you? Yes! 
>> Except, during that race on social issues -- 
>> let me ask you a question -- 
>> -- mitt romney sounded an awful lot like ted kennedy. 
>> I'm absolutely committed to achieving universal coverage and doing so for our children. 
>> Were you a liberal? Were you a moderate? 
>> No. You know, anyone can call me whatever they like, but people can look at my policies and make their own determination. 
>> Ted divine worked for the kennedy campaign. 
>> Mitt romney ran as a strongly pro-choice candidate. He told the newspaper in boston, the gay newspaper in boston, that he'd be better on gay rights than kennedy. 
>> Are you saying romney is just an opportunist? 
>> I think he looks at politics the way he does business deals, that this doesn't represent an ideological path for him. I think anyone who looks at his position on issues has to come to that judgment, that for romney, politics is a means of obtaining power to do things that he wants to do. 
>> By the fall of 1994, it was a dead heat, and the kennedy campaign was looking for a silver bullet. They found it in bain capital. 

[00:55:25]


>> I don't like romney's creating jobs because he took every one of them away. 
>> Theds featured workers for a paper company in indiana. After a bain-owned company took it over, many of its workers lost their jobs. Romnhe wasn't at bain at the time. His opponents say his actions led to the job cuts. 
>> If you think you'd make such a good senator, come out here to marion, indiana, and see what your company has done to these people. 
>> It worked so well the obama campaign is using the same indiana company, even the same people again. 
>> He doesn't care anything about the middle class or the lower class people. 
>> If we are successful -- 
>> romney's religious beliefs played a part as well. Senator kennedy's nephew joe at one point attacked the mormon church for not allowing blacks to join the priesthood, a policy that had changed 16 years earlier. Romney went on the offensive, citing the speech john f. Kennedy gave addressing his roman catholic faith. 
>> In my view, the victory that john kennedy won was not just for 40 million americans who were born catholics, it was for all americans of all faiths. And I'm sad to see that ted kennedy is trying to take away his brother's victory. 
>> My son's position is the same as jack kennedy's position. 
>> Even romney's father, george, entered the fray. 
>> I think it's absolutely wrong to keep hammering on the religious issue. 
>> Mr. Romney -- 
>> then in october a critical debate. 
>> Senator kennedy and his family have a multiple real estate empire across this country. 
>> Romney accused the kennedy family of financially benefiting from real estate deals. 
>> Senator, 15 seconds. 
>> Mr. Romney, the kennedys are not in public service to make money. We have paid too high a price in our commitment to the public service. 

[00:57:26]


>> Ted kennedy began pulling away, and mitt romney lost. 
>> He was back at work the next da the election was tuesday night. Wednesday morning he was back at his desk. 
>> We kind of expected it. It was -- it's interesting. Ann was more upset by it than i. But losing put me back into business, and I was more successful than I had been before. 
>> But not long after, something that would make political defeat seem trivial. 
>> I think my diagnosis was probably the roughest thing we had to go through as a couple. ?????? ??????

>>> It was just before thanksgiving 1998. 
>> She began to see some numbness on her right side. It began spreading larger and larger. She was having more difficulty getting up stairs. We went to a neurologist. 
>> Romney's life was about to take an unexpected and unhappy turn. 
>> We went into his office, and he performed an examination. It was very clear that she was flunking the examination. She couldn't stand on her right foot without falling over and so forth. He stepped out, and she began to cry, and I welled up tears as well. We hugged each other. And she said, something's terribly wrong. 
>> At age 49, ann romney was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, an incurable disease that can shut down the central nervous system. 
>> You don't know how much is it going to chew me up and spit me out. Where and when is it going to spit me out? How sick am I going to get? Is this going to be progressive? Am I going to be in a wheelchair? And it's a very, very frightening place to be. 

[01:01:46]


>> And I know ann was really distraught and distressed with the diagnosis, particularly as time went on, because she was really ill for quite a while. 
>> I really just was having a very, very hard time and was very depressed and had kind of given up a little bit. 
>> It was a tough moment for both of them. It was interesting to see the way he treated her as they went through that, very caring, very loving. Very frustrating for him not to be able to step in and fix it, but it was -- you know, they drew even closer. 
>> Even when I was as sick as that, he would curl up in the bed with me. 
>> Take a minute. 
>> So you just knew that that's where he was. It was like he was going to do anything he could to just say, I'm here, you're okay, just stay right there, and we'll be okay. 
>> As the romneys were struggling to get ann's m.S. Under control, they were about to face a challenge of an entirely different sort. 
>> Could the scandal over salt lake's olympic bid shatter our city's quest to host the olympic games? 
>> The 2002 olympics were in trouble. Salt lake city was embroiled in a bribery scandal that threatened to bring down the games. So the search was on for someone to repair the damage. 
>> Romney knew finance, politics and was a mormon. And that made him the top choice. 
>> They called me instead of mitt because they knew mitt would turn them down flat. 
>> She called me at work and said, I want you to -- don't say no, mitt. I think you ought to go run the olympics. Don't be ridiculous. That's absolutely crazy. I'd never do that. But over time she convinced me. 

[01:03:49]


>> So, despite ann's health issues, the romneys left bain and moved to utah in 1999. But when romney really left bain capital is now controversial. On paper, he remained chief executive officer, raising the question of his responsibility for companies that laid off workers when he was in utah. He says that he was gone from the company completely, that the olympics were all-consuming. 
>> When he got there, it was a disaster. And he was panicked. He really seriously considered saying, it's not going to work here, there's just too many problems. 
>> Romney needed help so he rallied an old friend from bain capital, fraser bullock, to be the games chief operating officer. 
>> Mitt did describe it as stepping into an empty elevator shaft because you're falling and you're not sure when you will hit ground. 
>> Bullock joined the team that tried to do damage control. They created an operating plan, tried to convince sponsors to stay on board and took a critical look at the nearly $400 million budget deficit staring them in the face. And even got rid of the usual catering at olympic board meetings. 
>> We had domino's pizza, and it was a dollar a slice. Because he knew he could buy a pizza for five bucks, cut it into eight slices, sell them for a dollar a slice, get $8 of revenue for every pizza at a cost of $5. He turned the lunches from a cost center into a profit center. 
>> The olympics is like putting on seven super bowls a day for 17 days straight. 
>> And he became the public face of the games, even becoming an amateur participant, seen here on the skeleton. So did he say one day, I think I'm going to try the skeleton? 
>> Yeah. He said, I'm going to go try this. He got better and better and better so he could get going 70 miles an hour, which is crazy. 
>> But hidden from the public was the continuing personal struggle. 

[01:05:53]


>> Mitt was always just constantly worried about ann. She was really deteriorating. 
>> And she battled through it. She got good help from wonderful physicians. 
>> By august of 2001, it looked like they had ann's m.S. And the olympics under control. But then -- 9/11. 
>> -- Billowing into the sky. 
>> There's smoke everywhere. 
>> Unspeakable sorrow and a very real fear of terrorism at the olympics. 
>> It's a time for us to make sure that everyo in the world recognizes that we don't stop as a nation, that the characteristics of honor and courage, sacrifice and devotion, which is represented by the olympic athletes, is a message more important today than perhaps everefore. 
>> Over the next five months and with the help of some money from the federal government, security was beefed up. And the games began. 
>> We had about 2,500 athletes that came in, did the parade of nations, walked all the way around. 
>> It was a great moment for him, I think. As one political pollster in utah said at the time, mitt romney could walk on water at that point. 
>> But not everyone agreed. 
>> Mitt and I often had disagreements about how or what we thought the games were about. And I wasn't on his team, so to speak. 
>> It's a gold medal day for utah. 
>> Ken bullock relation to frazier bullock, was on the organizing committee of the salt lake citolympics before and after romney was brought on board. He was a sort of my way or the highway kind of guy? 
>> Absolutely, no question. To me, the games were about utah. It wasn't about mitt. 
>> Bullock claims romney made the problems look worse than they really were, a calculated political move to ensure public success. 

[01:07:53]


>> Did we need to raise revenue? Were we short? Yes. Were we three years out? Yes. Big difference of the games being around the corner. 
>> So you think he overstated the problems? 
>> Dramatically. Dramatically. 
>> It's a charge the romney camp scoffs at. And in the end, the 2002 olympics were profitable and one of the most successful winter games in history. 
>> He had pulled off this big success. He had rescued these games. And now it was a question of what he would parlay that into. 
>> It wouldn't take long for that question to be answered. Pf. ?????? ?????? ?????? Hi dad. Many years from now, when the Subaru is theirs... Hey.

[01:12:16]


>>> The opening ceremonies for the 2002 winter olympics were still more than a month away, but mitt romney already had other plans. Beth myers remembers getting a call from romney in january. 
>> I'm thinking about running for governor, and would you have any interest in helping me run my cpaign? 
>> Massachusetts had a republican governor, jane swift, but party leaders saw her as weak so they came to romney in a panic. 
>> Jane swift gets wind of this, and two days later she bows out. So she's out and mitt romney is in. He flies back to belmont with his wife, ann, they're both wearing olympic jackets and give a press conference, and the campaign's begun. 
>> Romney's campaign spokesman. Was like being launched out of a rocket. 
>> How you doing? 
>> As you know, this is a very democratic state. The legislature is 85% democrat. Very few republicans make it into statewide office. So we had a fight on our hands. 
>> He ran as a moderate on social issues, vowing to clean up state government. 
>> Would you raise your right hand, please? 
>> It worked. 
>> Congratulations, governor. 
>> Thank you. 
>> From the beginning, romney relied on a small set of advisors. Beth myers, who has never spoken on camera before, was chief of staff. 
>> People call you romney's romney. 
>> For four years, we sat in offices that had a door between us and we popped back and forth between each other's offices all day long. We talked about faith. We talked about the issues of the day. 
>> First order of business, treat government like a business. 
>> We had a huge budget deficit so every morning we'd come in and we'd have stacks and stacks of budget books, and line by line -- and mitt would meet in his staff office every morning with the cabinet secretaries. 

[01:14:24]


>> It was the way he had always done it, at bain, at the olympics. But here not everyone was on romney's team. 
>> I will agree that he was a different cat than what people on beacon hill were used to. I think that's probably a pretty good thing. 
>> I got better over time. I know I made mistakes in how i dealt with others in the legislature, but we started off pretty well. 
>> Then, two years into his term, he set his sights on something bigger, something that would mean a legacy -- health care. 
>> He had not had a major achievement that he could point to as some big political success in a future campaign. He needed something to say, i had done this and it was a big deal. 
>> Romney decided to push for health care to cover everyone in the state, but that meant mandating most residents to buy health insurance. 
>> The governor felt that it would be wrong for the economy and wrong for our business sector to impose a mandate on employers, to require them to provide insurance to their employees. But he felt it very important that people take responsibility for their own health care. 
>> It was romney's big moment. But now a liability. Republicans bitterly oppose any kind of mandate in today's presidential race. 
>> I think the politics of it have been so complicated that it's ironic the biggest thing he achieved as governor is something he almost never talks about. 
>> No less complicated, the politics of abortion. While romney was personally opposed to abortion, he ran for governor supporting abortion rights. But once in office and presented with stem cell legislation that would, in romney's view, have the potential of destroying embryos, he changed his mind. 
>> And I realized that what sounded good in a campaign, when I actually became the governor and was going to be the person who would sign a piece of legislation which could take human life, I simply couldn't do that. 

[01:16:31]


>> Democrats say it was about ambition. 
>> He wanted to run for president of the united states, and he understood that within the republican nominating process, somebody that was pro choice or pro gay rights or anything in terms of a progressive stance would lose. 
>> I didn't ever see it flip-flop. I think that what you saw was the tension between personal beliefs and a public persona. 
>> None of this would slow romney down. His sights were already set on the white house in 2008. But there were doubts about his convictions and questions about his mormon faith, a religion some evangelicals call a cult. 
>> Mormonism is the most colorful and controversial, politically toxic and dangerous because people pull out strands and skewer them. 
>> There was no avoiding it, though, so romney decided to give a crucial speech on his faith early in the primaries. 
>> He wrote it. He really wrote every word. 
>> He wrote every word of it. I mean, you very rarery hear that about a politician. 
>> He did. 
>> I am an american running for president. I do not define my candidacy by my religion. A person should not be elected because of his faith nor should he be rejected because of his faith. 
>> Ultimately, 2008 was not mitt romney's year. IT WAS john McCain's. A brutal loss for romney and his family. 
>> I feel I have to now stand aside. 
>> For me, I was like, that's it, okay, we did that. That's fine. Never again.

[01:21:06]


>>> You guys are great. Almost but not quite. 
>> I will never do this again. And I just made sure it was very emphatic. 
>> The romney family seemed done with politics and didn't keep it a secret. 
>> It was again a very bruising thing. I think people forget that these are real families, the people they love that are going through these hard times. It was a change of heart. I learned how to not absorb is negative things and realize that it was worth pursuing. 
>> I'm mitt romney, I believe in america and I am running for president of the united states. Romney had one driving message. And have the experience to get our economy back on track. That is the kind of leader i aspire to be.

>> I want to hear what he that is -- he has to say on the topic. 
>> But it's about telling a story of who you are, that you believe and why you can be trusted. 
>> He is professional. He has a bit of new england in him. Had he is outdoing a job, he will do it professionally. S he is a very warm caring guy. 
>> He had warm personal stories about his church and family life. 
>> All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. 

[01:25:32]


>> But then, in september, a secret tape recording of romney in a private fundraiser raised new questions about who romney really cares about. 
>> There are 47% who are with him. My job is not to worry about those people. 
>> Romney painted had his own unflattering picture and the damage endured. 
>> His problem during this campaign, if you look at the polls is that a significant majority of people do not believe he understands their problems. And when he talked about the 47%, that only seemed to compound that problem. 
>> I think the first and most important thing to recognize that, it's not a accurate perception, that he is obviously running for 100% of the americans. 
>> The first presidential debate became t st important job interview of romney's career. A moment for him to fix things. 
>> As soon as he gets on stage, the first thing he does, takes off his watch and puts it on the podium. But then he writes dad on the piece of paper. Um, and that is amazing, because he loves his dad, respects his dad. Doesn't want to do anything that would not make his father proud and just a reminder, that yes, I'm here. But dad, I love and respect who you are, what you have taught me, what kind of a person you are and I'm going to honor that. 
>> Middle income families are being crushed. 
>> Romney attacked and obama wilted. 
>> You have been president four years and you said you would cut the deficit in half and it's now four years later and we will trillion dollar deficit. And it was a recasting of romney. 
>> Regulation is essential. 
>> Opening the door for the opposition to ask, who is the real romney? 

[01:27:35]


>> We have to name this condition that he is going through. I think -- I think it's called romnesia. 
>> People say you are out of touch, you keep secrets. You play by a different set of rules. 
>> I know that the obama campaign will do everything that they can to try and deflect from the economic record of the president. And his failure to come up with a plan to get the economy going in the future. 
>> No doubt, romney is on message this time. He wants us to believe he can fix things like the economy. And won't give up until he does. But that's the easy part of his story. The rest is harder to tell. He is a devout momon and more private than public, and in the end more cautious than candid, the ultimate lesson, mitt romney, learned from his father's life. 
>> He cared about the mission he was fighting for and winning and losing did not change his perspective of who he was. He has been defined as a man of character throughout his life and elections do not change that. 
>> Do you feel that way as you look at the election, win or lose? 
>> Absolutely. This is a choice that is up to the american people, a who i am has long ago been decided by my wife, sons, and grandkids and daughters in law and the people who know me best. 
>> A candidate of hope. We have chosen hope over fear. Inherits a nation in crisis. 

[01:29:36]


>> The briefing was chilling. 
>> My first job was making sure we were not going get into a great depression. 
>> A leader driven to change history. 
>> He just doesn't want to be another president. He wanted to be a great president.

>>> well, welcome back, we're telling your stories this half hour, sharing some very compelling video and pictures from our ireporters, josh levs is here to bring images. 
>> You know, this is modern technology meets mother nature. We have people capturing this, we just got a message, hoping that everybody is safe, sound, a lot of people are still suffering. Our reporters went out through stricken areas, documenting who life is like. 
>> This is a line for gas, and it started way, way back there. This is absurd, oh, my god, I'm not getting gas, there is no way I'm getting gas. 
>> We are walking the 59th bridge in new york city back from work. We have had about a three mile walk both ways. But it is just what new yorkers do. We're coming from queens, going back to our home in long island. We're not the only ones, every which way you look, everybody is doing their own thing. 
>> There is no traffic cops, not good, not good. 
>> This is what is in front of our building, that is my building in the back. This went all the way through the building. There is no fences left. 

[00:11:10]


>> I'm a train operator, I'm supposed to report here. And it is a ghost town. This is cone island station. Normally it is hustle, bustle here, nothing but muck on the street level. 
>> Still windy, the big ship -- 
>> as you can see behind me, we have downed trees. The only thing this weather is good for is making snowballs. 
>> The fire crew does not know what happened but there is some thick, black smoke coming out of the ground behind me. And as you can see, the fire crew is back there at york avenue. Everybody is gathered together. And more emergency responders are arriving. 
>> Oh, the kids did not want to miss halloween, at all. 
>> That was from our reporter, ed cohen, who saw all the kids going ahead. There was a massive tree that fell, but there were still kids, it was still halloween where they could still celebrate halloween, it was just a beautiful shot. 
>> So how do we pick those? 

[00:13:10]


>> I said, well, going into it, life has gotten better every day. 
>> Incrementally. 
>> Incrementally, that is right, we have an incredible team that is doing this, they get in touch with our reporters. They have to contact them, they have e-mail conversations, sometimes by phone. Sometimes they talk to one person for 45 minutes. They check out the camera, the type of pictures to make sure it is not fake, that it is where they say it is, various other things. So you want you to know there are a lot of steps to submit an ireport here before it comes to you, we have a fantastic team that does that. 
>> And we have a video that kind of set a record. It is the most viewed ireport ever. 
>> It is coming up. I want to tell you about it, imagine being on a cruise all the way up on the 13th floor, when the boat itself starts to tip a little bit. And the furniture slides, water starts to come on board the ship itself. We are going to show you that coming right up. 

[00:17:45]


>>> Our ireporters have been helping us tell the stories of the superstorm sandy and the aftermath. And we've got more than 3,000 reports from the storm, so we tried to put together as many as we could in this 30-minute special. Josh levs here with the sights and sounds. 
>> As you said, more than 3,000, what the editors have done is go in and pick the most compelling reports to tell the story of what this country has been in the past week. This is a striking contrast here, you have trick-or-treaters strolling along the street in brooklyn. The man who took this, luis munoz, says nothing keeps the new yorker down. And one of the pictures from sandy was in chelsea, you may have seen a facade ripped off the building, where our ireporter captured this, showing what was going on at the time. It is about the only time you understand what is going on around the facade of the building, and outside the subway here in manhattan, our ireporter shot this video inside where the pumps were operating. He said there had been at least six feet of water that he was able to see. And if you let the video is go, a few more seconds, the water being pulled out. Let's look at number seven -- 
>> it is amazing how fast they were able to do that, pumping the water out of the subway systems. 
>> And it has been federal, local, and state, so much impressive work. Talk about the impressive work. The employee didn't want to use his name but sent it to us from la guardia. This is the tarmac, where the flights couldn't land. This reminds us why 13,000 flights were cancelled. Take a look at this video. Let's listen. Look at that. 
>> Remnants ohurricane sandy. 
>> That is like michigan, near chicago. Our reporter said the wind was swirling. Peop were stopping to watch these waves. He doesn't ever remember seeing lake michigan this violent with this kind of storm surge. This is just incredible. Look at that. All right, the next one is heartbreaking, folks, let's go to this out of staten island, which, as we know, has been -- he told us about this. 

[00:20:14]


>> This is about half a mile from south beach. And nobody expected the water to go that far. So people in that area didn't even leave, and I had a friend who woke up and the water came running into their house. And that is probably why so many people died in that area. Because nobody expected the water to go that far. 
>> He was actually in sri lanka during that tsunami, and he believes this is similar, just on a smaller scale. Obviously, not the devastation but in terms of water amounts that he saw. The next thing we want to talk about, this is fascinating, a window into how our work goes, jordan shapiro took this at the brooklyn bridge, half with power, half without. We went to extreme efforts to make sure it was real. This is absolutely real, now an iconic shot of the storm. And finally, number three, here is another ireporter who spoke with us, george nicholas, with his fiancee, he spoke to jane velez-mitchell. 
>> I want to show you right now, we opened up the window. And it is really like a massive hurricane out there if you can hear it. It is very, very bad out there rinow. 
>> There is always -- wow. 
>> He got it closed, he is safe. That is very important to know. Don't go to any danger for photos. A photo we showed you all week, the flooded taxis in hoboken, new jersey, our other ireporter captured this from hoboken, and this other is from the cruise ship, take a look. He says they were on the 13th floor, fred. And a lot of areas on the ship got flooded. At one point the furniture went flying. It has an incredible number of views and it is still climbing. So I want you to know, you can see this and a lot more, we have a lot of interactives, I am going to put this on facebook for you. 

[00:22:28]


>> And to have an experience like this. 
>> Torrential. 
>> All right, thanks josh, more parts of of the jersey shore wiped out by superstorm sandy. For so many that spent summer vacations there, this really did hit hard. We're looking back at jersey shore memories, stay right there. Can curlers! Tomato Basil, Potato with bacon... we've got a lot of empty cans. 
[ Male Announcer ] Progresso. You gotta taste thisoup. . 

[00:26:41]


>>> All right, the last 30 minutes we have been sharing with you a lot of unique stories and compelling images that probably a lot of people have not seen. 
>> Right, and the ones we're going to show you right now, brand-new. ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? 
>> standing in line for about five hours, trying to get gas, the whole thing around here is crazy. ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? 

[00:29:42]

>> Sara: Hi. I'm sara moulton. Welcome to sara's weeknight meals. You know, the blt is a lovely classic sandwich. My husband considers, however, an heir of sandwich. I think it's delicious. I love the combo. But in order to get the husband to eat it and consider it dinner, I had to add something significantly large to it, and that is catfish. So I'm gonna start with the tomato part, and we're using plum tomatoes, aka roma tomatoes. But the reason I like these so much is because they've got a higher ratio of substantial tomato to seeds and pulp. So we're gonna slice them and salt them. I almost always salt my tomatoes, whatever I'm doing with them, because you want to get rid of the excess water that's in there, a., and b., Because you want to concentrate the tomato flavor. When you salt them and drain them--we're gonna do it about for 10, 15 minutes-- they get more tomatoey. We use kosher salt. I'm gonna put them on a rack and drain them. I'll do this very quickly. Okay, so our tomatoes are draining. I'm gonna go check my bacon. Now, I'm cooking my bacon my favorite way, which is in the oven. What I do is, I take the bacon, I put it on a rack-- I've got eight slices here-- and then I put the rack on top of the sheet pan. And what's so terrificbout this method--i give it about 12 to 15 minutes-- and what's so terrific about this method is that you notice how flat the bacon is. And this way you don't have fat sputtering all over the stove. So now we're gonna work on the basil mayonnaise. I've got to go get my fresh basil out of the garden. There we go. I love fresh basil. So I'm gonna need about 1/4 of a cup, and I'm gonna do something I never do with basil-- I'm going to abuse it. It needs to be bruised. Usually when I'm talking about herbs, we say, only hit them once with a very sharp knife, 'cause you don't want them to get wet and bruised. In this case, I want them to get bruis. You're gonna see that this mayonnaise is gonna turn bright green and really pick up the flavor of the basil. Okay, that's more than 1/4 of a cup, but who will know the difference? I just love basil. Put the excess over here. Lemon rind. Lemon rind is one of my favorite ingredients. It's very important only to go right down to the white part, meaning don't go through the white part. Get the yellow. 'Cause the white part, this part right here, is bitter, very bitter, and we don't want bitter. We need about 1/2 a teaspoon. And why I use lemon rind is, sometimes you don't want to add the juice, 'cause you don't need the extra liquid. You just want the essence of the flavor, and the rind is great. Now, 3/4 of a cup of mayonnaise. You can use the low-fat, however do not use the no-fat. That's a no-no. 'Cause no-fat has flavor. Okay, pinch of salt and pepper. I'm gonna blend this basil mayonnaise until it's light green, which will take about five minutes with a lot of scraping down. So just be patient. 

[00:05:03]


[blender buzzing] I can see that it's done because it's bright green, as promised. Look at that color. And the flavor is every bit as intense as that color. So we got our basiyonnaise. Now I've got to get my bread crumbs ready for the catfish. We're gonna make homemade fresh bread crumbs. Very easy. You just take homemade style white bread. We need four slices for this. We're looking for about two cups. One slice of bread equals 1/2 a cup. You can do this in a food processor, or you can do it in a blender. It is not rocket science. But it's just, you make them when you need them, you know? T, let's see. Yeah. Gonna put this into a pie plate lined with some parchment. I'm gonna get a 1/4 cup of flour or a 1/3 cup-- doesn't really matter-- and this is gonna be our first line of glue that's gonna stick the crumbs onto the fish. I'm beating one large egg here with just a tiny bit of water to make an egg wash. I'm gonna heat up some olive oil here, 2 tablespoons. Now, catfish is a fish that's been around forever. It's a bottom feeder. But it's pretty tough-- tough cookie. Mostly what you buy is farmed. I mean, that's what you buy and you want to buy. It's farmed. And actually according to the seafood websites that tell you about good sustainable fish, this is an excellent choice. I'm gonna season the fish before I bread it. A little salt and pepper. I'm gonna dip the fish in flour, then the egg wash, then the bread crumbs, and then finally it goes right into the pan. It's gonna take a couple of minutes a side, and the way we know it's done is, we'll be able to stick a knife right through it, and the knife will go through easily. And of course it will be golden and delicious-looking. I've got to pat my tomatoes dry down here. And we pat them dry just so they're not wet in the sandwich. Take a look at my fish and turn it. When you're flipping something in a pan that has a fair amount of oil, tip it like this so the oil goes down to the other side of the pan, that when you flip the fish, there's no oil underneath it, and you will not end up wearing it. Now I'm gonna get my bacon. The blt actually has its origins--it's vaguely related to the club sandwich. And perhaps it has some association with the english tea sandwich. Although it's far less delicate than the english tea sandwich. Okay. I have all my parts. So we're gonna start by putting basil-- the basil mayonnaise-- on both sides of the bread. Our romaine. I'll do three tomatoes two slices of bacon. Okay, we're ready. I'm gonna cut off the little end piece and take the meaty part. Wow. Yikes. I'm not quite sure I can cut this in half. As a matter of fact, I don't think I'm even gonna try. We're just gonna say you have to eat this like this because it's so substantial. And some wonderful vegetable chips. There you have it. FRIED CATFISH BLTs: A fresh take on an old favorite that's pretty darn good, if I do say so myself. I'm gonna make my own version of a barbecued pulled meat sandwich, only I'm gonna use chicken. Let's start with the bread. So we're not using any old bread. We're using homemade beer bread. And this recipe actually comes from a viewer. Her name is debbie bickford. And she sent in this recipe for beer bread, and until she sent it to me, I had no idea how enormously popular it was around the country. Apparently everybody makes beer bread except me. We srt with a stick of butter, we put it into--this is what we're gonna bake the bread in, is this kind of casserole. Pop it in the 350 oven while you're heating it, preheating it. And the butter will melt. Then we're gonna p the bread together over here. So we have three cups of all-purpose flour. If you wanted to, instead of all-purpose flour, all three cups, you could do half whole wheat or half white whole wheat, which is a great thing to do, and especially the white. The kids don't know that you're giving them something healthy. Or you could also substitute half the flour with cornmeal. I'm shaking this in so we're measuring it loosely. I don't think anody should stick their measuring cup in there and just pack it in, and you're getting more flour than you need. This is how I always measure. 3 tablespoons of sugar. 1 tablespoon of baking powder. And a teaspoon of table salt. And we're using table salt. I like to us that in breads and baking because it dissolves much better than kosher salt. Now, we're just gonna stir it up. And I'm gonna grab my beer. Now, what's interesting about the beer in this recipe is, it acts as a leavener. It's sort of like baking soda. It's got all that carbonation. But it also provides flavor. Pick a beer that you like the taste of so you that you can taste the beer of your favorite beer right in the bread. One 12-ounche bottle goes in. Isn't this fun? It's so different. It's sort of lumpy and thick, as you can see. Don't despair. It comes out lumpy. So let me go check on my butter. Oh, yeah, it's melted. I'm gonna pour off 6 tablespoons of butter and save the other 2 to coat the pan. Okay, so now the batter goes into the pan. And it's really thick. Gonna do our best to smoosh it out. You see, it slithers around 'cause of the butter. Okay, now we're gonna pour-- sorry, it's not low-cal. You couluse some ne lean country bread if you wanted to. Pour the remaining butter that you save back. There you go. I'm gonna pop it in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes. It looks, like, terrible, doesn't it? Don't worry. It's gonna be wonderful in the end. Now it's time to make some pickles. So the cheat for the bread is, use store-bought bread. I'm gonna come down and make some homemade pickles, but the cheat for the pickles would be, buy the pickles. But I love--i'm not a pickler. I don't do that. But a quick pickle, meaning one you make and you eat that day or several days later, that's just fine with me. We're using the english cucumber. They say it's seedless, which is a joke. We all know it has seeds, but it does have seeds that are edible. They're so tender. And most of all it has a very thin skin and a very sweet, lovely flavor. Now, I'm using this slicing device. It's a handheld mandolin. Be very careful when you get down towards the blade. Use the protector, or I just use a towel sometimes. So we need about a cup and 1/3. Okay, so let's say we have about a cup and 1/3 in there. We're gonna take some fresh dill. Dill's perfect with cucumbers. Keep your dill, if you can, even in the fridge in some water with the stems down, 'cause it really wilts. Dill is one of those ones that just goes, "uh," almost immediately, as soon as it's picked. We only need a tablespoon. I've got a little more than I need here. To me it sort of tastes like grass with attitude. You know, it's sort of grassy. All right, two tablespoons of cider vinegar. And we put a little bit of sugar in one second. Of course a hefty pinch of salt. Pickles, you know, are a little salty. 1 1/2 teaspoons of sugar. I'm not a huge fan of sugar in everything, but when you're making a pickle that has the acid in there, you really need the sugar to counterbalance it. Need to add a little pepper too. Now, these pickles are ready to go. I'm goa add chicken that I shredded from a rotisserie chicken to my homemade barbecue sauce. You can use store-bought. That's another cheat. You could really make almost noing here if you wanted to, but it's fun to make part of it. I just want to get this nice-- yo a pulled po sandwich is always really goopy and sloppy, so I'm gonna just make sure we have lots of sauce in here. So while I'm heating up the chicken, I'm gonna make myself some homemade ginger ale. I've got my homemade ginger syrup. All il did was take some fresh ginger, chopped it up, add it with a little sugar and water, and simmered it till it looked like this. You can make a jar of this and just keep it in the fridge and use it all week long. Okay, time for soda. Let's make some. I love soda. I love it all year round, but it's especially wond in the summertime. You know, it's just the perfect drink. 

[00:15:51]


[soda maker buzzing] Okay. 
[soda maker hisses] Top it off. And then this was filtered water, so it's just gonna be so delicious. Oh, okay. Mm. Let's assemble the sandwich. I'm gonna start with the bread. Make myself the perfect sandwich. First we're gonna put on some of our barbecue chicken. Be generous. I mean, after all, it is chicken. Some of our pickle. Oh, wow. There you go. And I've got some coleslaw to serve with it. Put some right on the plate. You notice we didn't do a mayonnaise base. We kept it nice and light. Mm. All right. Mm. Homemade beer bread really takes the sandwich over the top, and those quick cucumber pickles add a little crunch to my sweet pulled chicken barbecue sandwich. 
>> ?????? You know what ?????? ?????? I'm looking for ?????? ?????? and it's cold chicken ?????? ?????? and coleslaw ?????? 
>> Sara: How are the eggplants? 
>> They're great. 
[indistinct conversation] 

[00:17:57]


>> Sara: The star of the next sandwich I'm making, which is a grilvegetable sandwich with cheese, is the cheese, 'cause it's homemade ricotta cheese. The first time I ever made it was at gourmetmagazine. It's a recipe from the magazine from the creative director named richard ferretti. He made it all the time with his family. And it's a complete magic trick, and it's so ridiculously simple. But let's start with the vegetables first. I'm grilling them. You could roast . Just get the oven at 400 degrees and throw them in, brushed with a little olive oil, salt and pepper like I'm doing here for the grill. What you want to do is just cook them so that all th natural sugars come out so they caramelize. And that will happen either on the grill or in the oven. I meanwhile have also put into the oven a little package of garlic cloves. I want to roast them so they get nice and sweet, and we're gonna mash that and add that to the ricotta. So hgo my tomatoes. 
[grill hissing] And I'm gonna just take off these other vegetables. I've got zucchini and eggplant and tomatoes. You can use whatever vegetables you can find that are in season that day. There we go. Okay. So here's what goes into the cheese. Four ingredients. I've already got a quart of milk in there. I'm now gonna add 1/2 a cup of heavy cream. A little bit of salt, like1/4 teaspoon, woul good. That's kosher salt. Now, we're gonna bring this up somewhat slowly to a full rolling boil. Stir it so it doesn't scorch on the bottom, 'cause that can happen with dairy products. Now, you may be wondering, "why is she using such a deep pan for sotle liquid?" It's because when the milk boils--i don't know if this has ever happened for you-- it comes up and goes over the top. We don't want that to happen. I've got my lemons down here that I nuked. It's my favorite way to get the juice out. And we want about a tablespoon and 1/2 or 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Out of this whole recipe, with all that milk and all that cream, you only end up with about a cup of ricotta. But, oh, boy, it is e best ricotta you will ever taste. And you made it. Okay, so let that come up to a boil. Just have to be patient. Let's see how my tomatoes are doing. All right, as soon as you start to see it come up, stir in the lemon juice. And turn it down. Okay. See what happens? Look at that. Doesn't that look awful? 

[00:20:59]


[laughs] But that's what you want it to look like you're seeing the curds. Now we just let it simmer for a minute, and then we're gonna rain it. If you get no curds, add more lemon juice I've set up a very deep bowl here. It's lined with a strainer that's lined with some cheesecloth. You could certainly use just a dampened paper towel if you wanted to. That would be fine too. And we're gonna let this drain for about 10 or 15 minutes. The longer you drain it, the tighter it gets, the more structure it has. If you eat it right away, it's very, very creamy and soft. Right now you can see what it's like. See, it's very, very soft. I think I'm only gonna give this, like, five more minutes 'cause it's draining so quickly. Let me go get my garlic. I'm gonna mash it up 'cause I'm gonna flavor it with a little mashed garlic. You could leave the garlic out, but I just think it's a nice addition. And when you roast garlic like this in foil in an oven, it just gets so wonderfully-- whoops, it is hot-- so wonderfully creamy and sort of sweet. It's not that intense garlic, which, you know, some people, it's just too much. Just really nice. Just gonna cut it in half so I can squeeze it out. I could have roasted it ahead of time and cooled it off, which would have actually made my life much easier than using my asbestos fingers here. So I'm gonna add that to here, but before I do, I just want to pause and show you-- look at all that liquid. There's some more still coming out of it. You can use that liquid in baking sort of where you would have used milk. You don't have to throw it out. Plop this right into the bowl with our garlic. Wow. This ricotta will keep in the fridge for a couple of days. It's fresh, so eat it while it's fresh. And we're ready to assemble our sandwich. Like, for each sandwich we'rgonna want about 1/4 cup of this, 'cause this is about a cup. Beautiful rustic whole-grain bread. Vegetables--i'm gonna put a little bit of everything. This is a vegetable dagwood. Why not? Oh, boy. Whoa. And to go with this, I've toasted off some kale leaves so they become like chips. You see this--some kale leaves and some parsnips. These are parsnips that you just slice on a mandolin. You can even slice them with a peele then toss them with olive oil, salt, and pepp and pop them in the oven. I'm gonna take this ou it's a beautiful day. A well-constructed sandwich is a satisfying solution for a wonderful weeknight meal. Put any number of healthy ingredients between two slices of bread, and dinner is served. I'm sara moulton. See you next time for more of sara's weeknight. Sara's weeknight meals continues online.

- Hi. I'm murray from sesame street, and I'm looking for the word on the street. What's the word on the street? 
- Veterinarian. 
- What is a veterinarian? 
- It's like a doctor that helps animals.

- Oh, I'm playing a game with my pet rock rocco. 

[00:04:03]


- Zo rocco's playing a game? But rocco's just a rock. 
- Well, yeah, that's why he's perfect for the rock and roll game. 
- The rock and roll game? 
- Yeah! The game where you take a rock and you roll it to see how far it goes. 
- Oh. 
- Yeah. It's fun. You want to play? 
- Oh, sure, elmo will try. 
- Ok, good. I'll go first. 
- Ok. 
- Could you give us some room, elmo? 
- Oh, ok, ok. There you go. 
- Ok, rocco, time to roll! 
- Who ho, cool! 
- Look. I--i rolled rocco all the way to the mailbox. 
- Yeah, good one, zoe! Ooh, now is it elmo's turn? 
- Yeah, yeah. 
- Oh, good! Ha ha ha! 
- Oh, hi, everybody. Hi, zoe. 
- Hi, bob. Hi, barkley. Hey, bob, do you know about the rock and roll game? 
- Oh, well, I was in a band once-- 
- oh, no. Ha ha ha! Not that kind of rock and roll, bob. 
- No 
- the kind where you take a rock... 
- Oh, and you roll it like this. 
- Oh. 
- Wow, elmo. 
- Yeah! 
- You rolled rocco past the mailbox. That's farther than I rolled him. 
- Zoe's right. Ooh, this game is cool. 
- Yeah! I told you. 
- Barkley, hold up! Barkley, buddy. 
[Woof] barkley. Barkley. 
[Growling] don't worry, zoe. I'll get rocco for you. Barkley, sit. Now give it to me. 
[Whimper] good dog. Ah, it's a little wet, zoe, but I think rocco is just fine. Here you go. 
- Oh, rocco. Are you all right, rocco? 
[Woof] 
- you know, zoe, barkley didn't know that rocco was your pet rock. He just thought you were playing fetch or something. 
- It's ok, barkley. Right, zoe? 
- Well, I guess. 
- Ok, barkley, I'm coming. Hey, have fun with your rock and roll game, guys. See you later. 
- Thanks, bob. Bye. It's zoe's turn to roll rocco now. 

[00:06:05]


- Well...Rocco doesn't want to play here anymore, elmo. 
- Well, why? Why, zoe? Why? 
- You see any dogs, rocco? Me, neither. 
- What's zoe doing? 
- Rocco says we can play here. 
- But--oh, ok. 
[Dogs barking] 
- stop! Stop! I'm talking to you! Oh. This dog walking job is a real workout. Hello, my fellow monster friends. 
- Rocco says we got to go. 
- But-- 
- was it something I said? 
- Elmo doesn't think so, grover. But why does zoe keep doing that? Zoe! 
- Huh? Oh, well. What do you say, doggies? Once more around the parrrrr... 
- Whew. No dogs here, rocco. 
- [Panting] zoe, will you please stop running away? Elmo really wants to play the rock and roll game. 
- Ok. Rocco says this is good place to play. 
- Finally. 
[Woof] who's there? 
- On second thought, got to go! 
- Zoe, where you going now? Wait a minute. Every time zoe sees a dog, she leaves. Hey! Zoe's afraid of dogs. Zoe! 
- Any dogs around, rocco? 
- Hey, zoe, elmo knows why zoe keeps leaving. 
- You do? Why? 
- Because zoe is afraid of dogs. 
- No, no, no, no, no. It's not me. I'm not afraid. 
- Well, then why does zoe leave every time a dog comes along? 
- Well, because rocco is afraid of dogs, elmo. 
- Rocco? 
- Yeah. Look at him. He's shaking. 
- Zoe! Zoe! Rocco can't shake. He's just a rock. 
- A rock who's afraid of dogs. 
- Ok, ok. Rocco's afraid. 
- Right. 

[00:08:05]


- Well, maybe elmo can help rocco to not be afraid anymore. 
- Hmm. What do you think, rocco? Oh. Rocco says you can try. 
- Great! Elmo an idea. Elmo will be right back. 
- I wonder what elmo's going to do, rocco. 
- Zoe. Zoe? Elmo would like you to meet--come on in, kyle. Come on in. Would like you to meet kyle, mr. Mark, and puna. 
- Hi. Uh, elmo? Elmo? Puna's a dog. Rocco wants to go. 
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, rocco. Look, look, look. Puna--puna is puso a dancer, like zoe, see? See the tutu? 
- Ohh. - See? 
- Puna's wearing a tutu, just like me. 
- [Giggles] 
- what's that, rocco? Rocco says puna is really cute. 
- So rocco is not afraid of dogs anymore. 
[Arf arf] 
- ooh, rocco doesn't like the barking! 
- But--zoe! Oh. Well, thanks. Thanks, mr. Mark. Thanks, kyle. Thanks, puna. Thank you. Thank you for your help. 
- Bye. 
- Zoe! Oh. Zoe, what happened? 
- Hey, elmo. What's up? 
- Hey, gina. Well, zoe's hiding because she's afraid of-- 
- no. Rocco. 
- Right. Rocco is afraid of dogs. 
- Oh well, maybe zo--rocco--maybe rocco and i should have a little talk, because, you know, I do know a lot about dogs. 
- Oh, yeah, yeah! Gina's an animal doctor, a veterinari... 
- A veterinarian. Very good, elmo. That's right. Yeah. I meet new dogs every day. 
- Really? 
- Really. Yeah. Does--does rocco know how to meet a new dog? 
- I don't think so. 
- Oh! Ok, well, zoe, I could teach you. It's a very important thing to know. So, ok, elmo, can you pretend to be a dog? 
- Ok. 
- Great. Ok. Come here, doggie. 

[00:10:06]


- [Barking] 
- come on, doggie. Here you go. Very, very good. Ok. Now, zoe? Ok. Good. Shh. Shh. One second. You and rocco just make believe that elmo's my dog and we're just out walking, ok? Ready? Here we are. ?????? La, la, walking, walking my dog ?????? 
- dog elmo loves to walk. Woof woof woof woof. 
- Look, rocco, a dog. Yeah. Now what, gina? 
- Oh. Ok. Now you ask the dog's owner-- that's me--ask the dog's owner if it's ok for you to meet his dog. 
- Ok. Gina, is it ok to meet your doggie? 
- Oh. Why, yes, zoe, my dog is very friendly and loves to meet new people. 
- Well, what about pet rocks? 
- Ah, yes, pet rocks, too. 
- Too. Ok. Well, what's next? 
- Well, now--ready for this? You take your fist... 
- Uh- huh. 
- And you roll it in a ball like this. - ok. 
- Ok? And then you very, very slowly put it towards the dos nose... 
- Yeah. 
- So the dog can sniff it. See? Very good. 
- Woof woof! 
- There you go, yeah. See? 
- Smelling it, yeah. 
- That's how dogs get to know you. They use their noses. And sometimes they'll even lick you. 
- Really? Ok. 
- Go ahead. Go ahead. Try. There you go. Good. 
- Ha ha ha! 
- Very good! Ok, you can even scratch the doggie under his chin a litt bit. 
- Really? Scratch him? Ok. 
- Most dogs love that. Go ahead. 
- Good doggie. Good doggie. 
- Ha ha ha! Woof woof! Woof woof! 
- He's a sweet doggie. 
- Yes, he is. And there you go, zoe. You just met a new dog. Come on. Come on. 
- What's that? What's that, rocco? Oh. Rocco says he's not afraid of elmo doggie. 
- Oh! Yes! 
- But how about a real dog? Here comes bob and barkley. 
- What? Oh, no. No. 
- Oh. It's all right, zoe. Rocco knows how to meet a new dog now. 
- Yeah? 
- Yeah. 
- Oh, hi, everybody. 

[00:12:07]


- Hey! - Hey! Ha ha ha! 
- Ok. Are you ready, zoe? 
- Are you ready, rocco? Ok. We're ready. 
- Ok. So do you remember what hap first? 
- Um, yeah. First, I ask the doggie's owner, bob. Rocco wants to know if it's ok for him to meet your dog. 
- Oh, definitely. He's a very friendly dog. 
- But, bob, he barked loudly at rocco before. 
- Yeah, well, I know sometimes his barks get a little loud when he's excited, but he's still very friendly. 
- Yeah, barkley's always friendly to elmo. 
- Ok. Do you remember what happens next? 
- Um, yeah, but rocco doesn't have any hands, so I guess I'll do it for him. 
- Ok. 
- I make a little fist, and I hold it out for barkley to sniff. 
- Very good. 
- It tickles! 
- Oh, wow. Ok. And--and now? 
- Now, i--i scratch barkley under the chin. 
- Yeah. 
- Ah! Barkley loves that. 
- That's great. Zoe, do you want to try asking barkley to sit? 
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Barkley, sit. He did! Look. He did it. He did it. 
- Good, good. Now ask him to give you his paw. 
- Ok. Give me your paw, barkley. He's shaking my hand! 
- Aww! 
- I'm not afraid! I--i mean, rocco's not afraid anymore. 
- Oh, yay! 
- Zoe? - Yeah? 
- Would you like to hold barkley's leash while we take him for a walk? 
- Ooh. You think I could? 
- Sure, absolutely. 
- Yeah! Let's all go for a walk with barkley. 
- Elmo's down for that. Ooh, what about rocco? 
- Oh. Rocco says, what are we waiting for? Let's go!

[Ruff] imagine? 
[Ruff] imagine that. 
- I was on the case looking for the letter of the day. Who am i? I am i, private i. 
[Thinking] I didn't know what the letter of the day was, but I knew I had to find it. So I started to investigate. 
- [Slurp] 
- suddenly I heard something in the shadows. I shined my light on it, and what did I see? 
- [Slurp] 
- an iguana--my first clue. 
[Thinking] but there was more. 
- [Slurping] 
- he's eating ice cream. An iguana eating ice cream--interesting. 
[Thinking] I was on to something, but what? Just then, I heard another sound. 
- Buzz buzz. Oh, buzz. Buzz buzz. 
- Aah! Your incandescent instrument is irritating my irises! 

[00:22:24]


- Buzz buzz. Oh, buzz buzz buzz. Buzz. Buzz buzz buzz. Buzz buzz. 
- It's an insect. 
[Thinking] could this insect help me find the letter of the day? Did itthe buzz on the street? 
- Oh, buzz. Buzz. Buzz. 
- If he did, he wasn't talking. 
[Ding] just then, I got an idea. I put together all my clues. Iguana, ice cream, insect. What do all these clues have in common? 
[Thinking] I was stumped. 
[Knock knock] just then, I heard a knock at the door. It was my girl, iris. 
- Hello, i. 
- Hello, iris. I am sorry I don't have time for chitchat. I have to find the letter of the day. 
- "I." - Yes, iris? 
- "I." - What, iris? 
- "I." 
- Do you have something to say? Do you know what the letter of the day is? 
- "I." Do I have to spell it out for you? 
- [Thinking] and there it was... The letter of the day. "I" was right in front of my own eyes. Me, myself, i. The letter of the day was "i." Well, another case solved by i, private i. 
- I-yi-yi-yi-i.

- Aw. - Welcome to our class. We're just about to have lunch. 
- Aw. Look at this. My mommy just packed me a little sandwich. 
- Whoa, ohh! 
[Thump] 
- blogg, that's not little. It's huge! 
- Well, I'm really hungry, so I wish it was even more huge. I wish I cout take my wand and go zippity, zappity, munchity, munch! I want a really humongous lunch! 
- Ouch. 
- Wow! 
- What in the world? 
- It's a humongous lunchbox! 
- Oh, boy! And I bet it's filled with huge, delicious food. Let's check it out! 
- Hold on, blogg. This lunchbox doesn't belong to you. It belongs to pandora. 
[Gasp] oh, by. Pandora's lunchbox. Whatever you do, do not open it. 
- Why? 
- No time to explain. I must get ahold of pandora right away, and remember, don't open that lunchbox! 

[00:26:28]


- What, here? 
- Blogg! 
- Aw, come on, guys. Something gigantically good could be inhere. 
- Or something terrible. Whoa, whoa! 
- Whoa! Where's gonnigan? 
- He's gone again. 
- Aha! Now I can open the lunchbox! 
- Noooo! 
- Oh! Look! The box opened a little. 
- Ohh. What's gonna happen now? 
- Eh, you guys are worried about nothing. Uh-oh! - Yow! Whoa! Whoa! Eek! Ohh. 
- Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! 
- Hey! Would you-- whoa! 
- Well, I got ahold of pandora--oh, dear me. You opened pandora's lunchbox. 
- And the food has gone bananas! Err. 
- How do we get these things back inside, mrs. Sparklenose? 
- I don't know, gonnigan. Perhaps we should investigate the inside of the lunchbox and see if we find any clues. 
- Look! Ere's some shapes down there. 
- Ooh, yeah! A rectangle, a circle, and a--what's that other shape? 
- That is called a hexagon because it has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sides. 
- Aah! But what could those shapes...Have to do with all this crazy food? 
- Yeah. None of it is shaped like that. 
- Ah, but look closer, fairies. Maybe there's something about the food that matches those shapes. 
- How? 
- I think this calls for a twinkle think. 
- Aw, not that again. 

[00:28:30]


- Come on, blogg. Just think about tjuice box. 
- Ow! Ohh, I can't think. I got juice in my eye! 
- Oh, hey. I wonder what would happen iwe pulled out that straw. 
- Look. It's got 2 long sideand 2 short sides. It's a rectangle. 
- What are we waiting for? Let's get that straw! 
- Oh! 
- Unh! 
- Serpentine, serpentine. 
- Ohh! 
- Boy, that juice box makes me so mad! I'd love to knock it over! 
- Blogg, that's a great idea. Maybe if we knock it over the straw will fall out. Come on! Let's all get on this side--oh--and duck! Now push! Unh! 
- Yay! - Look. The juice box is now a rectangle. 
- Oh, yeah! We did it! - We did it! Wing whack! 
- Great job, fairies. Now let's go see what shapes are left. 
- Well, there's a circle and, uh, what's that strange shape called again? 
- A hexagon. 
- Because it has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sides. 
- Ouch! Hey! Watch it! 
- That wrap isn't like either of those shapes. 
- Remember, look closely at the food to find the shape. 
- We better twinkle think again. 
- I knew that was coming. 
- How can we find a shape in this wrap? 
- Oh! I know! Maybe if we unwrap it there will be shapes hidden inside. 
- Yeah! 
- Then come on! Let's unwrap that wrap. 

[00:30:36]


- Aha! Gotcha! Ohh! Unh! Eww! Yuck! This wrap is fulof beans! 
- Don't worry, abby. I got it. It got me! 
- Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! 
- I'm getting woozy. 
- Me, too. 
- How do I stop this thing? 
- The wall, gonnigan! Aim it towards the wall. 
- I'll try. 
- Oh, look! The wrap itself is... 
- A circle! 
- Yay! - We got another one! 
- Nice work, fairies. Only one shape left. 
- Um, what's that shape called again? 
- A hexagon. 
- Because it has... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sides. 
- Ah. But these tortilla chips only have 1, 2--ohh--3 sides. 
- Yeah. That means they're triangles, not hexagons. 
- Hmm. Let's twinkle think. H. Again? 
- How can we use these tortilla chips to make a hexagon? 
- Uh-uh. That's noa hexagon. Uh-uh. That's definitely not a hexagon. 
- That's it!1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sides! 
- A hexagon! 
- What are we waiting for? Let's grab those chips and make a hexagon. Ugh! There. Gotcha! 

[00:32:41]


- A hexagon! Yay! We did it! 
- Ha ha! 
- Excellent, class, excellent! 
[Rumbling]

[00:36:58]


- Well, happy to do it, ma'am. Hi, buttercup. She friendly? 
- Oh, yes! Extremely, but she seems a teensy bit sad lately. 
- Aw. 
- She always stays in the yard, but I'm having new grass planted, so be careful out there. She's such a delicate doggy. Here are her special doggy treats. It's the only thing she'll eat. 
- No problem, ma'am. She'll be safe with us. We promise. 
- Come on, buttercup. 
[Sigh] gee. I wonder what would cheer her up, bert. 
[Barks] 
- gee, buttercup. It's just a squirrel. Haven't you ever seen a squirrel before? 
- Buttercup, is this the first time you've ever been out of your yard? 
[Barking] 
- ohh! Oh, no! She got away! 
- Aw. Come on. We can't lose her! 
- No, not the fountain! 
[Panting] 
- gee. Looks like a whole new hairdo for you, buttercup. 
- Uh-oh. I hope ms. Ostrich isn't mad when she sees her. 
[Coo] 
- oh, look, bert. A pigeon. 
- No, buttercup. Stay. 
- Aah! 
[Barking] 
- hold on, ernie! We can't lose her again! 
- Don't worry. She's fine! Attagirl, buttercup. Gee, bert. She looks happier now. Maybe she just needed to get outside and play. 
- Maybe, ernie, but she must be getting hungry from all this exercise. Here, buttercup. Have one of your special doggy treats. 
[Barking] hey! 

[00:38:59]


- My frankfurter! 
[Baa]

[Barking] well, don't be, my dears. I haven't seen my darling buttercup this happy in years, right, pinky? What's a little dirt when you're having fun? Hoo hoo hoo! 
- That's what I always say.

[Clock ticking] 
- good night, bert. 
- Good night, ernie. Uh-oh. 
- [Snoring] 
- it's almost time for "elmo: The musical," but right now, we're gonna make a kimchi taco with our friend eddie. Ok, eddie, what do we do first? 

[00:41:04]


- First you have to grab a tortilla and a boat. 
- Ok, gonna grab the boat and a tortilla. I think I'll go for the beef right there. 
- Then you got to add the salsa fresca. 
- Ok, put a little spoonful of that right there. We might need some extra tortillas. Hey, ovejita! Put on some more tortillas! 
- Muy bien. Mas tortillas! 
- So now we've got to add our kimchi. 
- Ok. I'll get the red kimchi right here. 
- And then lastly, I've got 4 different sauces to choose from. 
- Ooh! I want to go for the spicy one. Right there. And how's that? 
- Voila. It looks beautiful. 
- Wow! I made a kimchi taco! Boy, meeting people in the neighborhood sure is delicious. Right now, check this out. 
- ?????? I'm a veggie you all know ?????? ?????? underneath the ground I grow ?????? ?????? orange, white, also blue, all these colors, it is true ?????? ?????? you can eat me many ways ?????? ?????? mashed or boiled on different days ?????? ?????? scalloped, stuffed, or just plain baked ?????? ?????? I'm the one you love to taste ?????? potatoes. 
- Ohh. What do you have to do to get service in this place? 
- Hello there, sir. 
- Oh, no, not you. 
- Yes, sir, it is i, grover, your rhyming waiter. 
- My what? 
- Your rhyming waiter. Today is rhyming day at charlie's. Whatever you pick to eat, I will rhyme it, and then you will get it. Get it? 
- Yes, I get it, but what's the reason? 
- Oh, no reason, just rhyme. For example, let us say you order some cheese. I would think of a word that sounds like cheese-- for instance, uh...Ooh, that is a toughie. Uh, cheese... 
- Oh, please. 
- Very good, sir! Please rhymes with cheese, yes, but I am the rhyming waiter, not you. So I have to think of a rhyme for cheese, or you cannot get your cheese. Cheese, cheese, cheese... 
- I don't want cheese. 
- Well, then why am I trying to rhyme it? 
- All I want is a tuna on rye. 

[00:43:05]


- Oh. Well, all right, tuna on rye. The customer has changed his mind. Not a problem. I will just think of a word that rhymes with rye. Rye. Rye, rye. Uh... 
- Ohh. Sigh. Tie. Lie. Cry! 
- Oh. All of those words do rhyme with rye, sir, but I have to do the rhyming, remember? It is my job. 
- Why do I come here? Why? 
- Why rhymes, too, but I did not think of it. Rye, rye, rye. You would think this would be as easy as apple pie. 
[Sigh] 
- you did it. - Did what, sir? 
- You rhymed pie with rye. Rye and pie sound the same. 
- Oh, I am a poet, and I do not even know it. Oh! I did it again. Did you see that? 
- I'm hungry! 
- Yes, of course, sir. The customer is always right. I will be right back with your order. 
- Oh, at last. 
- Mmm-mm. Oh, this looks so tasty. Here you are, sir, one hot slice of apple pie. 
- I didn't order apple pie. I ordered tuna on rye! The pie rhymed with the rye. 
- Oh, I am so sorry, sir. Ohh. It is not easy being a poet. I think it was shelley who once said-- 
- just bring me my lunch, please! 
- Yes, sir, with pleasure. 
- Ohh. Wherever I go, he's always there. 
- Ok, charlie, whatever you say. 
[Sigh] I am sorry, sir, but we are all out of tuna on rye. 
- Ohh... 
- Perhaps you should not have waited so long to order. 
- [Grunting] all right. Just bring me a cheeseburger. 
- Yes, sir. One cheeseburger, sir, coming right up, sir! Now, what rhymes with cheeseburger? 
- Ohh... 
- No, do not help me. I have to do this myself. This should be easy. Cheeseburger. Mmm...Linoleum.

>> MING: Today's technique, thickening. Now, there's many different ways of thickening, but I'm going to go over four major ways right now. Here we have some cherry cranberry juice, right? Liquidy. See that? When you reduce it... and I reduced it a lot. I reduced it by, like, 85%. You get this thick cranberry syrup, right? I mean, this has the consistency of maple syrup. So by reduction you can thicken. All right. The most classic French way to thicken is something called making a roux. So I'm going to take a little bit of butter here in a pan, and we're going to melt this butter. With roux, it's two ingredients. It's butter and flour. Some people say one to one. I like two to one, because I like to have it pasty so you can then pick it up. Classic example of making a roux, or a great use of it, if you're not using butter, Thanksgiving dinner, right? You have the pan drippings, right? The nice fat from the turkey. You can add flour directly to that roasting pan to make the roux, and then you can make the gravy by adding chicken stock. So here we have the butter melted. I'm going to whisk in the flour now. And it gets nice and thick. And you have to cook the flour, right? Because flour is not cooked. And the longer you go, the darker it gets, all right? And when you get it darker, it gets more flavorful. So here we went all the way to this nice, dark consistency. Now, this is a great thickener down in New Orlean jambalaya. It will start the pan with the roux before you add the liquid, and that will thicken it up. All right, so a great way. A calorie free way of thickening called a corn starch slurry. All you do is you take corn starch, and using your fingers, you add just a touch of water. Because all I'm trying to do is melt. You see all this corn starch kind of melting? So if you had a chicken stir fry going on, and you added stock to it, and you wanted to get it thick to stick to it, you would add this. Or, for example, let's say a hot and sour soup. If I wanted to thicken this up, it's important, paramount that it's boiling. You add a really thin stream as you're whisking. And you have to cook this. And you'll see how thick this will get. All right, so look how nice and thick this got. So there's two ways of testing it. I'll just go next to this cranberry syrup. But this was chicken stock. And look how thick that is, all right? So corn starch slurry adds no calories, and it also thickens up nicely. One last way of thickening is you can actually use puree, puree of carrot, for example, or potato. That added to a soup or a stew naturally thickens and also adds flavor. So thickening is key to adding viscosity and mouth feel to soups and sauces. Learn how to thicken. I'm so psyched that I have one of my best friends in the world, and an amazing chef, Susur Lee, in the house. 

[00:04:24]


(speaking Chinese) 
>> (speaking Chinese) How are you, Ming? Good to see you again. 
>> MING: I'm fanta. Thanks for coming back. All right, so you know the drill. Mystery basket. We truly don't know what's in here. We're going to open them up. You get the first pick. We're cooking on the f, under ten ingredients. You ready? 
>> Wow, that's a lot of memory. 
>> MING: That's a lot of memory. Okay, let's open it up, Su, see what we've got. 
>> Oh, wow. 
>> MING: What have you got? 
>> That's Chinese sausages. I love that. 
>> MING: All right. 
>> Pasta. That's fettuccini classic. 
>> MING: Okay. 
>> Red onions, yes, clams. These erry stones. These are from Boston? 
>> MING: Around here, absolutely. 
>> Squash. It's the perfect time of year. 
>> MING: All right. 
>> And what have you got? 
>> MING: I've got chicken breasts, endive, and some... looks like leftover orzo. 
>> Those are whole wheat. 
>> MING: Yeah. 
>> That's very healthy. I love that. 
>> MING: Some capers, nice. And some pumpkin puree. So Susur, it's your choice. You're the guest. You want to cook seafood, or you want to cook poultry? 
>> You know... wow. With seafood and poultry, it could be a paella. 
>> MING: So we can make one thing. There's no rule about that. 
>> Yeah. You know, I think I'm going to take... I'm going to take the seafood with the sausage. You know, Chinese sausage. I love Chinese sausage. 
>> MG: I knew you were going to do that. All right. 
>> When I was kid I used to love this. 
>> MING: All right, so you have kind of an idea what you think you're going to do? 
>> Well, I'm thinking of the clams. I probably use some of the meat, and also mix some of the juice of the clams. But I do, you know, go to your pantry and see what other stuff you have, and then going to put more things together. 
>> MING: I'm definitely going to make a chicken orzo endive dish. Come on, let's go shop. 
>> All right. 
>> MING: What have we got? All right, tons of herbs. You know your herbs, so... 
>> I love this. 
>> MING: Right. If anything strikes your fancy... we've got lemon verbena here. I think that's lemon thyme, right? 
>> Oh, you're right. Beautiful. 
>> MING: And this is regular thyme. All right. 
>> Mint, basil. What is this? 
>> MING: Lemon verbena, right? 
>> I love that. 
>> MING: It's really good. It's a little tough, right? But you've got to chop it up. Normal stuff. Parsley, cilantro, chervil. Some fresh sage there. 

[00:06:28]


>> I'll probably use some of this verbena lemon right here. 
>> MING: Lemon verbena, okay, cool. 
>> And maybe some cilantro, and also some... I'm going to use a lot of herbs, because it's the time of year. 
>> MING: Ten ingredients or less, my friend. 
>> Herb is one kind. 
>> MING: Okay, herb is one ingredient for Susur Lee. All right. Just have a peek. You've got some cheeses, you've got some snow peas in there, bean sprouts. 
>> Tomatoes. 
>> MING: Yeah, heirloom tomatoes. 
>> That's beautiful. 
>> MING: All right, so maybe something's getting you going? 
>> Yes. 
>> MING: And then last but not least, of course, dry pantry, right? We've got a great stock. You've got lots of rices, you've got nuts, lots of different sauces, vinegars, we have the fruit vinegar, you've got ponzu, right? 
>> Well, you've got some starches. 
>> MING: Yep, sweet potato starch, right. It's about thickening, right? So... 
>> I might use some of that. 
>> MING: And various spices, right? You've got everything. Wuchang and star anise. 
>> You know what? I think I'm looking for something that's here already. 
>> MING: Yeah? You think you've got something? 
>> Yes. 
>> MING: Yeah? Quinoa. You know your stuff, or you can read English. All right, you've got an idea? 
>> I do. 
>> MING: Ready to cook? 
>> Yes. 
>> MING: All right. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> MING: We're going to cook. All right, Sus and I are Chinese. Why is that significant? It's significant because we like to barter, so that we said, and I agreed, he really wanted ginger. To keep it under ten ingredients, I'm giving him ginger root in place of his three onions. So now you're under ten. All right, Susur, what dish are you making? Well, I am making a version of Chinese style paella. We've got sea clams, I see sausages, and I also see the starch. So pasta... this is linguini, right? Fettuccini. So I'm going to cut it up in almost like little rice pieces. 
>> MING: Nice. 
>> And then mix in the spinach, and then I will steam the squash. Kind of healthy, but at the same time, lots of umami taste from the ocean. 
>> MING: All right, what do we have to do? What are you doing with this? 
>> Well, peel this for me, and after that I'm going to start... 
>> MING: Peel the whole thing? 
>> I will just use the bottom part. 
>> MING: Just the bottom, okay. 
>> Yeah, I just want a little cup. 

[00:08:29]


>> MG: So peel the bottom. You're just going to cut it off? 
>> Yes. And then hollow it. 
>> MING: Okay. What did you just do there? 
>> Just crush it a little bit. 
>> MING: Okay. Excellent. So you're making a little cup out of this. 
>> You know what? We have the oil there. 
>> MING: Yep, we've got oil right there. So you're cooking clams, and you just pounded the garlic just to release the oil. 
>> Yes. Just give a little bit of... you know, garlic and clams, they just go so nicely. 
>> MING: It does. I mean, the Italians do it, Chinese do it. 
>> So... 
>> MING: All right, so you just want the little end off. And then how deep a cup do you want? 
>> I would say, you know, just like a half... I would say the bowl like this. I would say half like that. 
>> MING: Like that? 
>> Yeah, right there, yes. 
>> MING: Okay. 
>> So while the garlic's browning... 
>> MING: All right, so you're basically just flavoring the oil with the garlic. 
>> Yes. Putting the clams... I want to use all the clams also with a stock. And I want to steam it with a little bit of soju. 
>> MING: Okay. Soju is a liquid made from barley. It's really called the Asian vodka, if you would. You know that's the most popular distilled beverage, more popular than vodka? 
>> Is that right? 
>> MING: In the world. 
>> You make cocktail with it? 
>> MING: Oh, absolutely. Make many a cocktail. So can we save this one, or you just want one? 
>> Yeah, I think we're just going to use one. 
>> MING: Okay. 
>> So what we do is after that I'm just going to shave it down a little bit. 
>> MING:kay. 
>> And then we're going to just put it in a steamer with the Chinese sausage, and also with the spinach. And then meanwhile I will be cooking the pasta. 
>> MING: This is very healthy, Susur. I like this. How many sausage? 
>> Two. One or two is good enough. 
>> MING: Do you want all this in the steamer? 
>> Yes. One time. 
>> MING: One time. 
>> You can put just a little bit of salt in the squash, yes. 
>> MING: Okay. And spinach straight in. What, half of this, all of this? 
>> I would say a little bit... yeah, one big handful. 
>> MING: Like that. 
>> That's perfect. A little bit more. 
>> MING: Okay. Very healthy. I like this, Sus. So that... that we all steam. 

[00:10:33]


>> Yes. 
>> MING: Perfect. 
>> And then you've got some cold water. We're going to shock the spinach. 
>> MING: Okay. 
>> Meanwhile I'm going to cut the pasta up. And I'm going to turn it into, like, little pieces of rice. 
>> MING: What can I do with this ginger? 
>> Can you grate it for me? 
>> MING: Yep. 
>> Use maybe this. 
>> MING: Perfect, not a problem. 
>> After you grate it... 
>> MING: You obviously want it peeled, right? 
>> Yeah. I would just keep it last minute. I would use it on my... the mixture on my spinach. You see I cut them into little pieces of rice. 
>> MING: Yeah, I like that. By the way, a spoon's a great way to peel ginger, right, Sus? You can use a peeler, you can use a knife, but I like spoons. 
>> Also, you know, a chopstick... if you have a square chopstick ithe back, also it's quite nice. You can use this. 
>> MING: To peel ginger. Interesting. 
>> The edge especially. So I'm going to cook the pasta. 
>> MING: Okay. 
>> First I'm going to put a little bit of salt. 
>> MING: Right. Salt is key, right? It adds flavor to the pasta. Although we're calling it rice now, right? 
>> Yes, rice pasta. 
>> MING: Rice pasta, exactly. 
>> You know, I like the texture when these have that kind of... 
>> MING: Well, you've sauted pasta too, right? Risotto style, right? 
>> Right. Like orzo, for example. 
>> MING: Yeah. All right, so you just want a little bit grated? How much do you want? 
>> Just a little bit, yes. And after that, can you put in the clamshells to give that little, you know, gingery flavor? 
>> MING: More? 
>> That's perfect, Ming. 
>> MING: Okay. Throw this right into the clams? 
>> Yeah. Now spinach is ready. We can grab the spinach. 
>> MING: A little flambe there. We've got the soju flambe. This is good, because it's actually burning off the alcohol, right? 
>> Yeah. Give it a little sweetener. 
>> MING: Yep. Yeah, soju has a natural sweetness. 
>> Can you put it in ice for me, please? Now we continue to steam another maybe two minutes. I think we should take the sausage out and cu into a little dice, and then we can actually put one sausage right into the clams. It can give a very nice sweetness. 
>> MING: Cool, so that's probably what, four minutes away for the squash? 
>> Probably. 
>> MING: And this is probably about four minutes away. 

[00:12:33]


>> So my pasta is ready. 
>> MING: All right, so you need this drained now, because we're going to use the water again, Sus? 
>> Yep. 
>> MING: Okay. All right. Water ready? Just to stop it, right? You've got to shock it to stop the cooking. Love it. All right. Your clams are looking awesome here. All right, so that squash still is going to take about four or ve more minutes. 
>> Yes. 
>> MING: All right, we're going to let that cook through. 
>> And then you can... 
>> MING: You're pretty close to start plating it up. 
>> Yes. Well, it's ready. The clams are open. We dump it in, save all the juices, and then use the same pan. You turn it on, make it a little bit higher. 
>> MING: Okay. 
>> And also get the juice back in the pan. 
>> MING: Look how much juice came out of these clams. That's unbelievable. 
>> And then we're going to put this... can you put this... chop up the spinach for me, please? 
>> MING: Okay, sure. Justhat, fine chop? 
>> Yeah. And cook it down. Fine chop. 
>> MING: Yep. 
>> A little bit of pepper. 
>> MING: In with the pasta, Sus? 
>> Yes. 
>> MING: Okay. 
>> A little bit of salt. I like using white pepper. A little bit more feminine taste. Because this dish can be very masculine, you know? 
>> MING: I didn't know that. How about these... how about in here? You want me to dsomething? 
>> No. What you're going to do, you take the clam meat out, and meanwhile... 
>> MING: Clam meat out. 
>> ...I'm going to take the sausage, and you can just dice it out for me. 
>> MING: All right. 
>> You know, you can cut some of th. maybe I should cut this on the side here. 
>> MING: All right. I can't do everything, Sus. 
>> Well, that's why I'm here. 
>> MING: So you going to want any clams with the shell on, or everything out? 
>> And then I put the sausage right in too. 
>> MING: Okay. So you want any clams still in the shell, too? 
>> Oh, yeah. Give me two. Give me two shells, yes. 
>> MING: Here we go. 
>> And then we're going to get a plate, we'll start plating. 
>> MING: Okay, cool. Let's start plating it up. 
>> We've got the squash, nice and tender. 
>> MING: All right, here's the... want to put that in here, Sus? 
>> Thank you. 
>> MING: Oui, oui. Excellent. Looking beautiful. Clams in here? 

[00:14:35]


>> Clams, yes. And then we start... you know, get the starch, also start thickening with the starch. 
>> MING: Okay. 
>> Get a little water. 
>> MING: So that's... oh, you do the sweet potato starch. 
>> Yeah. 
>> MING: Okay. 
>> I like it because, you know, sweet potato starch give a very nice shiny part of it. 
>> MING: So you like it more than corn starch? 
>> Yes. Because it holds a little bit longer, too. Get a little more. 
>> MING: Okay. 
>> I always heard two time water and one time starch. That's perfect. 
>> MING: Good, okay. Get you some more clams. All right. More clams? 
>> Stir it up. Mmm, I can see... 
>> MING: This is surf and turf Susur Lee style. 
>> Like a nice stew. 
>> MING: All right, that's looking good. 
>> Bring it to a boil. 
>> MING: Okay. 
>> Then can you cut up some of... 
>> MING: The verbena? 
>> Yes, please. 
>> MING: Okay. 
>> And I need to gra little nutmeg while you're doing that. 
>> MING: Okay. 
>> Just a little bit right... like, spinach and clams in nutmeg, love it. 
>> MING: Interesting. Where have you had that before? 
>> W you know, this dish... you know, when I was traveling in Europe I was in Spain. Of course, you've got to eat paella there. 
>> MING: Yep. 
>> And when I look at, you know, pasta, you know, sausage and clams, you have to think about that culture. Yeah, right side. 
>> MING: Okay. 
>> Perfect. Now I'm just going to thicken up, and then we can start plating it. 
>> MING: I love it. So it's a really... it's a risotto with pasta instead of rice. 
>> Right. It's very light. 
>> MING: Right. 
>> And the sweetness is really coming from the nice... like a nice stew. 
>> MING: I can really smell the nutmeg, too. 
>> Plating it. 
>> MING: This is awesome. 
>> You know, you can also... without the squash, you can always just use it like a risotto. 
>> MING: And we'll drink a little soju with this? 
>> Yes. 
>> MING: Let me grab two glasses. I'll be back, two seconds. 
>> Then I reserved some of the clam juice. Just put some in the bottom. 
>> MING: I le that, Sus. 
>> Give it a nice little... like a little clam consomm?? in the bottom. 
>> MING: That looks so good. 
>> And then a couple of garnish with clams. Can you cut me some sausage in the lengthwise? 
>> MING: Okay. Lengthwise or brunoise? 

[00:16:37]


>> No, cut it lengthwise would be nice. 
>> MING: This way. 
>> Yes. 
>> MING: How many? Quarters? 
>> Yes. And then you cut it in two, and cut into little sharp ends. 
>> MING: Go ahead. 
>> Yeah, like... 
>> MING: You say sharp ends. 
>> Yeah, like this. 
>> MING: Oh, you mean (with French pronunciation)diamond. 
>> Is that how they say it in English? 
>> MING: Diamonds. 
>> So they can chew on it, you know? 
>> MING: Oh, cool. Sus, that looks awesome. 
>> And then, of course, finishing with a little garnish. 
>> MING: Ten ingredients. 
>> There you go. 
>> MING: Sus, let's try this. First of all, here's your little soju as well. Cheers to you, buddy. 
>> Cheers, Ming. 
>> MING: You're the best. Mmm. All right. Let's give this a try. 
>> love the sweetness from the ocean. Clams is one of my favorite. 
>> MING: Dude, that is so full of umami. That's why he is a master chef. Hey, will you cook with me? My turn to cook. 
>> Absolutely. I'm going to help you, of course. 
>> MING: Thank you, Sus. All right, more to come. Susur, that dish was unbelievable. Full of umami. You are the master. All right, we're going to do a simpler dish, perhaps. It's going to be a seared chicken breast, pan sauce, with an orzo risotto, using the pumpkin puree to thicken the orzo risotto, served with an dive capers salad. So here, bust me out one onion, please. Just fine dice. 
>> Fine dice. 
>> MING: And then on the endive I'm going to want you just to take the V out, right, and just really fine slice. We're just going to make a little endive salad. All right, then just chop up a little bit of capers, and maybe... I have a little bit of this fruit vinegar, which I love. We'll put some fruit vinegar with that. Olive oil. That'll be the salad. 
>> How would you like me to chop the chives up? 
>> MING: And chives, just fine chop. 
>> Fine chop, and also just shred it out? 
>> MING: And just shred that, exactly. 
>> This one, fine dice? 
>> MING: Fine dice with that. And then we're going to get some chicken breast going in the pan. So a little bit of salt. I'm going to use actually a little bit of curry. You like curry, right, Susur? 
>> Oh, I love curry. 
>> MING: Well, I'm thinking of the pumpkin, you know? So I want... you know, curry and pumpkin's a nice little combo. 

[00:18:38]


>> Right into the bowl, Ming? 
>> MING: Please, yep. 
>> Then you have very fine chopped chives too. 
>> MING: Oh, yeah. You know what? That... actually, onions is for my pan sauce. So go ahead and put it in a bowl. But that's fine. 
>> All right. Here, I'll leave it for you. 
>> MING: Yeah, thank you. But then I'll give that back to you in two secs. So I'm going to go ahead and get these chicken breasts going. All right. If you have too much oil, dump it out. Put it back in your oil thing. That's fine. I'm just going to get two of these going. 
>> Would you like two tablespoons? 
>> MING: Yeah, that's perfect. All right, get those two chicken breasts going. This should be plenty. 
>> Oh, I like curry. 
>> MING: Yeah, a little bit of curry. Season both sides. 
>> Right. Oh, you sear right with the oil, give it a nice flavor. 
>> MING: Yeah, exactly. A little curry on the side. Right, we're going to turn this down, because we don't want to burn it. 
>> You want me to shred this, too? 
>> MING: Perfect, yep. Nice. And Sus, I'll take these onions. All right, now you can put the endive back in this bowl, my 
>> Right. 
>> MING: All right, let me go ahead and make sure there's some good color on these. Nice. All right. So because these are pretty thick chicken breasts, I'm going to add a little bit of wine now to kind of help poach it, because they're sohick, right? And I also don't want... I don't want the curry to burn, right? So this is going to help poaching it, gets it cooking more. 
>> Get the flavor with the curry and all that. So should I put the chive in? 
>> MING: Chive in there, and then a little bit of capers as well. Capers are going to be my salt for this salad, right? Because capers are crazy salty. 
>> I like the choice you use for capers, because it's very... this one is a very good smaller one. 
>> MING: Yeah, exactly. All right, so we've got to get that chicken going. All right, some good fine dice there. And I've got a lot of onions. 
>> Right. 
>> MING: Let's get this chicken going. So as soon as this chicken cooks all the way through, I'm going to let it rest, and then we're going to add more wine and stock and do an orzo risotto thickened with a little pumpkin puree. So we're going to wait for this chicken to cook another six minutes. All right, so these are thick, right, Sus? So this is probably about eight minutes all day. All right, look at that. 
>> Looks juicy. 
>> MING: Now we're going to do kind of a pan sauce with your perfectly cut onion, Susur. Right, take up the chicken juice. Right. A little bit more white wine to deglaze this, just a little bit. Just to get all that great stuff off the bottom of the pan, right? 

[00:20:56]


>> I see you have chicken stock there too, right? 
>> MING: Exactly. A little bit of chicken stock. Because if that orzo which is left over. hand that orzo to me, Sus. 
>> How much do you need? 
>> MING: Two thirds of that. This is a whole wheat orzo, which I love. 
>> Is that enough? 
>> MING: Just a little bit more. All right. 
>> There you go. 
>> MING: So it's fly cooked, and we're just going to bring it together. 
>> Is this the plate? 
>> MING: That will be the plate, yeah. I'm going to bring this back. There's another way of thickening. I'm going to have the pumpkin puree to thicken, but I'm also going to thicken, which we do all the time in the kitchen, with butter, right? A little bit of butter at the end. It's a fantastic way to thicken. A little salt and pepper. So add a little of this fruit vinegar, which I love. You've had that before, right? You drink that as well? 
>> Yeah, this is something in Asia they use as sor... 
>> MING: Southeast Asia. 
>> Yeah. 
>> MING: To cleanse, right? 
>> It's almost like a sorbet in the middle course. 
>> MING: Exactly. 
>> And then the olive oil. 
>> MING: A little bit of olive oil. Thanks, Sus. All right, so this is good. So I'm going to use a little butter and a little pumpkin puree to thicken this up. Here we have the pumpkin puree. Not a lot, right? But curry and pumpkin go well together, right? So that's why I did it. So just, le, a spoon of that. 
>> Just smear it in? 
>> MING: Yep. And then... 
>> That was a good idea. Like, very healthy, right? Purees without using a lot of... kindf like corn or anything like that. 
>> MING: Right. And a little bit of butter. A couple pats of butter as well. That thickens that up. 
>> Yeah, I can... 
>> MING: Right? 
>> That's good. 
>> MING: Let's make sure. But most importantly, is it seasoned, right? Do we have enough? A little salt. 
>> I like the sweetness from the puree. 
>> MING: It's good, huh? Hey, can I have a little bit of your feminine white pepper, please? 
>> My feminine. 
>> MING: Why is it feminine? Just more delicate? 
>> I think it's the floral taste. That's how I describe it. 
>> MING: Well, in Chinese cuisine, we always use that so it doesn't color, like, fish and stuff, right? 
>> That's right. And also you know the ying and yan. 
>> MING: Yep, black and white. Exactly, I do know. All right. So a little bit of this orzo. It's a nice thickening in both the butter. All right, let me see some of that endive salad. 

[00:23:07]


>> Pass you the chicken? 
>> MING: Yes, thank you, Chef. I'm just going to put one breast right on top. 
>> Right here. 
>> MING: Just like that. All right. All right. Right on top, Sus. 
>> Right on top. 
>> MING: Coming off. It can maybe come off the back side here. 
>> Right here? 
>> MING: Yeah. 
>> Oh, I like this freshness. 
>> MING: I like it, Sus. All right, and then, you know, we drank a little of this Italian wine. Here, hand me those glasses, Sus. This is Vermentino, fantastic. Very fruity, high acid. I always say this, Sus. Cook with the wine you drink, right? Don't ever buy cooking wine. 
>> So high acidic with sweetness, good combination. 
>> MING: It's a great combination. 
>> I can taste it, I can smell it. 
>> MING: All right, Sus, here you go. 
>> Thank you. 
>> MING: You first, sir. Tell me what you think. Let me try this orzo. 
>> Mmm, your chicken is so tender. And also I like the curry, the background. 
>> MING: The curry and the potato. And you know what? Your salad actually works so well, because it's so bright and acidic. 
>> Great idea, Ming. It's always great cooking with you. 
>> MING: You are the best. 
>> Cheers. 
>> MING: The King of Canada, Susur Lee. Thank you so much. As always, peace and good eating. For more information on Simply Ming,including upcoming guests and more, visit us online at ming.com/simplyming. Closed captioning provided by:

[01:51:26]


>> Fuera, fuera, fuera, fuera!

>> ??Y usted est?? arrepentido ahora? 
>> Totalmente. 
>> S??.

>> Bueno, la acabo de conocer, la acabo de conocer, es una de las bailarinas modelos de S??bado Gigante, o sea, voy a hacer todo para hacerte sentir c??modo, para hacer inc??moda tambi??n. 
(Risas). 
>> O sea, pero bueno, siguiente, next, next. 
>> Eso no es nada, el problema es que la novia est?? aqu??, ??usted sab??a que el hombre era as?? tan ? 
>> ??Por qu?? problema? No, gracias por estar aqu??, mi amor. 
>> Exactamente, esa es la vida de los famosos, Don Francisco. 
>> Esa es la vida. 
>> Ay, s??. 
>> La voy a llevar a mi casa. 
>> S??, ??d??nde se la consigui??? 
>> Primero le preguntaron que si conoc??a a Alejandro Fern??ndez en todos los sentidos y ahora. 
>> Pero no conoc?? a Alejandro Fern??ndez en todos los sentidos. 
>> No, no lo conozco, pero no tengo que conocerlo para sacar las conclusiones de lo que dije la semana pasada, la semana pasada dije que me parece que ??l lo hace mil veces mejor. 
>> Ah bueno, vamos a ver, ??Qu?? dice Mar??a Conchita Alonso? 
>> Mira, bueno este, este hoy, o sea, cantas excelente, te not?? un poco r??gido quiz??s, tu vo sigue siendo excelente, va a ser muy dif??cil la noche de hoy pero s?? te not?? que quiz??s estabas un poquito, demasiado nervioso, un poco nervioso. 

[02:26:02]


>> ??Estaba nervioso o no? 
>> ??Estabas? 
>> Un poquito como siempre, siempre estoy nervioso, siempre me dan. 
>> En otra ocasi??n no te hab??a notado tan nervioso pero y tambi??n al principio como que, ya despu??s s??, ya despu??s se solt??, soltaste las voz al final, pero al principio era como que, ay, te not?? sin fuerza. 
>> Nervioso. 
>> Sigues siendo un excelente cantante y luciendo tan bien, como mejor que tus 
>> Bueno, Jackie dec??a que ten??a tonos muy Alejandrados, ??Qu?? significa eso? 
>> Bueno, sus bajas, sus bajas muy, muy parecidas a las de Alejandro Fern??ndez y ahora los agudos como los hemos trabajado, se parecen mucho, mucho, al principio de esa canci??n es as??, es una canci??n que empieza calmada para soltar el agudo al final, o sea, ??l no hizo nada diferente por lo que se le mont??. 
>> Puede empezar calmada pero no ten??a la fuerza aunque est?? calmado, o sea, yo s?? lo not?? como un poco sin, sin control ah??. 
>> Gloria, dijiste t?? que no se aplicaba mucho. 
>> No, s?? se aplica, a m?? me parece que es uno de los alumnos m??s aplicados. 
>> Ya. 
>> Ha sido una gente que ha trabajado much??simo en su expresi??n corporal, yo creo, aunque me vayan a matar, que la ropa no le ayud??. 
>> Puede ser eso, puede ser eso. 
>> No le ayud?? la ropa. 
>> Puede ser eso, porque tambi??n Alejandro se la pone m??s apretadita. 
>> S??, se fija en todo, se fija en todo para poder arreglar un poco este momento, tu pap?? est?? en DF, Alejandro, don Alejandro, venga a saludar aqu??. 
>> Hola, mi querido Enrique, ??C??mo est??s? 
>> Muy bien, impresionado, y muy impresionado gratamente, por supuesto, papi, qu?? maravilla. 
>> M??s yo todav??a me sigo impresionando y no dejas de sorprender. 
>> Ay, pap??, gracias. 
>> Muy bien, te felicito, para m?? lo hiciste muy bien, yo no te pongo ni un pero, bueno s??, el del traje. 
(Risas). >>ueno, muchas gracias, don Alejandro, vamos a ver qu?? dice don Maury Stern. 

[02:28:03]


>> Bueno, nada Enrique, sin duda este momento en la competencia como hemos hablado y siendo as?? de exigentes, yo creo tambi??n que no fue tu mejor presentaci??n, lo que realmente pienso, estoy de acuerdo con Mar??a Conchita, lo que siento que pasa es que en tu caso el reto es que no te pareces mucho f??sicamente, entonces las exigencias de hacer los gestos y las expresiones como Alejandro te exigen m??s y lo que creo que pas?? es que fue exagerado, porque como tienes que hacer las expresiones m??s parecidas porque tu f??sico no es como el de ??l, puedes correr el riesgo de verte exagerado, creo que eso es lo que pas?? y la parte vocal, tambi??n estoy de acuerdo, donde hay que tener m??s cuidado contigo es en las partes agudas, que ah?? es donde desconectas el color de Alejandro, esto es propositivo, es para que sigas adelante, pero eso es lo que verdaderamente pienso. 
>> Muy bien, vamos a ver entonces con Ednita Nazario. 
>> Bueno, yo creo que no fue tu mejor noche, yo estoy de acuerdo con los compa??eros, o sea, la canci??n tal vez no es la canci??n id??nea para este momento de la competencia, yo entiendo lo que dice Jackie, de que la canci??n empieza suavecita y que despu??s sube, pero no el color de la voz te vari?? mucho, mucho, mucho y no te he visto en otros momentos m??s brillantes, as?? que eso quiere decir para que trabajes m??s fuerte. 
>> Vamos con el tercer y ??ltimo participante dominicano, sin duda en estas semanas ha perfeccionado su interpretaci??n de H??ctor Acosta, el Torito, veamos lo que dijo la academia sobre Franklin Jos?? Liriano. 
>> Tenemos unos problemas, porque uno le trata de corregir unos movimientos que el Torito hace cuando canta, con las manos, yo le digo que cante como si estuviera lavando, ay, que se me tranca un poquito, no sigue ese, esas direcciones que uno le da. 
>> A veces se descuida un poquitito, pero uno le jala las orejas un poquito y vuelve otra vez a coger el paso. 
>> Aqu?? est?? Franklin Jos?? y la gentueja que t?? no sigues las instruccios. 

[02:30:07]


>> No. 
>> Los profesores se quejan. 
>> Se me quejan un poquito, porque soy un poquito dejado de eso, le pido perd?? aprovecho el momento. 
>> ??Por qu?? lo haces? ??Eres poco prolijo en eso? 
>> Parece que s??, me parece que s??, que siempre ha sido mi defecto. 
>> ??Y no crees que eso te puede perjudicar a la final? 
>> Creo que, creo que apuesto a m?? ahora y creo que lo mejor??, creo que lo super??. 
>> ??S??? ??Y has disfrutado t?? esta experiencia? 
>> Maravillosamente, a todos mis amigos, gracias por soportarme en esta competencia que es la m??s grande de mi vida. 
>> Muy bien, te deseamos mucha suerte, vamos a ir a la transformaci??n y mieras vamos a la transformaci??n, aqu?? est?? H??ctor Acosta, el Torito, cantando uno de sus ??xitos. ??????. ??????. 
(Aplausos). 
>> Vemos, se??or director, c??mo qued?? Franklin Jos?? en su transformaci??n de H??ctor Acosta el Torito, aqu?? sale de la c??psula para entregarnos su propia versi??n del tema, "Aprender??", un aplauso para ??l. ??????. 
>> Mi gente, ??d??nde est?? mi gente, d??nde est??? ??? Aprender??, a no sufrir cuando un amigo te mencione ???. ??? A soportar los latigazos de la noche ???. ??? Cuando el deseo se me junte con tu nombre ???. ??? Y te trate de llamar... ???. ??? Aprender??, a convivir con los recuerdos sin que duelan ???. ??? Y a convencerme de que no vale la pena ???. ??? Amar a alguien con pasi??n que no se quiera ???. ??? Al que no le duela ???. 

[02:32:09]


>> Ya, v??monos. ??? A despertarme sin tus besos ???. ??? Y aceptar queunto a m?? ya no te tengo ???. 
>> V??monos, v??mo ??? A olvidarte, arrancarte de mi piel y el coraz??n ???. ??? Aprender?? a negarme a m?? mismo ???. ??? Que te quiero como no he querido yo ???. ??? Y aprender??, a sacar todo ese amor de mis venas ???. ??? Como anoche ???. 
>> Suena guitarra. ??????. 
>> Vamos, vamos, vamos. ??????. ??? A despertarme sin tus besos ???. ??? Y aceptar que junto a m?? yo no te tengo ???. ??? Aprender?? a olvidar a arrancarte de mi pecho ???. ??? De mi piel y coraz??n ???. ??? Aprender?? a negarme a m?? mismo ???. ??? Que te quiero como no he querido yo ???. ??? Aprender?? a sacar todo ese amor ???. ??? De mis venas ???. 
>> Como anoche, muchachita. ??????. 
(Aplausos). 
>> Muy bien, aqu?? est?? Franklin Jos??, liviano, adelante Franklin Jos??, la gente no sabe que una vez se enferm?? el verdadero Torito y t?? lo reemplazaste. 
>> Alguna vez s?? sucedi?? eso, estuve por Colombia, ay, cu??nta colombiana, cu??nta gente buena, gracias por esa oportunidad que la vida me dio de suplantar a ese gran artista al cual yo admiro. 
>> Y t?? dices que Feliciano y Mark Anthony son sus peores enemigos. 
>> Yo creo que son los m??s fuertes de la competencia dir??a yo. 
>> ??S??? 
>> S??. 
>> A esos les tienes miedo t??. 
>> No miedo, pero me tiro un par de guantazos ah?? con ellos. 
>> Muy bien y Rafi, t?? hiciste coreograf??a porque levantaba las patitas, no s?? qu?? le pasaba. 

[02:34:12]


>> Levantaba la patita, pero tengo que decirlo. 
>> Falt?? m??s pata. 
>> No seguiste instrucciones. 
>> ??Ah? 
>> Es verdad, es verdad. 
>> Y t?? lo sabes. 
>> ??Qu?? cosa? 
>> Producci??n te pone unos elementos para utilizarlos, se coreograf??a para ellos y lamentablemente no lo usamos. 
>> Pero a la gente le gust??, ??verdad que s??? 
>> Claro, claro. 
>> Vamos a ver qu?? dice Maury Stern, que es m??s exigente aqu??. 
>> Nada, bueno, Franklin, no hay duda que tu parecido al torito y tu color de voz es maravilloso y ahora la pregunta a esta altura es, si me sorprendes cada vez m??s y la verdad es que no, siento que est??s en un lugar donde lo imitas bien, lo trabajas bien pero ya en esta competencia ya se tiene que sorprender y eso es lo que no encuentro o no encontr?? en esta presentaci??n. 
>> Muy bien, Ednita Nazario. t??rminos de imitaci??n, la imitaci??n tuya es impecable, impecable. 
(Aplausos). 
>> Vamos a ver qu?? dicen entonces los compa??eros que est??n tambi??n opinando de ??l, aqu?? est?? lo que opinaron los compa??eros. 
>> Y en realidad no sabr??a decirte qui??n es. 
>> Un cantante bien vers??til aunque un poquito indisciplinado, porque cuando uno lleva mucho tiem en esto, este, uno coge malas costumbres. 
>> Yo dir??a que no es muy disciplinado, s?? que a ??l le gusta hacer las cosas a su manera, est?? acostumbrado a hacer las cosas como ??l quiere, como a ??l le nace, c??mo ??l piensa que est??n bien hechas. 
>> Bueno, vamos a ver qu?? dicen adentro ah??, porque ah?? est?? Alejandra, ??est??n todos de acuerdo que es indisciplinado o no? 
>> Sin querer queriendo se acomodaron los tres solitos, mire, ah?? est??n todos los que hablaron de ??l, ??Qu?? pasa? ??Es indisciplinado o no? 
>> S??, s??, definitivamente s?? lo es, aunque debo decir que en estas ??ltimas semanas se ha disciplinado mucho, habl?? con Gloria, habl?? con Jackie, habl?? con Rafi, se ha disciplinado bastante. 

[02:36:18]


>> Oye, se ha enojado bastante aqu?? el amigo, Franklin Jos??. 
>> Bueno, no me lo esperaba de ellos, pero muchachos, esto es una competencia y tenemos que pensar que cada quien quiere ganar. 
>> S??, est?? bien, est?? bien, ??Qu?? dice Gloria Maggio? ??Es indisciplinado? 
>> Se tiene que disciplinar s??, porque si se le montan cosas y luego ??l hace lo que sea, el trabajo de nosotros no cuenta, perdido. 
>> Ya, no responde a la monta. 
>> No, ??l es muy bueno, no lo dudo, no lo dudo, pero s?? tiene que entrar e juego de la disciplina. 
>> Y Jackie, ??Qu?? dice? Porque hizo as?? con la cabeza, Jackie. 
>> Mira, ??l lleg?? a la competencia no muy disciplinado, yo puedo hablar vocalmente, vocalmente ??l est?? mucho mejor, todo lo que yo le he dicho que haga, ??l lo ha hecho, en estas ??ltimas semanas ha seguido bastante y sorprendentemente lo que no me esperaba. 
>> ??Qui??n me falta en el jurado? Mar??a Conchita. 
>> A m?? me pareci?? muy bien, yo no s?? si ser??s disciplinado o no, a lo mejor no lo eres porque todo el mundo lo dice pero yo no s??, por lo tanto, yo estoy viendo lo que hiciste hoy, a m?? me gust?? y a m?? me parece que eres, pues el Torito y adelante, adelante, me parece que lo eres y lo suenas incre??ble, se mueve. 
>> No, no puede ser que no est?? de acuerdo con Rafi, en muchas ocasiones yo no estoy de acuerdo con ??l, como el caso que puso un torero a estorbar al otro cantante. 
>> Claro, lo que pasa Maury, yo no quiero imaginarme los shows de tus artistas, porque realmente me imagino que deben ser muy aburridos, aqu?? se hace un espect??culo para el artista, para engrandecer al artista. 
>> Alejandra, v??monos contigo mejor, aqu?? se est??n peleando, vamos contigo. 
>> Mejor, Don Francisco, por favor, yo quiero hablar aqu?? con el imitador de Alejandro Fern??ndez porque obviamente al imitador de H??ctor le fue muy bien, al imitador de Jos?? Feliciano le fue muy bien, a ti no te fue tan bien, entonces tambi??n hablamos en cuanto al f??sico que no te pareces tanto, ??c??mo crees que te va a ir en el d??a de hoy? 

[02:38:20]


>> Bueno, no s?? realmente c??mo me va a ir, pero definitivamente cualquier tipo de cr??tica y cualquier cosa que tengan los jueces para decirme, definitivamente es cr??tica constructiva y la voy a tomar para mejorar. 
>> Yo estoy en desacuerdo total, porque todo el mundo coment?? esta hab??a sido tu peor gala y todos aqu??, Don Francisco, estaban diciendo que no, que al contrario, lo ve??an como que era la mejor, lo mejor que hab??as hecho. 
>> Bueno, yo lo sent??, me sent?? bien pero tambi??n es una cosa c??mo se vea del otro del escenario, as?? que 
>> Lo vimos bien, de verdad que s??, usted no se mueva de d??nde est?? porque despu??s de los comerciales sabremos qui??n deja en esta d??cima semana ??dolos de la canci??n, no se mueva. ??????. Hola, soy felix de bedout luchan por regresar a la normalidadreabren escuelas de nueva yorky aumenta el voto anticipadomiles de afectados luchan por regresar a la normalidad tras el paso devastador de la megatormenta sandy por nueva york. Entre ellos se encuentran cientos de latinos que no pierden la esperanza de rehacer sus vidas la mayoria de escuelas afectadas por sandy en la gran manzanseran reabiertas a partir de este lunes, anuncio el alcalde de la ciudad michael bloombergy fuentes cercanas a las campaqas electorales revelaron hoy que mas de 27 millones de personas han votado ya en 34 estados y el distrito de columbia, ya sea por correo o en persona. Mas en noticiero univision fin de semana ??????. 

[02:42:52]


>> Ya estamos de regreso en la 10 semana de ??dolos de la canci??n, y durante los comerciales Alejandra cambi?? porque ya no tiene dos sobrinos, acaba de nacerle el tercer sobrino a Alejandra. 
>> Efectivamente, el n??mero 13, don Francisco. 
>> Ah, trece. 
>> De mi hermanita m??s peque??a, Carlos Eduardo le mando un besote a mi hermana que es una brava, don Francisco, aguant?? el dolor con s??lo 20 a??os. 
>> Muy bien, pues la felicito. Bueno, ahora s??. La competencia se pone dura, dif??cil en este momento el jurado tiene que dar detalles muy claros, cu??l va a ser el primer clasificado y por qu??, porque entramos como dijo, Maury Stern a tierra derecha, al momento m??s dif??cil donde las diferencias son mucho m??s peque??as que al comienzo. 
>> Es correcto, si puedo comenzar, yo quiero clasificar a un artista que en presentaci??n, tras presentaci??n no sorprende, nos muestra su calidad, su disciplina, su color de sus movimientos, como toc?? la guitarra, impresionante, tenemos que, en mi caso clasificar a Jos?? Feliciano. 
>> Muy bien. 
>> Edgardo. 
>> Muy bien, primer clasificado, vamos a ver qu?? dice Mar??a Conchita Alonso, por qu?? ??l tiene s??lo un voto. 
>> Porque cada vez que lo escucho y que lo veo me hace pensar que estoy escuchando y viendo al verdadero artista, al verdadero, yo tambi??n me quedo esta noche con Jos?? Feliciano. 
(Aplausos). 
>> Muy bien, gracias, v??yase por la sombra, por favor, muy bien, nos vamos a ver ahora qui??n se va de la competencia, qui??n se va de la competencia, esto es un momento importante, es un momento dif??cil, voy a comenzar con Ednita Nazario, para que me diga pors razones espec??ficas con respecto al otro concursante que est?? a su lado, que tiene menos, que tiene m??s, para que el p??blico entienda en su casa. 

[02:45:02]


>> Sumamente dif??cil, don Francisco. Sumamente dif??cil. Porque verdaderamente ambas personas que est??n ah?? en el escenario tienen todas las cualidades para ganar este concurso, realmente, pero estamos buscando cosas tan espec??ficas y estamos buscando detalles y sobre todo una cosa muy imprtante que dijo Maury, espacio para crecer. Esta persona todav??a tiene que trabajar un poco, todav??a tiene que apretar un poco, pero a m?? me parece que est?? otra persona yo creo que nos dio todo lo que nos iba a dar, no quiere decir que soy criticando su talento porque me parece sencillamente espectacular, y yo creo que le deseo mucha suerte m??s adelante su vida, porque s?? que la va a tener y la va a seguir teni??ndola, yo creo que se debe ir, se debe ir "el torito". 
>> Muy bien, el torito dice, bueno, muy bien, todav??a no, todav??a no ese es un voto, nom??s, todav??a no. Vamos a ver qu?? dice Mar??a Conchita Alonso. 
>> Yo digo que, no estoy de acuerdo, yo creo que los dos son excelentes, pero el torito me ha llenado m??s, me ha lnado m??s, no pienses mal, don Francisco. 
>> ??C??mo? 
>> As?? que yo creo que El torito se debe de quedar y 
>> Muy bien, un voto para cada uno. 
>> Y t??, no, est??s muy bien, y si quieres tomar esto como carrera, vas a tener una gran carrera. 
>> Bueno, tiene un voto en contra Enrique Osorio, Orozco, perd??n, y tiene tambi??n un voto en contra Franklin Jos??. Aqu?? lo decide todo Maury Stern. 
>> Gracias, es verdad. 
>> Por qu??, y despu??s qui??n. 
>> Es un momento en donde ya los dos han hecho un gran trabajo por eso est??n aqu??, estamos ya muy cerca de la final, pero sin duda el aspecto de sorpresa es un aspecto muy importante y de detalles en lo que hagan, no hay duda que, que uno de ellos cometi?? bastante equivocaciones y creo que su presentaci??n anterior fue mucho mejor, pero tambi??n siento que la academia se equivoc?? mucho en la elecci??n del tema y detalles, pero 

[02:47:32]


>> ??Qui??n se tiene que ir? 
>> Para m?? se tiene que ir, y estoy de acuerdo con Ednita, creo que ya nos dio para m?? lo que nos ten??a que dar, no, no siento que, que me puede sorprender m??s, lo siento mucho eres un gran talento y te deseamos lo mejor, para m?? se tiene que ir el torito, Franklin, toda la suerte, gran trabajo. 
>> Muy bien. 
>> Franklin Jos?? se va. 
>> No, n no. 
>> Su pap?? est?? todav??a escuch??ndolo as?? que le puede decir algo a su pap??. 
>> Bueno, estoy sorprendido y gracias una vez m??s tambi??n por darme oportunidad de para la pr??xima semana, no se van a arrepentir de haberme dejado aqu??. 
>> Muy bien, ya tenemos entonces, Alejandra, que se tuvo que ir lamentablemente ya no vamos a recuperar a nadie. 
>> Don Francisco, yo no s??yo yo me quede como un poquito sorprendida por todas las situaciones, entiendo al jurado porque dicen que ya no le puede dar, o ya no les puede dar m??s en la competencia, pero estamos sorprendidos, don Francisco, y m??s por haber escuchado las cr??ticas que se le hab??an hecho al otro participante Enrique, ??t?? c??mo te sientes? 
>> Bueno, me lo encontr?? un poquito raro, diferente porque no me lo esperaba, pero, esto es un concurso y uno tiene que quedarse. 
(Aplausos). 
>> Bueno, me da mucho gusto que est??s as??, que est??s positivo te felicitamos a ti, que por supuesto, don Francisco. 
>> Muy bien, gracias Alejandra, vamos a despedir entonces a la academia, muchas gracias Jaquee, Rafi y Gloria. Muchas gracias tambi??n a nuestro jurado Ednita, Maury y Mar??a Conchita. Gracias. Vamos, Alejandra, entonces, lamentablemente uno se fue. 
>> Ay, s??, Don Francisco, con la pena pero es una competencia y la verdad es que eres excelente, hiciste un excelente trabajo y yo creo que el futuro de ??l es grande, y usted no se mueva de donde est??, porque nos vamos a una breve pausa, pero regresamos a la gran final del autom??vil, no se mueva. ???. ??????. 

[02:52:52]

What do you know about the lobster roll? Okay, now let's talk about what a lobster roll shouldn't be. Dry bread, not enough dressing, stale lobster, or even warm lobster. Not gonna find it here. Now let's talk about what the lobster roll should be. This is a lobster roll. Let's start with the lobsters. Fresh cracked lobsters. That's right, you heard it. Fresh crack, these lobsters are live. Crack the shell, poach them, get the meat out. Now let's talk about the dressing. The dressing is always made with the combination of horseradish, shallots, garlic, tarragon, celery, mayonnaise, maybe a little bit of ketchup, I've seen it both ways. That's what you're talking about to create sweet lobster filling with a wonderful dressing. Now, let's talk about the bread, the good bread, this bread is called brioche. Do you hear it? It crisps on you. It's got a light, airy wonderful texture. What's special about the way these guys do it here, and they it good, is they put a little butter on the inside, maybe that's the secret they didn't want to give, that definitely makes the lobster taste fantastic. Don't forget you put a little romaine lettuce on the bottom here, see that. That helps in the crunchiness, makes it taste like the garlic gives that extra flavor. Now with a good lobster roll comes one thing and that's fries. Enough about talking, let's dive into this baby. Good, now for every bite of wonderful lobster roll is got to accompany with a gd beer. Well, we're not finished with this segment. Up next lobster roll, lobster roll and more lobster roll. Taste This. So coming over from New York City now in Red Hook, Brooklyn on search for the best lobster roll, leads me to a place called the Red Hook Lobster Pound. But this place is rt of unique because what they are doing is taking the old clc main lobster dish approach and bringing it here right in Brooklyn. You know, what's fascinating about this establishment too is they have lobster trucks that go around to different neighborhoods and sell these delicious lobster rolls. But that's not it, let's go inside and grab a fresh lobster, cook it, and taste what this place is known for. So I am here with Ralf, is the owner of this fine establishment here. We have a lot of lobsters in front of us. 

[00:03:50]


- Yes. - Now, so do these lobsters play an intricate role in making the lobster roll? 
- They do in one aspect. It's just if they come in, you know, from being handled, they may be missing a claw, or two claws or whatever. Or another term is called the bleeder. And that's when they, in transport they're cracked or whatever the case may be. We will cook them off and use them in the lobster roll. But mostly they're sold as whole lobsters. 
- Now this particular lobster here, this is a male, right? 
- Exactly. Oh, watch yourself there. It's missing a band. 
- He likes me. So what do you look forward with this lobster? 
- Well, first of all, if you're looking for a very fresh lobster what he's doing here is basically trying to bite you. But because he is missing a rubber band, what you would normally look for is a Captain America like look. 
- You know, he's fresh. - Right. 
- If you can feel right there, he's a hard shell. 
- Yeah. 
- That means completely full of meat. 
- Ralf, thanks for having me on, I really enjoyed it. Well, let's see what the lobster roll looks like when it's prepared. So what's in this lobster roll? You start off with fresh cracked lobsters in a bowl. Right, you add some of your special mayonnaise, little white pepper, little salt, little lemon juice, some celery and you toss in this baby up to perfection. Well, going down in there, I see some lettuce, some fresh scallions on top. There is only one way to really see if this is a good lobster roll and that's to taste it. Very good, crisp great taste, lobster roll meat fresh and it's cold. And the flavor of the bun really makes this a winner. Don't forget about your pickle which could be a great accompaniment and a clean refreshing taste after you bite into the lobster roll. We're not finished yet because we're gonna head over to the test kitchen and whip up some more great recipes. So don't go anywhere. Taste This. Yes, so the lobsters, you know, the lobster roll is really good, truffle fries, my favorite. I've always found that a lot of people say they make a great lobster roll, when you put them to the test, unfortunately you're disappointed. Not at the place that we just visited though, good stuff. So now, what we're talking about doing is langoustines. Now langoustines are famous for their tail meat. Some people say they look like miniature lobsters, and I guess they could be in the same class. Some people call them crayfish or crawfish. But the langoustines are really good. And they can grow up to a foot long, otherwise they are just pretty small and really only used for the tail meat. The langoustine after you take a part of their head an re brain is great for stocks. You know, we've had langoustine froth on vegetables at many of these fine French restaurants, etc. So I'm going to be using langoustine because I like the sweet flavor of the tails. Now we got some olive oil here, that we are going to be putting in here, some fresh olive oil, first cold pressed. And we are going to be starting that with about, I don't know, quarter cup or so. Now what we're going to be doing is take in some garlic, putting it in the pan. And just gonna let that kind of just get brown a little bit, just bring it down a tad bit. Now here this is basil nutmeg, micro basil nutmeg. Now it's not something that might be very easy to find at your local grocers. But if you look hard enough and you want to get a little bit creative, it has basil flavor with a hint of nutmeg. So these wonderful accompanies that, you know, usually somewhere in Ohio, growing these products, these micro green products, are doing a fine job blending and really coming out with some unique flavors on a show that we will be doing next week. Where we'll be talking about micro greens, and kind of how they're grown. Now, when you are making your pasta, one thing I can't stand. I've said this on prior shows. But, is people that don't cook their garlic. I had Broccoli Rabe last week in a restaurant was totally disgusted because they just decide to put raw garlic in there. Now I don't about you, raw garlic just repeats on me all day long. All right, now you see the garlic browning, you could smell the garlic browning. Yofeel it, you feel that garlic browning. You know what I mean? It's the whole creative process here. While that's browning, I am just gonna take this off for a second. I have endives here. I am just gonna cut them down this way, cut them in half, I am gonna put them on our grill in the back. Notice what I have? I have a pizza down here, on the grill. I don't know about you people down at home, I like to grill my pizza. So, you know, people always say, I want to eat bread with my pasta and stuff like that, so some times I am in the mood for a piece of pizza with the pasta. Has bread sauce and everything else, you know. Hey, there is no rules, no rules in eating, no rules in cooking. All right, garlic is here. Now, you don't edge your langoustines until the very end, so what we do add is crushed black pepper, roasted pepper, scallions, a little bit of shallots, a little bit of chives and a little bit of love. Now we put that in there too to sink into the oil. And if you don't think you have a lot of oil in there, what does that mean? I mean, you are looking and it really should be covered with oil. Throw some more in there. It only gets good with great oil here. All right, capers, very important to put at this stage, right? In the beginning stage of cooking, you always want to make sure that the flavor would bleed into the oil. You know, peaches put in stuff in the sauce and expecting this to taste good. There is a process here on how you can get the maximum flavor from the ingredients that you put in. Now with our roasted red pepper. Now we got a couple of things that ??e're gonna do at this stage. We gonna deglaze this with a little bit of clam stock, and I am submerging it because it will cook down. We'll raise the fire. Now, when making stuff like langoustine and, you know, pasta angel hair and stuff like that, which what we're gonna do is we're just about ready to go, so we're gonna put our angel hair in that. You want make sure that it's the sauce is not too thick like in another words, you know, you don't want to make a sauce that is so thick, it's just, it's gonna lose the flavor of everything else. If I put all of this mato sauce in here, I wohave a mess on my hands. So we're not gonna do that. What we're gonna do is just add our angel hair pasta. Give it a little toss in the beginning. We've already salted this water. I always recommend that you salt the water before you actually put the pasta down. A lot of things and a lot times on shows, I don't season till the end. But obviously we're putting down pastas and stuff like that I will and that's it, you know, I just want to give it one stir and I'll have to babysit it. Now, we got our pasta going down and take a look at this. We've very runny but that's good. We're gonna put some basil in there. We'll just kind of clear this up a minute. We're gonna talk about adding the sauce. Man, that smells good. The garlic comes up at you, all the stuff. All right, now everything else is evaporating. What's going to happen is the liquid will evaporate, but the flavor will get more intense. So what we'll do now is take our tomato sauce. We're gonna squish this around. We're gonna see how much we want to go with the tomato. I think that's got to be it. Now see what I was talking about not being too thick and mushy and gooey, you know, we're not about that here. Okay, good, that's looking good. Now what we want to do is put our langoustines off to the side. You never want to add your cooked seafood in at the very beginning. Unless it's like raw calamari and you need to stew it for hours and stuff like this. The langoustines go in at the very end. So we got the aroma, we got the colors, we got the flavors. We're not going quick, so we're not losing anybody. We also have our pizza here in the back. What I like about the grilled pizza, but one of the caveats to this is that you have to kind of let it sit on there really low for a while. But don't worry about it because we're doing a couple of other things here to get started on this. So, you know, we're just gonna kind of let it sit here. Now, our endive as you notice, we have nice grill marks on. We don't want to take this too far, so what we're gonna do is take off our endive. We'll take some endive that we have here, some red, some yellow, Belgian, beautiful Belgian endive and of course not to get the core in there. And we're gonna throw this into the dish. If you notice, I have a lot of peppers in there. Sweetness. This has the tendency to be just a tad bitter. So what you're gonna get is bitter flavor on it. Not an overpowing bittering flavor because you're only putting a little. Right, now at this point, I need a little cream in this there, but I don't want to add heavy cream because it's just not gonna go good well with this dish. But I will add two pads of butter right in that baby. I'm also gonna add a little, drizzle a little olive oil on top too. All right, so we got the butter in there, that's coo down beautifully, right. Our pasta is ready. What we're gonna do is bring that pasta over to the sink. Now, whenever you're straining pasta, give a blow, get that steam away from you. Take it off the fire. And just kind of let this sit and cook out a little bit. In the meantime what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna started with our version of a nice salad that's gonna be an accompaniment. Now you've seen that lobster salad. I'm gonna make my own version of a lobster salad. So don't go anywhere, we're gonna cleaned up. When I come back, we're gonna taste the salad that you're gonna really enjoy. Okay, so now we'll add the langoustines to the dish and just kind of let it sit in there. Because you really shouldn't heat it up, they are already cooked and you just looking to bring it back to the temperature that's the same as the sauce. Now we're gonna get started on our langoustine kind of salad which we're gonna put in a wrap and then we're gonna put it over these beautiful micro greens that we have here. We have edamame, we he some red oak spinach, we have some tatsoi sour lettuce, etc. We even have a little bit of that basil nutmeg that we talked about as well. Now, we will also do is take our pizza off because we're definitely good. And as you notice everything is melted in the bottom. What I like about grilling the bottom is you hear that crunch, it's going to be nice and crispy. That's what I'm talking about. One thing I can't stand is a soggy slice of pizza, you know, where the bottom is not crispy, you wot find that here. So what gonna do is just transfer this pizza, cut it into quarters. And this is actually a gluten-free pizza by the way which is and they are coming out with it, you ow, lot of nice gluten-free products. We're gonna take this pizza, we're just gonna leave it in the back here. We're gonna get started on our salad which requires some mayonnaise. Now, you can use creme fraiche which is really nice and I've always found that creme fraiche goes great with lobsters, has a little bit of a sour taste, a mayonnaise base, which I like to my own mayonnaise which is a couple of egg yolks and some olive oil, salt, vinegar and pepper. All right, now we're gonna add our mayonnaise mixture. Again, I like to make mine myself. But you can buy it if you wish. It's not hard to make it. I find that probably a lot more healthier. Now we have some onions, some really thinly sliced onions that we're gonna use here which are good for salads. I don't really like anything like raw onions and stuff like that, but in this dish it will really compliment. And we just, we don't want all of our langoustines, but we'll put a good amount in there. You know, we want to balance it out how much mayo we have here as well. Let's put another one in there, that's fine. And now what we'll do is we have a couple of other things going that really enhance this salad. If you're not familiar with putting capers in salad, this is really a great thing. Let's throw some capers in there. I have some basil pesto. You know I always have some basil pesto in my refrigerator, st put it in there and we have a bit of mustard. This is Dijon strong mustard, you know, don't use anything else and just mix that around. We'll put some black pepper here and some salt. We're about to call this salad a day. All right, mix that baby up. Now we talked about that this is going on a wrap. And we talked about we're gonna pan fry this with some butter and olive oil. So now what we're gonna do is get ourselves a wrap and go right on our grill with this thing. What you have to do with wraps, especially if you're folding anything in them... Like a lot of people say, okay, let me get my wrap and fold it up. Oh, my God, it broke. It doesn't break if you bring it up to a little bit of a heat, you know, getting a little temperature in this baby. But, you know, be in a situation where you can just bring it to a heat. I mean, because you have your grill on anyway, so it's just a matter of throwing it on there. And now what we're gonna do is just put our mixture right in the center. n, you don't need all of this. And again, when I'm talking about wraps, I like our wraps crispy, you know, I don't like 'em like you know, gummy and pasty and stuff like that. That's really not what I like to do. Now, you got your wrap, you fold it, you have this little end piece here. What you can do is take some of your mixture almost like glue. Let's call this lobster or langoustine salad glue and pu of your glue then on the end. That baby's gonna seam this shut. Done, see that? Of course the seam side is gonna go down first, so we're gonna take some olive oil in a pan, a good amount. But you also want to put a little bit of butter in there. You're gonna get a nice crispy textureeat flavor. We're gonna put a lot of butter in there. This combination is great when you like sauteing fish, potatoes, stuff like that, you know, olive oil, butter, you know, even like to get a little, you know, burnt as you could see it's getting nice and toasty. All right, now what we do is we take our seam side lobster roll and put it right down in there. Now, you got to be careful with this because a good wrap has got a lot of lard in it, butter or shortening or fat, it will burn quickly. So what you want to do is take your lobster roll and just you know you want to kind of play with it little bit because this stuff cooks pretty quickly. Now it's dredged in some butter and oil here which is how I like it. More oil than butter. Let's clean this up a bit because we're gonna need to chop this off in a second. All right, now we're just gonna move this around a little bit. All right, as you can see the seam side down is cooked, if you can see that. Lobster is stillntact as we made it nice and thick, it wasn't runny and what we're gonna do is we're going to get our greens ready to go. We're gonna take a little bit of olive oil, little salt, throw some capers on there and we're just gonna take a little bit of balsamic vinegar, put it over the top. Okay, let's see how our roll is doing, we'll turn it over again. Excellent, that's what we're looking for. See what I'm talking about? Now that's the last side that we need to go. Now, we give it another minute or two, we'll bring it back. Now the trick of this baby is cutting this, so it doesn't smash out, right? So, I'll show you a little technique in a minute here. All rit, good, so now we got our roll. Now that's how I like to eat my lobster roll here. You know what I'm saying? We lost one. Now, with your knife, you see how I'm kind of just cutting the top first? This is how you cut a sandwich too. You don't smash that thing so it's look like runny gooey mess on each side. Just go down quickly with it. You pick it up, that's what I'm talking about. That is what I'm talking about right on top of these greens, man. There's lovin' in e oven. All right, put this here. Let me get cleaned up a little it and we're gonna return back to our pasta in just a moment. Okby, so we're done, we're done with our langoustine dishes. So let's just walk over what we have so far and we'll jump back over to the pasta. We made a langoustine salad, you know, similar to like a lobster salad you would make and we used mayonnaise. We talked about, you know, creating your own mayonnaise. Just couple of egg yolks in a blender, even a blender like that will do well. Gently add the oil, a little bit at a time, some vinegar, salt and pepper, you got lf a good mayonnaise mix. Then we put it in this tortilla roll. Now, we've talked about how you warm au ortilla up on the grill because if you don't, what's gonna happen as you take a cold tortilla and it's gonna break. See that, you know it doesn't have that flexibility. So that's not what we're looking for. So after it gets warm, we'll take it off the fire and then just take your langoustines, put it in the center, roll it up and then we fry it to get crispy because mean I think that's really how you should eat a wrap. You know, nice crispy texture, sweetness from the lobsters and you have all this green stuff going on which is pretty cool. Talked about our grilled pizza that we put on and what I l about pizza at the end is you put a little cold pressed olive oil over the top. That will really signify that you know how to eagood food. So, what we're gonna do is come over here to our angel hair pasta that we strained earlier before. And we're just gonna put, you knowough for one person in this dish right over here. Maybe a little bit more, feeling hungry today, okay. So, now what you do with your pasta at this point is toss it in your hot angel hair which is really good about angel hair, one of the things, it really absorbs the sauce. So you should always plan on when you're making or cooking angel hair, have a little extra sauce more than you normally would. Because that angel hair just soaks that baby out. All right, now we're gonna take a bowl, pasta bowl. You could see just for a couple of minutes that we're talking here, our pasta totally absorbed the liquid. And we gonna go the rest on it just like that. Now, I'm talking, you know, when you're making pasta, you're talking about evenness, right, everything is even. Well, we have the evenness from the langoustines and you could smell that evaporated stock in there. You could smell that garlic that really gave it some flavor. Overall I'd say that we have a winner here, a nice dish. All right, so that's what we have. These three dishes that can easily be duplicated may change. Again you don't have to stick with the langoustines, you can go with lobsters. One thing with cooking pasta and cooking lobsters. If you're gonna cook l sters in a sauce, generally you're not gonna find them out of the shell and in good condition. Not unless you've poachedhem yourself. Then in that case I have to say why you didn't you coo with the shell to get the flavors? With the langoustines, they're much more sweeter in the tails I think so, by just sauteing the langoustine tails, you are in a good place. But if you had to substitute this with lobster which I do really good, fra diavolo dish with the shells. Saute the actual lobsters, you're gonna get tremendous amounts of flavor in ysauce. All right, so if you have any questions that's related to these recipes or it's not related to the show, whatever, you can always write in and I'll be happy to answer any food questions th you might have, especially allergies. We've been getting a lot of requests for foods with allergies, celiac disease. Allergic to dairy, diabetic friendly. So, we've been doing and focusing a lot of our recipes around those types of food allergies. If you have an allergy to food and you don't know where to go, online is definitely a great tool. Email me because I've studied a lot with celiac disease, gluten free, dairy free. So, I can help you out with where you can find great products that are dairy free because I know that there's either really good products or horrible like, you know, just not edible. ow that there is a lot of stuff like that on the market. So, send me a request, I'll try to help you out as best I can. But thank for watching this fun filled episode of Taste This TV. I'm your host Chef Joseph Ciminera.

What this teen has to say. 
>> Some kids are encouraged to play video games in school. Find out why. 
>> I'll have a tip that just might help you do better on your next test. 
>> We'll meet a family that's milking their way to success. 
>> I'll tell you the story behind the story of the boy who wouldn't grow up. 
>> That and more, next on "teen kids news." 
>> Welcome to "teen kids news." I'm mwanzaa. 
>> And I'm siena. We'll start with our top story. 
>> Five years ago, we told you about the big step one city took to help the environment. Brandon reports that more and more communities are now taking up the cause. 
>> They stuff our landfills, tangle in our trees, and they kill sea birds a mammals. Plastic bags -- ever year, we use and throw away millions of them. 
>> Plastic bags are a huge litter problem throughout the world. 
>> We interviewed mr. Bloomenfeld back in 2007 when san francisco became the first city in the u.S. To ban plastic bags. Large stores were not allowed to offer them to customers. The ban was a success. So the city then voted to expand it to every store in town. Now communities all across the country are hopping on the "ban" wagon. The day after rye, new york, passed its law against plastic bags, teens were handing out green alternatives. 
>> There are no more plastic bags going to be offered in stores, so we're helping people out by giving them reusable bags. 
>> Reusable bags are considered the best alternative... 
>> Wonderful. 
>> ...Because even paper bags are bad for the environment. Although they can be recycled, they still use up natural resources to make, and the manufacturing process causes pollution. 

[00:02:05]


>> It's completely useless to use something once and then throw it away. 
>> People who work to ban plastic bags say the new laws help reduce the use of paper products, too. 
>> What most of these communities have seen when they pass these types of laws, is that they've seen an increase in reusable-bag rates, which means that their purchases of paper bags have gone down. 
>> By their using a bag that they can use in other stores and at other times, it reduces my costs for paper bags. 
>> Long ago, stores didn't give out bags at all. You had to bring your own. Now people are relearning how to do that once again. 
>> We have a sign by the cash register that asks if they've brought their reusable bag, and a number of people have said, "oh, that's a great reminder. Hold on, I'll be right back," and they go back to their car. 
>> We keep, actually, reusable bags in the back of our car, so every time we go to the store, we use those instead of plastic bags. 
>> Shortly after rye passed its bill, los angeles became the biggest city in the country to outlaw plastic bags. But we still have a long way to go. Bangladesh and rwanda banned plastic bags years before any community in the u.S. Did. So remember, you don't need a law to go green. Just the desire and the commitment to do the right thing. 
>> There's more "teen kids news" coming up next. 
>> We'll be right back.

>> This report is brought to you BY fitsmi.com. One out of every three american kids is overweight. And research shows that girls struggling to get fit are often the least likely to get the help they need. So denise's story is encouraging. About a year ago, she came ACROSS fitsmi WHILE SURFING THE Web. It's an online community of teens like her, trying to lose weight. And she's willing to share her story with us. Hi, denise. 
>> Hello! 
>> Has weight always been an issue for you? 
>> You know, when I was younger, it was never really an issue, but once I moved into my teens, I moved around a lot. I changed a lot of schools, and along the way, I dropped lots of activities. So that's when the weight really started packing on and just becoming a problem. 
>> And how did it affect you? 
>> At the beginning, really, i didn't notice it. I just didn't notice it at all. And then once I moved into my first year of high school, a whole bunch of boys, a whole gang called me chubby and started teasing me, and from that day, it just really continued like that, and it hurt. 
>> I bet. AND SO YOU JOINED fitsmi. And what do you get out of that? 
>> OUT OF fitsmi, I GOT A LOT. The main thing that I learned is I'm not alone. There's so, so many other girls who are going through exactly what I'm going through, who just want to -- who have the same goals as me, who want to lose weight and just be happy, really. And yeah, I learned how to discipline myself. I just set myself goals and how to achieve them. 
>> Adriana willsie is the editor OF fitsmi. She says the goal of the website is to help each girl find a solution that best fits her own lifestyle. 
>> GIRLS WHO JOIN fitsmi OFTEN Tell us that they see changes really quickly. And I think that's because we take this big idea of getting healthy, and we break it down into small, really manageable steps. 
>> The website has lots of helpful tools. For example, the change machine. With it, you can develop your own personal strategy. 

[00:07:07]


>> We have over 100 changes to choose from that help you do everything from eating right to staying active to looking and feeling your best. And it's as easy as browsing the changes we have, adding them to your change machine and then tracking your progress every day. 
>> My favorite thing about the site is the ability to really interact with all the girls, to interact with everybody, to learn their stories, to hear what they've been through and this has worked for them. And it's just so great to interact with all these girls. 
>> Nothing is holding denise back now. She celebrated her 16th birthday with a brand-new outlook. 
>> My whole life has changed. In the last year, I've lost over 26???? pounds, and it's just now, it's still working for me. 
>> And has it changed how you feel about yourself? 
>> Definitely. I used to be that sad girl who was -- I was just always upset. Yeah, I was moody, I was grumpy, I was really a pain to be around. And now, I'm just happy all the time. I just want to go out. I want to do things and just... I've learned to just accept who I am and just love myself. 
>> WOULD YOU RECOMMEND fitsmi TO Other girls? 
>> I WOULD RECOMMEND fitsmi TO Everybody. It's no hesitation, no doubt. Fitsmi, REALLY -- IT'S CHANGEDT CAN DO The same for anybody, for all girls. 
>> Thank you so much. It was so great talking with you. 
>> Yeah, it was great.

>> A family of 10 has come up with a rather unusual business. As katie reports, thanks to some goats, they're really cleaning up. 
>> In charlestown, indiana, the jonases have a farm. 
>> I'm brett jonas. I'm 15, and I'm the oldest in the jonas family. 
>> And on that farm, they have some goats. 
>> My name is colter jonas, and I am 13 years old. 
>> And from those goats, they all make soap. 
>> I'm emery jonas. I am the third oldest in my family, and I'm 12 right now. 
>> And there are five more, plus mom and dad. The entire family works to turn milk from goats into soap and other cleaning products. No wonder their company is called "goat milk stuff." 
>> I started making soap for the family just because I wanted healthy soap for their skin. And we just brought it to a craft fair, and then the response to it was tremendous. So that was really how the business began. 
>> It helps that mom has an engineering degree and dad is a former science teacher. 
>> PJ's ENGINEERING BACKGROUND And my master's degree definitely has played a part in our success. 
>> Another secret that helped the jonases become soap stars... 
[ Goat bleats ] ...Everyone has to pitch in. 
>> I have a rule around here. I call it my "youngest person rurule." And that means that the youngest person capable of doing a job is the one who does it. 
>> Just like cows, goats need to be milked every day. 
>> Sometimes I'll even get up as early as 6:00. 
>> Another big job is filling the online orders that come in from people all over the country. 
>> I'd say the hardest thing about living in a family that runs a business is when my little brothers or sisters don't do their jobs and I get stuck doing them. 
>> You have to work with your siblings all the time. You, like, you don't get a break from them. And that can get reall annoying. 
>> But there's also a lot of positives. 
>> I mean, you get to do a lot of cool things that most kids don't get to do. 
>> Some of my friends often want to come over and help out. They come over and they bag soap, and we talk. And we all have a lot of fun. 
>> The family says the proteins in the milk make for better, richer soap. 
>> The goats are really a part of our family. 

[00:13:45]


>> There are some who are mischievous, some are sweet, some are meaner than the other ones, and they all definitely have different personalities. 
>> I'm extremely proud of my parents and my family. We've worked so hard to get to where we are, and I just, I'm really proud that we've been able to get to where we are. 
>> No question about it, thanks to great teamwork, this family business is an "udder" success. 
>> It shouldn't come as a surprise that the more nervous you feel before taking a test, the less likely you'll do well. Dr. Sian beilock is a psychologyprofessor at the university of chicago. Her book "choke" gives insights on how stress affects us. 
>> Well, there's actually a simple technique for coping with the stress -- it's writing. My research found that students who write about their feelings of anxiety or stress for just 10 minutes before their exam actually perform better on tests. It has to do with the prefrontal cortex. That's the area your brain that sits right above your eyes. Your working memory is housed there. You can think of it as a mental scratch paat helps you work through complex problems. When worries in, your working memory becomes overloaded, and that can cause you to cave in to the pressure. But when you write about your feelings, you're giving yourself an opportunity to express those worries. This actually frees up space in your head. Writing can also give you insights into what specifically is stressing you out. So the next time you have a big test, take a few minutes. Write about your feelings. It should make all the difference. 
>> I guess you can call that the "write" way to te a test. Thanks, dr. Beilock. 
>> You're welcome. And good luck on your next test. 
>> To mark our 10th year on tv, each week, we take a look back at one of the stories we've covered. 
>> It's a truck that goes off-road. Wayoff-road. This is a boston duck. It's a truck that's not afraid to get wet. 
>> This is, I believe, our 12th season on the boston duck tours. 

[00:15:48]


>> We took a special ride on the boston duck tour. It's a way to see the city from land and water in the same vehicle. The ducks were around long before this tour began. They go all the way back to world war ii. And what is a boston duck? 
>> A boston duck is basically a world war ii amphibious landing craft that has been converted into a touring vehicle. So we take people around the city of boston on land and then also into the charles river. These vehicles were used for a lot of different things during world war ii. And mainly they were used as a supply vehicle because they could take supplies from ships onto the mainland. 
>> The amphibious trucks became KNOWN AS "DUKWs." Originally designed by general motors, the duck was 31 feet long and 8 feet wide. That's over three times the size of your average s.U.V. It weighed 6???? tons, even though it had no armor. It traveled 50 miles per hour on land and 6 miles per hour in water. It's a challenge for the tour's con-duck-tors. [Conductors] 
>> they're pretty interesting to drive 'cause you are basically driving a military tank through boston traffic, which can be challenging at times. 
>> So is it kind of a pain 'cause it's so slow? Sometimes you do wish it had a little more pick-up on land. 
>> For the tour's passengers, it's the perfect speed to take in the historic boston sights. In boston, I'm tyler for "teen kids news." 

[00:18:25]


>> It's one thing to playa video game, but it's a whole different learning experience to be able to createa video game. Diyu met some students who are doing just that. 
>> Well, my game is, basically, this guy has been robbed, and he comes home and he sees his house is a mess and his money's gone. And he's been left a ransom note, so he has go all over. And he goes to the city to, like, defeat the robber and to get all of his money back. 
>> But the story is just the beginning. It takes s.T.E.M. To get things moving... That's why these students are part of a nationwide competition. 
>> The national s.T.E.M. Video-game challenge was inspired by president obama's "educate to innovate" initiative with the hopes of calling folks' attention to the need for more science, technology, engineering, and math educatio in the country. 
>> The challenge is issued every year to students and teachers. They're going after recognition and prizes like computer equipment. 
>> Today, you know, you're still working on your game. You have, essentially, until thursday. 
>> For some students, the competition is an eye-opening experience. 
>> Before this challenge, i didn't really like math or science. I thought they were kind of boring. 
>> Once you get kids involved in creating games, they are learning s.T.E.M., But they're also learning a lot of other 21st-CENTURY SKILLS, LIKE Leadership and teamwork, and they're getting critical thinking and all these other things that come along with it in that package. 
>> It's a team effort. Students start by brainstorming concepts that would make a good game. 
>> And part of the process is that they have to come up with a design document first, where they basically map out the whole idea for the game and they have to come up with a story line and all that. 
>> These kids are learning basic engineering. Every step requires figuring out what works and what doesn't. Becoming an engineer is a smart career to consider. They're in great demand by all sorts of companies. 

[00:20:30]


>> So, wherever we go, engineers are critical in terms of solving some of our biggest problems in the world. 
>> When you work and study and excel... 
>> The competition top winners are celebrated in washington, d.C. You can find out more by following the link on our website. But truly, every kid who develops more s.T.E.M. Skills has reason to be proud. 
>> I kind of was into science. I didn't like math as much. But now I see that it's actually really interesting. 
>> It doesn't even feel like a working class. It's more about having fun, and trying your best, and it's a good experience. 
>> And that's exactly the reason behind the s.T.E.M. Video-game challenge. For "tkn," I'm diyu. 
>> Hey, everyone, there's still time to enter toshiba's ExploraVision. It's a science competition that asks you to imagine new technology for the future. Open to all students from kindergarten to 12th grade. Projects are due by january 31st. JUST CHECK OUT exploravision.org To get started.

[car crashing] 
>> It's a bedtime story many of us grew up with -- "peter pan." But did you ever wonder how peter became the boy who wouldn't grow up? As emily reports, delighted audiences are finding out eight times a week, including twice on wednesdays and saturdays. 
>> When I was a boy, I wished i could fly. 
>> The play is called "peter and the starcatcher." It imagines a time when peter pan was a lonely orphan. While aboard a ship, he meets a girl named molly with a magical secret. 
>> I'm a starcatcher. 
[ Magical tones ] we have special powers that we use in secret to keep starstuff m tyrants who try to rule the world. 
>> The original story about peter pan was written by j.M. Barrie in 1902, and it was written for adults. But the book became a children's classic, and this play is packing in the teens. 
>> Oh, it was really, really funny. 
>> It was so creative, and i wanted to keep seeing more. 
>> It was just hilarious. 
>> I think it's perfect for teens, and some of the best people at the stage door have been teenagers. Peter pan and my character are 13 years old. There's a lot of our qualities that I think resonate with teenagers. 
>> Celia gave me a quick tour of the theater. We went under the stage, through a sea of costumes, and then back up again. 
>> Do you want to see my dressing room? 
>> Sure. Even though celia is the starcatcher, there's no star hanging on her dressing room door. 
>> There are no, sort of, "stars" of the show, which is actually something that I really like about this piece, is that it's an ensemble. Everybody does everything. 

[00:25:31]


>> There's more than 100 different roles in the play, and they're all performed by only 12 actors. 
>> And we are lords 
>> and captains. 
>> Mothers. 
>> Orphans. 
>> Sailors. 
>> Pirates. 
>> Tropical kings. 
>> It's actually some of the most fun I've ever had in my young, short career. 
>> It's not just the actors who have fun. The set designers are pretty playful, as well. For example, the arch around the stage is handcrafted from household objects. Look closely and you'll see the designs are made from things like flyswatters, corks, forks, and garden tools. 
>> It's a really bare stage, so we're responsible for creating the entire world, visually and atmospherically. 
>> And that gets to the heart of "peter and the starcatcher." It's all about using your imagination. Peter must use his to rescue a trunk filled with magical starstuff. And the audience has a role to play, as well. 
>> And use your thoughts to hoist the sails. 
>> That's the great thing about the theater. Everyone brings their imagination. It's the one thing that we carry with us that nobody can take away. 
>> I spoke with the play's writer at the legendary theater restaurant, sardi's. 
>> What's wonderful about the theater is that in the theater, I can say, "see this sword? I'm gonna fight you with it." And you're gonna react as though it's a sword. 
>> The story of peter pan is over 100 years old. Why has it stayed so popular? 
>> Well, how would you feel if someone came home and said, "you never have to have a bedtime, and you never have to have any chores, and you never have to have any homework, and you get to do whatever you want. And you're always going to be as beautiful as you are right now." Does that sound good? That's why. 
>> Can you keep a secret? 
>> Yes, I can. But here's one secret I want everyone to know. "Peter and the starcatcher" is a musical that's truly magical. For "tkn," I'm emily.

=======================================================

His presidential race and both campaigns are running around. A presidential marathon and the finish linthe white house. 
>> I'm toure. "The cycle" is bringing to you from our loins. 
>> I'm taking you to "the politico" twilight ne. 
>> All that plus dr. Jay, governor ed rendell and we're crunching the numbers. "The cycle" is going big on this SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 3rd, 2012. 
>>> Good special saturday cycle to you. And we are finally here. The ninth inning of the politics as baseball cycle game and to quote my fellow play-by-play man keith jackson, whoa nelly. 
[ Laughter ] anyway the national poll shows a virtual tie with the pre[ident having a slight but persistent lead in some of the key battleground states. He has to close the deal. The deal is in the midwest. The candidates, their wives and running mates are covering eight battleground states in total today. We start by taking to you home base. Mike, the president hits four states. What's his closing argument? 
>> We got ourselves a barn burner. I'm sitting here home alone. In the words of keith jackson and the words of david axelrod, his closing argument and this is the most memorable quote is coming from his loins. We saw the president come in late tonight. He was back out on the road early this morning. He stopped apartment fema one more time, back to helicopter, back to joint base andrews, back in air force one. He landed in mentor, ohio, that's northern ohio. In terms. Closing argument, it's the same, basically the same stump speech but with that last final frenzy, that last bit of energy now that boston these candidates are giving it with just three days to go. Let's go over the president's schedule. He started in ohio. They are in milwaukee at this point waiting for the president. He's airborne heading in that direction towards wisconsin. Iowa and virginia. He end up in virginia and northern virginia tonigh I'll be out there accompanied by the dave matthews band. I'm looking forward to it. Tomorrow sunday in new hampshire. Florida. Ohio. Back to ohio and colorado. Monday wisconsin, guess where, ohio after that. And then iowa before he finishes up in chicago where he will spelection eve. Ohio we should mention nbc news and the marist organization yesterday put out their poll for ohio has the president up six. A whopping margin compared to what we've seen in the past. Our poll even has the president upwo in florida. So the obama team certainly optimistic and down the stretch they come to keep that sports metaphor going. 

[00:03:19]


>> Love it. Thank you. 
>> As for the challenger mitt romney needs to rally his troops and out gun the president's skilled operation. Ter zand certificate on a plane right now with the romney campaign. He called this report for us right before takeoff. 
>> Reporter: Two stops down, three more to go today asart of the 72 hour finalprint for mitt romney here in dubuque, iowa there's been a unique opportunity on the campaign plane as we prepare to board for colorado. Several of the governor's top advisers are traveling with the campaign today. Of course predictions about what will happen on tuesday. There's a sense they are soaking these final hours of a campaign that many of them have been working on during the course of the last five years. The governor here again offering bipartisan themes. He has tried to draw attention to the president's comments from yesterday in ohio we said not to boo but encouraged voters to vote. Sayingfor revenge. Romney said vote for love of your country. To ge you a sense of where this campaign stands as they look forward, the former governor of utah is traveling one of the first times with the campaign today. He's in charge of what's called the romney readiness pre-transition process as they prepare for a potential administration in his words. Like building a ship that you hope will set sail. That's the latest from here in dubuque. Back to you. 
>> In about 30 minutes we'll hear from paul ryan, campaigning mitt romney in battleground virginiaome state. Must be slightly awkward for him today given politi's exclusive story saying ryan wasn't romney ace first choice for vp, it was chris christie. So jonathan what do you make of these reports, your out let there. Politico saying romney was planning on going with christie and after his trip to israeling changed his mind? 

[00:05:29]


>> There was a significant intrigue going on even as these candidates are rumbling, stumbling and bumbling around the country in the last week if I can borrow your keith jackson refrain there. 
>> Can you have it, actually. I don't think I'll be doing that again. 
>> Mike allen and jim from politico reported chris christie was the number one choice for mitt romney at one point, he went to london for the olympics, came back and ended up picking paul ryan. There's a lot of bad blood right now between the romney campaign and the chris christie folks and we're seeing that spill out here right in the last couple of days. 
>> You know, let me inject. I've not plugged into the romney campaign like "the politico" guys. Ow about christie. I'm skeptical of the idea that there ever was a moment when romney was going to pick christie for this. It seems cute that it's coming out at this moment. Jonathan I want to ask you about demographics heading in to this tuesday. Seems like there's basically a test that we're going to find out. Can obama win re-election with a historically small share of the white vote which basically means will the nonwhite vote share of the electorate rise to new levels that will allow him to survive, like latino support and black support. Obama people say hey turn out among blacks and la zwroins will be as high in 2008 and republicans saying no it won't. Do you have a sense who is right in that dispute? 
>> Increasingly what you've seen a department coalition over the years that has been built on african-americans, hispanic, women. We see the huge gap, gender gap between barack obama and mitt romney. And some white men and incronly you see republican party that's the majority, large majority of white men and a gap on the other side. So that is a test, I think we'll see. One of the questions about all the polls we've seen are the models they are using correct. Is itng to be 75% white electorate? Is it 77%? 72%? Is the hispanic share of the electorate going to be 7%, 10%, 12%? So I think we'll get those answers to those questions. An interest ago side to that story about chris christie today, there was a romney official quoted anonymously in that story talking about how ohio is the onlytate where mitt romney's gender gap among men, his advantage among men is not bigger than his gender deficit among women. Which seems to be a concession from that official at least that he's losing ohio because obviously all of the voters are either men or women. 

[00:08:19]


>> Excellent analysis there. 
>> The voters are either men or women. There you go. Throughout this campaign the democratic brand has been above water and more popular than the gop brand which has been consistently under water and less popular than the democratic brand. The entire t in this whole campaign. It's not just a party i.D. Issue. Not just akin or mourdock. Do you think the gop brand is drag romney down just enough? 
>> Well I think a few years ago congressman tom davis of virginia had talked about this basically saying the gop brand was dog food. I th it's better than it was then. I do think that -- look I think romney has had a lot of things overcome in terms above signatureses tha he took in the primary when he talked about being severely conservative. Not necessarily theepublican brand but perhaps the conservative wing of the republican party was hard for him to make that pivot to the middle. We'll find out on tuesday if that was an insurmountable obstacle or he wrangled free from. Public officials are held in low esteem. All you have to look at is congressional approval ratings to understand americans don't have a lot of fate in their officials. 
>> The president has been reing the line don't boo, vote at rallies. He's tacked on another adage and mitt romney has respond. Let's take aisten to that. 
>> At the time the republican congress any senate candidate by the name of mitt romney -- no, no, no. Don't boo, vote. Vote. Voting ie best revenge. 
>> Speaking to an audience he said voting is the best revenge. He told his supporters voting for revenge. Vote for revenge. Let me tell you what I would like to tell you. Vote for love of country. 

[00:10:22]


>> Aside from giving mitt romney a nice opportunity to sound patriotic what do you think obama meant by revenge? Romney has not been president. He hasn't inflicted any policies on anyone. Revenge for merely running against him? Is it revenge for challenging him? What do you think? 
>> I think there's a real question, ther revenge for what? Mitt romney hasn't been a president of the united states. He wasernor of massachusetts, so maybe if you were talking to a massachusetts audience which the president wasn't there might be something to feel like you have a revenge against. I'm not sure what he meant. Seems like an odd way to talk about voting. However, I do think the president has spent the last couple of days trying to fire up his base. I think his message has been much more tailored to that even the talk youe hearing from his aides, david axelrod, his energy is coming from his loins which axelrod said which is the crudest thing I've ever heard anybody say about a sitting president. Is this base motivation stuff. Romney seems to be trying to make that end of campaign sale to themiddle. >>T me just say do I not have a hard time seeing what obama meant right there. He was connecting romney to a republican party that for instance presented a jobs bill. Refused to cooperate, refused to critic. Republican party obstructed just about the entire obama agenda for the last four years. The republican party whose leader in the senate -- 
>> it's an inspiring message to get revenge on people you've never met. 
>> It is a response to a republican senate leader who said his first priority was defeating barack obama for re-election. His first priority as a leader in the legislative branch the office defeat barack obama. 
>> So get revenge for something he said four years ago. 
>> Spent four years obstructing the agenda. I know what he said. 
>> Dr. Jay thanks for hanging with us on saturday. Up next our weekend cycle. Both candidates taking the race to iowa and that's our state of the day as "the cycle" rolls on LIVE FROM DEMOCRACY PLAZA.-??]??9???????? L@??o N????wyg??!nB w w wt<@m=m=m=o?>??kFokDr 

[00:16:12]


>> You can look at my record. You can see I can bring change. I helped bring it. The difference between us he made promises he couldn't keep. I am making promises I have kept and I will keep them for the american people. 
>> Duking it out in dubuque. At mitt romney in dubuque, iowa where the president will campaign tonight. Here at the cycle we've been examining the most important states for this year's presidential election. Today we take a hard look at the state that starts the race and might end it, iowa. It's known foreclose elections, carries six electoral votes and of all the swing states it has the best economy by far. According to real clear politics poll average president obama is currently leading by two points. With political ads running across the state 24/7 how will iowa shake out on tuesday? Guys I think iowa is weird state. We can all agree. 
>> No, no. I have friends in iowa. 
>> I liken to it the new hampshire of the midwest. There's a real strong independent streak there and it's hard to pin down their political leanings. I know you'll get into that in a little bit. But I just wanted to bring up a blog post that jeffrey anderson had at the weekly standard. He was talking about turnout. In 2008 democrats had a one. 
-- One-point advantage. In the point of this post was i have to think that will tighten. If there's good news for iowa for mitt romney, it's that turnout probably won't be as great for democrats as it was in 2008. And I think that, you know, the tiny margin in '08 that 1% at one point has republicans thinking that iowa is gettabl and it's why you've seen them sort of run into the state with an increased ground game. 

[00:18:18]


>> I was in iowa last year and i like to play this game where i say why should iowa be first in the nation. And they get very upset. They take their role in politics very seriously and they really try to know everything about the candidates. This is a very serious political state. I want has a progressive tradition. Eve gone for a democrat four of the last five times only for bush in '04. We thent for gore, clinton twice and this is a state not feeling the pain. 5% unemployment. They didn't have the foreclosure problem. They are a prosperous state. The recession skips over iowa. They are liking obama. 
>> Whatever happens, whoever wins and we did our election maps and I have iowa going to obama, iowa is a state where romney will have his best gains IN THE COUNTRY WHERE john McCain didn't in 2008. This was a 10 or 11 point race in 2008. Now two, three, four would be a lot for obama. You can go back to 2004, bush won a squeaker. In 2000 gore won it by 4,000. Iowa is two states. We say it's a progressive tradition. There's a ton of social conservative, religious social conservatives in western iowa and there's also a lot of these white working class middle class voters as a demo brafic have turned hard on obama across t country. Iowa, they are particularly pronounced in that state. A lot more for romney to work with. Your point is key, I mentioned this last week on the show. IN THE 1980s IOWA WAS AN Exception. The national economy was strong. Farm economy collapsed in iowa and iowa took it out on george bush sr. We might see the opposite where the economy is weak in a lot of places but stronger in iowa. 
>> Iowa voted for revenge. Interesting. 
>> Great reason to vote. 
>> To your point that's why the social consciences that's why mike huckabee and rick santorum do well in iowa. I don't think obama or romney are well suited to iowa. Did I just say ohio? I meant iowa. 

[00:20:24]


>> Iowa. 
>> Anyway, I don't think eat of those candidates are particularly well suited because there's a strong populace strain in iowa politics. I ultimately do havet going blue if you look at the polls. Romney has never led in iowa, interestingly even though as you pointsed out the democrats held a slight advantage in voting in registration numbers in 2008. They are turning out the same number in terms of early votes. They have a 60,000 vote advantage this year at this time versus in 2008 which is the same. So I think ultimately it is going to go to president obama. 
>> I have it going red but, again, I think we put up that chart of presidential voting history since 1972 it's picked republican president five times, a democrat president five times. Guess this is like the rubber match. Just quickly want to note that yesterday I laid down some smack is wt I did. 
>> A group smack down. 
>> I spoke forhe group. Yes. When I made some intimidating remarks. Take a look. With all due respect mr. Mayor, what the hell your thinking? Heartbroken residents of the five boroughs do not want to watch out of towners jog through their neighborhood as they dig out of wreckage. So do the right thing postpone this race mayor bloomberg. So you're welcome obviously. It was reported that they cancelled the marathon due to noise. 
>> My favorite part -- 
>> I'm noisy. 
>> Was the e-mail from s.E. Who said I'm drunk with power. 
>> I'm drunk with power. 
>> So, you were noise that made the mayor said enough. 
>> I'm going to take this opportunity I'm calling on the sun to set in the west today. Listen to me sun and do it. We'll have a follow up on monday. 

[00:22:32]


>> Ridiculous. 
>> Up next the one, the only ed rendell he'll join us from his home state battleground pennsylvania. Can romney still take it or said lock for obama. Cycle on with us live from democracy plaza. ?????? ??????

In the guest spot I call him biggy small, former pennsylvania governor ed rendell. Governor, hope the eagles aren't getting you down. >>. 
>> It's little depressing. Guys, listening to you guys it's clear this election has lasted at least a week too long. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> fair point. 
>> All right. 
>> Okay. All right. We'll take that with the love aassume that it's meant with. 

[00:27:01]


>> It is. You guys have been heroic but you shot your bulb. It's done. 
>> All right. Thank you, sir. Look peninsula is a diverse state, it's urban and rural, black and white. It seems like a little american in a lot of ways. When I look at this election we see obama is about to get crushed among white voters but about to dominant with black and brown voters which may carry him over the goal line. Are we at a place in america where white america can get together pick a candidate and still not get what they want? 
>> I think we've reached that place. To say that it's white america all for romney and against obama is wrong. President obama will win pennsylvania if he toes and i think he will is in the philadelphia suburbs which are predominantly 85%, 90% white. That's where you have progressive democrats in the suburbs become being increasingly democrat. You got the last of the moderate republicans and a lot of independents as well. And they are voters who are intelligent, they care about the environment, they care about social justice, they care about causes like women's right to choose, et cetera. And those white voters will stay with the president in significant numbers and that's what will bring him to victory in pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is a state with about a 10% to12% african-american population and about a 6% to 8% latino population. So white voters still dominate pennsylvania and you got to get your share. The president does. The president in '08 when he carried this state by 11 points he lost 11 out of the 12 southwestern pennsylvania traditionally democratic counties which are all essentially blue collar, white working class counties where they are pretty much pro gun and fairly conservative democrats. But he still won the state by 11 points. 
>> Governor, I've seen a lot of smart people say and write obama can't lead romney can work across the aisle that's why we should go for romney. Which of course builds, plays in to the strategy of obstruction. Republicans refuse to work with obama, making him seem like he can't lead and romney gets to come in and says I'll break the gridlock which ultimately is a strategy which rewards obstruction and says there's no pain for it, this is horrific behavior it's okay we'll reward it. Do you understand why smart people would look at what's actually going on in washington and add it up that way and not want to punish the republicans for obstruction? 

[00:29:38]


>> No. I really can't. When you think about it, the president gets criticized for not reaching across the aisle. WHAT DID mitch McConnell say early on in the first year of president obama's presidency. Our number one goal is to make sure barack obama is he's a one term president. He's been faced with resistance by republicans. Contrast that to george w. Bush. His major initiatives, warn iraq, medicare part d and no child left behind had substantial democratic support. In no child left behind, the leading liberal in the senate ted kennedy joining with president bush to push no child left behind. Contrast tha to the way the republicans treed barack obama and you see the total hypocrisy of that claim. 
>> Governor, philadelphia aside obama's biggest drop off has been among middle to upper class suburban women. Why do you think that is? You know the state. 
>> Because the economy is not doing well. Pennsylvania's economy has taken a nose dive since I left. When I left -- well truth is truth. When I left we were 7.4% unemployment, almost two points below the national average. We're now above the national average by a third of a point. So, it's significant. But the economy has not done well and suburban women are conscious of the economy. You'll know right away in pennsylvania, you don't have to look far to see whether this will be a close race. Just look at the turnout in philadelphia. If the turnout approaches '08 levels it's katie bar the door, philadelphia will give obama so many votes there's no way the rest of the state can come pen st. Two the philadelphia suburbs. Unless mitt romney is running close to even in a couple of those four suburban or five suburban counties, he has no chance to win the state. I'm not saying it won't happen but I think it's unlikely. 

[00:31:49]


>> Me too. 
>> What I thought the romney camp -- I thought the romney campaign made a big mistake after his first debate if he went to pennsylvania spent $4 million a week, came to the state, he and ryan came to the state five or six time he might have put the state in play. You can't do it in seven days. It's just not possible. 
>> Governor, that's what I can't figure out because for the longest time we've been talking about this narrow electoral path that romney has. He has to win either ohio or wisconsin and we've seen in the last week they are not making the kind of headway there they need. There's this late push in pennsylvania. We've seen polling in the last couple of weeks showing michigan a state obama won by 16 points now down to single digit. Minnesota, it could be in I'm astounded the romney campaign with all the money hit or more pble to the point the money the super p.A.C.S had never tried to lay the ground work. 
>> It is astounding considering the money they had and considering they had the brightest political strategist in the country in karl rove. Where was karl rove in those states after that first debate. He should have jumped on these states anticipate as soon as they saw momentum pennsylvania went from 9 to 6 pretty fast. There was momentum. There was momentum in michigan. I wouldn't have waited until the last week especially because it's not a question resource. They have the money. You show see what's going on in pennsylvania now. It's ludicrous. We have back-to-back ads against president obama from the various super p.A.C.S. That's wasted because you compressled knit to one week. By the way in a week wre president obama probably had his best independent week in the end news, the real news of the campaign. You know, they are trashing president obama while he's looking like what is it 78-8 people think he's done a good job on hurricane sandy. It's tough with that type of week it's just -- it gets enough. Now I think the only hope for the romney folks is let's say this ad blitz stimulates their base and they come out in pennsylvania in numbers that they were not likely to come out in before. And the obama base still remains over confident or lethargic, et cetera. I don't think that's going to happen. I think ofa still has an excellent ground operation. I've been going around to ofa staging places the last couple of days. And the ofa people are fired up. There hasn't been that much activity visible as of but in the last four days they can do a lot. They got a very, very good organization. So I think the odds are very difficult for romney here. 

[00:34:36]


>> Governor, you just mentioned hurricane sandy. I want you to quickly weigh in president obama and chris christie bromance. Robert mourdock said christie needs to redeclare for romney or take the blame for the next four years. Do they need to reto their vow? 
>> If I were the romney campaign and believe me I'm not -- my advice is obviously from a tainted source but if I were, i would give chris to come in to pennsylvania and appear with governor romney. I think that, number one, would be good for chris christie's future in the republican party and two at least meet some of the appearance of him being with president obama. I think rupert mourdock had a moment of sanity. A brief moment of sani. 
>> All right. Governor ed rendell thank you very much. 
>> Thanks guys. Hang in there. 
>> Thank you. From biggy small to nate dog. Right ahead nate the number cruncher is take a break from his saturday cartoons and talks about what he calls the popular vote nightmare. don "are you a cool mom?" I'm gonna find out.

[00:39:10]


>>> With the aftermath of sandy possibly affecting voter turnout in the traditionally blue northeast another storm forecast in the area election forecasters fear we may have a popular vote electoral college split. You've heard that possibility first floated by someone who is wearing gray sweaters all week on this show a while back. Nate cohen is taking it a step further. He laid out a detailed scenario, vote turnout nightmare. Let me ask you first about the popular vote issue. What we've talked about on this show before is the idea that obama is sort of underperforming in democratic states, he's going win anyway, he's had more of a falloff in blue states than elsewhere and that could drag down his national popular vote total. Do you think there's potential then when you add in the hurricane and the logistical issues that come out of that that further depresses turnout in new jersey or something and affects the national popular vote? 
>> I do think the blue states would be responsible for obama loss in the popular vote if he was winning the electoral college. There are recent polls out of massachusetts, connecticut and california in the last 24 hours that shows obama losing nine to ten points even more than that t in connecticut off of his 2008 performance and that would represent a pretty substantial decline that's greater than that elsewhere in the country. In terms of the hurricane it's hard to say. I'm not sure about what areas are affected. The atlantic coast of new jersey is not in aemocratic area. Staten island will vote for romney. Suffolk county, new york is divided. Don't know how much turnout will fall on the city of new york. If I want does it would make a difference. 
>> Democrats are contesting on the shore, there's talk maybe the republican areas hardest hit there. I want to ask you another thing about the battleground. I took a look this morning and it seems there's basically a fire wall here that obama has on tuesday that involves three states, ohio, wisconsin, and nevada. If romney won basically everything else that's up for grabs in not these three states he would be short of 270. He would have 267. If you look at the clear averages in these three states these are persistent leads. Ohio, wisconsin, nevada. Are we at a point where the only hope for romney there's something wrong in the method oflg these state polls? 

[00:41:40]


>> I think we're about at that point opinion he has a couple of days left for him to make a come back. There isn't a single poll, a single nonpartisan poll in ohio, wisconsin or nevada that shows romney in the lead. And, yes, you know the polls have been wrong before and it's conceivable that things can be off. You can ask about sharon engel if polls are right. The overwhelming majority of the time when someone holds a lea of this magnitude, this consistently, they wine up winning. And, you know, there are reasons to think the polls could be off. It's tough to talk to people on cell phones. Assumptions about turn out are more important than ever. But, yeah, you're right I think the polls have to be wrong at this state level. 
>> Polls ask who are you going to vote for but there's data around polls who do you think will win and that's extraordinarily predictive. Why is that question s predictive when we make people into mini anthropologists. 
>> It's what people are hearing. People are hearing stuff about romney. The average person, you know, has an idea that the president is still pretty popular. That makes them think that, you know, most voters or swing voters will tilt a little more in obama's direction. That has an effect on swing voters. Not in a direct sense that they think obama will win but the balance of information that people are hearing out there is the same information that will sway swing voters. It makes sense it would be a pretty decent relationship between the actual results and what people think. 
>> Nate, I got to be honest. I care little for polls. Let's gossip instead. I'm sure you've seen some of the blow back against the other nate for some of his predictions. I want to put up tweet who said the degree to which people put their faith in nate silver goes against everything nate silver stands for. She's a fan. You guys have taken on something of a mythic quality like something out of oz or lord of the rings. When did you number crunchers become like rock stars? 

[00:44:01]


>> Well, I don't think there's anything mythical or magical about it. The poll says obama will win in the swing states. Nate silver says obama is ahead in the swing states and win the electoral college. The polls are usually right. The model acknowledges the polls could be wrong. That chance is at 15% based on the same sort of analysis I gave earlier that look there are a few examples when the polls are off this much. Ken buck, sharon engel, hilary and obama in new hampshire but more the exception than rule therefore obama is the favorite. If obama wins I don't think that makes, you know, nate silver or myself or anyone else who stairs at the polls and says obama is favored, you know, being incredibly insightful. Polls are right and pollsters get the credit. If obama loses I don't think nate silver should be panned out. I don't think either. 
>> Never pan you. 
>> You could use your wizardry to answer this question. Isn't it quite possible at this point in terms of electoral college when you're looking at the key battleground states the president has a lead in most them. Isn't it possible the president will win the electoral college in a landslide. 
>> I don't think it would constitute a landslide. But it's easy tsee how grab gets to 303 or 332. By bush-gore standards it's a landslide. Pretty middle of the road. 
>> In speaking of that you have reviewed all of our map. We have made your own electoral college picks and you chose a favorite using your wizardry. 
>> Yeah. I thought that your map actually was the best. 
>> Hey. 
>> Sorry guys. 

[00:46:02]


>> Landslide prediction. 
>> Don't necessarily think this is the best map because I agree wildfirery state here. I don't think that obama is favored in florida and colorado and virginia strike me as coin flips. But there's a consistency that's, you know, evident in your map. Obama is probably likely to win both colorado and virginia if he wins either of them and if obama wins florida he's probably going to win say virginia and that i think complicates some of the other maps and steve's instance I think he showed obama ling colorado but winning virginia and I think that's possible but unlikely. I think s.E. Was right focus on new hampshire and iowa as potential areas of weakness for obama but gosh the polls are getting out of hand for romney in wisconsin. He's down by like seven or eight points in wisconsin. 
>> I'm counting on cheese heads across the state to pull it out for romney those. 
>> Nate, I've been sticking up for your but after that if you guys are wrong next week you are discredited. Thanks for joining us nate cohn. Up next politico twi light zone. Exploring alternate, election day realities. One of them is pretty scary. Keep it here on msnbc, with nonstop politics from here to election day. 

[00:50:50]


>>> In today's back spin, we enter into the political twilight zone. What would washington look like with mitt romney in the white house? How about democrats in full control of congress? 
>> No. 
>> Or crazier still, donald trump winning the write-in vote. So I was thinking about what would happen if romney were to win and either republicans take control of the senate or democrats take control of the senate. And harry reid made some news this week with a quote. He was talking about romney's argument that he would reach out to democrats and they would be able to work together. He said mitt romney's fantasy that senate democrats will work with him to pass his severely conservative agenda is laughable. 
>> Ouch. 
>> I tend to agree with harry reid, not only because romney said on day one the first thing he is going to do is repeal obama care, which democrats care very deeply about and will fight the hold on to, but if romney wins, it's going to be this vindication of this stregy of obstructionism. I think democrats may not go to the extent of holding the country hostage over raising the debt ceiling, but I think they will try to employee some of the same tactics. 
>> I think the underreported story of october was for the period when the odds of mitt romney winning increased, multaneously the odds of the republicans winning back the senate decreased. The chances are very good the democrats will hold on to the senate. If romney somehow wins this thing next week and the republicans were to win the house, they needed the slimmest majority and they can pass through reconciliation. If the democrats win, it's going to be tougher to advance. The flip side is if obama is elect and the republicans still have control of the house, i think the big gain there for democrats is they consolidate what they achieved in the last four years, and obama will then have leverage in dealing with this fiscal cliff. I don't like that term, but the fiscal cliff, and he will be able to make a stand and finally get rid of the bush rates, at least for the high earners. That will be a big difference. 
>> Something has to happen. 

[00:52:50]


>> If obstruction is rewarded, he will be emotionally hurt. It will bother me deeply. I wouldn't blame harry reid for obstructing in response. It's not right. I shouldn't feel that way. He shouldn't do that. I don't like the republicans did it. So we shouldn't do it back. But I wouldn't blame him. 
>> Revenge! 
>> Absolutely. I don't think the democrats can do it. I don't think that we are idealogically unified in that way. And we talk about that republicans like stand on principle, and democratic voters like stand on compromise. Go for compromise. That's not what the democrats are about. I don't know if they are going to be able to do that. 
>> Well, I just had a to-do list. Whoever is elected, we'll start with obama, I have a to do list. If we can put it up on the screen. Should it look pretty familiar to his supporters, because it's all of the things that he promised to do and hasn't, from cutting the deficit, lowering the debt, reducing dependency on foreign oil, address home foreclosures, reclose income inequality, reduce poverty, get tough in iran, reform social security and medicare. These are things that I think are important to a wide swath of americans. I would add to that list answer questions on benghazi. But I'll put up my to-do list for romney. It's the same -- it's the same list. These are the things that I want to get done that haven't been addressed I think as full throatedly as they should have been over the past four years. And now they're even more dire. So I hope both guys are watching, and these are the things that they focus on. 
>> Can I see your gary johnson to-do list? 
>> Shoot! 
>> Sorry, gary johnson. I totally shortchanged him there. 
>> And I do think -- I think steve made a really important point here that if the president is reelected, one of the questions has been the house is likely to stay republican. The senate is likely to stay democratic. People are justifiably frustrated with how slow progress has been. Tory said, I agree with that assessment because republicans said on day one we are not going to work with this president. What would be different in a second term. And I think your point that things have to happen because of the way legislatively things are coming down, the bush tax cuts expiring. 

[00:55:00]


>> Right. 
>> Sequestration, something has to happen with that. 
>> That's the only thing. My issue is this. Beyond that, for obama to be able to get something done with the republican congress next term, this election needed to deliver a message to republicans. They need to cooperate. And I think if they lose, the only conclusion they're going to draw is hurricane sandy cost it for us. 
>> All right that wraps it up for "the cycle" from democracy plaza. We will see you right back on monday. Tamron hall is straight ahead with a second weekend edition of "newsnation." ?????? ??????

Another using ohio as his airline hub. He's using all the hot spots trying to rally his base and any undecided voters he thinks are left. Governor romney is ao racing against the clock, tweaking his argument. And in case you forgot, we'veve got more than two guys running on tuesday, tonight we'll break down all of the battles, particularly for congress and who will decide control of it and what the next president can get done. Good evening from democracy plaza. It's saturday, november 3, 2012. This is a prime time edition of "the daily rundown." We're taking a look at how we got here. Presidential elections that aren't close are actually odd. No republican has gotten more than 300ctoral votes since 1988. Only four democrats in history have gotten more than 53% of the vote. Bottom line, this is 1976 meets 2000 meets 2004. In other words, it's a very close race. So how did we get here? The president began this campaign weighed down by a troubled economy and still faces a jobless rate higher than any incumbent seeking re-election since fdr. In the president's first six months there was a lot of money spent some of it by choice, most of it by need. The wall street bail dpts out, the federal stimulus and the auto bailout. At the time most of us said as gm goes, so goes the presidency. 
>> You know this really is a big one. It's kennedy in the steel industry, it's reagan the air traffic controllers. This is a big moment. 
>> And on tuesday, ts race could come down to how that decision has echoed in the state of ohio where government spending wasn't popular and neither was health care. Three cruel summers began with the angry town halls in 2009 that soured the public on the health care law that eventually passed. Of course there was that 2010 bp oil spill which shook faith in government a little bit. Republicans won the house with the largest gain for either party since 1948. 

[00:02:23]


>> This is something that i think every president needs to go through. Now, I'm not recommending for every future president that they took a shellacking like I did last night. 
>> After that, the debt ceiling crisis in 2011. And then the president began to string together a few victories. It started after the 2010 elections reconciling with former president bill clinton who made his debut as a character witness in 2010. In delivering a 1-2 punch that now has become a staple in this campaign. 
>> I've been keeping the first waiting for about half an hour. So I'm going to take off. 
>> I don't want to make her mad. Please go. 
>> You're in good hands. 
>> The president signed the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. He put together a checklist of accomplishments that you hear now on the campaign trail. Withdrawing the finest troops from iraq. 
>> Tonight I can report to the american people and to the world that the unid states has conducted an operation that killed osama bin laden, the leader of al qaeda. 
>> He put together a coalition in building intensity with his combas, by supporting gay marriage, easing immigration rules sms and the obama campaign focused single mindedly on beating mitt romney as early as it could. The president has since caught a few breaks. The job less rate fell blow 8%. The lowest level since the month of the president took office. But tuesday's elections will show was it enough to off-set the president's debate performance in denver? 
>> You know, four years ago i said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president and that's probably a promise that governor romney thinks I've kept. 
>> That said, the president might be in a position of ekeking out. 

[00:04:30]


>> Making sure that health care choices for women are controlled by women, as opposed to -- and I'm going to ask young people to pay for more college. You hear hope and change has been replaced by block and tackle. 
>> Mitt romney's road to election day he dropped out of the presidential race in twoit AND ENDORSED john McCain. From the outside, romney's strength was also a liability. He was a sbash an moderate republican with midwestern roots in a party that some call too conservative, evangelical and republican. As conservatives soured on the idea of a health care mandate, romney tried to inoculate himself ch as governor. He says we can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country and it can be done without letting government take over health care. And it was done without government taking over health care. In june 2011 at a farm in new hampshire, romney officially announced his second bid for the presidency. 
>> Just one of the guys running. 
>> The first element of becoming the front runner was keeping viable challengerers out of the race and one by one they bowed out. Finally the summer of 2011 a viable challenger got in, rick perry. They all surged to leads in the national polls before self destructing. Finally romney ended up one on one with rick satorum. Iowa where romney appeared to eke out an eight-vote win, a few weeks later santorum was declared the victory and then ohio. 

[00:06:31]


>> We are actually looking at recount provisions in the state of ohio. Our models have it that close. 
>> Romney's struggle in ohio was in the 2008 op-ed called for a managed bankruptcy but said the government should only guarantee private loans. Detroit needs a durn around not a check. The piece was titled let detroit go bankrupt. Romney survived the primary gaunt let and let republican super pacs hammer the president on the hair. The campaign spend a lot of time defining romney before romney was able to define obama. He was criticized for taking a week off in july. And for bungling that foreign trip to england, israel and poland. He announced paul ryan as his running mate but tha produce the bump he needed. As the focus of the race turned to medicare and the ryan budget. The republican convention was disrupted by weather and a guy talking to an empty chair. And then mid september, the leaked video of mitt romney's 47% remark surfaced. The first presidential debate, romney bested obama in front of 66 million people and began to benefit from mement tum. And then hurricane sandy hit. On tuesday romney will try to unseat an incumbent president, he's trying to knock a par out of power after just one term. While the president is targeting each part of his coalition with a handful of small arguments, romney is counting on winning the large one. 
>> He made a lot of promises, but those promises he couldn't keep. And the difference between us, he made promises he couldn't keep, I'm making promises I have kept and I will keep them for the american people. 

[00:08:39]


>> So where does that leave us? The two campaigns believe passionately in two different realities. The president obama campaign believes the countries demographics have changed the etor roert in your favor. The romney campaign believes you have the momentum to swing over. It's possible we are headed for a 50/50 split. It all comes down to nine states or seven or five? Whatever the result. Polarization is hardening. The house has changed hands three times in the last two decades. Two of those times have been in the last six years. Red states are getting redder and blue states are getting bluer. The even in the swing states, giving county maps that watch work look if you will. Shifting demographics are changing, the makeup of the electorate in 1980 whites made up nine of every ten voters. But by 2008 that number dropped to 74%. One of tuesday's most important predictors will be that important makeup. It's very possible that the president could win with the lowest share of blue collar whites since 1984 ba the republican party is likely to get the lowest share of latino and african-americans in its history. We're a 50/50 country deciding whether taxes go up or down, how you get health insurance. The fundamental role of government in your life could be decided. The great challenge for the winner will be more divided than we've had in a long time. All right. Now we're going to get into the weeds. Up next, time for a very heavy dose of flova. Thiew from the ground florida, virginia and ohio. Here's a look at the president's schedule. Romney's schedule, looks like he's making some time for the key stone state. And the vice president stopping by "hardball" tomorrow night. We're locked up right here in democracy plaza. Ah. Fire bad! Just have to fire roast these tomatoes. Do you churn your own butter too?

[00:14:21]


>> we need you, virginia. We've got to take back america. I'm counting on you. 
>> They're betting on cynicism. Ohio, I'm betting on you. I'm betting on you. 
>> You have na responsibility, you have that opportunity and on NOVEMBER THE 6th, FLORIDA C Make mitt romney the next president of the united states. 
>> Ladies and gentlemen, with you we can win. We win florida, we win this election! 
>> Well, in 2000 the election turned on the state of florida. In 2004 it was ohio that was the key. In 2008, virginia found itself in the center spotlight. Collectively I've been calling them flohva. Until florida our new poll has president obama up. Ohio we still have the president holding his lead. 51% to 45%. And in a recent poll of likely voters in virginia, the president was up 2 points, a statistical tie and nbc news has it's own coming out tomorrow morning. Look at the ad spending in these three states. Noern half a billion collectively in the mega states of flohva. They're not just spending money there, they're spending time. The president will have visited the sunshine state 14 times, for mitt romney it's 16. President obama will have made 19 stops in ohio, governor romney will be there 21 times. So let's get to our special panel. Adam smith is the political editor, chris booker, wcmh and larry sabado. Larry, let me start with you. The state of virginia, last time it was the closest to the country, the national popular vote. It was the one point off if you WILL OF WHAT OBAMA -- McCAIN'S Numbers were, does the winner of the popular vote win virginia, larry? 

[00:16:44]


>> I think virginia is very very, close, chuck. I think you could argue that virginia is one of the two or three closest states in the country right now. It's funny to have a panel of florida, ohio and virginia. Florida and ohio are used to this attention. They get it every four years. We used to be the bulgaria of american politics and now we've turned into the paris. Or that's how we feel. I would say on the whole, having talked to both sides repeatedly, they both insist that they're trackings show their candidate up a point or two. And I have no reason to disbelief them. That leads me to believe that it's very close. President obama would love to have virginia, because if he gets it, he really blocks most of the reasonable pathways to 270, assuming he keeps ohio and he's clearly ahead there. And governor romney really needs virginia. He's got to have it. 
>> Speaking of gotting to have a state, let's go down to adam smith in florida. You guys had a poll out today, 51-45 that had romney ahead. This seems to be saturday same story that larry is hearing in virginia, I hear in florida, where the two sides insist they're ahead because they believe in two different world views of what the electorate is going to look like. 
>> I hear the same thing that both sides are convinced they're up by a point or two and this is a margin of error race. Today was the last day of early voting in florida. Democrats are up about 104,000 votes over republican votes, but that's significantly less than the advantage they had four years ago. 
>> A number I heard adam was 160, I think, is what somebody told me if they get to 160, 200, somewhere in that range, they think they can win -- that they'll get enough on election day to pull that off. That sounds like they're going to fall short. 
>> It's sounds like they're going to fall short and we've got early voting lines of five hours in more in places like miami. I saw a thound people waiting in line in st. Petersburg today. If they come slightly short, it may not matter in the electoral college but I think there may be cutting back of early election days. 

[00:19:01]


>> Chris booker I know the state made an announcement today, is it over or are still more early vote to come? 
>> There's more early vote to come tomorrow. Obviously sunday is a big day, chuck. You'll have the souls to the polls effort of trying to get out the african-american vote. We have evangelicals coming in. I've heard that rand paul is supposed to be where casick lives, the state of ohio, the effort to get out both sides of the vote which my sources tell me is very very close. 
>> K chris, the jeep ad that vernor romney ran and there is's been some hammering about it quietly, has that been a decisive thing, are we going to look back at this and say romney came up short in ohio because of the jeep ad? 
>> You know, chuck. I ink it's going to be fascinating. You think of one of the earliest decisions that the president made was that auto bailout that that may be the defining issue. And my democrat sources say that it just showed desperation, it smacked of desperation and even some republicans have told me that he needed to take on the auto bailout sooner rather than what happened in this last week with this ad in tledo. 
>> Larry, if you could have only one county to watch, what county would you pick? 
>> Probably lauden county. President obama doesn't have to win it. He did win it four years ago, but he has to come close. Because he needs northern virginia to turn in a very strong performance. 
>> Adam smith, same question to you. If you could only have one county's results in the state of florida. What county do you want? 
>> I wish you could give me three. If I had one I would have to go with hillsborough county. 

[00:21:06]


>> The other two? 
>> Miami and orange county. 
>> You want to know what the gaps would be there. 
>> And chris booker same to you. 
>> Don't you want to see hamilton county went for obama in 2008, but traditional republican stronghold. You would like to see where they break on tuesday. 
>> See, we don't need three states. We've g it down to three counties. Chris booker, larry and adam smith in tampa bay, thank you all. Appreciate it. 
>>> Next up, your "daily rundown" guide what to watch for as the wults came in on tuesday. But first today's trivia yes. Name the only two states that flipped their presidential vote in both 2004 and 2008. Gore, bush and obama. That's your hint. The answer coming up on this special prime time edition of "the daily rundown." We'll be right back. Up. A short word that's a tall order. Up your game. Up the ante. And if you stumble, you get back up. Up isn't easy, and we ought to know. We're in the business of up.

[00:25:28]


>>> Woont to give you an hour by hour viewing guide for the next two days and for election night. Going to deep dive into what states you should be watching and what the early results will tell us about the outcome. First let's set the stage at the look of where the candidates are headed over the remaining days. Three more time sunday, monday and saturday here. It looks like an airline hub for air force 1. He's still getting others in. He's still getting a bit of colorado and florida, but look at this. The final day, on monday. Ohio, wisconsin and iowa. There's a reason for it. Let's take a look at mitt romney's schedule as you can see here. It includes plenty of ohio. He gets there twice. He's throwing in pennsylvania, though. What pennsylvania is, is this a position of strength or is this the ohio insurance policy if it doesn't come through? Use here's the other problem he has because he's also gone to new hampshire a couple of times and he's closing there. Florida and virginia and ohio don't get him to 270. The state of new hampshire would get him to 270. And even if it's florida, virginia and sylvania, he still needs two more going in. Now let's go through the poll closing business here, by 9:00 p.M. Polls will have closed here t and here's the way to look at it. If, say, at 7:00, virginia is too close to call, that's not good news for romney. You have the feeling as if romney is going to overperform the national number by a point or two in virginia. If that's a too-close-to-call state, and we haven't called it by 9:00, I think the folks will be worried. If by 9:00 we haven't called pennsylvania, then suddenly the folks in chicago better be nervous because this is a state that hasn't been on the battleground but the assumption has been there is a built-in vote there thanks to philadia. Now what about quick calls. Let's say if we call florida and virginia fairly quickly. Well, that tells us this could be, and we have not yet called, for instance, ohio and that's too close to call. Well sed evenly that could be a pretty good romney night. Let's do it here. What if we call ohio early. There's going to be a lot of sort of that's the ball game type thing. There are still paths for romney without ohio, but the point is how quickly do we call those states? It's an interesting way to watch the night. Let me quickly of course throw you through a couple of scenarios and what I want to do tonight is sort of what is the most narrow way for things to go and what is the quickest way? The quickest way for the president to get to 270 is ohio and wisconsin. And that's what they're counting on. When we talk about the midwest fire wall, that's what we talk about. So when you've got 34r, he needs all these states. He needs florida, he needs virginia, he needs colorado, and he needs new hampshire and this is a way to do it without ohio. That's the one piece of good news. What if he can't get a wisconsin? Wisconsin would put him over the top. What's his fastest way to get there? You put ohio back over here and he could do it then without colorado and without iowa. So his fastest way to 270 would be florida, virginia, ohio and new hampshire. So there's a way to watch this night. There's a way to watch it before 9:00. What we haven't called can tell you about where the night is headed. Next on the low down on the down ballot races. You're watching a special prime time he designation of "the daily rundown." We'll be right back. ???????????? ???????????? but they haven't experienced EXTRA STRENGTH Bayer Advanced Aspirin.

>>> There are other important races out there that we're watching. 33 senate seats up for grabs. Believe it or not there are sa of them that we think will be decided by less than 10 points. It's the mothe lode of great races. Six are in so-called red states, and three are in blue states. Joining me now, nbc news and editor, charlie cook. This has been a great year for senate races. 
>> Yeah, it's a shame. If this were a mid term election, they would get new credit. 
>> I'm going to put up. What we have is this is base d on the cook map right now. This is everything that's likely that's in red or blue. So we start this way and we have 15 of them. So we're going to quickly run down the ones that you don't have in toss-up anymore but are lean in the presidential states. Hi me. 
>> Pennsylvania. 
>> Tom casey -- tom smith scared bob casey but casey is going to hold. 
>> Ohio? 
>> You skipped on me. 
>> Nevada. 
>> Nevada. Close but to dean heller. 
>> All right. Next one? >> it's closed up but brown wins. 
>> Does he outperform the president by what, two points? 
>> I don't know. 
>> Yeah, yeah. 
>> If you were to guess, it's going to be a tight race? 
>> Florida, nelson beats mak. Then we get to virginia. 
>> Where are you there? 
>> I guess I would give kane maybe a tiny finger on the scale. 
>> Give it to blue? 
>> I don't know. 
>> We'll put it there for now. That gets us through the presidential toss-ups. Let's go to the red states if you will. These are a ton of great states. 

[00:34:07]


>> Flake wins. 
>> Montana, that's scary. Everybody, both sides say it's really too close. 
>> The libtarian candidate is going to make the winning number. 
>> It could. 
>> I guess he gets a couple. This guy john tester up a point or two andhe question is does that save him? Let's do edge er. 
>> All right. Next one? North dakotaight next door. 
>> Berg wins. It's very very close. 
>> The same way you feel about montana. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Not quite as close. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Let's stick in the red states. Nebraska. 
>> It tightened up, fisher wins. 
>> Bob kerry keeps it under ten. 
>> Missouri? 
>> McCASKILL WINS. It's like philadelphia in the east, pittsburgh in the west and alabama in between. Kansas city, st. Louis and alabama in between. 
>> Indiana? 
>> Close but I think donely edges, which again obama is going to lose a state, but donely I think will win. But it will be very competitive. 
>> You know, we skipped one of the big swing ones, wisconsin. What's going to be closer, wisconsin or virginia? 
>> I have you silent. I have you silent. Is wisconsin that close? Who would you put on tamy or tommy? 
>> I think I would go edge to tommy but very close. 
>> You don't even know what the makeup we've made here. 
>> Maine, massachusetts, connecticut. Does anything go red in those three? 
>> No. 
>> None of them go red. We're going giveependent to maine? 
>> Yeah. 
>> You're going to have elizabeth warren and scott murphy holding on, murphy holding on. Guess what you end up having? A net zero. 53-48. 

[00:36:14]


>> Just think how many billions of dollars spent. 
>> What does it say -- it's a converse we're going to have. What does I say we're going to spend $6 billion and we may have a status quo election house president and the presidency. 
>> It cancels itself out and this is the opposite of theast three elections. Now there is no way one way or the other. 
>> Let's talk quickly about the house. I know there's been, tons of redistricting, certainly plenty of competitive interesting house races and yet I think the stunning thing for a lot of people this week was democrats quietly admitting they may not pick up a seat. 
>> It's entirely possible you could have it break even. The republicans won when the maps were drawn and they probably pulled 15 seats that would have gone democratic off. So instead of looking at even or maybe democrats picking up 15, 20 seats, we're talking about democrats breaking even or maybe picking up 5. 
>> Who is the leader of the use democrats. 
>> The question is does nancy pelosi leave soon or does she want to wait through the budget deal and then leave. I don't think sheelt 'be in congress a year from today. And the question is do they do generational change. 
>> Look at this. You didn't plan on this, I don't think. But status quo. 
>> I heard we were going to do this, I hated you. 
>> Thank you, charlie. I spoke one on one request seven of the 11 snars that are leaving this year. If you go to our website, you can see the interviews on all of those issues and all of them talk about what's wrong with washington and what could make it work better. We're back in democracy plaza and some of the stranger ways to predict who will win on tuesday. We'll be right back. ???????????? ???????????? daughter 18th, five days later, I had a massive heart attack. Bayer aspirin was the first thing the emts gave me. Now, I'm on a bayer aspirin regimen.

[ Male Announcer ] BE SURE TO TALK TO YOUR Doctor before you begin an aspirin regimen. 
[ Woman ] LEARN FROM MY STORY. 
>>> A now a different way to predict the winner of the presidential race. You may heard of the red skins rule. When they win their last home game prior to a presidential election, that election is won by the party that won the popular vote in the previous election. When they lose the last home game, it is won by the party that lost the popular vote in the previous election. This rule is 18 for 18. It had an addendum to it because the one year it could have been wrong when they lost but president bush won re-election. But the popular vote. In 2008, the phillys won the world series, obama carried pennsylvania and he went on to win the election. In '96 the yankees won, clinton carried new york. Tigers won, reagan carried mitch, you get the picture? We could keep going. You get to go all the way back to herbert hoover. The world series champs this year come from california. And one of the newest predictors is in college football. The winner of the university of alabama-lsu game. Let's bring our saturday super panel. Tom brokaw, how about that? 

[00:43:18]


>> That's for the people of alabama and lsu care about more than the president. 
>> I'm confident in that prediction. 
>> Tom, I want to talk about this larger issue that I think no matter who wins or loses. The winning candidate has to govern a nation that is really, really divided. 
>> Yeah, it's not going to be a mandate it appears from all the polling that we're seeing and just the anecdotal evidence as well, I think it's going to be tougher for president obama if he gets re-elected because it does appear that the house will remain in the hands of the republicans and a lot of those are tea party members who will be going back to the house. I've been talk to go some of them. They have not given up the cause, the crusade. They're not going away. For governor romney, he likes to talk about how well he got along with the democrats when he was in the massachusetts state house. It's a different set of democrats that he'll be dealing with if he gets to be president who are in the senate and it appears that they'll hang on to the senate. 
>> One of the things that may be going on here, that some of the republicans may be hinting at, al of you are new yorkers, and the idea that some shou they froze the race that we know, but did it actually help the president? Maybe all of us are too consumed to know about it for sure. But eroll, the cooperation between bloomberg, cuomo, chris tea and the president couldn't have hert him. 
>> It shows the guy can do his day job at a minimum. And you know, freezing the race for a few days really hurts romney. He had a lot of ground to make up in some key states and he just got pushed off the page. He didn't have any active roll that would take him into the news cycle related to sandy and margin ly, around the edges a lot of the worst scenarios happen to be republican strong holds. It so happens a lot of the places that were devastated were in more conservative areas. 

[00:45:27]


>> When christie said he was thanking president obama, two days before it was about how the president was terrible at bipartisanship and the mitt romney presidency would be good at it. 
>> I think it takes a big storm to make a big case for big government and I think that's what we've seen. You have a situation where romney was calling for emergency services to be pushed back to the states and for there to be sharing, but when you've got a block of 12 states sitting together. 
>> Kelly, one of the reasons i was told that mitt romney was so doing this bipartisan message is suburban women. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> And women were tired of this polarization. 
>> They are and you know they're going to decide the election. Many of them who voted for obama last time around may have been on the fence this time around. I think on that point I think one of the issues of vurnables for the president has been this leadership issues question not being a strong enough leader. Voila, the week before the election he clearly has shown leadership on this issue that many suburban women willl be able to work with him and get something done. 
>> Is this blaming sandy by republicans a little unfair? 
>> If they do blame it on sandy, it will be unfair. I think if the president wins it's going to be the get out the vote that he's going to put together across the country in ohio and all of the key states. He'll win with the latino vote, with the african-american vote, with women generally, with what labor impact still remains in those states. So he's going to do a pch work thing but they're very confident about that. What I do think that the month of october has told us is that the absence of passion for either one of these candidates, because the national got moved -- 
>> so easily. 

[00:47:29]


>> They really did. They just moved around the landscape, wake up tuesday morning I'm going to go the other way. 
>> That remind me of 2000. Bush-gore was that way. The passion wasn't for each of them. 
>> That's right. I agree with that. And I think that may be one reason it's time to bring on bill clinton as we're seeing. 
>> It is also a reminder. This is why I think, what if they're both right. What if they're both ride about their models and we end up with this collision of recounts. I think it's more possible than people realize. 
>> I do, too. And having been through it in 2000. 
>> When we come back, we're going to do a little bit of surprises. 
>> I only have a few years left. 
>> You haven't seen it all, i promise you. 269-269. Then you can say you've seen it all. Trivia time. We asked name the only two states that flipped their presidential vote both in 2004 and in 2008. They were gore, bush, obama. They why iowa and new mexico. Could they flip again? We'll be right back. From democracy plaza. Jack, boring. Boring. Boring.

>>> I wanted to know whether we kault call you governor ventics ra or governor the body. 
>> Well, actually, tom, I've changed that. I'm no longer the body, I'm jesse "the mind" ventura. 
>> It was this day in 1998 when former professional wrestler shocked the world when he won a third-party victory in the state minnesota deep. Norm cole hubrert humphrey, ii. Let's bring back our panel. I'll start with you, if you had a surprise that you think ventura asked that could come, and I'll tell you, on the monday before the election, ventura in tracking polls was coming but he was still in third place. 
>> I think we all know the latino vote is important. I think it's going to be a margin of victory and will reshape politics in colorado, nevada, florida and north carolina. And it could be the margin in several or en all four of those states which, in -- 
>> the president says it will be one or two of those because of the latinos. 
>> It will reshape politics in those states. 
>> Verona, what do you have? 
>> I don't know ifhis is venturaesque, but I think there's a chance that the house could go democrat. 
>> That would shock the world. You know what, I applaud the bold list. 
>> I'm going bold. I'll tell you why. Conventional wisdom says when the economies go, it should favor incumbents. People just being completely disillusioned with congress and that has a tight correlation incumbent upsets. 

[00:54:02]


>> Mine is something that should not be a surprise. We have a record number of women running in the house and senate this year. Women make up only 17 percent of the house and the senate. Prediction here, surprising, it will be truly the year of the woman in 2012 and that women will increase that percentage about 17%. 
>> I promise you, in the senate, it will be at least 20 percent and maybe 21 or 22. 
>>> You love the unforseen. 
>> I've got a new surprise. My surprise will be if she's right. 
[ Laughter ] my surprise is not so much a surprise, but something to keep your eye on. I think republicans across the country are going to tighten their holds on state capitals or state legislatures with long-time conservatives. 'S how you spend education money, it's a tertiary that we don't talk about a lot. It changes the political endskap. 
>> And it certainly does the issue of governing. I'm just going to say that we'll have at least two states uncalled by 4:00 a.M. And we're going to be hanng -- you know, brian williams is going to hand it directly to matt lauer. We're just going to keep blowing through our shameless plugs. Errol? 
>> If you want to know anything that's going on with the effects of the storm, you have to watch ny1. 
>> Okay, my monday column on time.Combout what the markets are going to do if romney win and if obama wins and it's not what you think. 
>> For the women's perspective, and the year of the woman. 
>> It's going to be a bigger one than people realize in the sfat. 
>> Tom? 
>> My guess is that by wednesday morng, a lot of the country is going to say we went through all of this for this? 6 billion. My shameless plug i anna tuman, her brother, he had gas in his car.

Latest on how hurricane sandy is affecting early voting in ohio. This is "the ed show. Let's get to work. 
>> We know what change looks like. 
>> Three days a the obama campaign is pumped. The romney campaign is still playing with shiny objects. 
>> Did you see what president obama said today? He asked his supporters to vote for revenge. 
>> Alex wagner and michael steel on a huge day on the campaign trail. 
>>> Early voting rages on in ohio. State senator nina turner has the latest as the righties continue to delewd themselves about the buckeye state. 
>> Mitt romney will win ohio and he's going to win ohio easily. 
>> I think ohio is going to be a squeaker, maybe 80, 110,000 vote margin but I think the republicans are likely to take it. 
>> Bob strom is here and he'll set the record straight. 
>> An bill clinton continues to slam the door on romney in the state of virginia. 
>> If you really believe we're all in this together, re-elect president obama. 
>> As katy perry lights up the badger state. 
>>> Good to have you with us tonight. With just about 50 hours until election day, the candidates are making their closing arguments like never before and in the battleground state of ohio, president obama is definitely on the move. The latest nbc maris poll has the president up. He is pushing hard about the dishonest ad about jeep moving jobs to china. 
>> You've got folks who work at the jeep plant who have been calling their employers worried asking if their jobs were being shipped to china. You've heard about this. Everybody heard about this? And the reason they're worried is because governor romney is running ads saying that jeep is shipping jobs to china. There's only one problem. It's not . 

[00:02:06]


>> It's just not ohio where president obama is surging. In 22 new polls of battleground states, the president leads in 19 o them. The obama campaign is taking nothing for granted, however. And joe biden put the campaign into perspective. 
>> I want to remind you, this is the end of daylight savings time tonight. It's mitt romney's favorite time of the year because he gets to turn the clock back. He wants to turn that clock back so desperately. This time he can really do it tonight, it happens. 
>> In between all this hectic campaigning, president obama visited fema for an update on storm relief. President obama's best new buddy, chris advertise tea of new jersey extended early voting in the state of new jersey today. From the romney campaign, another sign of desperation. Here's governor romney in dubuque, iowa today. 
>> Yesterday the president said something you may have already heard that I found troubling, spoke to an audience and said voting is the best revenge. He'ssking his supporters to vote for revenge. I'm asking you to vote for love of country. 
>> Here's exactly what president obama said in springfield ohio. 
>> Don't boo, vote. Vote. Voting is the best revenge. 
>> That was a riff on what president obama says every time the crowd boos when they hear the name mitt romney. The president says don't boo, vote. This time he tossed in, okay, a line with the word revenge in it. Of course, revenge was probably not the best word choice, but it was truly just a throwaway line. The romney campaign, what do they do? They wasted no time capitalizing on the word revenge. In an 11th hour attempt to change the subject, the republican candidates have both gone to pennsylvania in the past 24 hours because they see that ohio is sthripg away. We want to know what you think tonight. Will romney's last minute attacks on president obama work? Text a for yes, text b for no to 622639. You can always leave a comment at our blog at ed.Msnbc.Com. 

[00:04:43]


>> One of the big hurd els that president obama has right now is to get white working male os his side. How do you see that playing out from what you've been able to see on the ground in ohio. 
>> That's exactly why he went to lake county today. It's a place I know well, I was born and raised in that county and it was a tight one in 2008. Barack obama pulled it out by less than 1%, but it's a county that's 95% whoit and it's a place where barack obama believes that his econo message will resonate. He was hitting hard in his speech today. In the 82 out of 88 counties that have businesses that are related to the auto industry, is the controversy that's gone on over that widely discredited ad put out by the romney campaign. And if you talk to people on the ground, one of the things that they'll tell you is that they think there has been a backlash against that ad. That the voters here know exactly what's going on in the auto industry. One out of every eight jobs is tied to the auto industry and they say they're not being fooled by it. I also talked to several members inside the obama campaign. They also believe that that ad has worked very strongly in their r, ed. 
>> So this entire narrative that thromney campaign has come up with, the candidate trying to reinvent himself on the automobile industry, would you go so far as to say you have a gut feeling that this has backfired on romney in ohio? 
>> Well, look. I know the people who live in that region where the president was today. I know my family, they all are working class. My father was working class. He worked in a factory nearby. And I think they're looking for a level of respect that they know what the truth is. And I think that's why the president was hitting this so hard. Look, he has not done well, as you know, with white working class voters. It's been hard for him to hit 40% nationwide. But in ohio, that number in the most recent poll that I've seen is closer to 5%. So they know that their message is working in their favor. And I can tell you from conversations I've had on ground, and it certainly is the belief of the obama campaign and the folks I talked to yesterday, that that ad has hurt mitt romney more than it's helped him by far. 

[00:07:12]


>> Chris, what are you hearing on the ground about the legal avenues that the obama campaign is taking to make sure that the integrity of the vote is what it needs to be? 
>> Well, they're serious about it, ed. 2500 lawyers on the ground in the state of ohio. 600 just in cleveland's county where the have bevern concerns about voter suppression. New software that has been installed in some of theegs electronic voting minutes and they're raiding questions about whether those results can be trusted. Now, the secretary of state who you know has been involved in a number of controversies says it's in a limited number of counties, 44, which would be half. And he said that he believes that it's not going to be a concern. But I can tell you that come election day, if problems do occur, and if this race is closer, then that most recent 6% poll would indicate, there are going to be lots of lawyers, and they've been holding training sessions for poll workers and other people to get involved to make sure that this integrity of this election is upheld. 
>> All right. Chris jansing reporting from ohio. 
>> Alex, you first. This word "revenge", it probably wasn't the best word the president could have used, but it didn't take the romney camp very long to jump on it. Is this a last-ditch desperation. 
>> I think actually if you look in the decksry under last-ditch campaign effort, you see this line of attack. The president has had a number of sort of throwaway lines that the romney camp has south to make hay out of. At this late stage in the game is it shows a sign of desperation. This is totally taken out of context and as you said, this is something the president says all the time. The spirit of it is go out to the polls. The "washington post" has a pretty strong assessment of why this is so in some ways despicable on the national stage. The romney campaign thinks so little of the american voter at this point. That we don't need the specifics, that you can get away with these small attacks to obfuscate the larger message which is we don't know what romney is about, he hasn't taken questions from reporters and this is your closing argument? 

[00:09:57]


>> They've not only taken out an ad but they have repeated this almost half a dozen times today on the stump. What do you make of it? Is this really a focal point now for the romney campaign and their closing argument of the american people? 
>> I don't think it's so much a focal point but a reemphasis, just sort of making the point as you saw in the rest of the clip there, the contrast, the president wants to talk about your vote being a matter of revenge and I want to talk to you about your vote being about america. So I think they were setting that up. I get the joke. If romney had used that word in the context of something else, i doubt you or anyone else would be as sanguine about the use of that word. 
>> I would have led the broadcast with it. 
>> I know you would have. 
>> I just admitted to alex that I think it was a very poor choice of wording by the present and that's why the president didn't repeat it. 
>> Can I say something? Does anybody really think that president obama is out for revenge? In terms of strategy. 
>> Of course not. Look. It's the end of a very, very long campaign. It's the heat of battle. I get everything you're saying about the numbers and all the put-down on romney and his lack of telling us and I have problems with the lack of specificity that's come from this campaign. I think if they had been more specific they would probably be a lot further ahead. But look at the numbers if all at you're saying is true and america is so put off by romney, then why is this presidency on the brink of collapse next tuesday? 
>> Come on. Michael, honestly. You think that president obama's campaign and presidency is on the brink of collapse? 
>> I'm just saying -- I'm saying look at the numbers. The president is not running away with this election, ed. 
>> No, he's not but -- 
>> you can cherry pick your way to where he's leading. 
>> A tight election was predicted all along and stated all along by both camps months ago. We knew it was going to come down to just a few people sitting on the fence ended up making a decision and making a difference in this campaign. And -- 

[00:12:08]


>> and why was that? Because of the state of the economy, the way people are looking at these issues, and dissecting the campaign. 
>> Chairman, if you look at how the two campaigns are being run at this zaj and who has the sand slipping through their fingers and the behavior of the candidates on the stump, the messaging, the strategy, who would you rather be 
>> I think I quite frarngly think the romney campaign, even despite the pause with sandy, and that took a lot of momentum that karl rove noted in his piece today, I think the romney campaign has done an expert job of keeping themselves in the campaign against a formidable political mrn that theresident has particularly coming off that first debate and really keeping this thing to the wire. We're down now ed to two states. 
>> We are. 
>> Of possibly calling this election. Virginia and ohio. 
>> But michael, in closing here, you think that the rney camp has done a heck of a job keeping themselves in the campaign with all that money that they've had out there? Come on, now. There's no question that the country now it was going to come down to the final hours of people making a decision, so much money, so much intensity, we're a divided country. I just think that when you look at ohio, what is dogging mitt romney right now is the way he has handled this automobile industry. 
>> Oh, no question about that. I am totally on your page on that front. I thought that was a little ham handed and really put the campaign into an awkward position ttry and clean it up. 
>> Alex, is the automobile the waterloo for mitt romney? 
>> Absolutely. 110%. Every campaign comes book to the candidate. The fact that mitt romney did what he did, wrote that op ed and then ran for president and did not think he was going to have to do any triage on that is a sign of a very flawed candidate or someone who totally under estimates the american worker. >> Ed? When you're calling him president elect romney on wednesday, we can talk about that again. 

[00:14:15]


>> Call me. 
>> I might have to take a few months off. 
>> Come to my place.

>>> The world is watching ohio, and I've got a message for the world that's watching. We are going to elect mitt romney and paul ryan president and vice president of the united states. 
>> Welcome back to the "the ed show." That of course was the ohio governor last night. He and other conservatives, 're living basically I think in a state of denial. They are casting aside every poll and trying to create this narrative out there that they are just in great shape in the buckeye state. This latest poll tells a different story. The president leads by 6 points. It will be tough for mitt romney to make up that kind of ground in the final days. 

[00:20:06]


>> Sean hannity, this date has flipped from the blue column to the red column. Mitt romney will win ohio and he's going to win ohio easily. 
>> Holy smokes. Meanwhile karl rove is actg like mitt romney has alrdy got the thing all wrapped up. 
>> For the president to have wiped out his victory margin by poor performance in the early voting and the republicans are going to take election day, boeds well for romney for election day. I think ohio is going to be a squeaker, maybe 80, 100, 110,000 vote margin. 
>> Let's turn to bob strum, mop the floor on that one. 
>> It's drifl. In the last ten days, 17,000 people have been polled in ohio. If you put all those polls together, even the republican leaning polls, the president has a lead outside the margin of error in those combine surveys. Number two, he has a great ground game. If you look at that early voting, that early voting is working out very well for democrats. And in fact in florida where they tried to stop people from voting, it's made them mad and they go wait in lines two and three hours. Thirdly you were right in the earlier segment. There is no question that the auto industry is lethal for romney in ohio. That story was told during the smur summer. The bain story was told during the summer and he lives with it. By the way, he didn't write that headline. I'll let detroit go bankrupt. But he adopted it. He doubled down on it in a television interview and said yes, that's exactly what I was saying. 
>> Is there a motivation pitch being made by rove to make people feel good. 
>> I think nathsly you're going to see some more movement toward the president. I think he's going to win ohio by 4, 5, 6 points. I think the nbc poll out there is probably right. But rove does have this belief that if you say you're going to win, then you're likely to win. The difficulty with that is even he's getting scared. He's done this interview with the "the washington post" where he said the hurricane helped the president, it's hurt romney. He was predicting romney at 279 elect troel votes. 

[00:22:34]


>> When you elect a president, you don't know what kinds of emergency may haen. You don't know what problems he or she may deal with. But you do want to be able to trust your president. 
>> I mean the word "trust" has really been the narrative for the obama campaign for the last month, talking about can you trust what he says, can you trust what he's going to do. But most of all, it's the storm that has also, I think, helped out the president as well because itsz given him an opportunity to show how he can be an executive, to develop the trust that he' talking about to the point where chris christie is one of his best surrogates. 
>> There's a coherent narrative and you're right about the storm being the last piece of that narrative. People look at the president and look at the guy who took out osama bin laden and the guy who handled this hurricane and they look at the guy who said he was going to do certain things, even if people didn't necessarily agree with all of them, he did what he said he was going to do. Mitt romney on the other hand, won't give specifics and tell anybody what his tax plan is going to do. I don't trus this guy not to take away my home interest mortgage deduction. 
>> Karl rove is now saying that sandy helped the president politically. 
>> He had this big prediction in 2000 that bush was going to win by a huge margin. And after the election he said, oh, no, it was the drunk driving thing that derailed us and made the election so close. What we saw in the gore campaign we were making huge process. We were hurt by the drunk driving thing because it took the story away from medicare and social security. 
>> How concerned are you about the shenanigans that's been played out in ohio of suppressing the vote, the long lines that your campaign with senator kerry experienced in 2004. I mean, is there a chance that president obama could lose ohio? 

[00:24:44]


>> I think it will be tough. They have a lawyers on the ground there, the exoin campaign. And you know, you're right about 2004. If you were a college student or an african-american, you sometimes had to wait eight or ten hours to vote. I don't think they're going to get away with stealing ts election, they're going to try to delegitimate the president's win afterwards. 
>>> Next, from long lines to power outages, ohio voters are facing obstacles to get to the voting booth. State senator knee na turner jones us with an update. 
>>> Then former president bill clinton. Doest get any better than this? This guy has really worked overtime to help president obama in the campaign. We're going to take a look at exactly how effective he's been. He really went after mitt romney today in virginia. This sd "the ed show" on msnbc. routine. Cute. Then new activia breakfast blend.

>>> You're watching tonight. It is the final few days of early voting in the state of ohio. The lines are long. Now some voters in this key swing state face another issue, power outages. The effects of hurricane sandy are being felt as far west as cleveland, a democratic stronghold and crucial for president obama to win the buckeye state. Nine polling stations in cuyahoga county are currently without power as the cleveland "plain dealer" reports locations for more than a dozen others can't be reached by telephone. Local officials are confident voting on election day will go as planned. 

[00:30:07]


>> We are working diligently to make sure those are up and running. The utility companies had made a priority for those locations and we've been assured by monday night we should have power in all locations. 
>> So the big question is what happens if the power is not restored? 
>> People can still vote even if is by a flashlight and chilly in those locations. 
>> I'm joined bio yoe state senator nina turner. Great to have you with us tonight. There's a few hurdles here that have to be done for president obama to take this state. But I want to go to this. Earlier today ohio secretary of state was asked about the controversial new voting software installed in some counties, here's what he said. 
>> The reporting system and the actual counting system are not connected in any way and the results that anybody can get at home they're going to get them the same time I do on election night. 
>> Senator, what do you make of that? Is the system transparent? 
>> Certainly there are a lot of activists here in ohio who are concerned about that, namely the northeast ohio voter advocates. And what I will say is that they should not be experimenting in a presidential election. The secretary state had previous years to try and experiment. So there is some concern there, the fact that this experiment is taking place in 44 counties, ed. But we cannot take our eyes off the prize. Other folks are working on this, we have our eye on this. But we're continuing to work. The man throws up so so much. S.O.S. Used to stand for secretary of state but here it stands for secretary of suppression. 
>> Here's another comment he made. 
>> Right now we're at 85% of them were sent have been returned. We expect a lot of voters put them in the mail yesterday and today and we think that the number could actually be smaller than it was the last time. So we're not concerned about that. 
>> Senator your thoughts. 
>> Of course he'sot concerned? This secretary of state has taken a cavalr attitude when it comes to other folks' right and ability to vote. Don't forget shs this is the man who appealed all the way to the united states supreme court to try to take away the last three days of early voting from all ohioans including veterans.Te so I'm not surprised he's cool, calm and collected about it. We do have those last three days, folks were out in force today, especially in cuyahoga county. About 3100 people voted today. Mothers, fathers, children, out in the cold. They were excited. It was eelectric. And then to have stevie wonder come by and vivica fox come by. We are holding strong. He is the secretary of suppression. Make no mistake about it. 

[00:32:54]


>> What about flashlights and paper ballots? Does that kind of contingency plan inspire confidence? I mean, these are somewhat a primitive backup systems. Are they in place and do you believe they can be affordable? 
>> We're going to overcome this. I'm happy to report there are only three polling places right now without electricity. They've been working hard with the utility companies, there are only three. I am confident, because she is confident, that they will be restored. Here in cuyahoga county, we already use paper ballots. We don't have the touch screens in cuyahoga county. So whether or not the electricity is there or not, those votes will be countied. Jane platen is the cons ument professional and I trust her judgment. We're not talking about some politician in columbus who wants to suppress the vote, we're talking about a professional cares that every vote is county zbld you're giving us new information here tonight. There are 17 locations. The board has been unable to reach by telephone. The with 14 of those in cleveland. You're saying that that has been remedied has taken place on that? 
>> It has been remediesed. I talked to director jane plat ten tonight. In cleveland proper itself every single polling location has its electricity restored. We will be ready, ed, on election day. 
>> The $64 question. Is president obama going to win the state of ohio? 
>> He is going to win, ed. We're going to deliver. They talked about the use of the word "revenge." . But all of us get caught up from time to time. But the president has heart-soulso agreement and that is what is going to deliver this election to him. Ohioans whether they're working class white males, african-american or hispanic and asian folks we know that he has heart-soul agreement and he has been standing in the ready position for us for over four years, we are going to deliver the state of ohio for presid barack obama. 
>> Before I let you go here, tomorrow is souls to the polls, is that correct. 

[00:34:57]


>> Yes. 
>> And this is going to be a big deal, isn't it? 
>> Big deal. From 1:00 to 5:00 p.M. We fought hard to get sunday back. The churches are ready to rock and roll and we're talking all souls to the polls tomorrow. 
>> Thanks so much. 
>>> Still to come, president clinton has been an effective surrogate for president obama this election season. Could he have an effect on down-ballot races as well? 
>>> And the romney campaign thinks they have a shot in wisconsin. President obama and katy perry are trying to do something about that. We'll take you to the rally in the badger state ahead. But first, this is "the fd show," coming to you live from the heart of democracy plaza in new york city. ???????????? ????????????humans -- even when we cross OUR t's AND DOT OUR I's, We still run into problems.

[00:38:58]


>>> Welcome back to "the ed show." Thanks for staying with us tonight. It is no secret former president bill clinton is one of president obama's most valuable surrogates on the trail. President clinton is campaigning full force, no doubt, traveling through swing states and hitting the stump. He stopped in chesapeake, virginia today. Even though his voice was hoar, his message very clear. He laughed off republican criticism. 
>> I notice the only criticism from the other party that was publicly voiced came from michael brown. Who was the head of fema when katrina struck, and he criticized the president for being too quick to respond to this tragedy. I say bring it on. More criticism like that. 
>> And he wasn't afraid to hammer the romney campaign over their continued use of the completely misleading jeep ad, in the way that only bill clinton can do. 
>> When I was a kid and I got caught with my hand in a cookie jar, my face got red and I took my hand out of the cookie jar. This guy gets caught, he digs down and gets some more cookies. They actually increased the ad buy on an ad they knew was false because they think you're dumb. I think you're smart and I think barack obama will be the next president. 
>> "Mork times" blog shows president obama ahead by less than 1 point. President clinton's appeal with white certain voters could be the final push the president needs in the state of virginia. Let's bring in joy reid. I want to say I've never seen a former president be so effective. I think a lot of people are going to be able to point to bill clinton and say this is one of the major reasons why president obama was re-elected if it happens. 

[00:41:03]


>> Definitely. Next to michelle obama, the most popular democrat in the country. Nothing beats having a former president to affirm you. Especially a guy like bill clinton. People believe him on the economy. 
>> Why is he doing it? 
>> You know, I think part of it is that his legacy is in a sense tied to barack obama's. Because a lot of what he's saying is let's go back to the clinton rates on taxes. There's an affirmation of him in barack obama getting re-elected. And of course they did bring their two political power house families together with the hiring of hillary clinton into the cabinet of barack obama. If you want to take the most cynical view of it, if hillary clinton wants to run in 2016, what better way to set that up. 
>> We've got some huge loyalty markers that are going to be able to called in on this deal. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> I think president clinton not only shas he done the job for president obama, but the work that he's doing for, on the down-ballot is just amazing. Do you think he can swing some races? 
>> I think absolutely. If you look at -- I'm seeing popping into my inbox, smaller candidates like val demings who's running for a congressional seat, but she's getting help from bill clinton. He's working in palm beach county, voters who are older and mainly white and voters who think clinton is credible. He's a validatetor for these down-ballot candidates -- and peopt split in florida. And he's a guy who's saying keep that ticket together. 
>> President obama is not going to lose the state of minnesota. I can speak with a little bit of authority and credibility on that one. So president clinton going to minnesota tomorrow, he's going to be there to try to defeat michele bachmann in supporting a guy named jim graves who is a seguy. He's a very successful businessman. If the republicans wanted to get somebody to run, this is the kind of guy that they'd go after. 

[00:43:17]


>> Yeah. 
>> What kind of effect can bill clinton have on a high profile tea partier who has been critical of the president from day one. 
>> Think about what you just said. This candidate on the democratic side is a perfect democrat and he's somebody that michele bachmann's softer supporters, whether it's women who are concerned with her position on women's issues, or republicans, there are a lot of republicans who look fondly at bill clinton, if clinton is validating this guy he might be my kind of democrat.

>>> Welcome back to "the ed show." And in the big finish tonight, mitt romney is in big trouble in ohio so he really needs to win wisconsin. Tonight president obama is ahead campaign spot for both candidates. Vice president biden talked to the voters at the red mug coffee shop in superior wisconsin, but he got up staged in milwaukee. Katy perry performed some of her hit songs at the crowded rally before president obama spoke. She asked everybody there to donate to the red cross. She made this offer to encourage people to vote. 
>> If you're over 18, and you've got some real cool outfit you're going to wear on tuesday, you tweet that to me and I'll retweet you. Because I'm going to pull out for sure as well. 
>> President obama didn't talk fashion. 
>> Wisconsin, after four years as president, you know me. And so, so, you know -- you know me. You've watched me age before your eyes. And you may not agree with every decision I've made. Sometimes you may have been frustrated by the pace of change, buu know where i stand. You know what I believe. You know I mean what I say. And I say what I mean. 
>> We are joined tonight by wisconsin state senator lena taylor. Also with us this evening ruth conif. Senator tailor does the state of wisconsin know president obama better than they do mitt romney and does that make a difference? 

[00:54:43]


>> We definitely know him and we believe that onsti and trust is importt. We can depend on what he says and he has followed through with that and the people have been turning out for him in great numbers, in early voting. Record numbers, better than in 2008. 
>> Ruth, what do you see on the ground as far as early voting? How enthusiastic is it? 
>> Well, it's interesting because as senator taylor knows the republicans in our state legislature curtailed our early voting and yet there are 5,000 more early votes in milwaukee. So the president is doing very well with the early voting and the enthusiasm is very very high. 
>> What about katy perry? Could her performance and appearance and support of wearing a "forward" dress obviously supporting president obama, I mean it doesn't get any more support on that on stage. Could this really motivate young voters to go forhe president? 
>> Listen, there is no question that it motivates young voters. Our motto in wisconsin is also "forward" so we loved that dr I'm like don't you have any other pictures of the rally and of course the only one they had was her in her dress. People were excited. 
>> Ruth, you've got katy perry this evening and now bruce springsteen is going to be in madison on monday. Is the campaign worried or are they just making sure? 
>> I don't think they're worried, the mar ket law school poll has him up by 8 points in wisconsin. I think it's a nice way to close your campaign having tens and thousands of people cheering for the president these days. I think that's why he's here for those great video clips. 
>> Senator, why hasn't paul ryan delivered wisconsin the polls? The polling has never been favorable for the romney examp and I think we can come to the conclusion just 50 hours away from election day that paul ryan doesn't seem to have had a big impact, if any, on the state of wisconsin. What do you make of at? 

[00:56:55]


>> I recall when he first is chose paul ryan. The question was how did we feel about it. One of the things I said we were excited, those of us in wisconsin, for one reason or another. From the democrat's perspective because we knew that paul ryan really does not connect with the values of wisconsin. And him willing to some say put grandmother over on the cliff with a voucher system in medicare does not play well, not just in wisconsin but even in his own district. So clearly wisconsin is going to go for president obama. He's protecting his relationship here, showing us that we matter and we've showed him that we care about him and we're going to show up for him. 
>> Ruth, the president's campaign has had a running theme for months on end, very consistent about being the advocate and the fighter for the middle class. There was quite a middle class fight in wisconsin over the last two years. Are those workers there with the president? Is this what's going to put the president over the top? 
>> I think there's no question that wisconsin progressivism is going to be a key ingredient in this election and that the president is speaking very directly to wisconsin progressives and when he says sometimes you're a little disappointed by the face of change but you know where i stand and you know I'm with you, I think that's a message that resonates and that this election is about these values, protecting the middle class, people's jobs, labor rights, versus a very awe steer, brutal vision. And I think that does make a difference in wisconsin. People are attuned to that and they're really motivate zbld setor taylor, are you concerned that governor walker might have some dirty tricks? 
>> We need to work on making sure we have our attention on intimidation, voter suppression, those are the kinds of issues we've seen the republicans do here consistently. So those are concerns. I don't suggest that they aren't. But people didn't vote governor walker in last time because of his policies. They voted him in mostly because they didn't agree with recalls. So I don't expect that he will be able to influence people's ability to get out to vote because we're going to stop them and I don't think he's to change people's opinions on president obama. 

[00:59:14]


>> And quickly, senator, will president obama the president win wisconsin? 
>> I feel very confident that he will win wisconsin. It means we're going to get up and do what we need to do. That's why people went out to early vote. We're going to take other people to the polls and get it done. 
>> State senator lena taylor and also ruth conniff. And that is "the ed show" and "the daily rundown starts right now with chuck todd. Have a great weekend. We're back tomorrow sniet.

It's definitely not change. Ruling out compromise by pledging the rubber stamp, the tea party folks in congress, that's not change. 
>> Changing the facts that aren't convenient to your campaign, that's not change. That's old. That's the washington that needs to change. Now, virginia, after four years as president, you know me. You know me. So, so, when you're trying to sort through this argument about change, you know, part of what you have to ask yourself is who do you trust? You know, when you're talking about the economy and policy that's so critical, you've got to trust. Michelle doesn't agree w every decision I've de. There may be times when you're frustratedt the pace of change. I am frustrated sometimes with the pace of change. But you know I mean what I say. And I say what I mean. You know what I believe. You know where I stand. When I said we'd end the war in iraq, we ended it. When I said we'd pass health departmentcare reform, we passed it. When I said we'd repeal don't ask, don't tell, we repealed it. You know I tell the truth. And, most importantly, you know I will fight for you and your families every single day as hard as I know how. So let me tell you. I know what real change looks like. I've faugt for it. I've got the scars to prove it. And you have, too. And after all we've been through together, we can't give up on it now. That's why I'm running for a second term. That's why I need your vote. Now, let me describe very briefly. I know folks are cold, but let me describe. What am I talking asht when I'm talking about forward? What do I mean by real change? Change is a country where every american has a shot at a great education. Government alone can't do that. Students, you've got to study. Don't tell me that hiring more teachers woent let our economy grow. Don't tell me that stunts who can't afford college should just borrow money from their parents. That wasn't an option for me, that wasn't an option for bill clinton. I bet it's not an option for a lot of you. That's why I want to cut the growth of tuition in half over the next 10 years. That's why I want to recruit a hundred thousand math and science teachers so we don't fall behind the rest of the world. That's why I want to change 2 million americans in community colleges. That's real change. I want us to live up to this country's legacy. We're not just building cars again, we're building better cars. Cars that by the middle of the next decade will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. That kind of innovation that kind of forward-thinking, we don't have to restrict it just to the auto-industry. I want to bring it back on all kinds of things. We've got thousands of workers building wind turbines all across the country. Profits, when they're making money hand-over-fist, I want to support energy jobs of tomorrow which will cut oil costs in half, help our environment and our national growth. I want to reward companies that are creating those jobs in virginia. That's the future I see to this country. As long as I'm commander in chief,we'll pursue our energies with the strongest military the world has ever known. And virginia carries more than its load when I comes to defending this country. And we are grateful to this state. But we also understand to be strong, it's time to use some of the savings from winding down two wars to pay down our debt and rebuild america. Fixing roads, putting folks back to work,rebuilding our bridges and making sure our schools are state-of-the-art. That's es speshlt le important for our veterans. We want to put them to work. That's my commitment to them. That's what's at stake in this election. And president clinton talked about it. We've got to reduce our deficit. I've got a trillion dollars worth of spending and we can do more. We're not just using it in tv ads and once you get in office, like dick cheney said, it doesn't matter. And then we have to ask the wealthiest americans to go back to the tax rates that they paid when president clinton was in office. And the reason is because budgets are about choices. As long as I'm president, I'm not going to turn in another voucher just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut. So, virginia, we know what change is. We know what the future requires. We know, also, that it won't be easy. I warned some of you. Maybe you weren't believing me. I said real change isn't just about changing presidents or changing parties. It's about changing our politics. We've been shut out of democracy for too long. The protectors, the guardians of the status quo. And that status quo in washington has fought us every step of the way in the last four years. They spent millions of dollars from preventing us from reforming health care and wall street. They have had a strategy and gridlock in congress refusing to compromise on ideas that, in the past, more democrats and republicans have supported. And what they're counting on now, you're going to be so warn out, so weary of what goes on in capital hill, that you're just going to give up and walk away. Just put him back in power or let him stay there. In other words, their bet is on cynicism. But, virginia, my bet is on you. My bet is on you and the decency and the good sense of the american people. It's not a part san bet I'm making. When the american people are with me, I'm right there and happy about it. I would have less grey hair if they're ready to go. We have some of the greatest american republican senators work with us to repeal "don't ask, don't tell." We celebrated them. I'll work with anybody of any party to move this country forward. You'll vote for leaders like tim kaine who feel the same way. People, leaders who will put people first and put the election aside for a moment. But we're still going to have some fights. Because there's some values that are at stake. There's some principles we've got to fight for. You know, if the price of peace in washington is cutting deal that is will kick students off of financial aid or letting insurance companies discriminate people with preexisting conditions or eliminate health care for millions of americans who are elderly orr poor, I'm not buying that. That's not a price I'm willing to pay. That's not bipartisanship, that's not change. That's surrender to the same status quo that has hurt middle class families for way too long. I'm here and I'm running for a second term because I'm not ready to give up that fight. I'm not ready to give up on that fight and I hope you aren't either. You ow, the folks here don't need another champion in washington. Regardless of who's president, they'll find a way to have their voices heard. The people who I read as champion are the men and women i meet on the campaign trail every day. The laid off furniture worker who is having to retrain at the age of 55 for a new career and a new industry. She needs a champion. The restaurant who has great food, he needs a champion. The cooks and the wait staff and the cleaning staff working overtime in some vegas hotel trying to save enough to send their kids to college, they need a champion. Now he's back on the job filled with pride and dignity, not just because he's building a great car, but because he knows he's building america, he needs a champion. Not always getting the support you need, but knowing every day she's touching that one child and something is going to breakthrough, she needs a champion. All of those kids in the valleys of ohio, in these rolling virginia hills, kids dream of become doctors or scientists or businessmen or even a president, they need a champion in washington because they don't have lobby iszs. The future never has lobbyists. But if there are dreams of those children that will be our saving grace. That's why I need you, virginia, to make sure their voices are heard. To make sure your voices are heard. We have come too far to let our hearts grow faint. Now is the time to keep pushing forward. Educate all of our kids. Train all of our workers, create new jobs, rebuild our infrastructure, discover new sources of energy. No matter what your last name is or who you love, you can make it in america if you try. Virginia, that's why I'm asking for your volt. You know, I was backstage with david pluck. Some of you guys know, he's sort of a master-mind to a campaign organization. As the campaign goes on, we become less relevant. 

[00:13:52]


>> But the power is not with us ore. Out of everything w do, it doesn't matter because now it's all up to you. It's up to somebody knocking on a door. It's up to somebody making a phone call and talking to nar mom or dad or wife or husband or grandma or grandpa and that's how democracy is supposed to be. It's up to you. You've got the power. That's why I need you, virginia. Don't get tired. Don't get weary. If you want to knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls for me, grab some friends for me, turn out to vote for me, we'll win, virginia. We'll win this election. We'll finish what we started. We'll reaffirm the spirit that makes the united states of america the greatest nation on ert. God bless you. God bless the united states of america. 
>> One of several trying to snap up the last-minute undecided voters who are still out there. Nbc correspondent is traveling with the president and joins us on the phone from tonight's rally. Mike, I've got to tell you, thousands of people looks like waited out in the cold to hear the president tonight. 
>> You've got to believe it's cold out here, too, melissa. I'm not going to hard ard gens because they get so volatile these days, how big is the rally, but there were several thousand who came out here a fair distance from washington and the northern virginia suburbs to listen to the president's fourth rally of the day. 

[00:16:08]


>> He will spend the night at the white house and then it's right back out tomorrow morning on the plane and visiting more states. He had bill clinton, as he saw, warm up for him. I swear, melissa, if I close my eyes, you hear that horse bill clinton. You would think it was 92 or 96. Bcandidates, the president and mit romney, not leaving anything to chance. It's all about the motivation now and the turn out. And the president certainly had a huge turn out. 
>> I agree with you. President clinton's voice sounded positively raw. I'm surprised the president doesn't sound about the same because they're working so hard. Tell us what we can expect for the next two days? 
>> A frenzy. President obama is going to be sending him back out on the trail. He'll go to new hampshire tomorrow as well as st. Cloud, minnesota. Some people think it's significant now wondering if he has somehow crept into a place where romney could conceivably knock it off. Tomorrow, the president, as i said, early in the morning, he's going to new hampshire and florida. A place where h hasn't been a great deal lately, es spishlly when you compare it to ohio -- 
>> we unforchew fatly have to wrap it up. We do have to go. But we'll hear more from you in the next couple of days. We will go back to the show after a quick break.

>>> The world is watching ohio and I've got a message for the world that's watching. We are going to elect mitt romney and paul ryan president and vice president of the united states. 
>> Welcome back to "the ed show." Speaking to a crowd in west chester ohio. Kasik and other conservatives, they're living basically in a state of denial. They are casting aside every poll and trying to create this nar tef out there that they are just in great shape in the buckeye state. Yet, the latest polling tells a different story. The president leads in ohio by 6 points. It will be pretty tough for mitt romney to make up that kind of ground in the final days. You wouldn't know it by listening to the right wingers. 
>> Mitt romney will win ohio and is going to win ohio easily. 
>> Holy smokes, meanwhile, carl rove is acting like mitt romney has got the whole thing wrapped up. 
>> For the president to have wiped out his victory margin by a poor performance in the early voting and the republicans are going to take an election day, boeds well for an election day in ohio. I think ohio is going to be a squeaker. Let's turn to professor and public policy. Well, mop the floor on that one. In the last ten day, 17,000 people have been polled in ohio. The president has a lead that's outside the margin of error on those combined surveys. He's in a very strong position. If you look at that early voting, it's working out very well for democrats. You were right in the earlier segment. There is no question that the auto-industry is lethal in ohio.In that story was told during the summer, the bane story was told in the summer. By the way, he didn't write that headline, let detroit go brupt. But he then adopted it. 

[00:21:45]


>> Is there a motivational pitch to make people feel good about the fact that they're still this thing in ohio? And could it be as close as he's saying it's going to be? 
>> I think nationally you're going toee some more movement towards the president. But he does have this belief that if you say you're going to win, then you're likely to win. The difficulty with that is that even he's getting scared. 
>> Here's president obama earlier talking about trust. Here it is. 
>> When you elect a president, you don't know what kind of emergencies may happen. You don't know what problems he or she may deal with. But you do want to be able to your president. 
>> The word trust has been the narrative for the obama campaign for the last month. Talking about can you trust what he says, can you trust what he's going to do. But most of all, it's the storm that's helped out the president, as well,because it's given him an opportunity to show how he can be an executive to develop the trust that he's talking about, to the point where chris christie is one of his best surrogates. People look at the president and the guy who handled this hurricane and they look at the guy who said, even if people didn't agree with him, so that you can trust him. He won't give him any specifics, won't tell them what his tax plan is going to do. Is he setting up the alibi? 

[00:23:49]


>> Oh, sure. He had this big prediction in 2000 that bush was going to win by a huge margin, 340, 350 electoral votes. I forget the exact number. After the election, he said oh, no, it was the drunk driving thing that derailed us and made that election so close. It took the story away from medicare and social security. 
>> Bob, how concerned are you about all of the shenanigans that's been played out by the republicans in ohio suppressing the vote. The long lineshat your campaign with senator kerry experience in 2004. 
>> You're right about 2004. If you're a college student or an african american, you sometime haves to wait eight or ten hours to vote. 
>> It's great to have you with us. From long lines to power outages, facing obstacles to to the voting booth. Then, former president bill clinton, does it get any better than this? This guy has really worked overtime to help president obama and the campaign. We're going going to take a look at how effective he's been. Stay with us, we're coming right back. 

[00:29:24]


>>> Thank you for watching tonight. It is the final few days of early voting in the state of ohio. Some voters face another issue. Power outages. The effects are being felt as far west as cleveland. And crucial to win the buckeye state. Nine counties are currently without power as the cleveland plain dealer reports, locations for more than a dozen others can't be reached by telephone. Yet, local election officials are confident voting on election day will go as planned. We are working dgently to make sure they're up and running. And we've been assured that by monday night, we should have power in all locations. So what happens if the power is not restored? 
>> People can still vote even if it's by a flashlight. 
>> I am joined tonight by nina turner. Senator, great to have you with us tonight. There's a few hurdles that have to be done for president obama to have to take this state. Earlier tonight, john hustead was asked about t controversial new software installed in some counties. 
>> The reporting system and the actual accounting system are not connected in anyway. And the results that someone is going to get on their computer, they'll have them the same time I do. 
>> Senator, what do you make of that? Is the subscription transparent? 
>> Certainly, there are a lot of activists that are concerned about that. What I will say is that they should not be experimenting in a presidential election. The secretary of state had years -- previous years to try to experiment. So there is some concern there, the fact that this experiment is taking place in 44 counties and we cannot take our eyes off the prize. Other folks are working on this. We're continuing to work it. The man throws up so much, it's hard to keep up with it. . S.O.S. Used to stand for secretary of state. But here in ohio, s.O.S. Stands for secretary of suppression. 

[00:31:47]


>> Right now, we're at 85%. That's a pretty good rate. And we think that the number could actually be smaller than it was the last time. 
>> Senator, your thoughts? 
>> Of course he's not concerned. This secretary of state has taken a cavalier attitude when it comes to other folks' right and ability to vote. I'm not surprised that he's cool, calm and collected about it. We do have those last three days. Folks were out in forsz today in ohio. I was down the board of elections with them. About 3100 people voted today. Mothers, fathers, children, out in the cold. They were excited. It was electric. And then to have stevie wonder come by. We are ready in cuyahoga county. He is the secretary of suppression, make no mistake about it. 
>> Senator, what about flashlights and paper ballots? Does that kind of contingency plan inspire coidence? These are somewhat a primitive back-up system. Are they in place and do you believe they can be affordable? 
>> I'm happy to report there are only three polling places without electricity. I am confident because she is confident that they will be restored. Here in cuyahoga county, we already use paper ballots. So whether or not t electricity is there or not, jane platen is the confident profesonal and I trust her h judgment. 
>> Senator, you're giving us some new information here tonight. There are 17 locations the board has been unable to reach by telephone with 14 of those in cleveland. You're saying that is a remedy? 

[00:33:58]


>> I talked to director james platen tonight. But she says all but three in greater cleveland. In cleveland proper itself, every single polling location has its electricity restored. We will be ready, ed, on election day. 
>> Is president obama going to win the state of ohio? 
>> He is going to win it. They talked about the use of the word revenge. But all of us get caught up from time-to-time. The president has heart sole agreement. We know that the president has heart-soul agreement. We are going to deliver the state of ohio for president barack obama. 
>> Ohio state's senator, nina turner. Great to have you with us. Before I let you go, tomorrow, his soles to the poles, is that correct? 
>> This is a big deal. From 1 to 5:00 p.M., We fought sunday to get back in. The churches are ready to rock and roll. 
>> Still to come, president clinton has been an e effective surrogate. Could he have an effect on downed ballot races, as well? And the romney campaign thinks they have a shot in wisconsin, president obama and katie perry are trying to do something like that. We'll take you to the badger's state ahead.

>>> Thanks for staying with us tonight. It is no secret former president bill clinton is one of president obama's most valuable surrogates on the campaign trail. In the final days leading up to the election, president clinton is campaigning full force. No doubt, traveling through swing states and hitting the stump. Mr. Clinton stopped in chesapeake, virginia today. And even though his vce was hours, his mes sajt was very clear. 
>> I know the only criticism that was publicly voiced came from michael brown who was the head of fema when katrina stru. And he criticized the president for being too quick to respond to his tragedy. I say bring it on. 
>> And he wasn't afraid to hammer the romney campaign over their continued use of the completely misleading jeep ad in the way that only bill clinton can do. 
>> When I was a kid and I caught caught with my hand in the cookie jar, I sort of shrugged my shoulders, my face got red and I took my hand out of the cookie char. This guy gets caught with his hand in the cookie jar, he digs down and gets more cookies. I actually increased the ad on an ad they knew was false because they think you're dumb. I think you're smart. And I think barack obama will be the next president. 

[00:40:31]


>> New york times 538 blogs shows president obama added virginia by less than one point. Pthd clinton's appeal with white, southern voters could be the final push the president needs in the state of virginia. Let's bring in the managing editor. I've never seen a former president be so effective. I don't know how I'll be able to point to bill clinton saying this is one of the major reasons that president obama was reelected, if it happens. 
>> Absolutely. He's definitely the mvp surrogate, right, next to michelle obama. Bill clinton, nothing beats having a former president to affirm you, especially a guy like bill clinton who's a walking advertisement for a strong economy. 
>> Why is he doing it? 
>> You know, I think part of it is that his legacy is, in a sense, tied to barack obama's. A lot of what barack obama is saying is let's go back to the clinton rates on taxes. There's an affirmation on him getting reelected. And then, of course, they did bring their two sort of political power house families together with the hiring of hillary clinton. Into the cabinet of barack obama. If you want to take the most cynical view of it, if hillary clinton wants to run in 2016, what better way to serve that up and set that up. 
>> We've got some huge loyalty. Some markers are going to be able to be able to be called in on this deal. Look, I think president clinton not only has he done the job for president obama, but the work that he's doing for on the downed ballot is just amazing. Do you think he can swing some races. 
>> I think absolutely. If you look at where I'm seeing him pop it into my inbox. You know, small mechanics like val dennigs nobody knows about it he's out there working on those races in palm beach county in florida. You've got voters who are older. Voters who are mainly white. Clinton is critical. I believe clinton if he says this is a good die. He's a value day tor. 

[00:42:37]


>> That's one of those places where people skets. 
>> President obama is not going to lose the state of minnesota. I can speak with a le bit of authority and credibility on that one. So president clinton is going to minnesota tomorrow. He's going to be there to try to defeat michelle bachmann in supporting a guy named jim graves. This is a guy who came from a very humble background. He's a very successful businessman. Joy, if the republicans wanted to get somebody to run, this is the kind of guy that they'd go after. What kind of effect can bill clinton have on a high-profile tea party? 
>> Carl, think about what you just said. This candidate is a perfect clinton democrat. He's the perfect d-democrat. He's somebody that michelle obama softens supporters. Whether it's women and her more extreme positions on issues. Or republicans. There are a lot of republicans who look fondly on bill clinton. If clinton is validating this other guy, he might be my kind of democrat. 
>> Great to have you with us tonight. Thanks so much for joining us. Coming up, katie perry helps president obama get out the vote in wisconsin.

Danica Patrick: For the millions living with copd, breathing becomes a real struge. Copd stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but you may have heard of it as chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Over time, it makes it harder and harder to breathe, until you feel like you're breathing through a straw. Copd is the 4th leading cause of death in the u.S. It kills one person every 4 minutes, and it took my grandmother. An estimated 24 million americans are affected, but as many as half of them don't even know it. It's a race against time to spread the word about this serious disease. If you're over 35 and have ever smoked, you could be at risk. The good news is, there are steps you can take to improve your symptoms. I'm danica patrick, and I drive4copd. Take action today to breathe better tomorrow. Join the movement at drive4copd.Com.

>>> Welcome back to "the ed show." And in the big finish tonight, mitt romney is in big trouble in ohio so he really needs to win wisconsin. Tonight president obama is ahead in the polls. Today wisconsin become a hot campaign spot for both candidates. Vice president biden talked to the voters at the red mug coffee shop in superior wisconsin, but he got up staged in milwaukee. Katy perry performed some of her hit songs at the crowded rally before president obama spoke. She asked everybody there to donate to the red cross. She made this offer to encourage people to vote. 
>> If you're over 18, and you've got some real cool outfit you're going to wear on tuesday, you tweet that to me and I'll retweet you. Because I'm going to pull out for sure as well. 
>> President obama didn't talk fashion. 
>> Wisconsin, after four years as president, you know me. And so, so, you know -- you know me. You've watched me age before your eyes. And you may not agree with every decision I've made. Sometimes you may have been frustrated by the pace of change, but you know where i stand. You know what I believe. You know I mean what I say. And I say what I mean. 
>> We are joined tonight by wisconsin state senator lena taylor. Also with us this evening ruth conif. Senator tailor does the state of wisconsin know president obama better than they do mitt romney and does that make a difference? 

[00:54:30]


>> We definitely know him and we believe that honesty and trust is important. We can depend on what he says and he has followed through with that and the people have been turning out for him in great numbers, in early voting. Record numbers, better than in 2008. 
>> Ruth, what do you see on the ground as far as early voting? How enthusiastic is it? 
>> Well, it's interesting because as senator taylor knows the republicans in our state legislature curtailed our early voting and yet there are 5,000 more early votes in milwaukee. So the president is doing very well with the early voting and the enthusiasm is very very high. 
>> What about katy perry? Could her performance and appearance and support of wearing a "forward" dress obviously supporting president obama, I mean it doesn't get any more support oat on stage. Could this really motivate young voters to go for the president? 
>> Listen, there is no question that it motivates young voters. Our motto in wisconsin is also "forward" so we loved that dress. I'm like don't you have any other pictures of the rally and of course the only one they had was her in her dress. People were excited. 
>> Ruth, you've got katy perry this evening and now bruce springsteen is going to be i madison on monday. Is the campaign worried or are they just making sure? 
>> I don't think they're worried, the mar ket law school poll has him up by 8 points in wisconsin. I think it's a nice way to close your campaign having tens and thousands of people cheering for the president these days. I think that's why he's here for those great video clips. 
>> Senator, why hasn't paul ryan delivered wisconsin in the polls? The polling has never been favorable for the romney camp and I think we can come to the conclusion just 50 hours away from election day that paul ryan doesn't seem to have had a big impact, if any, on the state of wisconsin. What do you make of that? 

[00:56:44]


>> I recall when he first is chose paul ryan. The question was how did we feel about it. One of the things I said we were excited, those of us in wisconsin, for one reason or another. From the democrat's perspective because we knew that paul ryan really does not connect with the values of wisconsin. And him willing to some say put grandmother over on the cliff with a voucher system in medicare does not play well, not just in wisconsin but even in his own district. So clearly wisconsin is going to go for president obama. He's protecting his relationship here, showing us that we matter and we've showed him that we care about him and we're going to show up for him. 
>> Ruth, the president's campaign has had a running theme for months on end, very consistent about being the advocate and the fighter for the middle class. There was quite a middle class fight in wisconsin over the last two years. Are those workers there with the president? Is this what's going to put the president over the top? 
>> I think there's no question that wisconsin progressivism is going to be a key ingredient in this election and that the president is speaking very directly to wisconsin progressives and when he says sometimes you're a little disappointed by the face of change but you know where i stand and you know I'm with you, I think that's a message that resonates and that this election is about these values, protecting the middle class, people's jobs, labor rights, versus a very awe steer, brutal vision. And I think that does make a difference in wisconsin. People are attuned to that and they're really motivated. Senator taylor, are you concerned that governor walker might have some dirty tricks? 
>> We need to work on making sure we have our attention on intimidation, voter suppression, those are the kinds of issues we've seen the republicans do here consistently. So those are concerns. I don't suggest that they aren't. But people didn't vote governor walker in last time because of his policies. They voted him in mostly because they didn't agree with recalls. So I don't expect that he will be able to influence people's ability to get out to vote because we're going to stop them and I don't think he's going to change people's opinions on president obama. 

[00:59:01]


>> And quickly, senator, will president obama the president win wisconsin? 
>> I feel very confident that he will win wisconsin. It means we're going to get up and do what we need to do. That's why people went out to early vote. We're going to take other people to the polls and get it done. 
>> State senator lena taylor and also ruth conniff. And that is "the ed show" and "the daily rundown starts right now with chuck todd. Have a great weekend. We're back tomorrow night. 
>>> As we fall back from daylight savings, the candidates are using every minute of that extra hour. President obama bounces from one battle ground state to another using ohio as his airline hub. He's using all the hot spots trying to rally his base and any undecided votee thinks are left. Governor romney is also racing against the clock, tweaking his

W york city is beginning to come back to life in some places there are striking new video from staten land where 19 people were killed by the super storm. Officials there are asking for immediate help. Millions are still without power, runningr and food is running thin. Some 80% of gas stations in new jersey alone are not working and tempers are flaring over hours' long lines. 
>> Two years, and I lost it. 
>> I don't have anything, anywhere to go. I don't have no clothes. 
>> This video rom staten island,be moments ago, people begging for food, water, clothing. 15 in my pocket. Nowhere to go, know electricity, no food. 
>> Supplies and patience are running out very quickly right now in new york and new jersey. 
>> I can't get no gas. Everywhere I went, no gas. 
>> I counted mre than 100 vehicles in this line. This is actually better than it was last night. 
>> I have bee here for three hours. Three hours. 
>> Unbelievable. 
>> Three hours. 10 for gas. No breakfast. We want to help, the government says we want to help. 
>> There is no help. 
>> There is no help. 
>> I'm out here helping people. Not making money. I'm broke myself. I'm helping tse people to try to get on their feet. 
>> Having a marathon from here to new york. How about one from new york to here. 90 people died total. 3.5 million people are still out of power. You should see reports in new york city alone. Downtown, people are dumpster diving for food. Electricity is not on. People pull guns on each other. Hard to believe this is happening in the united states. 
>> Greg: Yeah, it goes to show that bloomberg is no rudy giuliani. He is not even rudy from the "cosby show." His life is shaped by what you talk about at a cock party. Climate change, or fad diet of the american public. The world can survive with one less marathon. I don't think we should be sacrificing the help and safety of others to cater to this. 

[00:02:10]


>> Andrea: Greg brings up a great point. New york city marathon still has not been canceled. There was one report that some marathon runners trying to get rooms they reserved and staten island hotel worker said no, i have evacuees that are homeless. Wife hasn'he mayor canceled this yet? 
>> Dana: On the day after the storm, I assumed it would be canceled. It e-mailed a friend of mine, her sister was running and i said sorry you're not running thmarathon this year. She says no, the marathon is still on. I was surprised. I disagree having the marathon. It doesn't make sense. It try to put myself in mayor's shoes or shoes of the runner. I'm not a runner. My feet won't fit. I understand that they would like to have a goal, they want to continue on. They have all sort of people coming in. It would be a good moment for thety for emotional reasons. When you have people right now don't have food and water, at the split screen on sunday. People getting water and food handed to them as they run 26 miles throughout new york city. The split screen people in staten island standing in line three hours waiting for food and water. To me is a really bad decision. 
>> Andrea: They tried to do p.R. Damage control and rename the race the race to recover. But they give out gatorade, giant generators in central park. Think of the cops. The clean-up, marathon are not clean things. They shed clothes and they're doing other things because they're running for so long. That is happening downtown. Shouldn't go to those who need it most? No offense marathon runners. 
>> Greg: Every offense to marathon runners. I worked with them. They're miserable. The only people who like them are marathon runners. There is no audience for it. 
>> Eric: I have a hnch, i have a hunch they will go to. Once advertisers say I don't like to be associated with think. 'M not sure I'll do this. Mayor bloomberg will pull the plug on the marathon. Let's talk about s island. For four days we heard gove cuomo and senaor schumer and mayor bloomberg. Chris christie what a great job they're doing in northeast with the hurricane. They're not doing a gre job. Fema is bailing. Fema wants to help out, should come in here with generators, plug them, in get gas stations up and running and people can live their lives again. Get generators to get the power going. Then youwon't see the people dumpster diving or waiting for lines to get gas. 

[00:04:59]


>> Andrea: I want toget bob in here. What about the politics of it? We're four days away from an elecon. Should president obama be doing more than photo op in new jersey and one in the war room? 
>> Bob: Let me get the marathon out of the way. The fact it's in central park is more insidious. What you are doing is picking out isolated incidents here. There were 8.5 million people out of electricity wen it was at its peak. 3.8 million without electricity. They cut in half number without electricity. Fema is doing math job. Fact of the matter is this has been, this is one of the most massive storms, st surges we have seen. You can't say it would be nice if they can do more. They are doing evening they can. I don't understand why the national guard has not been called out. 
>> Greg: Who can forget the huffington post reporting cannibalism in hurricane katrina. The amount of exaggeration going on to demonize president busis beyond the pale. It's not even happening here because media is more interested to stress bipartisan than that. To me would never have HAPPENED if McCain was president. 
>> Andrea: There was a difference -- look at the response to hurricane katrina. President bush demonized, wasn't doing enough. 
>> Bob: Because fema was a joke of an agency then. Horse trader was running it. Now everybody who has dealt with fema in this storm gave them praise. 
>> Eric: I love you like a brother but the people who ar you know, there is a makeshift morgue in a school in staten island. There are people who are without power. You saw the people without food, power. Fema is not doing their job. There are people struggling and suffering. 
>> Bob: How many people do you think fema has? 
>> Eric: I don't know. Bring people in. 
>> Bob: Bring somepeople in. You think they couldn't bring neem, they wouldn't bring neem? They'd let staten island sink? 

[00:07:05]


>> Eric: Apparently that have. 
>> Bob: That is ridiculous. 
>> Andrea: This is also becoming political issue on the campaign trail. Strickland, the ohio governor introducing president obama. Instead of leighing the hurricane politics aside he decided to use it as a chance to take a shot at mitt romney. Take a listen. 
>> There is mitt romney who tried to fake compassion to ask people to bring food to a rally. And when they don't do it, they take $5,000 and go to wal-mart and buy food to pass out to the people coming to the rally. So he can get his picture taken loading boxes on a truck. 
>> Andrea: That so disgusting. 
>> Bob: Not disgusting that his campaign bought that stuff. 
>> Andrea: He isrying to help hurricane relief victims. Can't you leave politics out of it? If they criticized obama and they're not doing, there would be uproar. 
>> Bob: The romney cam spain not doing it? 
>> Andrea: I h't heard romney -- 
>> Bob: I was wrong about romney yesterday. I should have said his surrogates are the ones taking enowhere in mouse advantage this thing -- enormous advantage of this. They wen to wal-mart, they handed things to hand to romney. What is that about? Why didn't he take $5,000 and send where it they needed it? 
>> Greg: It's rse to politicize catastrophe to prove a point, like you did with climate change that any expert says you're wrong. 
>> Bob: Any expert? 
>> Greg: Yes. Every expert will tell you there is 285 hurricane strike since 1850. 86% of them occurred in below co2 level below the safe million. 
>> Eric: Are you saying that president obama doesn't stage photo ops? 
>> Bob: Of course he does. She a politician. 
>> Eric: Throw the garbage out -- 
>> Bob: Of course. But that doesn't suggest he is not dog his job or fema is not. 

[00:09:09]


>> Andrea: Could this backfire 
>> Dana: Not in time for elections people made up their minds already. Politicizing a hurricane or any disaster relief is abhorr. I thought so in 2005. I think so now. You'll close my mouth and be dignified about it 
>> Greg: Have marathon in basement on treadmill hooked up to generators. 
>> Genius. 
>> Greg: I am offering my basement and other places. 
>> Eric: I know you have been concerned with the sodium a soup and size of the soda. Can el marath but coming up, four days to go the final jobs report isut and it's almost 8%. Will americans give the president four more years where w this many people looking for work? We hear from both campaigns up next. ???????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????? 

[00:14:06]


>>> we are just entering the final weekend of the campaign. Obama rallies are shouting "four more years, four more years." I hearyou. You're shouting "four more days." He said he would lower the unemployment rate, down to 5.% Right now. Today we learned it's actually 7.9%. That is 9 million short of what he promised. Unemployment is higher today than when barack obama took office. 
>> Dana: All right. That was governor mitt romney in wisconsin earliay reacting to the jobs report, that came out earlier in morning. The president however sees it differently. Take a listen. 
>> In 2008 we were in the middle of two wars and worst economic crisis since the great depression. Today, businesses created 5.5 milli new jobs. This morn we learned the company hired more workers in october than at any time in the last eight months. 
>> Dana: All right. So that is the closing arguments in te last four days, everyone is happy. Four days to go. 171,000 jobs created in october. The number, however, for the unemployment rate went from 7.8% to 7.9%. Greg, thoughts on this. 
>> Greg: I don't know how you call it a recovery when unemployment goes up. Unemployment is not supposed to go up in a recovery. Don't give me a bruise and tell me it's a hickey. I said many times to eric. 
>> Dana: That is really good advice. 
>> Greg:813,000 PEOPLE Stopd ooking for work. Obama calls that couch jobs. Created 813,000 couch jobs. 
>> Bob: Can you take a look at the facts. The reason it went up you have been saying that the reason it's as bad a is people are not looking for work. Now they come back in workforce looking for jobs. 
>> Dana: Real unemployment is 14%. Eric, take it away. 
>> Eric: Let's talk about the numbers. By the way, this is official. Mitt romney ll now win the election. 7.9%. This is the official second coming of jimmyarter. It's going to happen,folks. This is good news for mitt ey. 7.9%, the highest since the great depression during a presidential election. Here are the numbers. I'll do this real quick. You can have fun with this. This is according to the senate republicans. Jobs created over the four years by president obama, four years. 194,000 jobs. Give you that. 194,000. People added to the food lines, food stars, new food stampers, 14.7 millionew people. 75 times more people went on food lines than got jobs. 

[00:16:36]


>> Andrea: Is that frown bob's face? It looks like beckel. 
>> Eric: If you think this will get you re-elected and you want four more years, good luck. 
>> Bob: There is 25 straight month of employment increases. You continue to say we can't blame bush for what is going on now, but we can in three months they lost 3 milli jobs. 
>> Dana: God. Okay. Look -- 
>> Bob: True or not 
>> Dana: Evething has to go back -- it's just -- I'm annoyed. 4 million fewer jobs than projected in 2009. Slowest jobs recovery in history. Less full-time work. Another problem compounded wh obamacare if not repealed. Seven time more people dropping out than new employees. Absolutely on the plus side of the ledger, they have been adding jobs but not enough to keep up with the population. Not enough to sustain a government credit card that we have been rung up for decades. 
>> Andrea: I don't know if i run around touting the number. I'm baffled by the president would do that. I love quoting paul krugman, as you know, the liberal from the "new york times." 
>> Dana: Enron adviser. 
>> Andrea: He said 36000 jobs needed to be created per month to get the economy back on track. So in the words of paul krugman this is a paltry number we got in today. If you break it down, dana and you look at the group, the demographics. This is obama's base. African-americans, unemployment, 14.3%. Young people. Young people, trying to rally to get to polls on tuesday are at 16%. People forget the government only factors people looking for work in the last four weeks. I doesn't factor all of the people who stopped looking for work or people with experience and degrees who are in fast food restaurants right now. In addition to the part-time work. So I would have a hard time with the president coming out, saying that this is great and we're where we need to be. 
>> Dana: Go ahead, bob. 
>> Bob: I was going to say that the people not looking for work, said for the first time it's now changed course and more people are entering the workforce looking for work. That is not accurate. 

[00:18:41]


>> Dana: Unable to find full-time jobs. 
>> Eric: You are quoting a stat that really bad for president obama. Around 4 million people over the last four years have left the workforce. 
>> Dana: Not only that, let me tell you, which this is where I am today -- misery up to 80%. Economic misery up to 80%. If you are president obama one thing we talked about is what would you do in the next four ars that would be different from the last four years? That one I have been following this every day closely. It could not answer that. 
>> Greg: One of the surrogates said it isn't time to change course. So what exactly is that time? I guess they're right. It could get worse. But is that a great slogan for obama? Obama, I could do worse. When you are lost, generally you stop the car, you turn around. What we need is somebody who can read the map of the united states instead of hugging the 
GLOBE. >> Bob: If you read the map at the united states, you look at three states, florida, ohio, virginia. Obama is winning in all three of those states now and by some margin, number one. Number two, the job approval rating has been up over 50% now for four months. 
>> Dana: That is not accurate. 
>> Andrea: Another thing, after all the negative ads, bob, mitt romney's favorability jumped up higher. The negative advertisements to paint him as a felon, lly and tax evade dor haven't worked. 
>> Bob: His momentum stopped last week. 
>> Andrea: How do you see that? Early voting -- 
>> Bob: Wait. Early voting -- 
>> Andrea: Significantly gone in his favor. Don't give me that. Early voting was so prominent for president obama. And liberals took the etwork touting it in 2008. 
>> Bob: We'll talk about this after tuesday. 
>> Eric: One more number came out today, unemployment, disturbing. Among blacks 14.3%. Jumped again. 
>> Dana: The closing argument -- 
>> Eric: Very funny. 
>> Dana: Sorry. 

[00:20:42]


> Eric: They are telling us that cbs is announcing that the new york city marathon is officially -- 
>> Dana: I was just going to say that. We'r done. Several developments on the libya terror attack. Don't forget our special show on sunday. Campaign race toward finish line. We'll be here. All five of us. Hope you will be, too. E. ???????????? ???????????? ?????? fare thee well ?????? ??? farewell ?????? ?????? mr. Gloom be on your way ?????? ?????? though you haven't any money you can still be bright and sunny ?????? ?????? sing polly wolly doodle all the day ???????????? ?????? hah ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? 

[00:25:36]


>> Eric: Welcome back to "the five." Day 52 since the attack on our guys on benghazi. We covered it every day on this program. Where has the liberal mainstream media been and how have they been covering the story? We'll get to them in a minute. But first, remember this? 
>> We will bring to justice, those who took them from us. 
>> Eric: Keep that sound bite in mind. Today we learn secret e-mails sent to obama administration specifically the state department to suggest consulate in benghazi was in imminent danger to refute the white house claims that "a," they weren't forewarned. Thanks to the president, no. Thanks to the republican senator lindsey graham. Why has it take son long to get to this guy? A republican senator to do whatthe commander in chief should have done weeks ago? I have to start with you. 
>> Bob: Do you have to? 
>> Eric: I have to. Bret baier warned us last night and he said you will start to see a lot of new information coming out day after day. 
>> Bob: I'll assume we won't do the story on wednesday. 
>> Greg: I'll make sure we do it. 
>> Eric: The c.I.A. Pushed back. The ambassador and his aide died within an ur of this attack. Nobody could have gotten there to save h. There were no military people on the ground. C.I.A. Agents on the ground. C.I.A. Pushed back twice today saying they were moving to help them. There is a lot of information here. Did they handle it right? No. They handled it poorly. But is there some kind of coverup or some as our producer says an epc coverup here? It's gotten out of frankly. 
>> Eric: Re to the finish line. Tuesday is the finish line. Obama administration trying to get there before whatever we find out comes out. 

[00:27:43]


>> Andrea: They were hoping that the video story and the coverup would take them past election but we see it's not the case. There are three failures, failure not to secure it in advance. The failure to not help rescue them while it was happening. The red herring was the video. Now the bungling after. How did the media get in the consulate to get the ambassador's diary? How did the "new york times" have better intelligence where the suspect was drinking mango juice than the president did? Why was the suspect then when he was sent to turkey not extra dieted to gitmo by the united states. Why has thisbeen bungled from the beginning, middle and end? The f.B.I. Should be in the white house investigating the crime there. 
>> Bob: Please. 
>> Eric: Could president obama attained access through the f.B.I. Sooner? Why did it take -- 
>> DanO THE -- 
Eric: To the detainee in tunisia. 
>> Dana: Interrogation and intelligence gathering is the most important thing, get to somebody as quickly as you can and get the information before they shut up. Simple, basic, f.B.I. Procedure. Not just for f.B.I. Intelligence and find out are there other attacks planned? Ho enmight be in the person's web. Get the cell phone. Chilling with tunisians for weeks apt got a story straight in his mind. Good they start to talk to him now but it's fairly late. I don't know why the relationship wasn't that we couldn't talk to him before. 
>> Bob: Does anyone ee this is a shred of evidence that it was terror attack before it happened? 
>> Eric: Before it happened. 
>> Bob: Yeah. 
>> Eric: The e-mail that catherine herridge broke last night. Catherine herridge or jennifer griffin broke last night that warned them, the tie to al-qaeda. Imminent danger. 
reg: THERE IS A DRIP, Drip, drip of facts coming outbout this with the last six weeks. Unfortunately the media is obama's raincoat. Keeping him completely dry throughout this. The fact remains if you want to stick to this story, and I'll say it again, all you got to ask is one question. Who pushed the video? That is the strand on the sweater that unravels the obama sweater of deception. There is no viable explanation for pushinge video. This is themost bogus investigation since o.J. Vowed to find nicole's killer. 

[00:30:02]


>> Dana: Remember, law enforcement arrested the maker, american citizen, exercising the first amendment rights. He is still in jail. 
>> Greg: Still there. 
>> Eric: Get to this. We teased this at the top of the block. We want to talk about the mainstream media, abc, cbs this week. You know how many stories, how many times they touched libya this week on their nightly evening broadcast? 
>> Andrea: Take a shot in the dark and say zero. 
>> Eric:100% right. 
>> Andrea: Yeah. Not surprising. What is interesting is they were engaged in the beginning. They were engaged and they came out, fangs blazing. Why did theycome out? Against mitt romney. 
>> Greg: And the video. 
>> Andrea: We know that. They tried to use it as an opportunity when there were four dead americans to take down romney. The minute romney backed off, they disappeared and helped go along with it. 
>> Eric: May, I please. 
>> Andrea: Not all of them. 
>> Can you at least agree with us that these networks should be covering this story? 
>> Bob: Yes, they should. 
>> Eric: Why aren't they? 
>> Bob: I have no idea. I assume they're part of the grand conspiry and coverup going on an meet in the white house every morning and get directions of what they are supposed to come in the news. You decided "new york times" somebody who got intelligence on the ground and evidence on the ground. The "new york times" had a reporter on the ground who said that this attack was a terrorist attack, this group was one of many who said they had som connection with al-qaeda. This group did see the video. Did get upset about it. You can say the "new york times" and cite what they say and the other things. 
>> Eric: Back to the video. Next on the rundown, romney doesn't normally sit down with gossip magazines but the president pops up in them da after day. Which strategy is more becoming of the oval office? AT DEBATE DIRECTLY AHEAD. New pink lemonade 5-hour ENERGY? 5-hour ENERGY supports the avon Foundation for Women Breast Cancer Crusade. So I can get the energized feeling I need and support a great cause? I'm sold. Pink lemonade 5-hour ENERGY? Yeah and a portion of every sale goes to the Avon Foundation for Women Breast Cancer Crusade. I'm sold. New pink lemonade 5-hour ENERGY. Get the alert, energized feeling you need and support breast cancer research and access to care. To new york mind colleagues with "the five." ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ????????????

>> Greg: I can't believe bloomberg banned marathon baru michigan favorite chocolate. Atlantic, the magazine, not the ocean, noticed romney skipping campaign stops with "us weekly." He ran a story 25 things you didn't know about me, barack obama. Spoiler alert, he is a caring dad. But romney opted out. Unlike obama who feeds off this, romney turned down glamour magazine, "the view," nickelodeon and mtv. Will it hurt mitt's chances? It shouldn't, but it could. Romney is not a joke. He is a success so it makes him the bunch line for people who think community organizing is work. Look at mr. Money bags who did all right. He's so rich and white. Eh, he is religious an he's boring. He must be a robot. Wefully a time keeping your head down and working hard is less cool than staring deeply in joy behar's eyes. Isn't doing "the view," glamour and mtv community organizing for the left wing media hacks. The joke isn't funny anymore. I love clowns. I am one. You don't want me in charge of everything. In serious times maybe it's not bad to have a serious guy in charge, somebody who ran something. Let obama keep doing the fluff. After all it keeps him away from the controls. Dana, you were recently interviewed by woodland elf weekly. Is it important to say yes to everything? Any press helps as you might say? 
>> Dana: It's a seductive thing. Conservatives get lured in this thing well there are so many people watching and people want to know and they want to know your point of view. So you cave. Then you tell your boss or yourself you do the interview and you go and say wh did i do this? It won't help. It will probably only hurt me. Good reason to do popular tv. Like you want to persuade somebody. Or explain something. I can't remember anything of the past year that stuck except for the most recent one which was that the death in benghazi weren't optimal, something that president obama repeated that jon stewart said. I can't really think of a good reason to do any of these, except if you are obama it works really well for him. It doesn't work for republicans. 

[00:39:38]


>> Greg: They never d well, do hay? Are they missing out? Should they show their fun side, which you often do? 
>> Eric: No. In fact, you point out -- first, in your monologue. Wait, what? 
>> Greg: What? 
>> Eric: You point out the difference. There is the difference. Obama wants to hang out in celebrity hang-outs and do the magazine. Do the leno show. Romney is a worker bee. Guy that gets it done. Creates jobs. Does anyone else think it's weird that the day that benghazi happened, and the day that the day after when people were, you know, kind of dieing! In this area, obama was in las vegas campaigning? Unusual? No? 
>> Bob:YES. I thought las vegas thing was a big mistake. It makes sense for romney not to go to these things. All he'd do is get heat. But why 'cuz obama go to these things? He has a target audience. I am trying to say that the people, nickelodeon and mtv -- 
>> Greg: Children, his audience. 
>> Bob: They can vote after 12. 
>> Greg: If they're democrats. Dead or a child. 
>> Bob: We voted many of them. 
>> Eric: Unemployment rate in a month. 
>> Bob: This is making perfect sense for obama. It looks funny but er a targeted audience. That is what politics is about. 
>> Greg: The more light stuff whether it's biden on letterman or obama, the weird contrast is to a miserable country. Greg is having a good time, I'm here eating beans. 
>> True. I don't know if he is eating beans, though. 
>> Dana: Evidence of that. 
>> Greg: That was uncalled for. I have a g.I. Problem. 
>> Andrea: On the youth vote thing, it's interesting that he does go to the youth channels. Most politicians talk to the audience they hope people were born yesterday. In the case of obama his supports really were bor yesterday. He did say no to nickelodeon. For the record, I'm not buying "us weekly." I will read it at the nail salon so you are not getting my $4.99. Sometimes this can be good press. One thing that george bush did in 2004. He wrote a letter to my daughters and published in "glamour." Just his words. Such a good thing. If you control it, good opportunities. You can't control it. 

[00:41:59]


>> Dana: They ask all the questions are loaded with hypocrisy. 
>> Greg: Remember when abe lincoln did "csmo." 
>> Bob: What is a mistake that was. Can I borrow that magazine when I get my nails done? 
>> Andrea: Get a pedicure together? 
>> Bob: I don't know what those are. Your feet? Man, that is disgusting. 
>> Greg: Coming up, five minutes, five political stories you can't live withou speaking of things you ca't live without, I'll be back SOON.??h@??@!# ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? 

[00:46:35]


>> Bob: I never heard that song. Who did tha? 
>> Greg: Billy joel. 
>> Bob: Good for billy joel. Lightning round in politics. We started this and we like it. Start with eric. 
>> Eric: President obama did it again. Went to the well. Listen to him in ohio. 
>> I understand that governor romney has had a toug time in ohio because he was against saving the auto industry. Hard to run away from that position when you are on videotape saying the words "let detroit go ankrupt." I know, we're close to an election. But this isn't a game. 
>> Er NO, IT'S NOT A Game. President obama, you are wrong. No, he's not on videotape. He wrote an op ed for "new york tis" in 2008, the problem is he didn't write that headline up top. "Let detroit go bankrupt." The "new york times" wrote that. In fact, at the end of the op-ed, he says, "federal government should provide guarantees for post bankruptcy financing, and assume car buyers and that their warranties are not at risk." In other words government could help out car companies in the structured bankruptcy. You're wrong. 
>> Bob: Who wrote the apology tour, by the way? Who did the apology tour? Never mind. Still looking for apology thing you mention. 
>> Dana: You missed the best line in speech. Voting is the best revenge. Who knew? Maybe republicans will take that in mind, too. Here is mine. I remember talking about mia love, at the g.O.P. Convention. A republican who is running, she has been a mayor, out there in utah. Running against incumbent democrat. She was behind, then tied and now she is way ahead in the polls. I want to point out that I'm excited about some of the younger g.O.P. Congressional and dates that look like -- candidates that look like they may unseat the democratic incumbents. Doherty of rhode island. Jason plumber, illinois. Bar, kentucky. Gill of california. Led by mia love, which is exciting. 

[00:48:46]


>> Greg: Get up to date. 
>> Dana: One direction. 
>> Greg: You have a poser on the ceiling in your office. Parade for world series -- 
>> Dana: How come you know that? 
[ Laughter ] 
>> Greg: I'm there when you're not around. Sergie romo, the san francisco giants closer at the world series parade he wore this shirt. If I had, could read it says, "i just look like I'm ill I'll" or something like that. I just look illegal. The point of this is the gist of all the articles about this how refreshing it was that romo instead of acting silly at a victory parade was lauding for taking a different path, raising questions about an issue. Do you think the writers for yahoo! Sports over the "l.A. Times" would feel the same way if he wore a ryan-romney shirt or worn any conservative message? There are a lot f athletes who are nservatives who can't wear shirts like that. 
>> I thought the shirt said who pushed the video. 
>> Andrea: Or who can't pray. A lot of republicans running against the obama agenda. Guess who sales? Kimberly strassal combat democrats are running from the president. He is radioactive. The best line sums it up like this. She says the battle for senate control is proving just as hard-fought as the one for the presidency. Though, with one notable difference. President obama is making the case for himself. Senate democratic candidates are making the case against him. Next wednesday, senate majority leader harry reid remains top dog it will be because many democratic candidates won by running as republicans. Bob carey in nebraska saying the president committed terrible mistakes including intelligence leaks. John tester saying he has an ad bragging he voted against the bail-out and auto industry and says he took on the obama administration. Lot of democrats if they win is because they ran against the president. Bad sign. 
>> Bob: They ran against him in two con seventive states -- conservative states. 

[00:50:50]


>> Andrea:15 seats up for grabs. 
>> Bob: I haven't seen one democrat who isn't running with the president. There is a lot of mistakes that depend on electricity for voting. States who are particularly close like virginia, still has a lot of power outals; particularly, in rural areas. If they don't vote by elenic ballot, they have to take the provisional ballot and vote by handwritten ballots so they won't be counted for three or f days. It will be true in new jesey and maryland. They're going for obama anyway. But pennsylvania another one. Hope they get the electricity gets back to the voting machines. 
>> Eric: It may be the best thing. Given what is going on, thre is a lot of alleged voter fraud going on. Some of the machines people are voting for mitt romney and it's coming up barack obama. They say it's because of he salbration. It's quirky though, it's not going the other way. Trying to vote for romney and ending up obama. I don't know. Maybe a paper ballot wouldn't a bad thing. 
>> Bob: I don't know who thought of that but a hell of a good idea. There you go. One more thing is up next. ???????????? ???????????? ] ] that? That's the sound of car insurance compani these days. Here a cheap, there a cheap, everywhere a cheap... You get it. So, what if ins of just a cheap choice, you could make a smart choice? Like, esurance for example. They were born online and built to save people money from the beginning. It's what they've always done. Not just something they cheap about. That's insurance for the modern world. Esurance. Now backed by allstate. Click or call. 

[00:55:49]


>> Andrea: Time for one more thing. Greg? 
>> Greg: I got my books in. "Joy of hate." It's coming out november 13. Go to dailygutfeld.Com and check out the bus tour. It will be great. It might be in your town. I brought books for everybody here and I sd them. This is for you 
>> thank you. 
>> Greg: Giving a gift without me having to pay for it. 
>> Bob: Bus tour? >> Greg: Starting in florida. That's for bob. This is for eric. I know you are going to love the picture. It's very piers bros nashn. But with constipation. Dan ab, I got you this. I figure you l this more than a book. You don't have time to read. 
>> Dana: I don't read. That is usually my problem on this show. I love it. I read the book. It's excellent. 
>> Andrea: I like the personal note. You call me the greek olive. Very cute, greg. 
>> Greg: Thank you. 
>> Eric: What page am I on? 
Bob: I thanked everybody. 
>> Greg: You're in there. 
>> Eric: Good story? 
>> Greg: Remember when you passed out. 
>> Dana: You can get through election weekend. Read and stare at this. 
>> Greg: The tension and the stress this is enjoying yourself. 
>> Dana: Did you not shave before you took picture? What is the problem here? 
>> Greg: Unnecessary. 
>> Eric: We talked about nbc. Main stream media and treatment of benghazi. Listen to my good pal rush limbaugh sum things up nicely. 
>> Does benghazi ring a bell to any of you at nbc? Name alert you to anything? I know it's not as cool as iran contra or water gate, or katrina, those all involved republicans. But you know, four americans died. As it turns out unnecessarily. They were murdered. Brian, and people are trying to get answers and nbc doesn't care. In fact, nbc is helping to cover it up. 
>> Eric: What he said. 
>> Andrea: We can almost do one of these a day, biden gaffe. We have to get a graphic for it. Listen to biden's latest. It could haven't said it better myself. 

[00:58:00]


>> Never been a day in the last four years I have been proud to his b his vice president. 
>> Andrea: Really? It doesn't need commentary after that. 
>> Andrea: One more time for cheap seats. 
>> There's never been a day in the last four years I have been proud to be his vice president. 
>> Andrea: Ask yourself this on tuesday, do you really want him one heart-beat away from the white house? 
>> Dana: Manual the p.R. Staffer for him. You're like ohhh, I can't believe that. Replace big stick for me as the best one. I was going to talk last night country music awards. I love country music. Dierks played, a sorts of -- blake shelton. Award for entertainer of the year. Shared song of the year with his wife. And dedicated the whole show to huricane victims. 
>> Bob: Trump tweeted obama is terrible negotiators. Now chrysler wants to send the jeep productions to china and will. Well, donald, you're wrong. He said you know, you're full of another word for dog food.

=======================================================

Ew key races and tell you which to watch. What they could mean for taxpayers, school kids and organized labor. Welcome to the journal editorial report. I'm paul gigot. The presidential campaign kicked back intigh gear late in week in the wake of hurricane sandy with president obama and mitt romney making their final pitches to swing state voters. 
>> Governor romney has been using all his talents as a salesman to dress up these very same policies that failed our country so badly. The very same policies we've been cleaning up after for the past four years. 
>> Attacking me does not create an agenda for him. We actually have a plan to get this economy going. 
>> Paul: And joining the panel this week, wall street journal columnist and deputy editor danhenninger, political diary editor jason riley, james freeman and washington columnist kim strassel. 
>> Any evidence that hurricane sandy is going to affect this race? 
>> I think, yes, I think it might, in the sense that -- i think one of the big elements in the race is the level of enthusiasm on both sides. My strong sense, paul, this is an enthusiasm deficit on the democratic side. 
>> Paul: All the polls show that. 
>> All the polls show that and I think it's a going to be a determining factor, now, new jersey, new jersey, maryland, it isn't going to decide whether-- obama will win those states. His popular vote may be down, I think the hurricane is going to suppress the popularity vote. 
>> Paul: Dampen that. 
>> And I spoke to a pollster not working for the obama campaign and agreed with dan's sentiment, turnout was an issue for democrats, enthusiasm is down, but also says that he thinks this allowed obama, even though he missed some days on the campaign trail, allowed him to get out there and show some leadership, some bipartisanship, thanks to the new jersey governor, publican chris christie be being at his side for a couple of days. 

[00:02:13]


>> Paul: I want to a you, new jersey residents, and generally a fan of governor chris christie, what do you make of this embrace of the governorith the president? 
>> Well, our colleague peggy noonan, says you want to keep your friends close, but your president closer. I think certainly, mr. Christy is dealing with had an emergency and trying to get help as soon as possible. There is a sense that these kind of situations will make people turn and embrace big government, but you're already seeing a lot of of flaws in the federal response, fema not getting a lot of these generators that they promised online quickly, so, I don't see any kind of a national move toward bigger government as a result. 
>> Paul: Kim, the other big story this week is that the romney campaign has been expanding the field. The electoral field moving into pennsylvania with a very big ad buy much bigger than the obama campaign and even talking a little how the fact that minnesota could be into play and the president was in wiscoin, and close to campaign in iowa, places where he should, you think he would have locked up. Do you take this expansion of the field seriously? 
>> Yeah, and I think that this is part of the momentum argument for romney, now, you've had the obama campaign desperately trying to tamp that down saying it's not true, it's not real. The reality is what you've seen since the denver debate is mitt romney pulling ahead in a lot of places, now, that momentum has slowed down a little bit in some of these very hard fought swing states like ohio and virginia, where the president is now throwing a lot of resources, but that's the story, is that has continued in other areas, like pennsylvania, minnesota, michigan, wisconsin. And the fact that you are going to have both romney and rhein in separate occasions in pennsylvania this weekend, suggest that they take this seriously. You don't go to a state and two days before an election unless you think there's tential. 
>> Paul: Let's take a president obama ad attacking mitt romney in ohio. 

[00:04:16]


>> It's said that character is what we do when we think no one is looking. 
>> Mitt romney thought no one was looking when he attacked 47% of americans, his company shipped jobs overseas, his plan cuts millionaires taxes, but raises yos. He'll voucherize medicare and make catastrophic cuts to education. So remember what romney said and what his name would do. 
>> Paul: Taking our name in vein, the 15th time, the wall street journal does not agree with any of the-- 
>> what do you think? 
>> This is a-- this is a distilled message 
(laughter) of the campaign. 
>> He keeps returning to this class warfare theme and this is in ohio and thinks the outsourcing, hitting the rich. 47% plays well with less educated white men in the midwest and where he's focusing ads. 
>> Paul: Is that really a good closing argument, dan? That's not an argument for the second term. 
>> It's not. And I honestly do not understand it, paul. It's -- I think it reflects barack obama's antipathy toward mitt romney? 
>> Personal? 
>> I think so, he's been wanting to take him down from the beginning. And he's been running the same campaign from the beginning. And voters are out there still the economy the number one issue, waiting for the president to tell them what his plan is for a second term to get the economy growing than the jobs report this week suggested. 
>> Let's turn to a mitt romney ad this week about president obama. 
>> Barack obama says he may int a secretary of business. His solution to everything is to add another bureaucrat. Why not have a president actually understands business? Under obama, millions of people can't find work. And more families on welfare and a record number of americans on food stamps. Mitt romney understands business, knows how to create jobs, and get our economy moving. He's done it before, he can do it again. 

[00:06:33]


>> Paul: James, good message? 
>> Well, I think so. The second half of it was positive and the first half, the secretary of business idea, it's a number of the-- one of the number of signs suggesting that the obama campaign thinks it's losing where they're throwing out ideas late in the campaign as a kind of a disorganized panicked quality and as the ad says, another bureaucracy is not the answer. 
>> Paul: Don't we have a secretary of commerce that's supposed to be a secretary of business? 
>> And we don't even need that one so the idea that we want to add another. Who knows? A secretary of business under an obama administration, maki sure that alternative energy companies getting more advantage over other types of firms? I mean, yikes. 
>> Paul: My only problem with that ad I think it's a distraction, in the sense that romney ought to be focused directly at the camera, here is my plan and contrast with the president. That's when he's most effective. Gentlemen and m we'll continue after the break. Much more ahead on this final weekend before the election, with october's unemployment numbers in, will the economy take center stage once again in the campaign's final days? communities businesses. The potential of Yelp unlocked. NYSE Euronext. Unlocking the world's potential. S 

[00:10:49]


>> the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 7.9%, with employers adding 171,000 jobs. In the final measure of the u.S. Economy's health ahead of tuesday's election. So, james, is this going to affect the campaign much, do you think? 
>> I think it does, I think it confirms that president obama's economic policies have failed on their own terms, that we still officially have a lousy economy and more than 12 million people unemployed, it's 23 million, if you count the people who are working part-time because they c't get full-time work, people who quit. So, yes, if this is a referendum on his economic policy with it. 
>> I know you wanted to get a point in here before i interrupted in the first segment about that. 
>> This is that we talk about the distortions of the ad, the bigger whopper that the president is telling on the campaign trail in the first clip where he basically says degulations and tax cuts of the bush years caused the crisis and now mitt romney is going to do them again. There was no deregulation in the bush years. It's a myth that he's been perpetrating for years and any of the tax cuts caused the financial crisis, that's why lehman brothers and bear-stearns had too much-- 
>> the housing market. 
>> The housing market, it's insane. I think mr. Mitt romney ought to be pushing back. 
>> As a quick extension, his idea itead of doing that with the economy back on its heels, raise taxes, which he will do if he gets reelected and impose more regulation on the economy. That's his solution to the problem we had before. 
>> I think the contrast in these closing arguments are very telling. Obama decides to double down on the character assassination and class warfare, romney is talking bipartisanship, and he was a governor of a blue state. One soundsore presidential than the other. 
>> Paul: The president is throwing out attempts to say, well, I'm going to get a big budget deal with congress, i real want bipartisan immigration deal, hey, maybe, even tax reform. 

[00:12:54]


>> This is really important, yeah, because he's being very critical of romney and last weeks we're seeing the glimmer of hope and change obama and trying to get that back and the testament with independent voters and women and they voted for him in 2008 because, again, he claimed to be a new type of politician. I don't think this was working. It's falling over flat. It's hard to look like the inspirational candidate when 90% of your advertising aimed at knee-capping your opponent, but he suggests that he knows that they have a problem with those voting segments. 
>> Paul: You know, kim, i can't recall an election where both sides seem so convinced they're going to win coming in the final days, usually a concessions in 2008, mccain really doesn't have much of a chance, a hail mary. This time both sides seem convinced they're going to win. How do you explain that. 
>> I think both sides have two reasons to win. The 2008 turnout machine and some aspects that look like they'll get a decent job. But on the romney side, enthusiasm of voters and independents swinging to him in a huge way. It's important, it's hard win an election unless you have independents behind you and you break it out into the swing states and some are going for obama, leaning toward him and some are leaning toward romney and that's behind the enthusiasm on both sides. 
>> No question, romney has expanded the field well beyond mccain and in striking distance or ahead in almost all of the key states. 
>> The polls are giving hope. The national polls have consistently shown romney with a slight lead since, you know, mid october or so, but the ste polls continue to show obama with a, some advantages in the electoral votes, so, i think both sides are looking at the polls and seeing hope. 
>> Dan, let's step back briefly here, how important is this election? We always say the elections are the most important in x years, but I think this is the most important election since ronald reagan certainly in terms of setting the direction of the country and validating or not the huge expansion of government that barack obama has promoted in the first term. 

[00:15:16]


>> I agree, paul. I mean, historically the country is divided in the past century between the private economy and the public government. And there's always been a division of duties there. Barack obama is tg to take spending from 20% of grosse pointe woods over thst 25 years up to about 23%. 
>> Paul: For the starters. 
>> For starters and plus, make the federal government the lead role in the direction of the economy in a way that no previous president has ever done and I think that that i the decision the american people have to decide is whether they want washington, the federal government finally to lead thentry or to have that reside and decisions made by everybody who is working in the private sector. 
>> Paul: All right. Still ahead, we go from the presidential race to the battle for control of the united states senate. Could a big night for mitt romney tuesday mean a g.O.P. Takeover there? Our panel preews the races to watch next. Med up pp to bring you a low-priced medicarerr prescription drug plan. ?????? ?????? with a lowrr national plan premium... ?????? ?????? ...And copays as lowtt as one dollar... ?????? ?????? ...Saving on your medicarerr prescriptions is easy. ?????? ?????? so you're free to focustt on the things that really matter. Call humana at 1-800-808-4003. Or go twalmart.Com forails. 

[00:19:28]


>> Turning now to the battle for control of the united states senate, where right now, democrats hold a slim majority, but that balance of power could change with the outcome of just a handful of races on tuesday. No, which ones should you be watching? We're back with dan henninger, jason riley and kim strassel and editorial board member steve moore also joins the panel. So, kim, not too long ago, people were talking about republicans picking up six, seven seats net. Now it looks like the fortunes have changed and say they may not pick up the three they need. What happened? 
>> Well, what you've got here is a number of races that are just become much more closer than you thought. The republicans are three down. And they are likely to lose maine, ty may lose massachusetts, where scott brown a rerunning and may lose indiana where dick luger was primaried this year and richard murdoch running against donnelly. A good pickup opportunities, nebraska and north dakota, but most of the reigning ones of these races are very, very close, so if you need five or six, what we seem to be looking at here is a replay of 2010 where the numbers are possible, but the republicans to take control are pretty much going to have to run the table and may depend how mitt romney does that night. 
>> Paul: Steve, is this a candidate problem in part? Scott brown has done, I mean, is a tremendous political talent, very, very good politician for that state, but it looks like he may lose to elizabeth warren just because that state is so liberal? 
>> Yeah, well, let me answer your question, I think it's pretty lousy candidates on the republican side of the aisle and democrats are recruiting pretty good candidates this year, examinatio bob carey in nebraska is making that price potentially tight. A red state. Your home state of wisconsin tammy baldwin from madison is hardly a centrist democrat, but she's running as one, and meanwhile, tommy thompson, who was the four term governor of wisconsin, is running a tired campaign and not appealing to voters. My favorite race, paul, is the one in arizona which should not be tight, a very red state and the reason that's important is because jeff flake, a taxpayer hero, made his career in the house as mr. Anti-earmark, all, he's being attacked in arizona by some republican business groups for not bringing home the bacon. 

[00:22:00]


>> Paul: But I've been told that that race has turned toward jeff flake in the last week and a pretty comfortable lead and likely to win. 
>> I agree. 
>> What about the problem of candidate talent? Todd aiken had-- 
>> some self-inflicted wounds and you mentioned tommy thompson and jeff flake, primary races left them bloody for the general election, and tommy thompson had no money or negatives and that's hurt as well. Not only the candidates sometimes, it's the primary process. 
>> There's more competition on the republican side, that's what the primaries have suggested. There's ferment inside the republican party. On the democratic side, less so, but an interesting thing about the democratic party and kim strassel wrote about this in her column this was, with the exception of elizabeth warren in massachusetts virtually all of these candidates are running in the political center or even to the right of center out of sync completely with the national democratic party. 
>> Paul: Let's give our viewers a flavor of that. 
>> I'm heidi hidecamp if you want a senator that only votes the party line either way out on one side or the other then you'll probably not your candidate. I'll do what's right, that's why I stood up to president obama with the balanced budget amendment and the keystone pipeline and capital and trade. No matter what, I'll protect farmers from overregulation, I'll approve this message because I'll only answer to you. 
>> Paul: That's remarkable stuff, kim. And in indiana joe donnelly, a congressman riching against mourdock, he voted for obamacare and now he's running so far to the right he's going to bump the rear end of michele bachmann's pickup truck. 
>> You almost feel sorry for rick berg how do you go to the right of heidi? But you see this everywhere, you see all of these candidates, joe donnelly you just mentioned is out there saying I'm going to extend all of the bush tax cuts. Heidi hydecamp talking to opposition of obama on keytone pipeline, on cap and trade and one of the problems for the republican as candidates, not only some of whom are a little inexperienced, and tied a little to the tea party and grass roots in some ways been a drag on them in some places, but the fact that it's hard again, to make a big contrast with some of the democrats running, even though their record suggests they wouldn't actually vote that way. 

[00:24:35]


>> Can I add something to that, paul. 
>> Yeah, I think that kim is right. I find is interesting that some of the states like montana and north dakota are running against the obama energy policy. People that are running for the pipeline, they're running for, now, for more drilling and by the way, heidi hydecamp says she would urge, urge president obama to fire for lisa jackson. He could do that, I'd vote for her. 
>> She's the head of the epa and once they're in office reliable votes for president obama if he wins. 
>> Of course. 
>> Paul: One surprise before we go, heather wilson has been closing the republican there, a tough state because mitt romney isn't going to win that state, but that may be one to look at, 'cause she's been gaining. Coming up in our second half hour, with the national polls tied up all eyes are on independents. We'll check in with pollster witt ayers who has new numbers. With all 135 house seats up. A look at what the 113th congress might look like and a roundup of other measures on the ballot in states across the country. Including a big showdown in california. 1-800-345-2550 about investing.

>> from america's election headquarters, president obama and mitt romney making their final arguments as election day approaches. A couple of days away now, romney visiting three battle ground states, new hampshire, iowa and colorado. And iowa is on the president's itinerary along with wisconsin ohio and virginia. And gas shortages a big problem in the wake of hurricane sandy. Thdefense of defense is setting up emergency mobile gas stations to ease shortages in the new york city metro area and this is the scene in new jersey, the state is now rationing gasoline in 12 different counties to try to ease the lines at gas stations and drivers with odd numbered plates can buy gas today. If you have even numbered plates in new jersey you have to buy gas on even numbered days so that woulde tomorrow. And then days after, sandy, ripping through the northeast cleanup continues. We'll be back later. ???????????? 
>> welcome back to the journal editorial report, I'm paul gigot, well, t final weekend before the presidential election and national polls show the race in a dead heat. Like many analysts, republican pollster ayers says the key to victory for either candidate rests with independents and he has new numbers to share with us. Great to have you back on the program. Is the race -- is the race really as tight as the polls seem to suggest? 
>> It is incredibly tight. Just incredibly tight. What's not tight now is the standing among independents who gave barack obama an 8 point margin ever victory in 2008, 52-44. We're now showing in our latest resurgent, 51-39 for mitt romney. This is nothing new, independents have been going south on obama since the spring of 2009 after he proposed h stimulus package and a budget with a trillion dollar deficit. This is the first time in our polling that we've seen romney with a double digit lead over obama. That would be a huge turn arn if the numbers held, a 20-point net turn around from the election in 2008. 

[00:31:12]


>> Paul: Okay, if that's true, and I agree with you the polls are showing that movement of independents to roey, if that's right and a big switch from 2008, why doesn't romney have a more comfortable lead at least 2 or 3 points in these polls? 90% of the disagreement in the polls right now, paul, involves differing assumptions about the makeup of the electorate. If we have an electorate that looks like 2004, with equal numbers of democrats and republicans turning out, then a double digit lead for romney among independents means he wins comfortably. 
>> Paul: Right. 
>> On the other hand if we have an electorate that looks like 2008 with 7 percentage points more democrats than republicans in the electorate, then that's probably enough to save obama, even if he loses independents by a dozen points. 
>> Well, where-- 
>> it's all in the makeup. 
>> Paul: Where do you think the recognizance electorate is going to turn out? Somewhere maybe in between 2004 and 2008? And that would, I guess, make it very close. 
>> Our last poll shows a 4.Democratic margin of 35 democrat, 31 republicans. 
>> So that's right way, halfway between 2004 and 8. 
>> Exactly. But frankly, paul, nobody knows, with 100% assurance exactly what this electorate is going to look like on tuesday, and if anybody tells you they do, they're lying. 
>> Paul: Okay. Now the other big discrepancy in the polls is the difference between the national surveys, which have obama and romney very, very close to tied and the state swing state polls, which have, except for north carolina and florida, bacally have the two candidates either tied, but obama having a one, two or more point lead, as many as five in se state polls, lead over romney. Why the discrepancy between the national survey and the state polls? 

[00:33:12]


>> The discrepancy is caused by the tremendous number of negative ads that the obama campaign ran against mitt romney over the course of the last six months. A rising tide lifts all boats, but it doesn't lift them quite as far in the battle ground states as it does elsewhere because of all the negative ads that the obama campaign has run. Nevertheless, a lot of those states are incredibly close, there are eight states right now that are within less than 3 points. So, who knows which way those are going to go on tuesday. 
>> Paul: There another a factor here which is interesting in the polling, which is in these head to head surveys in the swing states, president obama typically can't get above 47, 48%, even if he's leading romney by a couple of points, he can't get rise to get to that 50% level and that gives a lot of people in the romney camp confidence that when it comes to election day, or the president is going to increase his vote much beyond that and they can-- and the undecideds will break towards mney. What do you think about that argument? 
>> In open seat races, undecides tend to break evenly, but with incumbent reelection campaigns, undecideds tend to break for the challenger, that doesn't mean exclusively for the challenger. The people who decided it in the last week in 2004 voted for kerry over bush-- 
>> so they went for the challenger. 
>> They went for the challenger disproportionately, that might be just enough to get romney over the top. 
>> It may be in-- same in 1996, even thoug bob dole did lose, the undecides, did break for him. 
>> Where do you think this is going to go if I can put you on the spot. 
>> With the knowledge that pollsters tend to be better at predicting the past than the future. I think if current trends hold, I believe that romney will probably win the popular vote. We will see whether that's enough to win the electoral college as well. 

[00:35:25]


>> Do you have any surprise states that romney might pick up that aren't on the radar, minnesota, pennsylvania? 
>> Those are a stretch. The ones that we really need to go for romney are virginia and colorado which are just incredibly close with of course, new hampshire and ohio, he wins those, he will probably pull it out. 
>> Thanks, appreciate you being here. Still with all 135 seats in the house up for reelection, does either party stand to win big or lose big on tuesday? Our panel is ba to tell you next.

[00:39:39]


>> All 435 seats in the house of representatives are up for election next week, but few are predicting a party change in the house where right now, republicans have a 24-seat advantage. So what should congress watchers be looking for on tuesday night? And will the outcome make a difference for governing? We're back with dan henninger, jason riley, kim strassel and steve moore. So, steve, republicans picked up 63 seats in 2010. Now, usually in the next election. 
>> Right. 
>> Paul: A lot of those members, some of whom probably weren't professionals, they won because of the wave not because of their own talents and some of those usually washed out yet, this year, it sounds as if that's not going to happen with too many of them. Why? 
>> Well, it's going to happen with some of them. The republicans probably picked up about ten seats that were in pretty heavily democratic districts and probably surrender those, but they lost, don't forget, paul, republicans have an advantage because they pick up a seat as a result of redistricting and red states picked up more seats, for example, texas and blue states lost seats. I want to make one prediction here and you can come back to me next week and see if I'm right. I actually think, I think there's an anti-incumbent move out there not fully picked up in the polls and I wouldn't be surprised if they're on the republican and democrat side, you see high profile members that have been around for a long time losing. One example, make outrageous, I think that henry waxman, for example, in california is in trouble and it's because there's so much fear and anxiety among the voters out there. 
>> A real outliar prediction ifou can pull that off I'll buy you dinner, steve, let me tell you. And here is the thing, jason, congressman approval rating 16%. 
>> It's that high? 
(Laughter) 
>> people have been saying, as steve said, let's throw the bums out and yet, it doesn't seem to be happening. 
>> Well, you're going to see some of those democratics, steve, that republicans wanted in california, new york, probably shift back and you're also going to see down in the south and some parts of the midwest, republicans sort of consolidating, no more blue dogs, probably, after this election. 

[00:41:59]


>> Conservative. 
>> Very few. 
>> Conservative democrats, those are going away? >>, But there are also some republicans, high profile republicans who are in trouble. Alan west, for example, is running in a district where obama won. And michele bachmann is feeling the heat in minnesota, steve king in iowa is running against the wife after former governor, tom vilsack and he's feeling the heat, too, an interesting night. 
>> One of the interesting strategies, the reason they said they would take the house back, they would put pressure on the so-called orphan states, california, and where mitt romney isn't playing, they're not competitive in that ce, but the house seats, okay, we can plow a lot of money in, and republican turnout will be down and we can turn the seats, but they're going to win a couple of them, but surprising so far in the polling, republicans are holding their own in those seats, why? 
>> You're right. They are he' doing this very aggressively, especially going after freshmen that won in 2010, guys like bobby schilling in illinois the first republican to get elected in his district in 30 years. The reason you're no going to see a huge shift is because one thing the republicans did well. Not only being aggressive in the south and some of their home tougher, but they in contrast to the senate recruited some really great candidates themselves in some of these orphan states as you mentioned and they're putting pressure on prominent democrats in thace ins some the areas. They may lose the seats, but hold their losses. 
>> Dan, the ryan budget it was supposed to be, pelosi was waving it as the thing to bring her back to the speakership. 
>> An interesting point. One thing that has to be raised here in the context this have discussion, if barack obama loses, what does that mean for the progressive left wing of the democratic party represented by nancy pelosi and harry reid, and the fact that the progressives hold control of the big cities, los angeles, san francisco, new york, northern urban areas, a lot of the elections we're talking about in the suburbs among people who are much more toward the center of politics and I think if obama loses it's going to be a battle for the democratic party between the progressives and what bill clinton represents. 

[00:44:26]


>> Paul: I think I know who wins that, the progressive win that contest. Steve, what do you think about what happens if the republicans lose only a handful of seats in the house and president obama i reelected. Does that mean the republicans feel chasen and have to do what president obama was? 
>> No, it's the republican firewal and speaker boehner and barack obama doing battle again for four more years. 
>> Paul: Okay, when we come back, tuesday's vote won't just decide the presidency and control of congress. There are 176 initiatives on the ballot in 38 states. And they could affect everything from where your kids go to school to how much you pay in taxes. We'll profile some of the big ones next. life smile. Spending the day with my niece. I don't use super poligrip for hold because my dentures fit well. Before those little pieces would get in between my dentures and my gum and it was uncomfortable. Even well-fitting dentures let in food particles. Super poligrip is zinc free. With just a few dabs, it's clinically proven to seal out more food particles so you're more comfortable and confident while you eat. So it's not about keeping my dentures in, it's about keeping the food particles out. 
[ Charlie ] TRY ZINC FREE SUPER POLIGRIP. 

[00:48:28]


>> Lots of attention being paid of course to the presidential race and balance of power in the house and senate and dozens of other measures in states across the country that could have far reaching consequences. Back with a look at just a few of them is kim strassel and steve moore and colin levy joins us as well. Okay, steve, let's talk about california first, because that may be the second most important vote next week, which is a huge tax increase, raising the top income tax rate to 13.3% from 10.3, how is that going? 
>> I tell you this, the people in states like texas and nevada are hoping to have the tax increase because every rich person in the state is going to continue to move out. I do not think it's going to pass, I think the people of california is going to turn this down. Jerry brown, the governor has been pushing this, saying we're going to have to rip through the schools and the police departments if we don't pass this. I do not think it's going to pass, if it does, paul, i think it could be the end of california as an economic dynamo, truly, the small businesses and the wealth producers of that state will move out if they put in place a 13% income tax. 
>> You know-- go ahead. 
>> California should look at what happened here in illinois. In 2011, little noi raised corporate taxes, raised income taxes, guess what? In the next two months, unemployment surged and businesses tried to flee the state. A real mess. 
>> Paul: And choice seems to be if you're going to put any pressure on the politicians in sacramento to reform, a lot of businesses, jerry brown has been-- they've been chipping in, they think they're going down. And the middle class has been exiting california more than the rich. The hollywood guys and silicon valley folks can afford taxes, but the middle class employed by small businesses that end up moving to nevada, idaho, and elsewhere. So, colin, let's talk about michigan which you've been following and you've got the 

[00:50:37]


-- the battle over the collective bargaining, making collective bargaining a constitutional right in the state. And then there's a battle for the supreme court, too. Are the unions going to win these two? 
>> You know, paul, a lot has change in the past week and i don't think they're going to win it. It's looking tough, but right now about 52% of voters are saying they oppose the efforts to enshrine this propose proposition 2, the more people are learning, the more people are learning how ridiculous it is. And as for the michigan supreme court, this effort to get rid of two of the conservative justices on the court is drawing attention as well. Part of get out the vote a way for unions to say, hey if we manage to get the collective bargaining thing through and we will want to have the court on our side as well. 
>> Another couple of ballot tests where the unions, national unions are playing big are education initiatives and reform initiatives in idaho and washington and idaho in fact to repeal some education reform legislation that passed. Why would the national education association put in millions of dollars from washington, to affect the schools in boise? 
>> Okay, because this is turning into basically the mini wisconsin of this year. Last year and collective bargaining fight. Last year, the governor of idaho and his education chief passed one of the best education reforms that's ever happened, but what it does, it phases out teacher tenure and limits collective bargaining and institute a new merit bonus pay program and the national education association, they hate this and they're petrified that this could become a model for the rest of the country. They and the idaho education association, put in biggest in the state iowa to try to get down the approval of the rye forms. 

[00:52:38]


>> What about the tax initiatives in the the state of california on some of the ballots? I know that oregon has an initiative to phase out, eliminate its death tax. 
>> That's right, a number of those, no death tax in oregon, a couple of states that would, that would actually require a super majority to raise their tax rates, there's some proposition 13 property tax initiatives around the country, so, the taxpayers are, the march on these and by the way, there's also about 5 billion dollars worth of bond referendums on the ballot and we'll see whether taxpayers are in the mood to fund big governmt. 
>> And in washington, the two third state is on the ballot. Kim, you're an oregonion in exile now, is that going to pass oregon or not? 
>> The estate tax? 
>> The repeal. 
>> It's weird, it may well. Because what you have here in oregon is interesting. You've got a lot of people-- this is not a lot of money overall for the budget, but this estate tax hurts a lot of oregonions, and ranchers and farmers and they're land rich and the bank poor. 
>> We'll be watching them all. Okay, we have to take one more break. When we come back, hits and misses of the week. Cheerios cholesterol as part of a heart healthy diet. That's true. ...But you still have to go to the gym. ?????? The one and only, Cheerios ?????? calcium is efficiently absorbed in small continuous amounts.

[00:57:08]


>> Paul: Time for hits and misses of the week. Colin first to you. 
>> This is hit for the chicago public school system. The teachers union went on strike and demanded a big pay raise and they got it. Now, the illinois report card came out and said the expenses for educating each student is an all time high while test scores are completely flat. It's costing $20,000, 58% per student. 
>> Pay up, you'll be doing it for a long time. 
>> A hit for the walt disney company for acquisition of george lucas studios. Had I the luck to sit in the theater t see star wars. I knew then movies this changed forever. It had to be the same thing 1937 when they showed snow white. Snow white meets sky walker june notice the sales just before the capital gains taxes. 
>> This dismiss for governor andrew cuomo who blamed on man made warming. Essentially using a disaster to score political points. I think is pre shameful. The only madmade disaster that he should concern himself is the economy in upspaitd stated new york. 
>> Housing market could be helped. 
>> Speaking of the hurricane you live in new jersey, you've been enduring without electricity for the whole week. Any hits or must on the hurricane front for you, fat that account you were hit? 
>> Not really. You see the horrible suffering on the jersey shore an staten island, fortunately my neck of the woods hasn't hit that kind of problem but a lot of power out. I want to give a hit to the people of new york adopted home state new jersey.

>> Paul: What grade do you give chris christie. Like all politicians I wouldn't look to them. I think it's voluntary efforts, businesses and churches are helping people out.

>> And former secretary of ken blackwell tha could force americans to wait 10 days to find out who the next president is. And high said it wl not be close. Michael baron's build prediction of a land slide on election day. Live from columbus, mike huckabee. 
>> Welcome to huckabee. We'll come to you from columbus, thitate with a big role in the presidential election. Both candidates fighting for every last vote that would give them 18 electorial votes to put them past 270. And we'll talk about that in a few machines. Meanwhile in the home base in new york city and all over the northeast coast, there is pure devastation in the after math of hurricane sandy. ?????? ?????? they are talk being surges we have not seen before. 
>> With each hour the full scope of sandy's detruction is becoming clearer. 
>> The level of destruction on the jersey shore is unthinkable. 
>> Nothing. I done have anything or anywhere to go. I don't have clothes. 
>> We have water or electricity all of the food was thrown out. 
>> I didn't expect it to be that bad and not to see homes off of thation. 
>> Witnesses said the clouds gloge red can as the fire tore through the hope necessary breezy point. 
>> My parents lived here 40 years and it is unbelievable. Sorry. 
>> Look at >> I meany so many sights are plind bogling. 
>> Folks had to wait to fill up in many cases in lines that stretch for miles that is hard to watch. Our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers go to all of those people in the northeast who are adversely affected by hurricane sandy. And we are within hours, of election dape. Record numbers have early voted iluding me. I voted wednesday and so there is nothing that a cand date can do to my vote. But the campaign will continue until the polls close tuesday night. We are told that the election is it about jobs and the economy. I don't diswith that. It is it what the election will be about probably. But this ought to be the dramatic difference between two parties and world views and futures. You believe tax more and spend more and government more of your life is working for us. Then you will want to vote for barak obama and higher taxes gives government money that could have funded your job, romney is more likely to be your choice. This much I do know. I sense something very strong moving over this country. On august 1 people waited for line to buy a chicken sandwich. I believe those people are going to be willing to wait in line for hours to cast a vote so america will feel their votes. This is not just an election about our pay checks. This is it an election of our principlings. I believe that everyone's life has value and I don't accept the notion someone is dedisposable or expendible. I believe this election ought to be l about america's place in the world. I am not satisfied we are begin straight and honest answers of the murder of our ambassador and thry other american necessary benghazi. The lack of trance parency and the everchanging store stores from the administration are troubling. It is one thing for a politician to embellish or stretch the truth but for the government to knowingly and willingly deceive the citizens for political stelve preservation, that is not a political failure, that is it a moral failure. Maybe you are willing to overlook that. I am not. We saw the horror of the suddens alandoned in the rath of hurricane sandy. For some of them to wait days for rescue in the flooded homes and others to go days without food and water in the most resourceful city on earth is unknowledgeable to think they went hours without help and under a weapon's attack. That is it unimaginable. 

[00:04:58]


>> We are not just voting for a personality but the trustworthiness of the poem we effect. I have feet in those who believe in god and don't think he is out of style or disengauged. If they stay home they will be abandoned their children and grand children to a government they can'trust and future they don't want. If you stood in line for a chicken sandwich, please stand in line for your country. That's my view. Well, three days until election day and it could come down to the battle ground state of ohio. My first guess is that if it comes down to ohio, we may not know who the next president until 10 days after the election . Joining me is former ohio secretary of state and served as cincinnati mayor ken blackwell you talked about a nightmare scenario. We are here in ohio, political center of the universe. What is the danger and the nightmare scenario. 1976, carter beat ford by 11,163 votes that was less than one vote per pesinct. 2004 bush bet kerry by 118,000 and turned 60,000 and we would have president kerry. And in ohio, we have a situation where every voters was mail would an absentee ballot application and they sent that in and a week ago, we had as many as 800,000 who had sent for an absentee ballot that had not turn today in. If they decide to vote the old-fashioned way. Once they go to poling place, they wouldn't be allowed to vote. They would have to vote a provisional ballot because we don't want them voting twice. Provisional ballots are not counted until november 17th. What we would have is ape situation where we would have to wait if we had a close race on the traditional balolt. Michael barone is right, you know, it is a scenario that we can all laugh and joke about. If it is it a tight race, it would be a long wait. 

[00:07:25]


>> You are ohio's chief election official in the capacity of secretary of state how likely is it that people might deliberately or accidentally voting absentee and I better go down there and vote. How do you protect that from happening? 
>> We have a excellent system and competent secretary of state and 88 boards of lecs and made up with democrats and republicans and they have a double lock security system and a lot of transparency. I don't think that is going to happen. What is going to potentially happen is that we have a close race on eion night, and provisional ballots and overseas ballots will be the determining factor. 10 sleepless nights waiting to find out who won ohio and perhaps who won the presidency. 
>> There are reports of problems with voting machines and how wide spread do you think that is? Is that something that both camps should be worried about? 
>> Look, we don't have any perfect systems any time you have electronic voting system you have cal voting problems. But the ohio system, what i love, we have transparency and a lot of back up systems to make sure that the sortf things that people are wringing their hands about will not the outcome of our election ask we'll have a result whether we get it election night or two weeks from election night. That hommeds the confidence of voters in ohio. 
>> It is good to know that you are confident of the integrit of the election. What are the issues that will move them for president obama or romney in >> they are going to be economic issues in the main. But the religious arbitrate - electricity - liberty is impacting the category of voters tt the president thought he had in his hip pocket. Women and blue collar workers and the like. The catholic church going on the offensive to protect religious liberty is a potential force that can change the result in ohio. 

[00:09:48]


>> Your prediction. Romny or obama? 
>> I think romney will narrowly eck it out. I just hope we know what is going on on november 6th or seventh. 
>> Great to see you. Coming up michael barone with numbers that he said will decide the election in a land slide. But for whom, stay with us. To find out. I would like it hear fru. Go to my website mikehuckabee.Com. And sign up for facebook fage and - page and follow me on twitter. You can find that and he's making a bold prediction saying that the election is not going to be close. He came up with a scenario that might stur - surprise you. Michael baron. You had a bomb shelve an article in the washington examiner and you are predicting a land slide and who wips and why? 

[00:13:59]


>> I would predicting romney winning the electorial vote with 315 and that's not a land slide in popular vote and neither of the candidates will get 53% barak obama had last time and he had 365 electorial tes and so when you get up to the numbers you carry a lot of states. Obama carried 28. I tried to look at what i think are the fundmentals in this election and see how they played out in the target state. Most voters don't like barak obama and like the slulish economy that resulted from them and likely to center a less democratic electorate thap is shown in 2008 exit polls and most polls, they are tending to show nationally and independent voters going for romney. That means each party's side is relatively eating and nen partisan vote for cappedidates and independent voters break the tie. 
>> We have a map that is it on the screen it shows solid red as the states for romney and blue for obama and light likely obama and the pink states are light red for romney. Pennsylvania, wisconsin and you say those are likely to tilt romny's way. 
>> Wisconsin tep electorial votes is a battle ground with governor scott walker reforms affecting the bargaining terms and there was a june recall election on governor walker and he won it with 53% of the vote and his side got well organized from that. And I think that balance of enthusiasm that seems to favor republicans this year, that might enable romney to get over the line there. And pennsylvania, a couple of trends and that is not a targetitate in the romny campaign and people supporting romny put money in there. Western pennsylvania, where barak obama did not run well but had low turn out in 2008, voters were cross press and traditional democrats didn't want to vote for obama. You will see more 18-obama and it is coal company. And alsolet pennsylvania polls tightened up after the first debate and that is only have happened in the philadelphia suburbs. And afluent areas in the north which are trending democratic were moving back some distance to romney and I understand it romney has a speaking date tomorrow night in buck's county outside of philadelphia. And stow romny has put real money in pennsylvania it is it not cheap to campaign obama responded with some. Those factors could put it over the line that would be a real shock and it is it out on the limb. I will not be utterly surprised to be brong. 

[00:17:28]


>> And you have been right more awn than wrong when i read the article I said thi is it stunning. You also looked at ohio and where I am tonight. And this is ground zero for the election, how important is it ohio and who wins that tuesday? 
>> I think ohio is it hugely important and it has 18 electoral vote. That is it a significant number. Bark bumum carried it by four poigns in 2008 and he put a barage of anti-ads and bain capital and autobail out and obama is doing better with white blue collar voters in ohio than other state. He's leading in most polls. And a lot of the polls are showing a democratic party identification edge in the respondants that is greater than the exit poll. And that just doesn't make sense to me and causes me to question them. We have problems with pollingly technology now because of so many cell phone only people there is it a lot of questioning going o in the polling profession. And I think we may see something like in 2004,hich was quietly unreported by the press who don't mix in those stirkles saw evangelical voterss and maul town voters turn out much enhanced numbers that enable would gforge bush to carry the statine though kerry did a job of turning out the vote in central city neighborhoods and onas. And I am picking romny to narrowly win. And I think we may like ken blackwell may wait until november 17th to see what happens to the provisional ballots this is it a provision that leaves me uneasy, but that's the direction I move in. 

[00:19:29]


>> Michael, we'll be following closely and we may bring you back to stee how well you did. 
>> If I wear a paper bag over my head, you will know i didn't do well. 
>> People suggested I should do that every week on the show and you can come and join me and we'll both be bagged. Thank you for being here. 
>> Thank you. Who should get credit for ohio's economic improvement? Should president obama or john csack and waiting for romney, who is speaking in colorado at a campaign stop and when he does, you will hear his comments live e e e e swenson today. M happy. Sales go up... I'm happy. It went out today... I'm happy. What if she's not home? 
(Together) she won't be happy. Use ups! She can get a textrt, reroute... Even reschedule her package. It's ups my choice. Are you happy? I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. Happy. 
(Together) happy. I love logistics. 

[00:23:39]


>> Ohio is experiencing a economic recovery president obama will take credit foror that as he campaigning here. My next guest says the prize aught to go to someone closer to home. Governor, it is it great to center you here. Unemployment rate in ohio was 9 percent and dropped to 7 percent x. One of the few places in the country where that is it happened. Why is that happened. 
>> We are making it job friendly again business friendly again. We balanced our budget whole and did it without raising taxes and we cut taxings. Businesses in ohio understand that we are open for business and we are creating an economic environment where they can be successful. 
>> The president is here and said that ohio is one of those states that prove his economic policiless are working. How do you respond to the president if he makes those claims? 
>> I would say it is it just the opposite. They are hurting. We can gobetter if we had a real partner in washington who understood what it takes to create jobs. Through our effort and initiative. We are reforming our regulations and at the same time the federal government is pushing more regulations and obamacare and the affect that is it going to have on government spending and more tax dollars spent on medicaid after it is it implement the impact it will center on ohio. 
>> I loved csi. Common sense initiate itch. Because it is it a name that is trendy, but I loved that we will assem pel the top business people and ask them. If you can set government policy to cause y create jobs whampt is it going to be. And so what did they tell specifically would help them create jobs in ohio? Obviously it has worked. 

[00:25:45]


>> We have been meeting and thank you for menging - mentioning. I talk to many, many small business round tables and ing to thempt we have a advisory council that meets. Lower taxes and regulatory environment and understanding that your government is financially responsible after we balanced our budget and our credit outlook was upgraded. That is it important to a business that is making a decision to invest a lot of money to suggest which states they are doing that in. And what is it going to look like? 
>> Governor, the big claim of the obama administration is that his saving and rescuing the automobile industry is one of the key reasons that ohio is doing better. I saw numbers that didn't match that up. And what is thee store store of how many js are auto-related jobs. 
>> We'll go throughlet numbers. We created 112,000 in ohio. Since we took office. Of that 112,000, 400, of those jobs are associated with the auto. 4400-- fr hundred out of 112,000? 
>> Yes. We have a diverse economy and focusing on making it technical and food production and manufacturing. And medical. We are growing in many different industry segments and that is it partly contributed to ohio's success. 
>> It is it a fascinating store store and I think you and governor casack deserves credit. I can do that. And we are expecting governor romney to spheek soon out of englewood, colorado. We'll carry it live and we don't want to miss it. Right here on huckabee. Stay with us. . 1-800-345-2550 about investing.

>> We'll go straight to colorado with governor romney. 
>> Thank you, colorado. Wow. I would like to introduce someone to you. I would like to introduce you to the next first lady of the united states. Ann romney. 
[ Applause ] 
>> that is the most extraordinary welcome. Thank you, colorado! 

[00:29:49]


[ Applause ] we're getting closer and closer and this is getting very exciting. 
[ Applause ] this is what -- three more days. 
(Chanting) 
>> it is. It is only three more days! 
[ Applause ] this is so exciting for us. It is a thrill to be here. What a great country this is what an honor it has been to go across the nat and meet people like you that are here standing up today for america. 
[ Applause ] 
(chanting three more days) 
>> you got it. You got it 
>> we have such a thrill to be able to go across the country and now that journey is coming to a close and a new journey is about to begin! 
[ Applause ] and what a thrill it is going to be for me because I know something about mitt. He does not fail! 
[ Applause ] in our marriage, he has stood by me in my darkest hour. As you know, I had difficulties in my life and where is mitt been? Standing by my side! 
[ Applause ] as a father, I have seen him show exemptulary courage and devotion to his family and sons. He raised the most extraordinary sons! 

[00:31:54]


[ Applause ] I have seen him in business be everything and most exceptional business leadership and turn thippings around and now what I am excited about is the next turn around in his chapter and career. And it is going to start next tuesday with your help. Thank you very much! 
[ Applause ] 
>> tonight, tonight we are entering the final weekend of the campaign, and you are right at the obama rallies they are shouting more years and we are shouting three more days. And we are so very grateful to you and the people across the country, for all that you have given of yourselves to this campaign. This is not jt about paul ryan and me, it is it about america. 
[ Applause ] it is it about the future that we are going to leave our children. We thank you we ask you to stay at it until we win on tuesday night. 
[ Applause ] now the closing hours of a campaign have a dynamic all their own and many voters have made up their mind who they will vote for. Yeah, I figured you know what you will do, but there is it a lot of others are putting aside the demands of daily living and considering who they will vote for and how that will affect their lives and children and counselry. We ask them to look beyond the speeches and the attacks and the adlook to the record, accomplishments and failures and the judgment, because words are cheap and a record is it real and it is it earned with effort. 

[00:34:10]


[ Applause ] you so, change can't be measured in speeches it is it measured in achievements and four years ago, four years ago, candidate obama promise tod do soy much, but he's fallen so very short. I mean, you recall. He promised to be a post partisan president he's been most partisan and dividing and attacking and blaming. He was going to focus on creating jobs and instead he focused on obamacare that killed jobs. He said he was going to cut the federal deficit in half and then he doubled it. And then he said he would bringlet unemployment rate down to 5.25 percent and we learned on friday 7.9 nine million jobs short of what he promised and unemployment. And unemployment today is higher than when barak obama took office and by the way, he promised to propose a plan to save social security and medicare. He did not. Rather he raided $716 billion from medicare to pay for obamacare. The list goes on. And he said he would low are health prem yups by $2000. And instead went up $3000 a family. And average american family pays $2000 more for gasoline than when president obama was elected. And I mention one more thing. He said he would work across the aisle on the most important issues. He's not met on the economy or on the budget or on jobs with either the republican leader of the house and senate since july so he's made the divide wider. People wonder how is it he fell so short of what promised? He never led. Or worked across the aisle and never truly understood how jobs arereated in this economy by the way, he's making new promiseless. Promises he will not be able to keep, because he admits he's stayog the same path. And same course we are on will not lead to a better destination. That means 20 trillion in debt in the end of the second term that he will not have and crippling unemployment and stagnant take home pay and depressed home values and devastated military and by the way, unless we change course, we may look at another recession . And so the question of this election comes down to this, do you want more of the same? Or do you want real change? 

[00:37:20]


[ Applause ] president obama -- president obama promised change but could not deliver change. Now, I promise change and i have a record of achieving real change. 
[ Applause ] 
>> I built a business. I helped turn around another. And helped to put the low pressures back - olympics back on track and turn happened my state from deficit to surplus and job losses to job growth and higher tax home pay. 
-- Take home pay this is why i am running for president. I know how to chae the course of the naption and balance the budget and get rising take home pay. 
[ Applause ] this is it accomplish and change is not something I talk about. It is something that I have done. And it is it what I will do when I am president of the united states with your help. 
[ Applause ] 
(chanting) 
>> now, if you believe we can do better and believe that america should be on a better course and tired of being tired. I ask you for vote for real change. Paul ryan and I will bring you real change from day one. When I am elected, the economy and american jobs will beinant. I will not waste time complaining about my predecessor. 
[ Applause ] and I won't spend my time trying to pass partisan legislation that is it unrelated to jobs. Day one, I will help americans get back to work. 

[00:39:33]


[ Applause ] now, you know as well as I do, people are responding to the five-part plan to create jobbings. You know part one, taking full advantage of our energy resources. Day one. I am going to act to increase leases and permit to drill on federal lands and I will act to speed the approval of the key stone pipe line from canada. Secondly, I will boost trade with latin america and finally desigate china as a currency manipulator and it is time that trade w america. Now, third, I want to send to congress retrain asking rorm act to make sure workers have the skims for good paying job and fourth move to tackle out of control spend spend to congress. Down payment on fiscal sanity act. 
[ Applause ] and in this act we'll not just slow down the rate of government and its spending, but I will cut spending. 
[ Applause ] you see, I am not going to just take office on january 20th. I will take responsibility for that office as well 
[ applause ] and number 5, number 5, I will act to boost small business and all business and I will issue executive orders aimed straight at the problems that are holding back the economy and the first of those will grant state waivers from obamacare to begin instant repeal. 

[00:41:45]


[ Applause ] and the second, the second is going to launch a sweeping review of all of the obama era regulation eliminate or repair those that are killing american jobs . 
[ Applause ] and for the first time in four years, every entrepreneur, every small business person, every job creator, will know that the president of the united states likes them and loves the jobs that they hire for americans. 
[ Applause ] we've almost forgot what a real recovery looks like and what americans can achieve when we limit government instead of the limiting of the of fellow americans and that's about to change. Now the people who will be voting are going to choose the future they want. You know what you need to know, you can stay on the path of last four years or choose real change. You know that if the president is reelected he will be unable to work with the people in congress. He's ignored them and blamed them and attacked them. The debt ceiling will come up again and shut down and default will be threatened and a chill in the economy. The president was right when he can't change washington in the inside. In this case. We can take him at his word. He's going to be on the outside. 
[ Applause ] you see, when I am elected, and when I am elected. 
[ Applause ] am going to work with republicans and democrats in congress and meet withheir leaders and endevor to find good men and women on both sides of the aisle who care more about the country than they do politics. Now you also know if the president were to be reelected he would continue his war on coal, oil and natural gas. And all of that would guarantee higher energy prices at the pump and fewer jobs as well. When I am elected, we'll change course on energy and i know how much it mean to middle class families struggling to get by. We can help to hold down price necessary the pump and energy, and nuclear and coal and renewables and oil. You know, you know that if the president were to b reelected he would promote government and demote business. He chose his own job's council you know. Made up of leaders, business leaders and he wanted advice on the issue of the time creating jobs and a stronger economy. Do you know how long since he met with them? Nine months. Nine months. Look, look, I see free enterprizes as a means for people to fulfill their and so, by the way, you know the other day, i was in richmond, virginia a couple of days ago, and met with ronda eliot. She's been running her family restaurant for a few years and it is called bill's queue - barbeque and been in her family years. And she just closed it down. She told me obama era regulations and taxs and obama economy put her out of business and teared up. This was not about money, it was about the future for her family and for the family of employees that she cares about. I want to help the hundreds of thousands of dreamers like roda and I will. 

[00:46:09]


[ Applause ] now you know, if the president were to be reelected he will say good things about education but in the final analysis he will do what his largest campaign are contributors tell them. That means your kids will have the same schools with the stame results. When I am president, I will be a voice of the children and parents, because they don't have a union! 
[ Applause ] I want to make sure the parents have the information they need to know to find out if their school is succeeding or fail I want to make they have the choice to pick the scho with a child with the best chance of success. Now one more thing. Under barak obama, a reed obama. There would be devastatingly cuts that jeopardize our national security and kill jobs. When I am president, I will not cut our commitment to national defense. 
[ Applause ] a strong america is the best allied peace and I will keep it strong. 
[ Applause ] now I have watched over the last few months as the caaign gathered the strength of a movement. Not only the size of the crowds. This is it an extraordinary crowd tonight. 
[ Applause ] it is also the depth of our shared conviction. It made me strive more to be worthy of your support and campaign as I would govern. And to speak for the aspirations of all americans. I learned as governor of the state of massachusetts best achievements are shared achievements and respect and good will go along way and return in kind. That's how I conduct myself as. Doing things for the common good. I will not only represent one party. I will represent one nation. 

[00:48:48]


[ Applause ] 
(chanting three more days) 
(chanting usa) 
>> now as you know, as you know, throughout the campaign. President obama has tried to convince you last four years have been a success. He's floating a plan for the next four years. He wants to take all of the first term, stim tim and borrowing and obamacare and all of the rift and try them all over again. Look, our big will not be satisfied with a small agenda that has already failed and yesterda I imagine you already heard this. Yesterday president obama asked his voters to vote for revenge. For revenge. Instead, I ask the american people to vote for love of country. 
[ Applause ] 
(chanting usa) together we have got to lead america to a better place. Now we are three days away from a fresh start. Three days away from the first day of a new beginning. My conviction is it based on unshakable faith of the american spirit. Is anyone worried that the last four years is the best we can do. If anybody fears therican dream is fading away. Is there better jobs or pay checks are things of the past. I have a clear message. With the right leadership, america is about to come roaring back. 

[00:50:50]


[ Applause ] 
(chanting usa) 
>> we are americans and we can do anything. The only thing. The only thing that stands between us and some of the best years have known is lack of leadership and that is why we have election. You saw the difference between president obama and myself when we were side by side in our debates. He said it has to be this way. I said it stand this way. He offers excuses. I have a plan. 
[ Applause ] I can't wait to get going. He's hoping we'll settle. But americans don't settle. We build. We aspire. We listen to the voice inside that said we can do better. A better job and better life for our kids and bigger and better country that is it coming soon. 
[ Applause ] 
>> three more days and we can get to work and rebuilding our country and restoring our confidence and renewing conviction and confident of a solid path and steady impresumement and graduates -- college graduates will find a better job. Confident that the single moms who are working two jobs will have a shot at a better job as well. 
[ Applause ] now my confidence in america and in our future stems from what I have seen in the heart of the american people. We are a people who are given to give ourselves to things larger than ourselves. It said a hero is not someone who is larger than life. Just larger than himself . Several years I served as a boy scout leader for the boy scouts of america. 

[00:53:04]


[ Applause ] and I was in a court of honor, that's where they get the eagle scout and other award and there was a long formica table next to an american flag and the person who was speaking in theodium was a scout master we flew in from monument, colorado to tell the store store, I just through there. He said his boy scoutroupee wanted a? American flag and had one flown above the capt capt building and the boys said I would like to have nasa take it up in the space shuttle and they contacted nasa and nasa agreed. You can imagine the pride of our boys sitting in the rooms at school and watching the tv sets and saw the space challenger shuttle launch in the air and saw it explode in front of their eyes he said he called nasa and said have you found any remnant much our flag. They have not. Week after week month after month. Still no remnant of the flag from the terrible disaster and then he was reading an article in the paper and described the debris from the challenger disast yer mentioned a flag. He call would nasa again. And in fact we have a presentation to make to your boys. Nasa came together and they presented the boys with a plastic container and they opened tup. It was a american flag in perfect condition. 
[ Applause ] he said, then he said that's next to mr. Romney and i reached over and I grabbed that flag and held it out. And it was as electricity ran through my arm. Because I thought of all of the men and women in our space program who put themselves in path out of a desire for learn knowledge. For us. It is it the american way. Think of all of the servicemen and women who put themselves in harm's way for freedom. 

[00:55:23]


[ Applause ]

Moms and dads who are working two jobs or perhaps one working night shift and the other day shift and hardly see each other. And want to make sure the kids have the other clothes that kids have and don't stand out.

>> He is about as hollow as the tin man. 
>> If we don't run candy crowley, romney will be the nominee and he'll lose. 
>>> We begin tonight with the latest on the recovery from the devastation of hurricane sandy. Nbc news has now confirmed 94 deaths from the storm. More than half of those killed, 48 died in the state of new york. Of that 48 in the state, 40 deaths occurred here in new york city. And of those 40 new york city deaths, more than half, 22, occurred in the borough that was the hardest hit. Staten island. It's greater thaevery other state hit by the storm. In new jersey, 13 died. 11 people died in maryland. There were seven deaths in pennsylvania. West virginia lost six people, four people died in connecticut, in north carolina two died and one person died in puerto rico. Speaking to reporters today on staten island, homeland security. 

[00:02:06]


>> It's been mentioned this was a large storm. The area that sandy covered was roughly the size of europe. We know that staten island took a particularly hard hit from sandy, so we want to make sure that the right resources are brought here as quickly as possible to help this community which is so very strong recover even more quickly. 
>> Secretary napolitano told reporters today they had fema and the national guard on the ground in the northeast with more to come. Over 75,000 survivors have applied for federal disaster assistance already and the governor has already given out $15 million in aid. More than 8.7 million liters of water are in place for victims along with 2.6 million meals. The red cross has 258 shelters open across the region. Federal officials are moving generators to hospitals and nursing homes still without electricity and the department of defense is helping to air lift utility crews into affected areas to get the lights back on. In new york, officials have restored power to more than 375,000 homes and businesses. People cheered when the lights came back on, gasoline is still tough to come by with lines stretching several miles in some locations across new york and new jersey today. Some locations are still without electricity. So the gas cannot be pumped. Officials have reopened the port of new york allowing more supplies in including fuel tankers bringing more than 200 million barrels of fuel to expedite that process. New york governor andrew cuomo temporarily waiving registration requirements for fuel distributors and transporters. After a day of increasing controversy of the new york city marathon, michael bloomberg announced it has been canceled. Quote, we would not want a cloud to hang over the race or its participants, and so we have decided to cancel it. We cannot allow a controversy over an athletic event, even one as meaningful as this, to distract attention away from all the critically important work that is being done to recover from the storm and get our city back on track. With the red cross, fema and the national guard on the ground to help in staten island, people there have some hope. We get the latest from nbc news correspondent andrea canning. 

[00:05:24]


>> >> Reporter: GOOD EVENING. This morning all of that changed. 
>> Today a welcome flood of relief as national guard, fema, red cross and other agencies set up camp bringing much needed supplies to this hard-hit working class community. 
>> Thank you fema. 
>> Reporter:24 hours after this desperate plea on live television. 
>> You need to come here and help us. We need assistance. Please. 
>> Reporter: There is now hope. 
>> Reporter: There's a renewed hope and spirit and that's what they needed. 
>> Reporter: Families crowded around tables to pick up canned food and ready to eat meals. More than 150 people lined up for dry ice. Down the street, residents were streaming in with whatever bags of warm clothing they could share for their neighbors. Temperatures are dropping tonight and parents here are rried about their children. The homeland security chief and fema officials today oversaw the relief efforts. 
>> Folks are going to be going door to door in these communities making sure that nobody is left out. 
>> Reporter: As one person put it, it's not charity, it's humanity. 
>> I'm from brooklyn, today's my day off, I'm here now trying to help more. Because it's just like a bomb hit. 
>> I don't believe this. 
>> Reporter: Esther doesn't even know where to start. 
>> We need help here. We truly do. We need someone to come and tell tuesday which way to go and how to go. Everybody's becoming so frantic. 
>> Reporter: She feels lost in her own neighborhood. There's the boat in her house, the water damage and the tangled web the wires hanging over her yard. About 500 residents are living at the local shelters. Officials say housing is the biggest need. 

[00:07:27]


>> They're scared, they've been through so much and they want to know they're going to have a place to go for the next 30 days or so and as for now we don't have those answers. 
>> Reporter: While they wait for answers, today a small republican to normalcy. For the first time since the storm, the staten island ferry reopened, carrying passengers over quiet waters. 
>> And the cleanup has begun in this neighborhood, but it is going to be a long, hard road. You can see these boats on someone's doorstep. They're strewn up and down this street. A crane rolled in today taking one at a time taking them from the road back to the marina. Back to you, lawrence. 
>> Andrea canning on staten island. Thank you. Joining me once agai phone is michael kusic, a democrat who represents staten island. I want to go straightaway to the issuof the new york city marathon which begins in staten island at the base of the verrazano narrows bridge. 47,000 runners were registered for it this year. Supplies were beinbrought out to staten island today for the marathon before the decision was made to cancel it. Are you supportive of the mayor's decision to cancel the new york city ma? 
>> Yes. I'm supportive of the mayor's decision. I think the mayor made the right decision today. This was always about resources for us here on staten island. Many of the neighborods that had been hit very hard by the hurricane, very close to the starting line and very close to the verrazano bridge where many of the runners would start the marathon. So this was always about the resources. We're still rescuing people. We're still going door to door. We're still trying to help our neighbors. And it was hard to figure out having a marathon going on, if there were resources used for the race, like police or generators or that type, could they have been used to help with the rescue. So I think the mayor made the right decision today, because this will at least put the ease some of the folks who still don't have electric and they're still without heat and are very close to where the start of that marathon would have been. 

[00:09:51]


>> You know, I have to confess that when the mayor first said that it was going to continue, he said that a few days ago before we realized how extensive the damage was, particularly on staten island. And there was a case to be me for it, that the city needs to be seen to be back on its feet, literally in terms of the marathon. But as time wore on, it became less explicable why we were doing this. And the "new york times" cover party showing two generators that were being used in central park for the marathon to heat their tent. Explaining that those two generators could be used on staten island to provide power to 400 homes. At that moment this morning when I saw that cover, I couldn't conceive of how this marathon could go on. 
>> Right, right. Like I said, I think the mayor made the right decision when he had decided early on to go forward. That was for the good of the city and for morale and for small businesses. But as you pointed out, lawrence, in the last day, it's amazing what a difference 24 hours is. People didn't really know how bad it was out here on staten island. And I think that when the news cameras came oute yesterday, with senators schumer and dilabrand, they realized it was bad out here. I don't think people realized that and I think that changed people's minds that there was still more work to be done on this hurricane issue. 
>> Michael, I know not every new york city politician frequents staten island, but cabinet secretary is a rare visitor to staten island. How did secretary napolitano's trip today help on staten island? 

[00:11:51]


>> The secretary's trip was great for morale. I think the people out here were encouraged to know that the federal government is here now in full force to have a member of the cabinet here to kick it off and to show that fema is here and they'll be here as long as it takes to get staten islanders back on their feet. It was very encouraging to the neighbors and to the residents. But very encouraging to the elected officials out here. We've been working as a team out here, led by our borough president and many of the state elected officials and to have the secretary sit down with us and give us a briefing on what the federal government is going to do really, really helped us move forward today because when I spoke to you last night, lawrence, it was a different story. We, the day before, we hadn't heard from anyone. And to get this treatment today, and to see the number of fema employees here and the red cross and the national guard has done wonders for people's morale, and see that people really do care how the people are here on staten island. 
>> Quickly before you go, a word on the red cross. The red cross was getting some heavy criticism on staten island just 24 hours ago. We gist did a telethon for the red cross to raise money for people in the wake of the storm. So people were saying no, don't send money to the red cross. What's your view of how the red cross is on helping on staten island now? 
>> The red cross is here in full foand I think it's time to forward. I think that people's opinions have changed. The president of the red css was out here today. The red cross has met with all the elected officials on staten island and they have said to us they are going to be here 100%. They have had numerous trucks here from the red cross. I was in a neighborhood today where the trucks were givinge ut food and blankets to folks who don't have heat or electric and it's safe to say that the red cross has been a supporter here on staten island and we see them being a supporter in the future. 

[00:14:31]


>> New york assembly man michael cusick. Thank you very much for joining me tonight. 
>> Thank you, lawrence. 
>>> Coming up, four days to go. The campaign's sprint to the finish. Karen finney ire for that. And in the rewrite tonight, what was the biggest lie republicans told this year about something president obama said. Tweet me your guesses on that one. The answer will be in tonight's rewrite. 
>>> And, some of the craziest republicans in congress. That's coming up. snapshot progressive, but don't just listen to me. Listen to these happy progressive customers. I plugged in snapshot, and 30 days later, I was saving big on car insurance. With snapshot, I knew what I could save before I switched to progressive. The better I drive, the more I save. I wish our company had something this cool. You're not filming this, are you? Aw! Camera shy. Snapshot from progressive. Test-drive snapshot before you switch. Visit progressive.Com today. 

[00:17:21]


>>> The recovery from hurricane sandy isust beginning and it will take a lot of government spending to get it done and a lot of earmarks. And suddenly at least one big republican is in favor of federal government spending. And, yes, in favor of earmarks. That's in the rewrite. 
>>> And, the back and forth on the campaign trail is getting even more intense. Team romney attacks, team obama responds. We'll have the latest from the campaign next. rosa chantix. When the doctor told me that I could smoke for the first week... I'm like...Yeah, ok... Little did I know that one week later I wasn't smoki 
[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. Some people had changes in behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. It helps to have people around you... They say, you're much bigger than this. And you are. 
[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. 
>>> With just four days until the election, four days? Did I say four days? Four days until the election, presidential candidates campaigned in ohio where moments ago, mitt romney said this. 

[00:19:30]


>> Your state is the won I'm counting on, by the way. This is the one we have to win. 
>> A new cnn poll of likely voters in ohio shows president obama polling at 50% and mitt romney at 47%. The president made three stops in ohio today where he talked about mitt romney's lie that chrysler is moving american jobs to china. 
>> You've got to own what you say. This isn't a game. These are people's jobs at stake. These are people's lives. Companies like g.M. And chrysler, they put a lot of time and effort and money into building up their brand and letting americans know that the american auto industry is back. And we don't want suddenly a bunch of ads saying stuff that's not true. You don't scare hard working americans just to scare up some votes. You know I tell the truth. And you know I fight for working families every single day as hard as I know how. 
>> President obama concludedis speech this way. 
>> And that's why I need you, ohio. To make sure that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from, what your last night is, where you started, no matter what, you can make it in america if you try. That's why I'm asking for your vote and if you're willing to work with me and knock on some doors with me and make some phone calls with me and turn out to the polls with me. We'll win this election. We'll win ohio. 
>> New polls show president obama polling ahead of mitt romney among likely voters in the battleground states of virginia. In virginia, a reuters poll has president obama at 49% and mitt romney at 45%. In florida, reuters has president obama at 48% and mitt romney at 46%. In michigan, a ppp poll has president obama at 52% and mitt romney at 46%. And in colorado, a ppp poll has president obama at 50% and mitt romney at 46%. In new hampshire, a new england college poll has president obama at 50% and mitt romney at 44%. Tonight, nate silver the "new york times" blog forecasts that president obama has an 81% of winning re-election and that he will win 304 electoral college votes and mitt romney will within 234. And the great thing about next week is I will no longer have to say ppp poll. I'm done with that poll. These polls are tight. These polls, you know, I refuse to use the language the poll shows president obama winning 50, because every one of these polls is within the margin of error. Every one of them. So they are really showing something that could be a tie, could be tight. For incumbents this is not considered particularly strong polling. When the incumbent is at 48 and the other guy is at 45, that's considered a risky spot for incumbents. 

[00:23:03]


>> Here's the thing. The map is getting tougher for mitt romney. No question. 
>> That's always true. My bet is still on president obama. I just feel this thing is tighter even than those polls show. 
>> I'm not sure if I agree with that. Because if you look at -- 
>> you don't have to. You're not here to agree. You're here to elucidate, to educate. 
>> If you consider that how much money romney has tried to spend in the last couple of weeks trying to move the numbers in ohio and he hasn't. At this point they're trying to buy some cheap tv advertising to buy some time in pennsylvania, that's not going to happen. He may stand there and tell ohio, hey, I need you. It's not going to happen. He's already behind. And if you look at the battleground early vote states, he has to win 54% of the remaining votes in ohio to win the state. So those numbers, if you consider how many of the early vote people have already voted, in colorado, where you cited the ppp poll, he's got to win 55% of the remaining votes in colorado to win. That's where you start to see the wisdom of the obama team strategy, of a strong ground game and focusing on early votes and those sporadic voters and that the map for romney is getting tighter. 
>> Ari, there is that decision is there another route. Sometimes the democrats are doing it but here it is for romney. Is there a route around ohio. But there's romney tonight saying I think the one true thing. I have to win ohio. 
>> Right. And when he says that, he is actually revealing more than he means to. Because what it shows you also is that the pennsylvania stuff is garbage. Ifou could win, pennsylvania, florida and the southwest could do without ohio. 

[00:25:05]


>> Why are they doing that? Because that he's a play we've seen them try before and we've essay seen it fail before. Is there some attempt to manipulate media coverage? 
>> To quote bill clinton, they think you're stupid. It's more a play for the media being stupid, saying look here's a chance to even it up, the press loves to even it up and pennsylvania is a way -- 
>> are they trying to get obama to put resources into pennsylvania? 
>> It is part of it. There is an element of a head fake to see can we shake something lose here, can we see movement in numbers, can we make them spend time there, maybe once you're playing those kinds of games you know that your path to 70 is limited. As you said you better get ohio because pennsylvania is garbage. 
>> When people tune in on tuesday night and they see you lawrence o'donnell reading these election results. 
>> No, they're going to see rachel maddow. I will be sitting somewhere nearby being very quiet. 
>> There's a funny thing where they're going to look at the bottom of the screen and see these votes coming in, it's going to start at zero and go. But that's an tificiality. He has what looks to be a billing lead there and that is concrete. That's not polling. That's ballots. 
>> Part of this is about, i believe, trying to delegitimize president obama in a second term. A, so if they can create a little ruckus and they're going to try to blame chris christie. 
>>> Coming up, how hurricane sandy has exposed one of mitt romney's biggest lies about president obama. That's in the rewrite. 
>>> From legitimate rape to communists in the congress. Some of the craziest republicans are in trouble in their election campaign because of something ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ??????

[00:33:21]


>> I don't know what tomorrow's job numbers are going to be. I have no doubt they'll cook the books. 
>> Hurricane sandy did not prevent the release of the october jobs data as planned. 
>> In 2008 we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great depres. Today, our businesses have created 5.5 million w jobs and this morning we learned that companies hired more workers in october than any time in the last eight months. 
>> According to the bureau of labor statistics, private sector businesses added 184,000 jobs last month. The biggest monthly gain in eight months and 84,000 more jobs were actually created in august and september ian previously estimated. The unemployment rate ticked up to 7.9% due to me workers restarting their job hunts, reentering the work force. Attempting to. Mitt romney reacted to the jobs report in wisconsin today. 
>> He said he was going to cut the federal deficit in half and then he doubled it. He said he was going to lower the unemployment rate down to 5.2% right now. Today we learn that it's 7.9% and that's 9 million jobs short of what he promised. 
>> Joe bid responded to romney this way today. 
>> Called it territorial tax. It's the bain way. It means if you're going to build a factory you go find -- this is the fact. You go find a country with the lowest tax rate and the cheapest wages. Build it there, pay thostaxes and you never have to pay a penny in tax in the profit you make when you bring them back home. Why would anybody build -- why would anybody build a factory here? Ladies and gentlemen, the experts point out, that new territorial tax will create 800,000 jobs. All of them abroad. I'm not making up, all of them abroad. 800,000. I found it fascinating at their convention when governor romney said the first thing I will do when I'm elected president, i will take a jobs tour. It's going to have to be a foreign trip. 

[00:35:39]


>> Joining me now ezra klein and eugene robinson. It was a strong week for the conspiracy theorists about the unemployment numbers. First the theory was that the president would use hurricane sandy and its effects possibly on washington, d.C. As an excuse folaying the jobs report until after the election. And then of course as of yesterday when they knew it was coming out, they were absolutely convinced that they would cook the books. And so we saw an up tick of .1%. 
>> It's a reverse psychology ploy that the obama folks are trying it won't work. None of what the conspiracy theorists thought would happen in fact happened and there was an uptick in the percentage and a decent number of new jobs. And so it really allows both campaigns to continue with their main economic narratives. The obama narrative that things are getting better, let's stay the course and the romney narrative that things aren't getting better fast enough. 
>> Mitt romney brought up the booming debt ceiling situation. There's going to have to be another increase relatively soon. Let's listen to what he said about it today. 
>> You know that if the president ise-elected, he will still be unable to work with the people in congress I mean, he's ignored them, he's attacked them, he's blamed them. The debt ceiling will come up again and shutdown will be threatened chig the economy. 
>> And harry reid reacted to mitt romney claing he would be the one who would work congress. 
>> Romney's fantasy that senate democrats will work with him is laughable. Ezra, this argument that mitt romney will be better at working with congress has absolutely no basis in for experience, but what do you see happening after this election on these issues? 

[00:37:53]


>> Well, it's a funny word that wasn't in anything romney said, that was republicans. That romney's party in congress triggered a near-debt ceiling default a year ago. And in an effort to work with them, president obama did give larger concessions on the debt ceiling than any president ever before in history. From that perspective, we actually bent over backwards. In terms of what I see happening going forward, if mitt romney is elected with an all-republican congress, if republicans do manage to take over the senate and hold the house, at least the latter one is likely, he would be able to work with them. If he had to work with a democratic senate, his relationship with harry reid i think is f to say is not great. Conversely if barack obama is re-elected, he will have to work with speaker john boehner and very likely have a democratic senate. And what's fascinating about that and you've talked about it a lot, is is we do have a reverse situation in the last couple of years on our hands. He's got the leverage in the fiscal cliff. He can let this happen and republicans can decide if they want taxes to be much, much higher. Republicans see their leverage coming two months after the fiscal cliff we have another debt ceiling coming up. I think a lot of folks in poli are skeptical that if the republicans lose an election, the american people are open tthem triggering a debt ceiling. 
>> I don't think there's going to be a romney presidency but if we had one, I would love to see the first meeting between him and harry reid and he says okay, let me see your tax returns. 
>> Exactly. I would love to see that meeting, too. And you know, I would also like to see some subsequent meetings between mitt romney and even the republican controlled house, which, as you know, has its factions that john boehner tries to keep together. But essentially is he going to be ae to deal effectively with the tea party types.

>> Thank you both for joining me tonight. 
>> >> Coming up, ana marie cox. And the biggest lie mitt romney has told about president obama has now been exposed by mitt romney's former best friend chris christie and that is in the rewrite. 

[00:42:26]


>>> It took the tragedy of one deadly hurricane to convince one republican that government really does build things and build things that the private sector never could that's next in the rewrite.?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? mo dad? Guys? 
[ engine turns over ] 
[ engine revs ] ?????? ?????? HE'LL BE FINE. [ Male Announcer ] MORE PEOPLE Are leaving bmw, mercedes and lexus for audi than ever before. Take advantage of exceptional values during the season of audi event. is work. And his new ss told him two things -- cook what you love, and save your money. Joe doesn't know it yet, but he'll work his way up from busser to waiter to chef before opening a restaurant specializing in fish and game from the great northwest. He'll start investing early, he'll find some good people to help guide him, and he'll set money aside from his first day of work to his last, which isn't rocket science. It's just common sense. From td ameritrade. Nobody said an inkjet slow. Or that printing in color cost a fortune. Nobody said an all-in-one had to be bulky. Or that you had to print from your desk. At least, nobody said it to us. Introducing the business smart inkjet all-in-one series from brother. Easy to use, it's the ultimate combination of speed, small size, and low-cost printing. 
>>> What was the most lied about statement president obama made this year? What did the president say that republicans then lied about, day in and day out? And even devoted one night of their convention to lying about? This. This was the most lied about ing president obama said this year. 

[00:44:29]


>> If you successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable american system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somedy invested in roads a bridges. If you got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody elsde that happen. The internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the internet so that all the companies could make money off the internet. The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiat but also because we do things together. There are things just like fighting fires we don't do on r own. So we say to ourselves, every since the founding of this country, you know what? There's some things we do better together. 
>> That is the full version of the statement. The version you never hear from republicans. What republicans reduced that to was, if you have a business, you didn't build that. What the president actually said was somebody invested in roads and bridges if you've got a siness you didn't build that. What he was very clearly saying was if you have a business, you did not build the road that your busines on. You did not build the roads that lead to and from your business. The roads and bridges that allow you to do business. In the closing week of the campaign, you haven't heard a word from republicans about you didn't build that, which was once their favorite attack line on the president. And one republican is very busy these days thanking the federal government for what it has built. 
>> I saw in places like avalon where there were significant dunes that were builerby the army corps of engineers, they did much, much better than some of the things that were done in northern part of the shore. One of the things I'm going to be talking to president about is bringing the army corps immediately. 

[00:46:49]


>> Countlessusinesses have been destroyed. Those businesses will not reopen without help from the gont. Federal and state government took coordinated action today to make sure those businesses and individuals will be able to get fuel, fuel that was rapidly running out. Cars in new jersey were going to run out of gas. Gas stations were going to run out of gas. And not be able to get any more. If the government didn't take action today. The government, yes, the gas stations and the drivers are going to pay for that gasoline out of their own pockets when they buy it, but they weren't going to be able to get it without government help. The government will clear the streets of wreck age and debris in front of the businesses that are now closed. The government will do the repair work that allows thos businesses to electrical power, to have passable streets. And ultimately allows those businesses to reopen and thrive once again. The government will reopen the transportation systems that allow those businesses' employees to come to work. Transportation systems that allow those businesses' customers to come to their stores and restaurants. The owners and workers of those businesses will work harder than they have ever had to work before to get their businesses up and running again and they deserve to take pride in whatever rebuilding they do. But what they know is that they cannot do it alone. Not now. Many of them will get checks directly from the federal government for rebuilding. And one republican now believes they should get those checks from the federal government, believes that they deserve those checks. 

[00:48:50]


>> When people who don't have interest on the jersey shore, have never visited, have no interest in seeing it make it, see this in a world of shrinking resources, is it fair to ask why you? Why the money? Why the effort if this is the new normal? 
>> Well, listen, it's fair to ask it but I have the answer. The answer is that for new jersey, which gives so much to THIS COUNTRY, BY THE WAY, 50th In return of our federal tax dollars. So new jerseyans sent more than any other state america getting back less. When that is done and you see that our state is a state that needis to contribute to our economy and also to the soul and vibrancy of our state, I think we have answers and arguments to make. And you're looking at the guy who's going to make those arguments. 
>> Now chris christie is going to be the republican who is going to say to washington, give us money for spending on infrastructure. The kind of spending that republicans mocked in the you didn't build that lie that they told about president obama all year. Le chris christie is the republican guy who's going to say to washington give us earmarks, yes, earmarks for the army corps of engineers to build sand dunes on our beaches. Exactly the kind of spending that republicans have ridiculed for years. Sand dunes that just saved lives in new jersey. And chris christie will have a little extra punch to his argument. Because as he rightly points out, what he's asking for is for new jersey to get its own money back. New jersey sends in more money to the federal government than it ever gets back in federal spending. Per person, new jersey sends in more money than any other state compared to what it gets back in federal spending. The wealthier states have always done this. The phenomenon was first tracked by then-senator from new york daniel patrick moynahan who based his funding on that fact that new york sends into the government far more money than it gets back. While at the same time states like alabama, alaska, louisiana, kentucky, mississippi, west virginia, wyoming, they all operate as clients of the federal government, collecting fromederal treasury far, far more than they ever send in in tax payments. These states have always lived off new york's money and new jersey's money and connecticut's monday and california's money and they've always been represented by conservative politicians happy to make speeches about wasteful federal spending while they were very busy directing that wasteful federal spending as they would call it to their own states. When staten island and the rest of new york state and new jersey and the other storm-damaged states are rebuilt, there is now at least one republican in new jersey who will understand the profound truth president obama spoke when he said this.

>> Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business, you didn't build that. 
>>> It's been ten days since wildberry is the same frequent heartburn treatment as prilosec otc. Now with a fancy coating that gives you a burst of wildberry flavor. Now why make a flavored heartburn pill? Because this is america. And we don't just make things you want, we make things you didn't even know you wanted. Like a spoon fork. Spray cheese. And jeans made out of sweatpants. So grab yourself some new prilosec otc wildbe

>>> It's been ten days since richard mourdock solidified his standing amongst the bat crap crazy politicians when he said this. 
>> Even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape that it is something that god intended to happen. 
>> An october poll had him up by 5 points. Today he's trailing his opponent by 11 points. Joining me now ana marie cox. There is trouble in crazy land for the republicans. claire McCaskill is ahead of todd akin, allen west is in a tie at basically 47-48. How is michelle doing in minnesota? 

[00:56:19]


>> She's actually doing really badly when you consider she's outspent her opponent by about 12-1 and she's really running closely with him in part because she showed her inner crazy and didn't do her district the courtesy of coming back and explain herself later. She kept being crazy. I think there's a lesson for the gop to learn from all of this. This is what happens when you try to ride the wave of something like the tea party without pushing back on the ideological stuff that's objectionable to moderates. This is what happens when you grab on to that momentum because you need the momentum because you'll do anything to win, you'll do anything to grab on to something that makes you seem more popular, you wind up with people like this, not in y primaries, but in your general tion. 
>> Crazy joe walsh is now behind tammy duckworth. He said you don't need the exception for the life of the mother for abortion because the life of the mother is never, ever in danger in pregnancy. 
>> I don't think all men are stupid, but certaiy gop congressmen are and women aren't. This is something we're seeing across the line in swing states. Women are paying attention to these races. Women thing reproductive rights are important in these races and these guys apparently don't understand that that's something women think about not just as a social issue, but as obama said in one of those debates, it's an economic issue, it's a personal freedom issue. 

[00:58:23]


>> And allen west o's just crazy across the board, he doesn't limit himself to reproductive issues. He's the one who said that the house of representatives has like about 100 communists in it, he's in istical tie. And his opponent's ads have just used quotations from allen west. Word for word, this is what your congressman has said and that's the basis of his challenger's campaign and that has worked for him so far. 
>> Yeah. It seems to me that should also work in the presidential campaign some of the stuff mitt romney said, especially now about getting rid of fema, but yes. Allen west has been allowed to go off the reservation. When you're off the reservatiwn for that long you lose sight of where your boundaries are. You go off into crazy land and you forget there is such a thing as sane land. Voters have a way of shutting that down. Voters know crazy when they see it. And when a congressman or when someone who is running for office shows who they are, they will get feedback from voters and it's not going to be voters and it's not going to be positive. 
>>> How close? Let's play "hardball." ???????????? 
>>> good evening. I'm chris matthews in washington. Let me start with this. President obama has got a spring

9 m obama and some bad news. How will this affect the vote? And is the national press reporting the story accurately? Lou dobbs and I will analyze. 
>> There's something much more fundamental about mitt romney. He seems so old-fashioned when it comes to women. 
>> A new study shows that two out of the three cable news networks are more negative than positive toward mitt romney. Can you guess what two they are? Bernie goldberg and I will have some thoughts. 
>> I don't have anything, anywhere to go, I don't have no clothes. 
>> The new york city area really suffering because of hurricane sandy. We will have the latest on that. 
>> Caution, you are about to enter the no spin zone. The factor begins right now! Hi, I'm bill o'reilly. Thanks for watching us. As was predicted yesterday, the national media is reporting today's economic news is a plus for president obama. I'm not saying the data is not a plus, I'm just telling you what the national media is doing. I'm reporting, not analyzing. But now I'll start analyzing. I listen to cbs radio every morning. It's usually pretty fair in its assessment of the news. But I knew when the economic data came out today cbs would report it this way. 
>> The labor department's october employment report, the last big reading on the economy before election day shows stronger than expected job gains. But more people were look for work last month and that pushed unemployment a tenth of a point higher to 7 .9%. Still a pickup of 171,000 jobs is significant. Economist stewart hoffman calls it the real deal. 
>> A good gain in jobs, a widespread gains, this isn't a fluke, it's a genuine improvement in the jobs market. 

[00:02:05]


>> In a moment lou dobbs will tell us if he agrees with that point of view. Here is what is really happening. Unemployment ticked up to 7.9%. However, there were more jobs available in october. In fact, the workforce rose by 578,000 americans. That's good. The reason unemployment went up is because more americans are now looking for jobs because more jobs are becoming available. The bad news is that unemployment among african americans jumped almost a full percentage point from 13.4% to 14.3%. That is a disaster. Also, the real unemployment rate in october was 14.6%, including people who have given up looking for work. Bottom line, 12.5 million americans who want to work, can't find employment. The candidates responded. 
>> In 2008 we were in the middle of two wars and the worst economic crisis since the great pression. Today our businesses have created nearly 5.5 million new jobs and this morning we learned that companies hired more workers in october than at anytime in the last eight months. 
>> He said he was going to lower the unemployment rate down to 5.2% right now. Today we learned that it's actually 7.9%. And that's 9 million jobs short of what he promised. Unemployment is higher today than when barack obama took office. 
>>> Now, as always, you make the call on which can date has a better grasp of the economy. Of course, that will be the deciding factor in the election tuesday. Finally, I think I've covered this economic deal today fairly and my prediction of yesterday that the mainstream media, which overwhelmingly supports president obama's re-election, will use the last few days to bolter mr. Obama looks to be on track. But I want to know what you think about the factor's election coverage analysis. We are asking in a new billoreilly.Com poll. Do you believe the factor has been fair covering the election? Do you believe the factor has been fair covering the election? Yes or no. And we will give you the results on monday. That's a memo. Now the top story tonight, let's bring in the aforementioned economic guru, lou docks. And you say? 

[00:04:20]


>> I say unemployment right now is higher than when president obama took office in 2009. And that's not good enough to be of any significant, in my opinion, any significant help to gov. Romney. And that is 23 million people without work, who are working without, you know, a full-time job who want th or have given up work being all together. 
>> So you,ou dobbs, take the exact opposite stance that cbs news radio takes? Exactly the opposite? 
>> Imagine that. 
>> But look, come on now, cbs radio goes out to thousands of radio stations, people like me listen to it in their car or when you get up, this and that. @You respect -- are a respected economic reporter. You say I don't think it's logical. 
>> You know they have to spin it the president's way. 
>> Whatit portrays a lack of understanding what is happening here and the numbers tell the story. This is a workforce in this country of over 135 million people. We see a net change within that of 171,000 people in one month. It takes about 150,000 of them to just keep up with population growth and suddenly there's economists on the air of cbs that say this is a broad-based change in direction. It is not. It's an improve men, a slight improvement if anything at all, and that's the fact of the matter. 
>> Okay. So you say, and I'm sure with all due respect. 
>> Surely. I like that respect word. 
>> That the economists, they chose, cbs chose, a guy named hoffman, that he doesn't really know what is going on? He doesn't really know what you say that this isn't just a little grip, it doesn't indicate anything on the overall economy. There's no indicator hearby. 
>> One way to look at that, this is one month out of 48 in which president obama will have been president. 1/48th AND TO MAKE BROAD Declarations about it is nonsense. 

[00:06:33]


>> What if I were to say you were a romney partisan, that you believe in robust capitalism, less regulation on business, which I think is true 
>> that's true. 
>> And there are you are spinning this negative against the president because you want romney to win. 
>> No, not at all. I want the american people to win. I will tell you point-blank, if we didn't have 23 million people unemployed who are seeking work, if we didn't have a nation looking for -- 
>> I think 12.5. You are saying 23. 
>> I'm saying 23 million people. 
>> Some of them don't want to really work, right? 
>> That could be one view. My point of view is they were so discouraged out of time, and millions are employed six months or longer in this country. 
>> You are a fairly sophisticated guy when it comes to economics. Everything else you are -- 
>> can we go back to the economics? 
>> The voter is going to hear cbs radio and they are going to hear the other national media on friday, saturday and sunday. Basically tell them -- 
>> the economy is getting better. 
>> The same message that the president has. I don't know if the romney campaign has any answer to that. 
>> I don't think they need an answer, bill. I think the obama campaign is making a big mistake. They are out today and the president with a message saying his policies have worked. The 23 million people disagree. The middle class in this country, all of whom have lost on average $4,000 a household in income. 
>> That's the key. You just hit it. It's income. It's -- these stats don't mean anything. 
>> And sometimes I get lucky like this. 
>> I said you were so fist indicated in economics. That's the key but you don't hear the governor going out with a trumpet and say that's what it's all about, take-home pay, and your take-home pay is going down. Last word. 
>> The last word, this economy, as you said in your opening remarks, this election is about the economy. If it's about the economy, the most trusted man in this race is gov. Romney, on the issue of the economy, and that looks like it will be a powerful influence in the direction in what is a tied race right now. 

[00:08:43]


>> Lou dobbs, everybody. Next, a new study of the three cable news network. There's data concerning positive and negative coverage of mitt romney. Bernie goldberg will discuss. And how the vote may go down tutututututu 

[00:12:15]


>> tonight a new study from the project for excellence in journalism. Look at the three major networks evaluating positive and negative coverage of the two presidential candidates. Since I don't know what "positive" means, I am throwing that o and I can do that because I'm the anchor of the program. But I absolutely do know what negative means and here's the stats on that. Gov. Romney, 36% of the coverage has been negative, 63% neutral. Nbc, and fox news 12% negative, 60% neutral. Join us now from north carolina. Bernard goldberg. There's a reason I'm throwing out the positive is because that's almost impossible to quantify. I mean, it could be a number of things. But negative means you are doing something bad so that's easy. I just want to clarify that. First of all, does it matter what the cable news networks say? 
>> If by does it matter if you mean does it matter in terms of the election, the answer is overwhelmingly no. Here's why. People chews the cable network to watch for a bunch of reason, buone of them is they want their own views validated. If you are a conservativyou are not watching a lot of times spending msnbc and more conservatives watch fox than liberals. 
>> Let me stop you there. In every study that's been taken of this program, which is the flagship at 8:00 p.M., There is a large, independent audience. 
>> Right. 
>> And a significant democratic liberal audience here. 
>> I totally believe that. I totally believe that. And I said one of the reasons they watch is to get their views validated. Another is they just want to watch the more interesting channel. And I think, and I'm not saying this because I'm here tonight, fox is more interesting than the one-note samba of msnbc. But let's take them for a moment. This is funny, by the way, 71% of the stories on mitt romney were negative. 3% were positive for mitt romney. 3%. 

[00:14:37]


>> See, I don't believe that. I don't believe the positive thing. I believe the negative. I don't believe the positive. I don't think any of the stories there were positive. Zero. 
>> You think it was less than 3%? 
>> It didn't even rise to 3%. 3% was a stammer. 
>> I got it. Let's put it this way -- 
>> you know why. They don't have a bret baier or a shepard smith hour. They don't have that. 
>> Got it. 
>> It's all zombie land. Go ahead. 
>> Got. It that's why they can't even vaguely be considered a news organization. They , in effect, -- 
>> a left wing channel. That's what they are. 
>> No, they are barack obama campaign headquarters. 
>> Right now they are. 
>> But your question does it matter, the reason I say no is because most of the people who watch msnbc don't like mitt romney anyway. 
>> Let's stick with the factor, though. I try to be fair and I tee everybody off. I have everybody mad at me, left, right, center, you, whoever it may be. Krauthammer. But I believe we have some influence here. What we try to do, and we just did it with lou dobbs; separate fact from propaganda, which as you know, and you were the first one to even write about this in your book "bias," now fact and propaganda is together in the hard news coverage. 
>> You know, I say this about once every other year. You have again stumbled on to a very impor point. And here's why. Personally -- I mean, I'm a viewer far more often than I'm sitting in a chair talking to you. I'm a viewer most of the time. I prefer analysts who are honest. Conservatives or liberals who will give an honest opinion, even if it hurts their team. And I prefer that overwhelmingly to somebody who is just going to give political spin. And I think on this program, i mean, yeah, are there some people. 

[00:16:46]


>> Not many, them we really try to get people like you. 
>> That's right. 
>> -- Who speak their mind and go against maybe what their philosophy is if the facts say it. I have to get on to this real quick. Another study, center for media and public affairs, analyzed the late night guys and their jokes. Romney by far was the butt of the most jokes. 148 in the time period studies and president obama 62. Once again, does that matter in the election? 
>> Okay. First of all, we live in a liberal culture. The news media is liberal, women's magazines are liberal. Hollywood is liberal. Academia is liberal, and it shouldn't surprise us that late night comedians are liberal, too, and their writers are and they find it much funnier to take a shot at a guy like romney than their guy, barack obama. But does it matter? I think the evidence is it doesn't matter much because the jokes are overwhelmingly against romney. He's the butt of most of the jokes. But the policy don't reflect. That the policy are reflecting a very close race. So if the jokes are overwhelmingly in one direction and it mattered, then the polls would be wider in president obama's favor. 
>> The other thing I would point to is bill clinton was unmercifully mocked. 
>> And he got elected twice. 
>> There you go. Bernie goldberg, ahead. Directly ahead, senator john mccain on who will win the presidency. He has some passionate thoughts about the libya situation. And later on. bernard McQuirk forced to evacuate hit home on long 

[00:21:52]


>> personal story segment. There's perhaps known more qualified in the country right now to speak about the last days of a presidential campaign than senator john mccain. Four years ago he thought he would win the presidency. No he has some very strong views on what will happen tuesday night. ALSO senator McCain is furious, furious about libya. I spoke with him last night. Senator, first of all, are you surprised that the libyan story hasn't gotten much tracks 2349 media? 
>> I guess surprise isn't the word. I'm very, very deeply disappointed. But I guess that I'm not shocked about it. But it sure is reprehensible. 
>> Do you think it's a protect the president play by the instream media where they just don't care about libya? 
>> I think is some combination of that and other factors. But I can tell you, this is a case where four brave americans lost their lives, and probably the most incompetent functioning as far as senate security is concerned of any administration in history. It's either that or willfully deceiving the american people or maybe a combination of both. 
>> Is it enough for the president to say that his administration is investigating and will get to the bottom of it? 
>> There have been two previous attacks on our consulate. The fact that there were warnings, there's a report out today about a meeting on august 15th and the messages sent on the 16th about the lack of security. This has taken on all the earmarks, bill, of the classic scandal and coverup. The coverup continues to go on. Today we know that the counterterrorism security group which is supposed to meet and coordinate the agencies of government when there's an act of terror never met. And the president should go on television and tell the american people. He was quick to go on television to tell the american people about the raid that got bin laden. Have you heard any additional information from the president of the united states about this, except that we will have an investigation? And coincidentally, that investigation will not be completed until after the election. 

[00:24:02]


>> Do you believe that president obama is going to get away with it? The voters have heard the story. I don't think it's going to resonate anywhere near the economy. So he's pretty much going to get away with all of this? 
>> Well, I can tell you I'm hearing from veterans all over this country. I have talk to so many and hearing from men and women who e on active duty. They have no trust and no confidence in this president as their commander in chief. Veterans all over america are at a level of anger that I have never seen before. And I think that may affect voting, at ln a state like florida where they have 1.6 million veterans. They are auroused and angry in a way I have not seen before. 
>> That's interesting. So where are we in the presidential race? This time four years ago you were running a little bit behind barack obama, but, you know, it was still a horse race. What's the difference between now and then? 
>> Think the biggest now is that the president did not have a record in 2008 to defend. And it still leads he to believe the small number of undecides, which will probably make-or-break this election will probably swing to mitt romney when they go into the ballot booth. History shows that undecides generally break for the challenger in close races because they know the incumbent so well. 
>> I do think this weekend there is going to be a pro obama cycle by the mainstream media based on the economy. That's going to be interesting to watch. 
>> I think that, and this four days for him doing his duties as president of this tragedy of the storm, sandy. And I appreciate the president's work there, but I also think we expect presidents to do that. And I believe that this election should be about jobs and the economy. 
>> Now, four years agin the debate you went light on barack obama about the reverend wright stuff. You didn't bring up a lot of his associations, resko and a lot of the chicago stuff. You basically took the high road. In the last debate, mitt romney did not bring up the libya stuff to any extent, whereby he could have, making it a bigger story. Was that a mistake by the governor? 

[00:26:26]


>> I feel strongly about libya, as you know, bill. My background, my knowledge, my love of the military. I plead guilty. I plead guilty because I went to a refugee camp on a turkish border and met some women who had been gang raped and had their parents killed before their eyes. And this president sits back and watches it without even getting weapons to them. I'm angry and upset. Maybe mitt romney, whose background and success I admire, probably may not have as much of an emotional connection but i think he's run a great race, i think he did a great job in the first debate, debate, and I still believe he will win, although we will be up late. 
>> And the reference you just made was to the syrian situation on the turkish border where the president has pretty much STEPPED BACK FROM THAT.t% 
>> Yes. Doing covert -- 
>> and haven't lifted a finger to help these people. 
>> Final question. Think back four years ago. You thought you were going to win. You were campaigning as hard as I have seen anybody ever campaign. Is there any dnce between you and governor romney on the trail? 
>> No, I don't think so. I think he's -- he's got a great message. He's got people inspired. I think that clearly the first debate was a seminal moment in american politics. And the campaign. I think he's done a great job. Senator, thank you very much. From fargo, north dakota, thanks again. senator McCain was in north dakota campaigning for a candidate there. 
>>> And we will talk about the aftermath of sandy. And then we will have the latest polling numbers for you as the presidential vote is just days away. We hope you stay tuned for those reports. that? That's the sound of car insurance compani these days. Here a cheap, there a cheap, everywhere a cheap... You get it. So, what if instead of just a cheap choice, you could make a smart choice? Like, esurance for example. They were born online and built to save people money from the beginning. It's what they've always done. Not just something they cheap about. That's insurance for the modern world. Esurance. Now backed by allstate. Click or call. 

[00:32:01]


>> Many americans are livid about what happened at bghazi. But mr. Rivera has been more object I have about it. I thought you only beat up on me. 
>> I was trying to channel you. 
>> You are on the wrong side and here is why. We discussed this last week. During the terror attack on 9/11 it was impossible to get people in, the military in. It was too fast, two chaotic, the military is too far away. However in august, we now have documentation after documentation after documentation that ambassador stevens and others were telling hillary clinton, and it's right on her plate, telling hillary clinton, the secretary of state, that they could not protect themselves in this environment. The state department not only ignored that, but downgraded the security. Now these are facts. You know, I've seen you in iraq. I've seen you in afghanistan. 
>> You've seen me in benghazi, libya. 
>> Right. And in our the one of these touchy, feely, politically correct people on these issues. Surely you are upset that the state department of the united states would not frequent their own? Surely you are? 
>> I have to start where you started. The president of the united states has been absolutely slandered over this story. He's been called a murderer and a lier. 
>> Not by anybody here, and not by rational people. 
>> There has been plenty of reporting about why he didn't bring the ac-130 gunship there. 
>> We were already there. Rivera, you are going back on territory -- we are already past that 
>> I think the president is owed an apology. 
>> All right. Why don't you go door to door and get that. Stay on my point. 
>> Now let's divide -- so there's three parts to the story 

[00:34:02]


-- 
>> but I want my part. 
>> I'm getting to it. 
>> Get to it now. 
>> I am getting to it. I want to summarize so people aren't confused. 
>> They aren't confused. 
>> So the fred is owed an apology. He did everything he could have done during eight tack to keep people safe. 
>> You don't know that for a fact. That's your opinion. 
>> I know the senators today suggested as such, specifically in a letter -- 
>> you give the president the benefit of the doubt. So that's okay. 
>> It's not giving him the benefit of the doubt -- 
>> no, no, you are -- go to my point. August, requested more security, not given. 
>> And they said today we did not have force necessary the region that could have intervened to save those lives period. Th's what they said. 
>> So you are dodging my question totally on thi 
>> now go back to the two things I think you were right about. As much as I am uncomfortable agreeing with you, let me tell you why I do in part. Remember, there's three parts of the story. Part two I just said. Part one is what about the security in the consulate in benghazi from the getgo? Isn't that fair game that the state depament did not do enough to protect ambassador stevens in benghazi and what the hell was he doing in benghazi knowing about the situation. That's a fair question and that's why I think there should be vigorous hearings about whose idea was it to keep our people in harm's way with so little help. Now the evening of the attack, there's no reason to criticize the president or the cia -- 
>> this is the fourth time you said that. Thank you. 
>> Now to part three of the story. 
>> Right. 
>> How they characterize the attack after the fact with susan rice going on the sunday show. 
>> Misinformation. 
>> That also deserves severe inspection because I believe there are really valid questions about whether or not to protect the president -- 

[00:36:03]


>> so in two years -- here's the deal. 
>> They spun an an act of terrorism into an act of vandalism. 
>> They should have held a press conference long before this and clarified those issues, yes? Yes? 
>> Yes and. 
>> Thank you. As a leader of the country he should have held a press conference and clarified what happened. 
>> Letter. Now here's the press conference. By now we give you your press conference. What was the cia doing in benghazi, mr. President? 
>> I can't answer that because of senate security. 
>> Are you ducking it? 
>> I'm not dubbing it. 
>> Then why don't tell you why they are there. 
>> Come on. 
>> But that's what you get from a press conference. 
>> Bull. He just gets on and says this is what we know and this is what we see. That's all. He hasn't done it. He's running away from it because it would hurt him on the election. You know it. 
>> I just think that we have lost some good people under tragic circumstances that need really to be vigorously investigated, but it's not a political issue. 
>> When did you turn into a waffler? 
>> I know the militia. I'm a war reporter. 
>> Then put you in charge of the investigation. 
>> I can have a press conference. I can answer these questions. 
>> Geraldo, everybody. When we come back, the aftermath of hurricane sandy. bernard McKirk had to be dragged out of his house on long This Bible changed the world. I'm Kirk Cameron. Four Hundred years ago our forefathers risked their lives to bring this Bible to the shores of America. Because it contained the principals for economic liberty, political liberty and religious freedom. The 1599 Geneva Bible. It was the first complete english translation, complete with chapters, numbered verses and 300,000 utterly unique study notes. It actually came out before the King James Version and beuse the government didn't authorize it, it was outlawed. But it was a Bible by the people, for the people, the book that built America. And now for the first time in 400 years it's available again in a beautiful leather edition. I have one, I want you to have yours too. Please visit GenevaBible.com and get your copy of this rare and historic version of God's Word today. Thank you and may God bless you. 

[00:41:25]


>> This is the what the heck just happened segment tonight. A lot of people are happening that because of hurricane sandy. Where I live, long island, a half a million people without hour and chaos all over the area because people can't get gasoline. The marathon was just cancelled. You can't debt there. So you live in long beach, right? 
>> Two blocks from the worried of long beach. 
>> Well, I was a lifeguard a couple of towns down you. A beautiful area. But they had to drag you out of your house, right? 
>> Well, sort of. I left voluntarily yesterday because no power, you know,o heat obviously, this and that. And I saw monday night outbeside my front door the atlantic ocean coming down the block for about an hour and a half like the delaware rapids and watch it rise about an inch a minute for about an hour and a half. 
>> They didn't make leave before the storm? 
>> There was a mandatory evacuation. 
>> But you disobeyed. 
>> Totally disobeyed. After hurricane irene we wanted to say. We were worried about property. 
>> So you stayed in violation, and McQuick, you can get arrested. The authorities are waiting after this segment to get you. But after you stayed in your area, you thought I'm on the north shore, I'm on the other side of the island from you. Now gasoline on long island. They can't pump it because there's no power, right? 
>> Can't get it. 
>> Three and a half hours, four and a half hour waits at the few stations that are open. In your opinion are long islanders reacting well to this? What's -- 
>> I can speak for my hood, if you will, the long beac area. People are despondent, stunned, angry, confused, and waiting for help. There's nobody helping. They don't feel like anybody is being proactive. Unlike governor christie, they don't feel there's anybody speaking up for them and that's the rackaways and those people too. 

[00:43:32]


>> And people in any neighborhood too, where is the power company, how come the governor isn't here, cuomo, and all of that. Now gutfeld is the exact opposite. You don't have any problem, right? 
>> Well, authorities were trying to convince me to stay. 
>> That's weird. 
>> , I don't but -- 
>> just let me explain why for a minute. Because if the water rises, you drown first. 
>> You are an awful human being. You would cradle me in your arms and rescue me. 
>> Over my arms. Right over the shoulder. 
>> It would be a beautiful pictur I suffered nothing but guilt because nothing happened to me. 
>> You are in an apartment in new york city, right? 
>> Yeah. All I did was sit in a room in the dark and drink wine and write poetry about you. But, no, I had no problems. 
>> You didn't lose power? 
>> Didn't lose power. 
>> And if you were below a certain area in lower manhattan, they didn't have powers. 
>> I was fine. My biggest hardship was trying to figure out what kind of takeout I wanted. And my family would call me and I felt so guilty because I had nothing wrong with me. 
>> WHY DON'T YOU say McKirk in. 
>> He had some hygiene problems frani can't deal with. 
>> You are selfish. 
>> I'm a selfish person. 
>> There's no god, is there, bill o'reilly? 
>> People on the west side generally despise people like McKIRK AND I. 
>> I'm staying in a nice warm apartment in queens, my brother-in-law's place. 
>> So you are okay? 
>> I'm okay. Thank you for asking. 
>> Are you going to go back to the peach and live there again? 
>> I certainly am. When the power comes back. 
>> Which will be in three or four years. 
>> So I hear. By started the cleanup already when I was there so I'm glad i didn't leave because now the cleanup has begun and I'm waiting for the power. 
>> You could be dead, though. We are jobing about it but when at the tell you to leave, you should leave. 

[00:45:35]


>> There were people whose houses were knocked off their foundations. 
>> Right. That could have been you. 
>> Could have easily been me. 
>> Who would have been subbing for him tonight? 
>> It's a tough one. I have to say, I feel a little selfish, if there are any nursing students out there that don't have a place to stay, I do have. 
>> Nursing students? 
>> Yes. 
>> Does that include male nurse necessary. 
>> Depends how much I've been drinking. I have bunk beds, six or seven in one small room. 
>> Bunk beds? 
>> Yeah, just in case for this. 
>> But how long are those beds? 
>> They aren't long. Even for the people sleeping in them it's not very long. 
>> We have a few laughs, ladies and gentlemen. The situation iso bad here and if you are not laughing about it you will put the nozzle of gas in your mouth. But what happened, there's no gas so you can do that. We hope everything works out for you. 
>> Nobody cares about me. 
>> In the moment, the very latest presidential polling numbers. And the tip of the day, a column you might want to read. We will be right back. 

[00:47:51]


>> Tons of new polling out today. The tracking has the presidential race tied at 48. In ohio, a vital state, they have it tied at 49. But the university of cincinnati has obama leading by 2 in ohio, 48-46. Colorado, they have romney up by 3. 50-47. But a cnn poll has 50-48, obama. Nevada, all the polls have the president lead bug it is close. Same thing in wisconsin. President is ahead in all the polls except rasmussen, who has the race tied at 49. Florida, all the policy out this week has obama leading romney, but very close. And in the commonwealth, up 5 points but cbs has the president up by two. North carolina, rasmussen has romney up by 6 and survey usa has the governor leading by 5. New hampshire, new england college has obama up by 6 over mitt romney. Last week rasmussen had romney up by 2. And nbc has the president up by 6 points. Got all that? Joining us now from boston, david. He directs polling. 

[00:51:18]


>> He want to run it down from your point of view. You have canvassed the whole country, know what's going on. Ohio, how do you see it? 
>> I see it really close. If you look at the last four polls, it's one point. 1 through 8 the poll was average four to five points. What we look at is the head-to-head number. The last three consecutive polls, excluding the two you mentioned were at 48. That's a sign of vulnerability. Obviously you have seven candidates on the ballot. I think those polls that had the plus four, plus five overstated obama's support because they overcounting a strong democratic county, and they had a party differential in those polls of democrats with an 8 point advantage party affiliation. 
>> So you see romney momentum in ohio? 
>> I see romney strong enough to be within a point. And that's exactly where the last four polls showed him. 
>> So the governor has a very, very -- he has a very good chance in ohio. How about florida? 
>> I don't think so. As we talked about a couple weeks ago, both florida, north carolina and, as well, virginia, are still stuck in that ballot test number of under 48. Florida and virginia are 47.8. The same place they have been for six weeks. They haven't grown. That ballot test number hasn't grown and obama has gone from leading 48-40 to now tied at 48. He hasn't grown at all. He's below 48 in some states and IN NORTH CAROLINA IN 46th. 
>> The momentum there is romney. Florida, north carolina and virginia. 
>> I I believe so. 
>> Just north of you, new hampshire. 
>> New hampshire a lot trickier. In our last new hampshire poll we had it tied at 47-47. The libertarian johnson candidate is a major player. He's a hidden weapon for barack obama, ironically, as a libertarian on the ballot. If people rotate against johnson and if the undecides break against the incumbent, I believe new hampshire could also be in play. Between ohio and new hampshire, those, in my view, in addition to colorado, are the states people should focus on when look at the electoral votes. 

[00:53:45]


>> All the recent polling in new hampshire is the president's way. Johnson is running on legalize pot. And I'm saying this semi facetiously, you think he would take from the president. People who like marijuana are generalally liberal people. Am I wrong there. 
>> Yes and no. He was a republican candidate at one short period of time. He identifies with people who are lib teariance, so hcarries a little more strength than the eight northern counties. Romney will do very well in the two biggest counties in new hampshire, hillsborough and rocking hal county. 
>> Only seconds left. Iowa, who is trend? 
>> I think it's going to be tough to beat barack obama. 
>> So obama, iowa. Colorado? 17 candidates on the ballot, very difficult to say. That's even 49.5 could win colorado. 
>> All right 
>> that's iffy. 
>> Nevada looks to be obama. I've got to go. Factor tip of the day, newspaper column you might like. The tip, 60 seconds away.

S en asking, you're all nice. I want to show you one thing though. Look at this video. This was taken this morning by our friend jessica rodriguez who is a producer on this show. Most of these nights, she would be responsible for making sure this video made it on air, but today she was at home in new york on long island because this is the street where jessica lives. This is what her neighborhood looks like as of today. Four days after the storm made landfall. She was at home today working to assess the damage, clean up her flood-damaged home and help her neighbors. While she was at home, a new york congressional delegation made her way down the block. She was wearing her staff sweatshirt when a senator came up to talk to her. This little flip cam video, this is the best way we know to show you how we all feel about this story that we are in the mid te of. This disaster just took lives and uprooted lives and ruined a lot over a huge area affecti millions of americans. In a big area of the east coast, but also really specifically in this one part that we all live which is the most densely-populated place in this country. Which means we're forced here in this particular part of america to be interconnected and interdependent, to know thy neighbor because thy neighbor is close to thee. It's part of the reason you live and work in a place like this. We strive to take a fair view of what's happening in the world to do our best job at communicating useful information to you about the world we are in, but if you have been sensing some personal urgency in our telling this particular story, it's just because we cannot hide it.

When the power came back on in parts of lower manhattan tonight, late this afternoon and early tonight, you could hear the cheering from the lower east side of manhattan. Sweet relief, it's been a long week. There was some cheering here at our offices in midtown when we saw the live feed come through. Throughout the night, the lights have been coming on in our homes as well, which is a cause for e relief and lots of gratitude and lots of worry and consternation over the places that are still a long way out from coming back. A point of personal privilege, if you have not donated, think about whether you can. 1-800-help-now. I will leave it there. A lot to get to tonight.

>>> it's now four days until t election and we have reached the point where the campaigns both start pounding their chests and say we're going to win, we're sure of it. I'm not sure why they do this other than the fact that trash talk is always fun in sports and in politics. But maybe there's a sense of people who haven't decided even at this late point in the game will want to side with the guy that's going to be the winner. But regardless, both sides do it every year. In the last few days before the vote in particular. That's why you're seeing david axelrod making a bet that if president obama does not win michigan and minnesota and pennsylvania, he will shave off his mustache. He's betting his face. That's how confident he is. Because this is the time in the campaign when you're supposed to project confidence. On the republican side, it's been a little more complicated. After a bad week of polling for mitt romney, top staffers held a conference call with reporters that enumerated their reasons why they see mitt romney as a shoe in despite the polling. They suggested their secret sauce that's more important than the polling is that mr. Romney is winning independents. So there. Romney has this thing in the bag. Carl rove, for the republicans this year, he took to "the wall street journal" this week to patitly explain to the people who don't understand that these numbers that look so bad for mr. Romney do not matter or they are wrong. Or they are wrong and they don't matter. Because he says democrats are not winning early voting by enough. And he says the polls make assumptions about turnout that he describes as absurd. It also describes some stuff that makes him believe romney is going to win like crowd size and closing clguments. That shows that mitt romney is totally going to win this thing. Both are trying to convince the country it's obvious they are going to win. It's worth listening to the arguments and checking to see if the arguments are based in good sense. But honestly, it's also worth recognizing that every campaign on both sides does this every time. For example, here is how this particular phenomenon looked the day before the election in 2008 when this bragging that we get every year was being done by a john McCain republican surrogate named mitt romney. 

[00:08:51]


>> Insmpaign, what do you get on the inside that we don't get on the outside because you're doing your own polling? 
>> You see the widest array of polls. You look at mason din that came out yesterday. You take that apart, it's close to the internal polls. IT SHOWS THAT john McCain is leading in the states that he's got to lead in. We're going to pick up pennsylvania. We have a good shot in vnia, new hampshire, new mexico, nevada, that's the pathway to VICTORY FOR john McCain. We're excited. We're hoping to see a lot of people out there in chicago on election night with barack obama experiencing a long, cnight, THAT john McCain won. 
>> It's nice he wishes physical discomfort on his enemies. But notice what exactly he was so confidently predicting there. The day before the election in 2008, it was mitt romney. These were his predictions for STATES THAT john McCain was definitely going to win. 
>> john McCain is leading in the states he's got to lead in l ohio and florida. We'll pick up pennsylvania. We think we have a good shot at virginia, new hampshire, new mexico, nevada. That's the pathway to victory FOR john McCain. 
>> See how all those states were blue? His confident predictions that john McCain was going to win all those states in 2008 were wrong in every single instance. They lost every single one of those states. Even though it seemed like he was going to win all of those states the day before the election. He didn't say like he felt they were going to win. He said they have the polling data that showed they were going to win and they did not win in any of those states. This is just part of the way the game is played. It's just bluffing. And that is important context for understanding what's going on in the last four days of the campaign. There are patterns to how presidential elections end. Some of the same stuff happens every four years. Specifically, in 1992, the republican candidate was poppy bush. He went and campaigned in pennsylvania. And then the next day, he lost pennsylvania. The next election, 1996, bob dole. Right before the electio bob dole went and campaigned in pennsylvania. Then bob dole lost pennsylvania. In 2004 the republican was george bush and the day before the election he went and campaigned in pennsylvania. And the next day, george bush lost pennsylvania. Last time around as well the sunday before the election, THERE'S john McCain campaigning in pennsylvania. AND THEN john McCain loses pennsylvania. Right before the election, you can set your watch by it. The republican presidential contender will go and campaign in pennsylvania. And every year the media responds by saying, wow the repuan is going to pennsylvania. Maybe the republicans are going to win pennsylvania this year. Does this mean the republicans are planning on winning pennsylvania this year e. And the republicans say, yes, we're going there because we're going to win pennsylvania and they lose it every year. The reason they do this every year is because they want to be seen as super confident. They want to be seen as so confident they are eding the map. They want to create the impression that they are going to win big. They don't need to go to the so-called battleground states. They have locked all those up. They have the meat and potatoes. They are going for gravy. They go to exotic states because they are going to win those states too. It's going to be a landslide. It's trash talk. You can understand why they are doing this, but there's no reason to pretend that it's unprecedented and there's no reason to write down the spin instead of checking the facts about whether their argument actually makes sense. Checking the facts is easy to do. Look at the polls in pennsylvania. There have been two dozen polls in pennsylvania since august first. Of those two dozen polls, of those 24 polls, how many does president obama lead in? 24 of the 24. Every single one. And look at the rest of mr. Romney's campaign hedule. He's taking the one trip to pennsylvania that republicans always take. But other than that, he was in ohio and wisconsin today. He was scheduled to be in new hampshire, iowa and colorado in the final days. And he just spent the last couple days in florida and virginia. That means the map is not expanding. No the if you can't afford to walk away from any battle ground states. He's still flogging it out where he has to win. All of this we're going to win stuff is a fake out, it's a blf, it's trash talk. And there's nothing wrong with it. It happens every year. You should know it's a dependable part of the end of presidential campaigns. But every once in awhile at the end of a presidential campaign, this expected faint, this attempt at a fake out that everybody knows is coming, every once in awhile it's revealed as a fake out. Every once in awhile you get from the campaign an admission that they actually know they are going to lose. At least they know they might lose. At least they are making plans based on an expectation they could lose. And when that happens, we know from insiders on campaigns past that it's very unsettling to the campaign and makes everybody upset and hope people do not notice it happened. That's what happened in 2008. It was right before the election and pro-palin conservatives started talking to the press publically floating her plans for after the election. Not as vice president, but aft b THE ELECTION AFTER john McCain and sarah palin lost. Their plans for her were published by "the new york times" seven days before election day. if McCain loses, she could emerge as a standard barer for the movement in 2012. Her prospects in or out ofr governmentre among conversations among conservative leaders. She's making sure she's well-positioned for the future if they lose. That was a week before election day in 2008. Sarah palin's plans for saving her own skin once they lost the election were being leaked by her allies. And we know from people inside that campaign it caused enormous TENSION INSIDE the McCain/palin camp. So imagine how this went over this week in the romney campaign. Publically, the romney campaign is on their we're going to win tour. We're even going to win pennsylvania tour. That's what they are saying publically. That's their public message. Meanwhile the associated press publishes a story that's eerily similar to the sarah palin's post-election defeat plan. This time it's paul ryan whose future is being leaked about by his supporters who are fairly, clearly assuming that they are about to lose and they need to think of something else for paul ryan to do because he's not going to be busy as vice president. Publically ryan and allies maintain that momentum is behind the romney/ryan ticket, but his biggest boosters realize he can write his own ticket. These allies spoke on the condition to discuss private proposals they were preparing for him. If romney loses, ryan will be seen as a white house contender in 2016 just like sarah palin was in 2012. For the next few years, democrats would lay traps forcing them to take sides on measures to come back to haunt him. That's why ryan's biggest boosters are considering why it wouldn't be better for paul ryan to resign from the house. He could write a book. Or he could teach at a university. Days before the election, paul ryan's supporters are leaking their plans to the press for what they want paul ryan to do since he's not going to be vice president. What they want paul ryan to do once he and mitt romney lose the election next week. I sort of can't believe it didn't get more attention yesterday afternoon. It is also the purest and most direct rebuttal of that campaign's own rather heroic efforts to project some super human confidence about how much they think they are going to win on tuesday. Joining us is a man who is in the business of knowing who is going to win, nate silver, for "the new york times." He's the who author of "the signal and the the noise." Thank you for being here. 

[00:17:39]


>> Thank you, rachel. 
>> A lot of headlines say that since mitt romney is going to pennsylvania, that must mean that pennsylvania is in play. From the numbers, do you believe pennsylvania is in play? 
>> You had the list of 24 polls and none had romney ahead. Some were done that had romney up a couple points there, but no public pollster has had him with a lead all year. It's not just that obama is up there, but it's a state where it's been stable and consistent in the polling. I think it might be more in play because I don't think they are conceding ohio. They need a better plan b. 
>> Is there a famous circumstance in which all the polls all yearlong point in one direction and a partisan poll correctly predicted the results? 
>> That poll is almost always going to be wrong. Especially when there's a consensus of 20 polls. Maybe in a house race where the public polls aren't as good. But the public polling is pretty good. We know what the party bases are and where they live. This is a state that teases republicans where they can get up to 49% pretty easily, but it's hard to get to 50%. Unless because of the hurricane and where the power outages might be, that could affect things. But apart from that, it's a sign of a campaign that doesn't like the electoral map very much. 
>> What about the montra we have been hearing on the right. We were hearing the idea that mr. Romney has momentum heading to the election day. You shouldn't look at the raw numbers. You should appreciate there's momentum movement in the numbers that indicates he's going to win. How do you assess that? 
>> Today was proof he does not have momentum, there were 19 polls released today in battleground states. And mitt romney led in zero of those polls. There were two ties and obama led in 17. That's not what we were seeing two weeks ago where romney pulled ahead in virginia and colorado and florida and had drown ohio down to a one-point lead. If anything, obama has momentum. He was declared the winner of the final two debates. I'm not sure how the hurricane is playing for him, but his numbers ticked up. That's why the states that seem toss uppy seem like they are more firmly in the president's favor. 

[00:20:05]


>> Let mask you, and I didn't warn you I was going to ask you this, but you have been the subject of a lot of criticism in this last week in particular as if the polling model that you built at "the new york times" and the way you explain the polling is somehow biased or wrong or evil. I feel like you are waging a one-man war against pneumonia rossty in explaining how polling works. How has the week been? 
>> It's been a trip where you become subject of conversation yourself and there's this celebrity level attached to it that's new for me e. But there are other websites that do the same thing that we do. They all show basically the same thing. There's no way to slice and dice the data in ohio or iowa or wisconsiright now and say that romney is winning there. In fact, the polls would have to mess up by quite a bit for that to occur. There's years that's happened. But we're now in the phase where it's nnger a question of who is ahead in the electoral college so much as will the polls have a bad year and they could, but that's why you see some conservatives now are no longer bothering to say that we're winning in these states. They are saying that the polling is wrong. Usually it's wishful thinking. 
>> You're a man at the center of the storm in a which you did not expect to be. 
>> Thank you, rachel. His book is callinged "the signal and the noise

>>> SEPTEMBER 10th, 2002. Florida voters go to the polls for a primary. What they find is a mess. Fancy new voting machines do not work. Poll workers do not show up. Pollinplaces do not open because voting that day is hard the lines are surprisingly long. Florida's governor at the time is jeb bush. He orders the polls to stay open for two extra hours to help everybody that wants to vote vote. That was in 2002. In 2008 florida sees epic lines at the polls. Even in the days beforthat during the time for early voting. People waiopd through lines that stretched through three city blocks. This is what it looks like in 2008 even during early voting. Florida's governor during that election was also a republican, charlie crist and he declared a state of emergency at the polls. He ordered the polls to stay open longer so peoe can vote. He says I have a responsibility to ensure that the maximum number of citizens can participate in the process and every person can exercise the is right to vote. The obama campaign thanks the republican governor when he did that and then with a boost from early voting, democrat barack obama won the state of florida and the presidency oops. Last year florida's new republican governor rick scott decided he was not going to make that mistake again. Rather than expanding voting the new one decided he would cut the days for early voting almost in half in order to make voting harder. Look. At least that's how it works. Long, long, long lin for early voting in polls places across florida except this year it's long lines with no relief in sight. We have been getting pictures ever since early voting started in the state. This is how democracrks in florida this year. Look at this. Get in line. Wait and wait. Wait an hour. Wait four hours. Wait five hours. Yesterday florida democrats and the nonpartisan group the league of women voters ked the governor to do something about the long lines. They asked him to add a day of voting to open the polls on the last sunday before the election when many african-americans usually plan to car pool after church to go vote. The governor said no. Florida's governor said, "early voting will end on saturday night, but I want everybody to get out to vote." He wants everybody to get out and vote. Just get in line. Let's see how long we can make you wait. Get in that line going out the door, around the block, governor scott is lfive-hour waits for his constituents already for the people he was ted to serve. And he has no sign of any desire to fix it. Listen. The more opportunity people have to vote, the more likely they are to vote. High turn out favors democrats. Low turn out, favors republicans. This is not rocket science. To the extent that voting in florida is a debacle, it's one made by design. The ballot in florida is ten pages long. And with fewer days to vote, you get really long lines. But that's the way it goes in florida now. Leading up to the election, florida republicans cut the time for early voting in half. So now floridians stand in long lines. They pass new restriction on registering voters so thousands fewer new voters signed up. And the governor has tried to purge the voter rolls. In south florida and palm beach county, 30,000 ballots were printed wrong. Clerks have been copying what the voters marked on to new ballots that can fit into the tabulating machines. Dozens asked for absentee ballots and still haven't gotten them because they screwed up the ballots. The situation is worse in broward county where people have waited for weeks for absentee ballots. Yocan say that florida's election is another debacle in the making were it not already a debacle right now. And it is. Joining us is joy reid. She's an msnbc contributor who has been reporting on the election mess in florida. Thank you for being here. It's nice ave you here. 

[00:32:16]


>> Great to be here. All florida. Florida will not be moved aside by ohio. 
>> We believe in the power of florida here because florida has demonstrated its power. In terms of what I just summarized there, does it strike you in terms of your latest reporting as what's most important to keep an eye on? And what's your latest reporting on the other issues? 
>> Absolutely, rachel. In the last couple hours, I made a couple phone calls and discovered that everything you said is accurate with one more county. Miami-dade is also having issues with people who requesd absentee ballots. Some of these people requested that ballot a month ago. They requested it the beginning of october. And still haven't gotten them. If it's not returned by 7:00 p.M. On tuesday, in the a office on that day, it won't count. Then the next wrinkle is that people who ordered their absentee ballots but decided to show up at a poll and try to vote will be made to vote on provisional ballots because there's no way to verify that person didn't mail ian absentee ballot. And florida doesn't have a strong record of counting provisional ballots. 
>> Why does the government not do more to make voting easier? We saw rick scott take action here more aggressively than other republican legislatures did. He ordered that early voting be cut. Has there been any argument from what he's done? 
>> No. You talked about charlie crist earlier and the fact he signed that executive order extending voting hours. That was the beginning of the end of charlie crist's tenure in the party. Because republicans in the state blamed crist for barack obama winning the state. So when I spoke with the former head of the republican florida in florida who is in his own world of trouble over charges about some illegal money things he was doing, but when he was running the party, he told me that republican consultants came to him and said we want to craft a bill to get rid of early voting or severely cut it because in the worlds of the consultants, all it does is bring every african-american out from under a rock and get them to vote for democrats. It doesn't help us. So the republican legislature which in 2010 became more tea party and conservative, there's no margin in it for them to increase access to in-person early voting. What they did is passed a law that didn't touch absentee voting, which republicans tend to dominate in, but severely limited the early vote. So there were 96 hours this year total to vote. There wereours in 2008. And already in the state, 3.46 million people have voted. When you looked at the numbers, that's almost as many votes as barack obama got by himself. In the last presidential election, almost half of the people who voted voted early. This is really a problem. 

[00:35:25]


>> This is a problem and this is a problem not looking ahead to election day. It's a problem already in the way that it's affecting people who are trying to early vote. I feel like I'm not the dredge report and I'm not a website, but if I could put a siren over my head, I would. 
>> I'd wear one too. 
>> We'll have to get them. Joy, it's great to have you here. Thank you. 
>> Thank you.

>>> A flurry of new polling from the swing states today. All these polls are ju released today. In colado president obama up by four. In iowa, president obama up by four. In wisconsin president o by seven points. In new hampshire the president leading in six points. In ohio president obama leading in three points. In virginia president obama leading by one point. In florida president obama leading by two points. One state that's not a swing state this year but that president obama made into a swing state in 2008 is the great ste of indiana. Indiana flipped from red to blue in the presidential contest. President obama is not necessarily expected to pull off the same thing this year in indiana. But this year there's a really hot race in indiana in the senate. After a tea party primary cost senator richard lugar his senate job, the republican candidate in indiana ended up being the guy on the left side of your screen richard mourdock. He's up against joe donnelly. Since he made his rape comment at a debate a few weeks ago, in very, very, very, very red state indiana, the republican candidate is now behind in that state senate race. He's losing the race by double digits. Here's the interesting thing about that poll to. It's a poll in indiana, which almost never happens. It's really weird, but nobody nationally never knows what's going on in indiana politics because they don't poll in indiana. In indiana, it's illegal to make automated calls for telemarketing purposes and for public opinion surveys like polling. You can't use an auto dialing device unless the subscriber has consented to being contacted or a live operator gets on the line and getssent that y. Since it make s it hard and expensive, there's little polling in indiana. But while we're on the subject of weird details, check out this ballot in north carolina. It's more than a dozen states where they have straight ticket voting. They say everybody with an r next to their name, that's who I'm voting for. I want all the republicans or all the democrats. But there's a bizarre catch to straight ticket voting in north caro. North carolinas the only state where voting for a straight ticket does not include the presidential race. So you have to vote for the straight ticket and then in addition to that, you also have to cast another vote for president. If you just vote straight ticket democratic, you do not cast a vote for barack obama for president. You have to do that separately in addition. So it's not really straight ticket voting. It's straight ticket plus the president voting. Okay. I said weird details. Here's something weirder. This is a democrat in the governor's race. He leads in the polls by more than 30 points. But that may not be enough. The vermont state constitution requires a candidate for governor to get 50% plus one vote. So even though he's leading, he has four opponents. So if those four opponents get a combined 50% of the vote, the GOVERNOR WILL NOT BE REELECTEt No matter how big the margin he wins by. In that case with nobody getting 50%, it's the state legislature that picks the governor. That's happened recently. Some of the most interesting still undecided races from yesterday's elections after the governor's seat. This afternoon nbc news declaring peter shumlin the winner. What's interesting about that is that even though the democrat won, he did not get 50% of the vote. Under vermont's state rules, that means technically the legislature picks who wins the ra two months after that, the vermont legislature did what vermonters had already done. They picked peter shumlin to be governor. Which means 28 people in the legislature voted to elect somebody who the people of vermont did not vote for. A gentle reminder that states run the elections. They are governed by weird rules and worth whatever efforts it takes. It's worth filling out two bubbles. I'm looking at you, north carolina.

>>> The question for this election is this. Do you want to stay on the same course we're on or do you want real change. Paul ryan and aplan on putting in place real change from day one. Accomplishing real change is something I don't just talk about, it's something I've done. The question of this election comes down to this. Do you want more of the same or do you want real change? We bring real change. 
>> Spare change? Real change. That was mitt romney's closing argument today in wisconsin and ohio. A vote for me is a vote for real change. And tonight, just outside cincinnati, the romney campaign attempting to underscore that message by holding a big mega rally in westchester ohio. Featuring nearly 100 governors, senators, congressmen and other republican luminaries to talk about the real change you would get if you elect mitt romney. So who did he enlist to sell this message of what real change he's oering america? The headliners were george w. Bush's secretary of state, george w. Bush's labor secretary, the governor and current speaker of the househe mitt romney, change you can believe in if you really liked george w. Bush and if you like the current republican congress. Then we're the kind of real change we're looking for. Who cast this thing, the democrats? One of the reasons that the message of real change resonated back in 2008 because the country at large had ceased to be delighted by the george w. Bush administration. And it wasn't just the war in iraq or, or, or, or. It was stuff like this. This is the u.S. State department's annual report on global terrorism in 2003. Every year they would put together a report ke this detailing accidents of terrorism around the world. And the next report after this one, showed that despite the bush administration's clai that we were winning the war on terror, despite the constant claims, the number of terrorist attacks had gone up to its highest level in the two decades the state department had been publishing this report. What was the bush administration's solution to that problem? The solution was to stop publishing the report. The bush administration just eliminated that annual report once it included something very politically inconvenient. The bush administration had a habit of doing this. If you don't like the data, get rid of the data. Earlier they were faced with a new report from their own education department showing that charter school kids were falling behind public school kids. How do you deal with your own administration's data on underperforming charter schools? You cut back on the data that you collect about charter hools. The bush administration just announced they w be collecting less data going foard. In 2003, after the bush administration labor department report detailed mass layoffs in the manufacturing sector, the bush administration announced they were going to stop publishing information about mass layoffs. If we get rid of the data pointing to a problem, maybe the data wouldn't look so bad. The obvious move is to get rid of it. This w a hall mark of the george w. Bush administration and it appears to be one of the things hat mr. Romney liked very much about the george w. Bush administration. It at least appears to be one of the things that he's promising to bring back. You don't like the data presented? Kill the report. After the totally unimpeachable ly did a report concluded that romney's plan would be great for rich people and hurt everybody else, the response to that was to go guns blazing against the center. You don't the message, shoot the messenger. Last month after the bureau of labor statistics announced the unemployment rate was going down, the right started attacking the bureau of labor statistics as if they were the problem because they said the unployment rate was going down. It used to be that democrats and republicans would argue about how best to deal with some factual things, some problem facing the national. Now republicans do it differently. They do it differently than everybody else. This is not a mirror image problems on both sides. They refuse to acknowledge factual thing. They are still doing, it was brought to a whole new level last week when it was revealed that a nonpartisan tax report was withdrawn by a federal agency because republicans protested its findings. The federal agency in question here is the congressional resource service. They're kind of the gold standard. Congress's internal think tank. Members of congress have a question about policy or issue, they look into it for them and they issue a report in response to a member of congress asking for that report. The congressional research service is as nonpartisan as it gets in washington. And a little more than a month ago, they issued a report on tax policy. They found there is no connection between lowering the tax rates millionaires and billionaires and creating economic growth. There's no evidence that if you cut taxes on the rich that that makes the economy grow. That's a problem because that is essentially mitt romney's whole reason for living. This is the republican party's economic reason for existing. If you cut taxes on the rich, the job creators, that will jump start the economy. This is e whole basis of the party' economic philosophy. This is why congressiona republicans pledge their first born children to a man named grover. And here comes this highly respected agency that says it turns out the whole thing is bunk. Giving rich people a tax break doesn't help the economy but it sure does help rich people. What do you do if you're the republican party? You pressure the agency into burying the report which is exactly what republicans in congress did this fall. The "new york times" is reporting that the congressional research service quietly withdrew their entire report. Reportedly against the advice of their own economics experts. This is amazing, right? If a report tells you something you do not want to hear, get rid of the report. Especially if that report is coming out on the eve of a big election and it debunks your candidate's whole economic argument. Luckily, breaking news, the report does still t. You can find it right now. You can read it right now. It's not written very long, you can find it at maddowblog.Com and there is nothing that republicans can do to stop that. We will see you again on sunday night. We are doing a special live edition of this show on sunday night, because, well, isn't it obvious? Well, now it's time for "the last word" with lawrence o'donnell. Have a great night.

A lot of us have property almost all of us have been living out of suitcases, but we are all safe and that's what's important. I want to thank everybody who has been asking, you're all nice. I want to show you one thing though. Look at this video. This was taken this morning by our friend jessica rodriguez who is a producer on this show. Most of these nights, she would be responsible for making sure this video made it on air, but today she was at home new york on long island because this is the street where jessica lives. This is what her neighborhood looks like as of today. Four days after the storm made landfall. She was at home today working to assess the damage, clean up her flood-damaged home and help her neighbors. While she was at home, a new york congressional delegation made her way down the block. She was wearing her staff sweatshirt when a senator came up to talk to her. This little flip cam video, this is the best way we know to s you how we all feel about this story that we are in the middle of. This disaster just took lives and uprooted lives and ruined a lot over a huge area affecting millions of americans. In a big area of the east coast, but also really specifically in this one part that we all live in, which is the most densely-populated place in this country. Which means we're forced here in this particular part of america to be interconnected and interdependent, to know thy neighbor because thy neighbor is close to thee. It's part of the reason you live and work in a place like this. We strive to take a fair view of what's happening in the world to do our best job at communicating useful information to you about the world we are in, but if you have been sensing some personal urgency in our telling this particular story, it's just because we cannot hide it. It's true. Which is why I say it's a privilege to do this show this night following the big telethon to raise funds for the hurricane sandy relief effort. I may never endorse candidates, but I'm allowed to tell you how wholeheartedly I endorse this message that if you have the means to do so, even at a small level, if you have the means to do so, you should donate to help the relief efforts for this disaster. If you want to donate by phone, the number is easy to remember. 1-800-help-now. Online, you can go to red cross right now. Or you can donate $10 by texting to 90999. When the power came back on in parts of lower manhattan tonight, late this afternoon and early tonight, you could hear the cheering from the lower east side of manhattan. Sweet relief, it's been a long week. There was some cheering here at our offices in midtown when we saw the live feed come through. Throughout the night, the lights have been coming on in our homes as well, which is a cause for e relief and lots of gratitude and lots of worry and consternation over the places that are still a long way out from coming back. A point of personal privilege, if you have not donated, think about whether you can. 1-800-help-now. I will leave it there. A lot to get to tonight. The new york city marathon was cancelled. 22 million gallons of gas will be distributed. And by the way, there's a presidential election in four days and there's news about that too. That's all hay add in next hour. We'll be right back.

>>> it's now four days until the election and we have reached the point where the campaigns both start pounding their chests and say we're going to win, we're sure of it. I'm not sure why they do this other than the fact that trash talk is always fun in sports and in politics. But maybe there's a sense of people who haven't decided even at this late point in the game will want to side with the guy that's going to be the winner. But regardless, both sides do it every year. In the last few days before the vote in particular. That's why you're seeing david axelrod making a bet that if president obama does not win michigan and minnesota and pennsylvania, he will shave off his mustache. He's betting his face. That's how confident he is. Because this is the time in the campaign when you're supposed to project confidence. On the republican side, it's been a little more complicated. After a bad week of polling for mitt romney, top staffers held a conference call with reporters that enumerated their reasons why they see mitt romney as a shoe in despite the polling. They suggested their secret sauce that's more important than the polling is that mr. Romney is winning independents. So there. Romney has this thing in the bag. Carl rove, for the republicans this year, he took to "the wall street journal" this week to patiently explain to the people who don't understand that these numbers that look so bad for mr. Romney do not matter or they are wrong. Or they are wrong and they don't matter. Because he says democrats are not winning early voting by enough. And he says the polls make assumptions about turnout that he describes as absurd. It also describes some stuff that makes him believe romney is going to win like crowd size and closing arguments. That shows that mitt romney is totally going to win this thing. Both are trying to convince the country it's obvious they are going to win. It's worth listening to the arguments and checking to see if the arguments are based in good sense. But honestly, it's also worth recognizing that every campaign on both sides does this every time. For example, here is how this particular phenomenon looked the day before the election in 2008 when this bragging that we get every year was being done by a john McCain republican surrogate named mitt romney. 

[00:08:54]


>> Inside a campaign, what do you get on the inside that we don't get on the outside because you're doing your own polling? 
>> You see the widest array of polls. You look at mason dixon that came out yesterday. You take that apart, it's close to the internal polls. IT SHOWS THAT john McCain is leading in the states that he's got to lead in. We're going to pick up pennsylvania. We have a good shot in virginia, new hampshire, new mexico, nevada, that's the pathway to VICTORY FOR john McCain. We're excited. We're hoping to see a lot of people out there in chicago on election night wbarack obama experiencing a long, cold night, THAT john McCain won. 
>> It's nice he wishes physical discomfort on his enemies. But notice what exactly he was so confidently predicting there. The day before the election in 2008, it was mitt romney. These were his predictions for STATES THAT john McCain was definitely going to win. 
>> john McCain is leading in the states he's got to lead in like ohio and florida. We'll pick up pennsylvania. We think we have a good shot at virginia, new hampshire, new mexico, nevada. That's the pathway to victory FOR john McCain. 
>> See how all those states were blue? His confident predictions that john McCain was going to win all those states in 2008 were wrong in every single instance. They lost every single one of those states. Even though it seemed like he was going to win all of those states the day before the election. He didn't say like he felt they were going to win. He said they have the polling data that showed they were going to win and they did not win in any of those states. This is just part of the way the game is played. It's just bluffing. And that is important context for understanding what's going on in the last four days of the campaign. There are patterns to how presidential elections end. Some of the same stuff happens every four years. Specifically, in 1992, the republican candidate was poppy bush. He went and campaigned in pennsylvania. And then the next day, he lost pennsylvania. The next election, 1996, bob dole. Right before the election, bob dole went and campaigned in pennsylvania. Then bob dole lost pennsylvania. In 2004 the republican was george bush and the day before the election he went and campaigned in pennsylvania. And the next day, george bush lost pennsylvania. Last time around as well the sunday before the election, THERE'S john McCain campaigning in pennsylvania. AND THEN john McCain loses pennsylvania. Right before the election, you can set your watch by it. The republican presidential contender will go and campaign in pennsylvania. And every year the media responds by saying, wow the republican is going to pennsylvania. Maybe the republicans are going to win pennsylvania this year. Does this mean the republicans are planning on winning pennsylvia this year e. And the republicans say, yes, we're going there because we're going to win pennsylvania and they lose it every year. The reason they do this every year is because they want to be seen as super confident. They want to be seen as so confident they are expanding the map. They want to create the impression that they are going to win big. They don't need to go to the so-called battleground states. They have locked all those up. They have the meat and potatoes. They are going for gravy. They go to exotic states because they are going to win those states too. It's going to be a landsli l. It's trash talk. You can understand why they are doing this, but there's no reason to pretend that it's unprecedented and there's no reason to write down the spin instead of checking the facts about whether their argument actually makes sense. Checking the facts is easy to do. Look at the polls in pennsylvania. There have been two dozen polls in pennsylvania since august first. Of those two dozen polls, of those 24 polls, how many does president obama lead in? 24 of the 24. Every single one. And look at the rest of mr. Romney's campaign schedule. He's taking the one trip to pennsylvania that republicans always take. But other than that, he was in ohio and wisconsin today. He was scheduled to be in new hampshire, iowa and colorado in the final days. And he just spent the last couple days in florida and virginia. That means the map is not expanding. No the if you can't afford to walk away from any battle ground states. He's still flogging it out where he haso win. All of this we're going to win stuff is a fake out, it's a bluff, it's trash talk. And there's nothing wrong with it. It happens every year. You should know it's a dependable part of the end of presidential campaigns. But every once in awhile at the end of a presidential campaign, this expected faint, this attempt at a fake out that everybody knows is coming, every once in awhile it's revealed as a fake out. Every once in awhile you get from the campaign an admission that they actually know they are going to lose. At least they know they might lose. At least they are making plans based on an expectation they could lose. And when that happens, we know from insiders on campaigns past that it's very unsettling to the campaign and makes everybody upset and hope people do not notice it happened. That's what happened in 2008. It was right before the election and pro-palin conservatives started talking to the press publically floating her plans for after the election. Not as vice president, but after THE ELECTION AFTER john McCain and sarah palin lost. Their plans for her were published by "the new york times" seven days before election day. if McCain loses, she could emerge as a standard barer for the movement in 2012. Her prospects in or out of government are among conversations among conservative leaders. She's making sure she's well-positioned for the future if they lose. That was a week before election day in 2008. Sarah palin's plans for saving her own skin once they lost the election were being leaked by her allies. And we know from people inside that campaign it caused enormous TENS[ON INSIDE the McCain/palin camp. So imagine how this went over this week in the romney campaign. Publically, the romney campaign is on their we're going to win tour. We're even going to win pennsylvania tour. That's what they are saying publically. That's their public message. Meanwhile the associated press publishes a story that's eerily similar to the sarah palin's post-election defeat plan. This time it's paul ryan whose future is being leaked about by his supporters who are fairly, clearly assuming that they are about to lose and they need to think of something else for paul ryan to do because he's not going to be busy as vice president. Publically ryan and allies maintain that momentum is behind the romney/ryan ticket, but his biggest boosters realize he can write his own ticket. These allies spoke on the condition to discuss private proposals they were preparing for him. If romney loses, ryan will be seen as a white house contender in 2016 just like sarah palin was in 2012. For the next few years, democrats would lay traps forcing them to take sides on measures to come back to haunt him. That's why ryan's biggest boosters are considering why it wouldn't be better for paul ryan to resign from the house. He could write a book. Or he could teach at a university. Days before the election, paul ryan's supporters are leaking their plans to the press for what they want paul ryan to do since he's not going to be vice president. What they want paul ryan to do once he and mitt romney lose the electionext week. I sort of can't believe it didn't get more attention yesterday afternoon. It is also the purest and most direct rebuttal of that campaign's own rather heroic efforts to project some super human confidence about how much they think they are going to win on tuesday. Joining us is a man who is in the business of knowing who is going to win, nate silver, for "the new york times." He's the who author of "the signal and the the noise." Thank you for being here. 

[00:17:43]


>> Thank you, rachel. 
>> A lot of headlines say that since mitt romney is going to pennsylvania, that must mean that pennsylvania is in play. From the numbers, do you believe pennsylvania is in play? 
>> You had the list of 24 polls and none had romney ahead. Some were done that had romney up a couple points there, but no public pollster has had him with a lead all year. It's not just that obama is up there, but it's a state where it's been stable and consistent in the polling. I think it might be more in play because I don't think they are conceding ohio. They need a better plan b. 
>> Is there a famous circumstance in which all the polls all yearlong point in one direction and a partisan poll correctly predicted the results? 
>> That poll is almost always going to be wrong. Especially when there's a consensus of 20 polls. Maybe in a house race where the public polls aren't as good. But the public polling is pretty good. We know what the party bases are and where they live. This is a state that teases republicans where they can get up to 49% pretty easily, but it's hard to get to 50%. Unless because of the hurricane and where the power outages might be, that could affect things. But apart from that, it's a sign of a campaign that doesn't like the electoral map very much. 
>> What about the montra we have been hearing on the right. We were hearing the idea that mr. Romney h momentum heading into the election day. You shouldn't look at the raw numbers. You should appreciate there's momentum movement in the numbers that indicates he's going to win. How do you assess that? 
>> Today was proof he does not have momentum, there were 19 polls released today in battleground states. And mitt romney led in zero of those polls. There were two ties and obama led in 17. That's not what we were seeing two weeks ago where romney pulled ahead in virginia and colorado and florida and had drown ohio down to a one-point lead. If anything, obama has momentum. He was declared the winner of nal two debates. I'm not sure how the hurricane is playing for him, but his numbers ticked up. That's why the states that seem toss uppy seem like they are more firmly in the president's favor. 

[00:20:15]


>> Let me ask you, and I didn't warn you I was going to ask you this, but you have been the subject of a lot of criticism in this last week in particular as if the polling model that you built at "the new york times" and the way you explain the polling is somehow biased or wrong or evil. I feel like you are waging a one-man war against pneumonia rossty in explaining how polling works. How has the week been? 
>> It's been a trip where you become a subject of conversation yourself and there's this celebrity level attached to it that's new for me e. But there are other websites that do the same thing that we do. They all show basically the same thing. There's no way to slice and di the data in ohio or iowa or wisconsin right now and say that romney is winning there. In fact, the polls would have to mess up by quite a bit for that to occur. There's years that's happened. But we're now in the phase where it's no longer a question of who is ahead in the electoral college so much as will the polls have a bad year and they could, but that's why you see some conservatives now are no longer bothering to say that we're winning in these states. They are saying that the polling is wrong. Usually it's wishful thinking. 
>> You're a man at the center of the storm in a which you did not expect to be. 
>> Thank you, rachel. His book is callinged "the signal and the noise." 
>>> Some things do not change. Bruce springsteen will always be awesome at benefit concerts. David axelrod will probably always have a mustache. And voting in florida will always be a mess. Apparently. This year it's already to a degree. That's just ahead.

>>> SEPTEMBER 10th, 2002. Florida voters go to the polls for a primary. What they find is a mess. Fancy new voting machines do not work. Poll workers do not show up. Polling places do not open becausvoting that day is hard the lines are surprisingly long. Florida's governor at the time is jeb bush. He orders the polls to stay open for two extra hours to help everybody that wants to vote vote. That was in 2002. In 2008 florida sees epic lines at the polls. Even in the days before that during the time for early voting. People waited through nes that stretched through three city blocks. This is what it looks like in 2008 even during early voting. Florida's governor during that election was also a republican, charlie crist and he declared a state of emergency at the polls. He ordered the polls to ay open longer so people can vote. He says I have a responsibility to ensure that the maximum number of citizens can participate in the process and every person can exercise the right to vote. The obama campaign thanks the republican governor when he did that and then with a boost from early voting, democrat barack obama won the state of florida and the presidency. Oops. Last year florida's w republican governor rick scott decided he was not going to make that mistake again. Rather than expanding voting, the new one decided he would cut the days for early voting almost in half in order to make voting harder. Look. At least that's how it works. Long, long, long lines for early voting in polls places across florida except this year it's long lines with no relief in sight. We have been getting pictures ever since early voting started in the state. This is how democracy works in florida this year. Look at this. Get in line. Wait and wait. Wait an hour. Wait four hours. Wait five hours. Yesterday flora democrats and the nonpartisan grousathe league of women voters asked the governor to do something about the lo lines. They asked him to add a day of voting to open the polls on the last sunday before the election when many african-americans usually plan to car pool after church to go vote. The governor said no. Florida's governor said, "early voting will end on saturday night, but I want everybody to get out to vote." He wants everybody to get out and vote. Just get in line. Let's see how long we can make you wait. Get in that line going out the door, around the block, governor scott is looking at five-hour waits for his constituents already for the people he was elected to serve. And he has no signy desire to fix it. Listen. The more opportunity people have to vote, the more likely they are to vote. High turn out favors democrats. Low turn out, favors republicans. This is not rocket science. To the extent that voting in florida is a debacle, it's one made by design. The ballot in florida is ten pages long. And with fewer days to vote, you get really long lineon but that's the way it goes in florida now. Leading up to the election, florida republicans cut the time for early voting in half. So now floridians stand in long lines. They pass new restriction on registering voters so thousands fewer new voters signed up. And the govethor has tried to purge the voter rolls. In south florida and palm beach county, 30,000 ballots were printed wrong. Clerks have been copying what the voters marked on to new ballots that can fit into the tabulating machines. Dozens asked for absentee ballots and still haven't gotten them because they screwed up the ballots. The situation is worse in broward county where people have waited for weeks for absentee ballots. You can say that florida's election is another debacle in the making were it not already a debacle right now. And it is. Joining us is joy reid. She's an msnbc contributor who has been reporting on the election mess in florida. Thank you for being here. It's nice to have you here. 

[00:32:15]


>> Great to be here. All florida. Florida will not be moved aside by ohio. 
>> We believe in the power of florida here because florida has demonstrated its power. In terms of what I just summarized there, does it strike you in terms of your latest reporting as what's most important to keep an eye on? And what's your latest reporting on the other issues? 
>> Absolutely, rachel. In the last couple hours, I made a couple phone calls and discovered that everything you said is accurate with one more county. Miami-dade is also having issues with people who requested absentee ballots. Some of these people requested that ballot a month ago. They requested it the beginning of october. And still haven't gotten them. If it's not returned by 7:00 p.M. On tuesday, in the a office on that day, it won't count. Then the next wrinkle is that people who ordered their absentee ballots but decided to show up at a poll and try to vote will be made to vote on provisional ballots because there's no way to verify that person didn't mail if an absentee ballot. And florida doesn't have a strong record of counting provisional ballots. 
>> Why does the government not do more to make voting easier? We saw rick scott take action here more aggressively than other republican legislatures did. He ordered that early voting be cut. Has there been any argument from what he's done? 
>> No. You talked about charlie crist earlier and the fact he signed that executive order extending voting hours. That was the beginning of the end of charlie crist's tenure in the party. Because republicans in the state blamed crist for barack obama winning the state. So when I spoke with the former head of the republican florida in florida who is in his own world of trouble over charges about some illegal money things he was doing, but when he was runng the party, he told me that republican consultants came to him and said we want to craft a bill to get rid of early voting or severely cut it because in the worlds of the consultants, all it does is bring every african-american out from under a rock and get them to vote for democrats. It doesn't help us. So the republican legislature which in 2010 became more tea party and conservative, there's no margin in it for them to increase access to in-person early voting. What they did is passed a law that didn't touch absentee voting, which republicans tend to dominate in, but severely limited the early vote. So there were 96 hours this year total to vote. There were 120 hours in 2008. And already in the state, 3.46 million people have voted. When you looked at the numbers, that's almost as many votes as barack obama got by himself. In the last presidential election, almost half of the people who voted voted early. This is really a problem. 

[00:35:38]


>> This is a problem and this isis a problem not looking ahead to election day. It's a problem already in the way that it's affecting people who are trying to early vote. I feel like I'm not the dredge report and I'm not a website, but if I could put a siren over my head, I would. 
>> I'd wear one too. 
>> We'll have to get them. Joy, it's great to have you here. Thank you. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> One more big story for you tonight about something that is essentially trying to be disappeared down the memory hole. This is that's refusing to go down the memory hole even though they are trying to shove it there. That's coming up. 

[00:41:23]


>>> A flurry of new polling from the swing states today. All these polls are just released today. In colorado president obama up by four. In iowa, president obama up by four. In wisconsin president obama up by seven points. New hampshire the president leading in six points. In ohio president obama leading in three points. In virginia president obama leading by one point. In florida president obama leading by two points. One state that's not a swing state this year but that president obama made into a swing state in 2008 is the great state of indiana. Indiana flipped from red to blue in the presidential contest. President obama is not necessarily expected to pued off the same thing this year in indiana. But this year there's a really hot race in indiana in the senate. After a tea party primary cost senator richard lugar his senate job, the republican candidate in indiana ended up being the guy on the left side of your screen richard mourdock. He's up against joe donnelly. Since he made his rape comment at a debate a few weeks ago, in very, very, very, very red state indiana, the republican candidate is now behind in that state senate race. He's losing the race by double digits. Here's the interesting thing about that poll to. It's a poll in indiana, which almost never happens. It's really weird, but nobody nationally never knows what's going on in indiana politics because they don't poll in indiana. In indiana, it's illegal to make automated calls for telemarketing purposes and for public opinion surveys like polling. You can't use an auto dialing device unless the subscriber has consented to being contacted or a live operator gets on the line and gets consent that way. Since it make s it hard and expensive, there's little polling in indiana. But while we're on the subject of weird details, eteck out this ballot in north carolina. It's me than a dozen states where they have straight ticket voting. They say everybody with an r next to their name, that's who I'm voting for. I want all the republicans or all the democrats. But there's a bizarre catch to straight ticket voting in north carolina. North carolina is the only state where voting for a straight ticket does not include the presidential race. So you have to vote for the straight ticket and then in addition to that, you also have to cast another vote for president. If you just vote straight ticket democratic, you do not cast a vote for barack obama for president. You have to do that separately in addition. So it's not really straight ticket voting. It's straight ticket plus the president voting. Okay. I said weird details. Here's something weirder. This is a democrat in e governor's race. He leads in the polls by more than 30 points. But that may not be enough. The vermont state cotitution requires a candidate for governor to get 50% plus one vote. So even though he's leading, he has four opponents. So if those four opponents get a combined 50% of the vote, the governor will not be reelected no matter how big the margin he wins by. In that case with nobody getting 50%, it's the state legislature that picks the governor. That's happened recently. Some of the most interesting still undecided races from yesterday's elections after the governor's seat. This afternoon nbc news declaring peter shumlin the winner. What's interesting about that is that even though the democrat won, he did not get 50% of the vote. Under vermont's state rules, that means technically the legislature picks who wins the race. Two months after that, the vermont legislature did what vermonters had already done. They picked peter shumlin to be governor. Which means 28 pple in the legislature voted to elect somebody who the people of vermont did not vote for. A gentle reminder that states run the elections. They are governed by weird rules and worth whatever efforts it takes. It's worth filling out two bubbles. I'm looking at you, north rolina. 

[00:46:08]


>>> The question for this election is this. Do you want to stay on the same course we're on oro you want real change. Paul ryan and aplan on putting in place real change from day twice the stain fighting power as the leading liquid value brand. Era detergent. A lot of fight for a little dough. 

[00:51:46]


>>> The question for this election is this. Do you want to stay on the same course we're on or do you want real change. Paul ryan and aplan on putting in place real change from day one. Accomplishing real change is something I don't just talk about, it's something I've done. The question of this election comes down to this. Do you want more of the same or do you want real change? We bring real change. 
>> Spare change? Realhange. That was mitt romney's closing argument today in wisconsin and ohio. A vote for me is a vote for real change. And tonight, just outuide cincinnati, the romney campaign attempting to underscore that message by holding a big mega rally in westchester ohio. Featuring nearly 100 governors, senators, congressmen and other republican luminaries to talk about the real change you would get if you elect mitt romney. So who did he enlist to sell this message of what real change he's offering america? The headliners were george w. Bush's secretary of state, george w. Bush's labor secretary, the governor and current speaker of the house. Mitt romney, change you can believe in if you really liked george w. Bush and if you like the current republican congress. Then we're the kind of real change we're looking for. Who cast this thing, the democrats? One of the reasons that the message of real change resonated back in 2008 because the country at large had ceased to be delighted by the george w. Bush administration. And it wasn't just the war in iraq or, or, or, or. It was stuff like this. This is the u.S. State department's annual report on global terrorism in 2003. Every year they would put together a report like this detailing accidents of terrorism around the world. And the next report after this one, showed that despite the bush administration's claims that we were winning the war on terror, despite the constant claims, the number of terrorist attacks had gone up to its highest level in the two decades the state department had been publishing this report. What was the bush administration's solution to that problem? The solution was to stop publishing the report. The bush administration just eliminated that annual report once it included something very politically inconvenient. The bush administration had a habit of doing this. If you don't like the data, get rid of the data. Earlier they were faced with a new report from their own education department showing that charter school kids were falling behind public school kids. How do you deal with your own administration's data on underperforming charter schools? You cut back on the data that you collect about charter schools. The bush administration just announced they would be collecting less data going forward. In 2003, after the bush administration labor department report detailed mass layoffs in the manufacturing sector, the bush administration announced they were going to stop publishing information about mass layoffs. If we get rid of the data pointing to a problem, maybe the data wouldn't look so bad. The obvious move is to get rid of it. This was a hall mark of the george w. Bush administration and it appears to be one of the things that mr. Romney liked very much about the george w. Bush administration. It at least appears to be one of the things that he's promising to bring back. You don't like the data presented? Kill the report. After the totally unimpeachable ly did a report concluded that romney's plan would be great for rich people and hurt everybody else, the response to that was to go guns blazing against the center. You don't like the message, shoot the messenger. Last month after the bureau of labor statistics announced the unemployment rate was going down, the right started attacking the bureau of labor statistics as if they were the problem because they said the unemployment rate was going down. It used to be that democrats and republicans would argue about how best to deal with some factual things, some problem facing the national. Now republicans do it differently. They do it differely than everybody else. This is not a mirror image problems on both sides. They refuse to acknowledge factual thing. They are still doing, it was brought to a whole new level last week when it was revealed that a nonpartisan tax report was withdrawn by a federal agency because republicans protested its findings. The federal agency in question here is the congressional resource service. They're kind of the gold standard. Congress's internal think tank. Members of congress have a question about policy or issue, they look into it for them and they issue a report in response to a member of congress asking for that report. The congssional research service is as nonpartisan as it gets in washington. And a little more than a month ago, they issued a report on tax policy. They found there is no connection between lowering the tax rates on millionaires and billionaires and creating economic growth. There's no evidence that if you cut taxes on the rich that that makes the economy grow. That's a problem because that is essentially mitt romney's whole reason for living. This is the republican party's economic reason for existing. If you cut taxes on the rich, the job creators, that will jump start the economy. This is the whole basis of the party' economic philosophy. This is why congressional republicans pledge their first born children to a man named grover. And here comes this highly respected agency that says it turns out the whole thing is bunk. Giving rich people a tax break doesn't help the economy but it sure does rich people. What do you do if you're the republican party? You pressure the agency to buryg the report which is exactly what republicans in congress did this fall. The "new york times" is reporting that the congressional research service quietly withdrew their entire report. Reportedly against the advice of their own economics experts. This is amazing, right? If a report tells you something you do not want to hear, get rr, of the report. Especially if that report is t coming out on the eve of a big election and it debunks your candidate's whole economic argument. Luckily, breaking news, the report does still exist. You can find it right now. You can read it right now. It's not written very long, y u can find it at maddowblog.Com and there is nothing that republicans can do to stop that. We will see you again on sunday night. We are doing a special live edition of this show on sunday night, because, well, isn't it obvious? . .

>> hi. I'm abby johnston, silver medalist in the 2012 olympic games. Winning this silver medal was a longtime dream come true of mine, but most people didn't see all the hard work it took to get me there and all the amazing people who helped me along the way. There are two kinds of people in this world--those who create problems and those who work to solve problems. The young woman I'm going to introduce to you is the epitome of a true problem solver. What she has accomplished in the midst of all her challenges demonstrates that she has the real winning edge. 
>> Thetold me that I would never walk normally again, that I would never be able to run, that I would never have a normal life, that I'd be disabled my whole life because of this injury. 
["Star-spangled banner" playing] I decided I wanted to fly and go into the air force when I was 8 years old. My dad is in the 144th fighter wing, which is an F-16 BASE, AND HEARING F-16s FLY Over my house every day gave me the inspiration to become a pilot. I told my parents, "i'm gonna go to the academy." 

[00:04:24]


>> Being a student athlete at a military academy requires a lot of discipline. It's difficult because it is a military institution. So we're still required to do things like parades and formation and , and we still have to do certain military training. It's not just schooand sports. 
>> My typical day at the air force academy is waking up at about 5:36 and getting ready for the day, making sure I have everything good to go for my homework for that day. Normally, we have some type of morning formation. The thing I like most about the academy is all the amazing opportunities. Over the past summer, I was able to go to the middle east. I know that I'm prepared to serve my country in any way I can, and I'm excited to go support the mission being a pilot. The most difficult thing about the air force academy is definitely time management. It's hard to balance sports, diving 4 hours a day, being a division I athlete with school. We take so many hours, course hours, here, and gpa is really important with the military aspect, and that's all of our leadership opportunities, formations, monthly inspections. 
>> I met moranda about 8 or 9 years ago when she was a little girl and she came to our diving camps that we host in the summer because of her commitment, and i said, "this is the kind of young lady we need as a cadet here at the air force academy." I think she's a good leader, but she also has that competitive desire to be the best diver on the team. Moranda's best dives on one-meters are forward 2 1/2 tuck, and then her best dive on 3-meters, the forward 2 1/2 pike. She's very trim, and she gets in the water very clean. Moranda was close last year in qualifying for the ncaa zone qualifying meet, and this year, I see no problem with her qualifying for that meet. 
>> My parents decided to put me in gymnastics. I loved it. I progressed very quickly, started competing when I was 6, 7 years old. When I was 10 years old, I had an ankle injury. It happened at the state championship meet. The beam, that was my event. Everything seemed to be going wrong. I hit the mat wrong and broke my ankle, and one of the bones tore through the growth plate entirely, broke it on both sides, had to go into surgery a few days after. So many doctors told me no. "No. You will never be able to go to the academy because you'll never be able to run. You'll never be normal." I saw my dreams of going to the academy totally wiped away, but I talked to my parents about it, and we prayed about it every night. We prayed for my ankle. We prayed for my future and that god would work a miracle through this situation, and we just kept praying for that one doctor that would tell me yes, and we finally found her. When my dad deployed, it really affected me. My self-esteem dropped, and i just really didn't think I was worth muwhen he came back, it wasn't like the magic fix, and I was still struggling with that experience because i thought I was the only one. I thought I was weird, and so i didn't really want to talk to anyone about it because no one understood, and then I met another military girl named kaylei deakin who had gone through the same thing when her dad deployed, and when we met, we had that aha moment, and we felt such relief talking to each other and knowing that we weren't crazy. After that, we got the ball rolling, got to thinking about how we can help other military girls, and then we both attended a conference in california. After seeing all the camaraderie of people c ming together with a commonoal, sharing common experiences to help each other, I decided that military girls needed this and that I was gonna make it happen. That's how the sisterhood got started. The sisterhood is an organization for girls 13 to 18 with a mom or dad in any branch of service in the military. We have a website, sisterhoodbdus.Org, where military girls can go online and connect with each other through a forum. 

[00:08:46]


>> When she missed class to go to the white house to give her speech, we only learned about that when she came back, and the students in her class were in shock and awe that she had done this amazing thing and hadn't mentioned it to any of the other students. I thought she was just cordial, polite. I think one of the qualities that distinguished her throughout all the press that she got was that she was humble about it. 
>> Having the real winning edge means having faith on your side in every aspect of life. In diving, I have to have a lo of faith and a lot of trust that god is gonna keep me safe. I want to share with other people the message to power through your adversity, to take an obstacle and turn it into an opportunity and god'll get you through it. 
>> Next, the fear that was keeping him from winning. here office.

>> Hi. I'm steven lopez. My father came from nicaragua and built a successful life here, and now all 4 of his children are top martial artists. I'll tell you what he taught us--to make opportunities, even when it seems like there are none; to keep pushing through, no matter what the obstacle. Most importantly, every day, you have to win the mental battle. I'm introducing the story of a young man who also comes from a family of successful martial artists. He faced many obstacles and overcame them, but his biggest victory was finally learning how to win the mental battle, and now he has the real winning edge. 
>> When I started competing in taekwondo, I was just so nervous before every competition. I'd just sit there for hours just praying and praying and prayng. 

[00:12:56]


>> There was a span there which he just didn't win for some reason. I was like, "this happens in this sport, you know? Sometimes you just try and try and try. It just doesn't come across, right?"

Definitely, just seeing them sort of, you know, succeed and especially win nationals, I remember, I lost first round, and they both won gold. I got started in taekwondo about 10 or 11 years ago. I have two brothers--chris and alex. They both compete in taekwondo with me. We trained at a local studio for about 3 years, and my brothers and I sort of kind of came to the decision--my whole family, I should say--that we really wanted to do sparring, olympic sparring. So that's how I started going to woosop's in fenton and a big difference, really, really, really, you know, far away, but it just really started getting tough when we started teaching there, as well. We were teaching there to pay for our classes that we were taking. Then we'd take a class because the traffic was horrible and it would take us, like, an hour and 10 minutes, hour and 20 minutes to drive down there. So it was just really stressful, really just really difficult, so much time and just energy and just doing homework and just doing stuff while moving in the car and just cramped. Us leaving and coming back, it would be, like, 5 hours, and that just caused a lot of problems in the other parts of our lives, especially with scholastics. 
>> Physics is a very demanding class, and michael shows incredible discipline in keeping up with tremendous workloads and finding the time for all the studies required. Remarkable thing about michael is the fact that he excels at taekwondo and it's so time-intensive while the physics class alone should take up so much time. I just find it amazing. He's never asked me for any special help or any special consideration for these extra demands on his time. He's just done theheork. He's done above and beyond the level of work required. Michael always has the utmost respect for other students. It's obvious that he excels at a level that a lot of students can't in the classroom, yet he never makes a point of it. Hf goes out of his way to help other students. 

[00:15:15]


>> Relationships are crucial to anybody. How I try and go about it is, you have to pour time into them. You encourage each other in what's good in one another. 
>> Every person he comes into contact to, he's gentle, and he's kind, and it's very rare. Every saturday, a group of us go downtown to the city just to hang out with homeless people. 
>> We just do what we usually do. We were just walking down the streets, and then this girl came up to us. She brought up her son in that she's always wanted to get him a bike for his birthday. My friend jordan and i were like, "well, we got a lot of friends, and I'm sure we can find a bike." We called up, told her that we were coming, and we drove to where she lived in this just rough, like, neighborhood, just straight up. When we gave them the bike, they were just really excited about it. When I started competing in taekwondo, I was just so nervous bere every competition, and really, it was just my want to be perfect, to not fail, but what I had to realize is that those expectations are unrealistic, and really, how I've gone through it is just so much prayer. It wasn't about my power or my strength. It was about, "ok. I'm freaking out, but, you know, I need him to step in now and to be able to support me." 
>> There was this time he was really scared at a competition, you know, and we just had to push him. He pushed himself and his trust in god, and he just got in there, and ever since, he's peaked out, and he started competing the best he's ever done. 
>> I've never seen any brothers that are so close together. So that really helped them in becoming, you know, who they are in their taekwondo career. Mikey at the national competition, he was very, very good. He's very dominant, and not too many kids actually score any points on him, and so i attribute it to not only good training, but also from learning from his brothers and their mistakes and whatever they've done in the past. 

[00:17:36]


>> Michael becoming junior national champion and getting on the junior national team was unreal, surreal. I don't know. It's something that no one in missouri has ever done. It really brought us together again. I just cried when i hugged him because I knew that he had done what he even thought he couldn't do. 
>> My perspective on living is a little different from your average athlete. If you win a race and after you get your gold medal, does that gold medal make you better at all? You know, are you more honest? Are you more loving? What happens outside of you? What happens in the competition itself is just a temporary just moment, but you becoming better, becoming just more godly, more true, you know, more loving, if you garner these things throughout your competition, then you've actually won. That's what a real victory is. If you'ifre facing a difficulty or an obstacle, it's meant so that god can show you what's wrong with you. It's so that you can become better, and not just focus on how hard it is, but what good can be garnered from it in your own character. 
>> Going ahead when it seemed impossible when we return. 

[00:21:40]


>> Hi. I'm general john shalikashvili. You know, coming up through the ranks as a young soldier, I developed the physical toughness that is takes to be a disciplined soldier. It requires far more than strong muscle to be a truly excellent military person. It is character that makes the difference between mediocrity and excellence. The young man I'm introducing has the character and the spirit to be the very best. He has what we call the real winning edge. Meet brad geary, a senior at the u.S. Naval academy in annapolis, maryland. Brad's goal upon graduation is to be a navy seal. In this, he will endure some of the most grueling training of any of the military pursuits, and he is up to the challenge. This young man learned early to discipline himself to be his best. Since coming to the academy, he has earned a varsity letter each season. Brad also excels academically and enjoys anything that challenges him to be a better, stronger person. In addition to all this, brad is developing his whole self. You'll see as you meet this young man what it is that gives him the real winning edge. 
>> My mother got me started in swimming back in, must have been, second or first grade. It was the summertime. We were living in georgia at the time, and she said, "we're not gonna sit on our butts all summer and do nothing." So she made us choose a sport, and in the summertime, it was warm. So i thought swimming would be good, headed over to the local pool, and signed up for the team, and I started swimming, and I liked it because I was a small kid and a lot of the older girls would flirt with me, and so I stuck with it. Well, I never even knew about the naval academy back in high school until the swim coach here saw at a swim meet and wrote me a letter. I had no idea what it is, and my swim coach back home, he was just ecstatic. He thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread and told me I needed to definitely look into this place. So I wrote back to the coach, told him i was interested. He wrote me, gave me packets on this stuff, and I looked at it, reviewed everything, started on my application, and the more I read about it, the more I liked, decided it was something i wanted to do. 

[00:24:03]


>> It's reifficult if you're a varsity athlete at the naval academy. There's a big stigma that the varsity athletes get out of a lot of things that everyone else has to do because they play that varsity-athlete card and they use that as an excuse. Well, brad never did that. Brad was-- even tugh he was up at 6:00, you know, or an hour earlier than everyone else going to swim practice and he was at swim practice after school, he still made every effort to be a plebe and to do his job in every military aspect, and that may sound insignificant, but that's just a huge, huge sign of the type of character that he has. 
>> The only word I know to describe him would be "inhuman." As my squad leader last semester, I got a reallyse look at his daily routine, and every morning, he swam 4,000 meters as captain of the swim team before most of the brigade even got out of bed and still managed to pull all the responsibilities of a squad leader and carry a 4.0 grade point average together in one fell swoop and procure for himself a selection to the navy seals, one of 16 out of about 50 guys from our class that were trying for it. He's an amazing person. He pretty much epitomizes everything that we're trying to do here at the naval academy. 
>> I decided I'd try to be a navy seal after my second year, just decided that that was what I wanted to do. It seemed like a great challenge, and since I've been swimminfor 16 years of my life, I figured it'd probably be good to do something that involves water. So I went for it, and I got it. There was times this past summer when i was doing a training program getting ready for seals where i was freezing. It was the middle of the night, and I was laying in the water off the coronado beach shaking uncontrollably. I tilted my head back and saw the moon, and I remembered that my fiancee wasying for me at the time and she said she would be all the night long, and that's what got me through, really, and I decided I would use the moon then as a reference point and remember, "hey, people are praying for me back home, and their prayers are what got me through." 
>> He had been close to making olympic trials. If he'd have done that, he would've continued to swim and olympic trials would've been this summer, would've extended his season, and obviously, that was a huge goal. He went and just swam his best, had, like, 3 personal records in other events, and missed the olympic trials by 2/100 of a second, and his attitude was, "that has to be what god wants for me." He just looked at every positive aspect of that, whereas me personal, I'd have been crushed. Now, he didn't say one negative thing or one bit of disappointment for not making the olympic trials. 

[00:26:34]


>> It was before I even knew what I wanted to do, where i wanted to go. I was working hard for those goals, and since I was doing that, it gave me the opportunities I've had. I didn't know I wanted to come here until my junior year of high school. If I hadn't been working hard up to that point, it wouldn't have been available. The opportunity would not have been available to me. So since god gave me that desire and that effort, it opened up doors that otherwise would not have been opened. The navy seals. If I had not worked hard on everything I've done here, whether it was applicable to seals or not, i would not have gotten it when i decided that's what I felt called to do. So that would be my advice--just work hard in everything so th you can prepare for everything, and when something comes your way, you'll be ready for it.

Voting. Reports of lines up to four hours long in some places. And as life begins to return to normal in manhatt new pleas for help from another hard-hit new york city borough. We're talking about queens. I'm wolf blitzer. You're in "the situation room." We're now just three days from the presidential election and the race for the white house is reaching a fever pitch. Both campaigns are making a final push for thecandidates. Their wives, the former president bill clinton, the house speaker john boehner all campaigning down to the wire. Cnn is covering their every move. Our correspondents are in key locations in critical states. Any one of which could ultimately decide who will be the next president of the united states. We're going to -- let's go to colorado right now. Mitt romney is speaking there but jim acosta is there setting the stage. Tell us what's going on. 
>> Reporter: Mitt romney just arrived here just a few moments ago. He has been delivering his closing argument to the crowd here and he's been doing that all day long. Waking up in new hampshire, moving on to iowa and here in colorado for two stops. He has been going afte the president on that new unemployment data, he has also been talking about what he would do if he's elected president. Talking about cutting the budget, eliminating the president's health care law and tapping into domestic energy resources. I have to tell you the one message that they have been hitting hard in the last final days of this campaign, they have been going after the president on this issue of bipartisanship. Mitt romney is making the case that the president has forgotten his mandate to be a uniter in this country. The president said people should be voting because it is the best revenge. Mitt romney has been telling crowds all day long that people should be voting out of what they think is best for the country in their heart. So that is the message that they've been delivering all day long. I can also tell you that the front of the campaign plane we have seen a higher number of top campaign advisers flying with the gop nominee including michael levitt who has been leading the readiness project, as they skaul it. I talked to governor levitt for just a few brief moments in iowa and he said what they've been doing is building a ship, he called it, that they hope will set sail and we'll find out whether that will happen on tuesday. 

[00:02:54]


>> Maybe, maybe not. I want to listen in on mitt romney. He's got an enthusiastic crowd there in colorado springs. Let's listen. 
>> We've almost forgotten what a real recovery looks like. What americans could achieve when we limit government instead of limiting the dreams of our fellow americans. And the people of america, they're going to be able to choose the future, because they need -- they know what they need to know to know what the future will look like. They can stay in the path of the last four years, or they can choose real change. Now, you know, you know that if the president were to be re-elected, he would still be unable to work with members of congress. He's ignored them. He's attacked them. He's blamed them. And of course the debt ceiling is going to come up again and then there would be a threat of shutdown or default and that of course chills the economy, puts more people out of work. The president was right when he said he can't change washington from the inside. You can take him at his word. That's why we're going to send him outside. All right? When I'm elected I'm going to work with republicans and democrats in congress. I'm going to meet regularly with their leaders. I'm going to endeavor to find those good men and women on both sides of the aisle who care more about the country than they do about politics. And together, we're going to put the nation back on track to a balanced budget and to reform our tax code and to finally reaffirm our commitment to financial responsibility. Now, if the president were to be re-elected he would continue his war on coal and oil and natural gas. He would send billions more to his favorite friends and all of this means higher gasoline prices and fewer jobs. Today gasoline costs twice what it did when president obama took office. And when I'm elected, we're going to change the course of energy entirely. I know just how much energy means to middle class families in this country. We can help hold down prices in the pump and grow new energy jobs and new manufacturing jobs with my policies. And by the way, if the president were to be re-elected, he's going to continue to promote government and demote businesses. You know -- you know, he put together his own jobs council. Business leaders he brought from all over the country. And there are people he picked. You know, it's been nine months since he's been willing to meet with his own jobs council? I see free enterprise as a means for people to fulfill their dreams. Yesterday I met with a woman in richmond, virginia. She's been running her family restaurant for years. It's a business in her family for 82 years. At its high point she employed 82 people. She just closed it down. She told me that the regulations, the taxes, the cost of obama care, the obama era economy put her out of business much and she teared up as she was telling me her story. It wasn't about the money. This was about the future for her family and for her family of employees. I want to help the hundreds of thousands of dreamers like rhoda, and I will. And you know if the president were to get re-elected, he's going to say every good thing he can about education. But in the final analysis, what he's going to do is what his largest campaign supporters insist upon, and that's the public sector unions, and your kids would have the same schools and the same results. When I'm president, I'll be the voice of the children and their parents, because there is no union for the pta. I'm going is to make sure that the parents get the information they need about how their school is doing and whether it's failing or succeeding and they get the choice they need to pick the school where their child has the best chance for success. 

[00:07:31]


>> So mitt romney, he's speaking right now in colorado. We're watching him closely. We'll continue to monitor what he has to say. By the way, the president is scheduled to speak live later this hour as well. We will have live coverage of that. He's on a whirl wind swing during these final 72 hours. Right now he's in iowa, as i said, we're getting ready to hear from him later this hour. Jessica yellin is traveling with the president. First of all,jessica, what does his itinerary today reveal? 
>> Surprise focus on wisconsin in the closing days of the campaign. He is on his way from wisconsin right now iowa which is across the river from wisconsin. And he is visiting wisconsin three times in the closing days of this race. That's a state that's traditionally a blue state. A state he should haven't have to be fighting for but the campaign manager says they're taking nothing for granted. They've learned from the past and as you know this is the home state of paul ryan. Precious time to be expending on a traditional blue state at the end. The president is cross crossing the nation going is from ohio to virginia to florida to colorado back and forth across the battleground states in the final hours. And part of the message is countering the message you hear from romney. Governor romney says he will bring big change, the president arguing he is the only one who can carry that banner. Listen to this. 
>> You may not agree with every decision I've made. Sometimes you may have been frustrated by the pace of change. But, you know where I stand. You know what I believe. You know I mean wt I say and i say what I mean. 

[00:09:37]


>> And wolf, part of his argument there as well as he's an honest person that voters can trust. Something interesting I'll tell you, you might be able to tell over my shoulder, a comparatively small crowd here. They've been mixing it up. The one in wisconsin 20,000 people, according to law enforcement officials there. This one significantly smaller. Where ever I've been, they ask for a show of hands how many people have early voted, at most of the president's events have already voted. And the campaigns are emphasizing that's something that's a plus for them. A lot of these people, they've gotten them to turn out. They say that makes it a much heavier left for governor romney come election day. 
>> What do they say about the size of these crowds. During the final week four years ago there were tens and thousands and you're saying righw in iowa it's a relatively small crowd? 
>> The argument, and I'll point out again that 20,000 at an event in wisconsin and reportedly will be tens of thousands tonight in virginia, we'll see. But yes, I've been to only groups where there have been a few thousand for the few past events in ohio, too. The campaign says that's by design. The logic is if they're trying, what they're focused on is getting people out to the polls to vote. They're not trying to build crowds to to campaign events. They're trying to get people to vote. So if if you're focus is on voting not on crowd 3wi8ding, that might make sense. Let's be honest, compared to 2008, they didn't 23450ed to crowd build to get people to come see president obama. After all this economic trouble, it's been a different four years and he's a different candidate this time around. 
>> You can't compare the enthusiasm that the obama supporters were showing then compared to now. We'll see how that translates on tuesday. Thanks very much jessica yellin. Once the president starts speaking we'll have live coverage of that as well. Our campaign coverage continues throughout the weekend. Please be sure to join us tomorrow night for a cnn special. Count down to election night in america. 8:00 p.M. Eastern, 5:00 p.M. Pacific. Anderson cooper and I will co-anchor that special.

[ Male Announcer ] ONE PILL EACH MORNING. 24 hours. Zero heartburn. . 
>>> These are live pictures. Mitt romney just wrapped up a speech in colorado springs, colorado. A key battleground state. He was enthusiastic as he has been throughout the day. With romney, facing some questions about how to pull off a win in the key battleground state of ohio and break through president obama's so-called midwestern firewall. His campaign is ensure shurg allies there is still a clear pavictory. Peter, tell us about this memo. 
>> Reporter: The romney campaign is facing serious questions about the electoral college math. People in ohio here generally think obama has a slight lead also in wisconsin and iowa and nevada. Three of those four would give obama the presidency. So the romney campaign knows they're going to have to answer questions about this on the sunday shows tomorrow and on the final days of the race. They circulated a confidential memo to top republican leaders and surrogates. We got our hands on it. This is what they're saying. They're saying they're putting the obama campaign on defense. Quote, mitt romney is up or tied with obama in every key battleground state forcing obama defense in states he won by double digits in 2008 like wisconsin, iowa, michigan, minnesota, and pennsylvania. With the campaigns even on the ground and in early vote, gop enthusiasm is going to carry romney to victory. They're saying energy is on their side and look where obama is campaigning. The reality here is just because the obama campaign is playing defense that still doesn't mean they're going to lose those states. You can play defense and still win. So this is what the romney campaign is talking about today. 

[00:17:12]


>> What are both campaigns saying about their chances in ohio during these final few days? 
>> Wolf, you know, our poll showed obama leading romney by three points here, I interviewed govern nor both of them were dismissing public polling saying our models show that the turnout is going to favor republicans. Republicans are more enthusiastic. But I went out this morning with some afl-cio organizers. People are talking about turnout. The obama campaign says they've contacted over 120 million vote ners all these battleground states. They have a larger and more sophisticated ground operation. So that's what going on in the end. It's going to come down to turnout. This is a base election. And that's what both campaigns are doing right now is getting their people to vote early, either the obama campaign is doing their famous souls to the polls push tomorrow morning after churches. That's what we're looking at now. 
>> Peter doing some good reporting for us in clumus ohio. Still to come, more on the race for the white house. We've got a lot more on the race for the white house. 
>>> We're also following the aftermath of the superstorm sandy, four days in a shelter with no shower.

>>> We'll get back to the race for the white house shortly. The president getting ready to speak in iowa. Meanwhile, millions are suffering in the wake of superstorm sandy. Power is beginning to trickle back on, but more than 2 million customers are still in the dark. New york transit authorities are reporting that subway service is 80% restored. One area still waiting for the lights and the heat to come back, the rockaways section of queens. New york city mayor michael bloomberg toured the heavy devastation there today. Susan candiotti is on the ground. 
>> Reporter: The water came up to where in your apartment? 
>> T water came all the way up to where we were. We were knee deep. We couldn't get out. 911 wouldn't answer. We were stuck. We had to stay there. We were totally scared. And the devastation after the storm is what you see. There's children with no food. There are people without water. Nobody has power. People can't cook. And nobody is -- the only people that are out here are people from rockaway that are donating stuff. And rockaway park, just like everyone else, needs help. 
>> You feel like you've been left out? 
>> I feel like we need help out here. We need the city to step in. We need fema to come and place people in housing. Because you have children who lost everything. You have parents who are deaf state who are sitting in shelters. I was in a hurricane shelter, is-217. There were no showers and we were there for four days. 
>> Reporter: You got your teenaged son out of here before the storm hit. 
>> Right. I got him out because I didn't want him to be here in the devastation. 
>> And see all of this. 
>> Sues onan also tells us the community groups are on the ground handing out hot food, clothing and water to held those storm victims in need.

>>> You're looking at live pictures from dubuque, iowa. We're going to go there live to hear from the president. Stand by for that. Mitt romney and the president are making their final three-day push to the finish line. Supporters on both sides are making the case for their respective candidate. Let's bring in candy crowley and gloria borger. You just taped an interview for tomorrow's state of the union with the chicago mayor. I got a little clip. Let me play it. 
>> The vice president's wife has been send up to pennsylvania doing a couple of early weekend stops. Billlinton is being used in pennsylvania on monday. It tells me that you all are a little worried about that or worried about the race in general. Are you saying no? 
>> No. I think, look. I think, candy. Ready? It's a close election. B, you nail everything down. I think pennsylvania is secure but you don't take anything for granted and that means there's going to be a lot of people going back to ohio in the next 96 hours. Multiple times they'll go to pennsylvania. But pennsylvania is going to be on both the philadelphia, the surrounding counties and pittsburgh and harrisburg, that's where you have a democratic vote and you do go to secure it. But that doesn't mean it's flipping. It just means the natural tiding of a race. 

[00:29:56]


>> Let's bring in candy. If they're spending a lot of time in pennsylvania at this late stage, it suggests to me they're worried. 
>> It did to me and it's about the fourth time I put this question to him because he veers off nicely into talking points. The fact is that the romney people went in there for a couple of reasons. One, they said listen, mitt romney hasn't been beaten about the head in pennsylvania on the air as he has in so many of these other states. Two, it's down to a four-point race according to some of these polls. And three, they've got as much up in some of these swing states as they possibly can put up in terms of ads. They've got the ground game covered and they figured that pennsylvanias will vote on election day. 
>> I agree. I talked with the senior romney adviser about this yesterday and I said pennsylvania, what are you doing in pennsylvania? If they didn't feel they were covered in every other state, we're used to campaigns sort of allocating resources saying we're running out of money. That's not the case this time. There are extra resources. So if you look at their, at internal polls which show the race sort of three to five points somewhere, it would be malpractice if they didn't actually just go in and -- as someone said, it's like buying a lottery ticket. You might as well and see. 
>> Look at where they're spending. Both of these candidates tomorrow and monday. Obama is going to new hampshire, florida, ohio, wisconsin, iowa, romney going to ohio, new hampshire, pennsylvania, virginia, I guess where they are underscores what they need to do. 
>> Sure. It doesn't exactly look like your summer vacation, does it? They're all in ohio multiple times. 
>> And that one extra hour we'll get tonight, they'll probably go to ohio. 
>> But obama needs -- they both need ohio. Let's stipulate that. But he's got a midwestern strategy. If he can do ohio, wisconsin and iowa, he believes he could put it away. Romney of eourse ohio. But he needs virginia and florida. Needs if he is going to get his path to 270 and that's why you see him in these two states. 

[00:32:08]


>> One thing I mentioned to jessica yellin earlier, the obama crowds in these final few days are no where near where they were four years ago. They were huge four years ago. I don't know if that's a concern to them. I don't necessarily buy that. I think they would love to have tens of thousands of people show up as they did four years ago. That's not happening. 
>> I think you will see it in the final, final day. I think probably monday or maybe even sunday night. But the fact is, remember how four years ago it was all about the movement. This was a movem and then all these throngs of people would come in. This is now about governance. This has been a hard slug. It takes some work to get tens of thousands of people into an arena after four years of governing because that's reality as as opposed to hope and change. 
>> Now they're focusing on trying to get their people to the polls. They say that they've contacted 125 million voters, and that the romney campaign has only contacted 50 million and there's a huge disparity there. They would say they're more interested in that than in the crowds. I think they would like to have both. 
>> Thanks guys very much. This programming note. You can see candy's full interview tomorrow morng a special edition of "state of the union" beginning at 9:00 a.M. Eastern. Once again, we're standing by to hear from the president of the united states. He's campaigning in iowa. You're looking at live pictures. There's the word "forward" with the exclamation point.

>>> And let's take a closer look right now in the race to 270 electoral votes. John king is here at the magic wall. On this day with three days to go, it's going to be complicate d. 
>> We know it's close and we have to say advantage to the president. But how big, that's the open question. We start the final weekend 237 strong or leaning the president's way. 206 leaning governor romney's way. The race of course is to 270. The president is ending withal rallies in iowa, wisconsin and ohio. Why? Because that's his easipath to 270. If the president can take iowa, can take wisconsin and can take ohio, it's game over. If nothing else changed on the map, that would get the president to 271 and it would be game over. That's why the president is ending his campaign right here in the hardland. Places where he can talk about the auto bailout. That's one way. That's the president's quickest way. I won't say the easest. It means that governor romney has to take the state of ohio. That was the president's fastest way. How does governor romney get there? He has to win the state of florida. He needs florida. He has to take north carolina. We already had him leaning that way and he has to take virginia as well. That would get governor romney there. Then the governor romney's most reasonable scenario is to take ohio. No republican has ever won without i9. If governor romney can get those votes plus virginia around north carolina, that would get him to 266. Over here in the east, he would need just one more. Any one of the remaining states, if governor romney can do florida, virginia, north rolina and ohio, any one of the remaining states would put him over the top. That's what makes this one so, so important. So if he does that, then he's got a pretty interesting terrain. He's competitive in colorado, this one tends to be leaning democratic. The romney campaign says it's mpetitive, but cwnsistent polling in the wisconsin. This one here, romney campaign says it's competitive, let's for hypothetical let's say that's a safer pick to give that to the president. I'm going to take it back and make it a tossup state again. I was in colorado recently. This is a true toss-up. For the sake of argument say governor romney gets that. Then you're out here in the east again, 253, 257. For the sake of argument give that to the president, you're at 259, 257. Who wins nample? Only four. That could be a critical one there. This is the biggest one of all. Governor romney has to kin. If he does in this scenario, he's over the top. If he does you could potentially have a scenario like this. With a state like colorado and a state like new hampshire deciding it at the end. If there's one place to watch, that is the biggest of the battlegrounds heading into the final days. 

[00:40:14]


>> You can't overestimate how important eye yo is to both of those candidates. 
>> Not just romney. I can give you me reasonable obama 2007 scenarios, but what makes this interesting is you have strategies on republican siesd saying we need it, and strategists saying we probably need it too. 
>> John king over at the magic wall for us. The president is getting ready to be introduced there in dubuque, iowa. We're going to hear what he has to say. Stand by. A year of mortgage payments... COURTESY OF Quicken Loans.

>>> This may be the most closely watched election in history. Now we know that there's been a change in new jersey in the wake of hurricane sandy. Joe johns is joining us now and he's got more of what's going on. 

[00:44:29]


>> In response to the superstorm, governor christie in new jersey has issued a directive that says displaced voters can submit ballot applications either by e-mail or by fax to their county clerk. They have to return the ballot by 8 p.M. On tuesday. An unusual situation. It's a case of states changing the rules on the fly for an emergency. The type of thing poll watchers are already looking out for as we close in on election day. 
>> Reporter: Long lines in south florida and in cincinnati, ohio as early voting comes to a close. And those aren't the only crowds this hotly contested election has attracted. 10,000 in grass roots. 
>> Everywhere. They've trained people in 50 states to legally poll watch. 
>> Reporter: Lawyers and poll watchers of all political stripes descending on ohio and across the country in search of any issues that need to be challenged. 
>> We're looking for long lines that might be the result of machines breaking down, poll workers that might be asking the wrong questions, asking for id when they shouldn't be. 
>> Reporter: Groups like the left leaning election protection have been training for weeks so they're ready to respond to any problems at the polls in real time. 
>> With all the changes nationally in the voting laws, we're prepared for there to be a significant amount of confusion on election day. 
>> Reporter: But controversy over some of how the organizations do their job. 
>> They have problems. 
>> Reporter: Former justice department lawyer christian adams now represents true the vote, a tea party-affiliated group with a simple goal. 
>> Free and fair elections. True vote stands for election integrity. Follow the law, period. 
>> Reporter: But true the vote has real critics of their own from the left. 
>> True the vote has consistently challenged the voting rights of legitimate voters. We must address anybody who dries to deny anybody that right to vote. I consider it criminal, i consider it unpatriotic and highly offensive zblr. 

[00:46:41]


>> They're liars. They are bearing false witness against law abiding citizens and they should be ashamed of themselves. 
>> Reporter: Whatever the election watchers find it may be up to super lawyers like ted olson to go to court. He led republicans to victory between george bush and al gore. 
>> I'm clearing my calendar. 
>> Reporter: He says iflection officials want to avoid litigation, they shouldn't change direction in the middle of the game. 
>> If you follow the rules that were in place on election day with respect to counting the ballots, then the presumptive outcome will be expected. 
>> But the truth is there could be other changes to the rules, especially as states affected by the storm get ready for the election. We'll be looking for them as i am sure lawyers well as will. 
>> The president is now speaking in dubuque, iowa. He's really getting into his speech. Let's listen in. 
>> It's a choice between going back to the top-down economics that crashed our economy, or embracing a future where we're building a strong and growing middle class. You know, as americans, we honor the striefrs and the dreamers, the entrepreneurs, the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity that the world has ever known. But we also know that our markets work best. The free enterprise system works best when everybody is participating. When we make sure that everybody's got a good education, and everybody can learn new skills. When we support research into medical breakthroughs or clean energy technology. We think that america is stronger when everybody can count on affordable health care. And medicare and social security in their retirement. We think the market work better when there are rules in place to protect our kids from toxic dumping, to protect consumers from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous credit card companies or mortgage lenders. We don't want government doing everything we think that we can do most things ourselves. T there are times we can come together but we certainly don't want government getting involved in the wrong things. We think we don't need politicians, especially mostly male politicians to try and control health care choices that women are perfectly capable of making themselves. For eight years we had a president we shared these believes. His name was 

[00:49:35]


[ cheers and applause ] 
>> his economic plan, like mine, asked the wealthiest americans to pay a little bit more so we could reduce our deficit, invest in the skills of our people, invest in the ideas that we need to succeed in a new economy. And, at the time, back in the '90s, THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS And a senate candidate by the name of mitt romney said bill clinton's program would hurt the economy and kill jobs. Sound familiar? Turns out, his math back then was just as bad as it is now. Because, the end of president clinton's second term, we created 23 million new jobs, incomes were up, deficits were down. So, iowa, we know our ideas work. We've put them to the test. We also know that their ideas don't work. Because they have been tested, also. In the eight years before I came into office, we've tried what they're selling. We've tried giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest of americans. We tried giving insurance companies and wall street a free license to do what they please. Here's what we got. Fallen incomes, recor deficits, and an economic crisis we're still cleaning up after. So we know what works. We know what doesn't. Now, governor romney, he's a very talented salesman. And, in this campaign, he's been working overtime to try to repackage the old, bad ideas that didn't work and try to sell them to you as new ideas. He's trying to say that they're changed. But here's the things. Iowa, we know what change looks like. 
[ Cheers and applause ] >>nd what he's selling is not change. Giving more power to the biggest banks? That's not change. Another $5 trillion tax cut that favors the wealthy? Not change. Refusing to answer questions about the details of your policy until after the election? That's definitely not changing. Politicians do that all of the time. Ruling out compromise, pledging the rubber stamp, the tea party agenda in congress? That's not change. That's what we need to change. That's why I'm running for a second term. Changing the facts when they're inconvenient to your campaign, that is definitely not change. So what he's selling, we tried it. It didn't work. We're not going back. Those are the attitudes in washington we need to change. And that raises somethin about the choice you have to make, iowa. You know, a lot of choosing a president is about trust. You know, iowa, I started my presidential journey right here in this state. After two years of campaigning and after four years as president, you know me by now. You aee with every decision I've made. You may have sometimes been frustrated with the pace of change. But you know that I say what i mean. And I mean what I say. You know what I believe. You know where I stand. When I said I ended the war in iraq, I ended the war in iraq. 

[00:53:26]


>> So the president of the united states, he's getting into it. He's going to do several more before tuesday. We'll continue to monitor what he's saying in the battleground state for iowa. Here's a question, republicans may have a tough time winning the majority in the senate. Why?

[00:56:34]


>>> And our senior congressional correspondent is here in the situation room. Dana, the balance of power in the senate is pretty tight right now. It could be different, maybe not, after the dust settles on NOVEMBER 6th. 
>> Republicans currently hold 47 seats, democratsold 51 if you add the two independent senators actually equals 53. But 47 is the magic number. The math is pretty simple. In order to get to 51, they need to net four seats. 
>> Unless romney wins the white house and then they only need three. 
>> But for comfort reasons, they'll need for. But look at this, wolf, 13 competitive races across the map. This is a huge number. Republican that is have to defend their seats, democrat that is have to defend their seats as well. That's a big problem for americans that you see these red states right here because they have to hold onto these and, also, capture the democratic seats. And the problem is if you look up in new england, maine and massachusetts, republicans at this point, they're likely to lose those seats. A number of polls, internal republican polls, they're very pest mystic that they're going to actually pull that off. And then in th state of maine, they think that seat is goi to be gone to the former governor, I should say. Let's just look back at the map. They needed four to pick up a net four. Take away those two, 45 they currently would have. So they need to get six, then, six of the blue states, the competitivtically-held states. Let's look at the map. There are a number of them across the country. Montana, neck-in-neck. North dakota, neck-in-neck, as well. Virginia, all of these pretty much hav polls that are just too close to call. Republicans have to run the board because they need six out of eight in order to take control of the senate. They're not entirely optimistic that they're going to do that. It's a huge question mark. 

[00:58:47]


>> How close is virginia? It's about as close as can be: 
>> It sure is. And another interesting tidbit by republicans that are trying to win back the senate tell us, they are believe now, really, the only way they can do that is if mitt romney wins the white house to pull the senate candidates up on his coat tales. 
>> We'll see what happens. And the reason they would only need three if romney were to win is the vice president, as the president of the senate, he would break the tie. You have 50 republicans, that would be the majority: 
>> And that's happened before. 
>> It certainly has. Dana, thanks very much. Our campaign coverage will continue throughout the weekend.

Tom: And it's big, it's round, and it's inflatable. What is it? 
Kevin: All that and more coming up. doesn't alone." At the home depot's how- community, you can watch videos, read tips, and get advice from fellow doers. We're proud to support "this old house" and doers everywhere. ?????? 
[ wind howling, bird squawks ] 
[ thunder crashes, car alarm blares ] when the unexpected happens, state farm is there to help you getyour old house to a better state. Proud sponsor of "this old house." ] man! What we need is some elbow grease. 
[ Laughs ] Yeah, you can -- are you kidding me? Gmc -- lending "this old house" a helping hand since 2002. by liquidators, retailer of hardwood flooring. Their wide selection includes bellawood prefinished, bamboo, laminate, and vinyl plank flooring. Lumber liquidators is proud to sponsor "this old house." A lot of people want to live in cambridge. This is prime real estate, and consequently, it is a densely populated city, and that means it's hard to get around. There's a lot of traffic, it's hard to park, so the city of cambridge is trying to encourage people to ride their bikes. They are having pretty good success. There are 37 miles of bike lanes in the city, and, in fact, one in ten people ride their bike to work. As it turns out, one of the easiest ways to get around is also one of the oldest. If you're looking for old, this is the place for you. It is the cambridge antiques market, and it is just loaded with all of this old stuff. I mean, look at this -- a vintage typewriter, old kerosene lamp. Every single one of these things is a lesson on the way things used to be done. I mean, look at this. Remember when we used to listen to vinyl? Well, I am here actually looking for a bicycle. I know they are around here somewhere. He's not upstairs, so he's got to be down here. Vinnie, there you are. Been looking all over for you. Kevin, how are ya? I'm all right. Welcome to my shop. Thank you, your shop is in the basement of an antique warehouse. Yeah, who ever heard of it? But it works. Yeah, and so what's the deal with these vintage bikes being all the rage? What we've found is that all the features that were on the old bikes, those features are good for commuting, and that makes those bikes really popular here in cambridge. This is a popular bike. Yes. This actually is an antique. THIS IS FROM THE '30s, NOT REALLY SOMETHING You'd really commute on, but let me show you something that I think would be good for commuting on. So what are the features that people are looking for in these commuter bikes? WELL, THIS OLD BIKE FROM THE '60s, It's got mud guards or fenders front and back, keeps the water from spraying on you. And it's got a chain guard so it keeps the grease off your pants. You don't have to tuck your pants into your sock. You know, if you buy a bike today and pay like $1,000, you don't get any of that stuff. In fact, when I was a kid, I took these things off my bike. That's crazy, it's a shame, but, yes, and those things are desirable now. Okay. This bike's got springs on the seat, upright riding position, great for commuting. So this is an ideal commuter bike. You know, I bet you people have got a lot of these things in their attics or their basements. How do you know if you've got a good vintage bike worth saving? I've got one on the stand over here that I just got in. We get these bikes at yard sales, flea markets, police auctions, and there's a few quick things you want to check. Make sure the wheels spin freely, make sure they're not warped. No rubbing there, looks pretty good. Make sure the cranks spin nicely and they're not bent. Check the frame for bending. A lot of times they'll bend up here. And don't be worried about rust. When there's rust on the chrome, there are tricks to clean it up, so don't be discouraged if you find rust. So you guys are fixing these things up all the time. You get a bike like this, you do some work to it. What does it cost you when you're done? 250, $300. That's it? And a 30-day warranty. That's a fraction of a new bike. All right, well, I've got to go to work, I want to wear my boots, my jeans. What do you got for me? I've got a bike for you over here. We've got to check your size. That's the first thing. Well, I'm big, real big. All right. OKAY, SO THIS IS AN OLD RUDGE FROM THE 1960s. English three-speed classic. An english bike. You can shift it while you're stopped. Perfect commuter bike. All right. Stand over the frame flat-footed. Let's make sure you got room there. Oh, yeah. Okay, you've got about an inch, yeah. I do. That looks your size. Hop up on the seat. All right, so I've got to take it to the any chance to give this one a spin? That fits you perfectly. Yeah, check it out. Vinnie, you're the man. Thank you. It is time to start thinking about the landscape design here on our cambridge project, and helping us with that is landscape architect greg lombardi. Now, we've worked with greg in the past about five or six years ago, and that was on another cambridge project. Hey, greg, how are you? 

[00:05:06]


Greg: Hey, kevin. How you doing? All right. So you li in town, right? I do, just around the corner. Yeah, you got one of these? No, but now you made me want one. I'll get you one. So you've been thinking about the plans for the house, and I guess here the big challenge is that on the outside of the house is going to be, well, vintage, like my bike, but on the inside, we're talking modern, contemporary. How do you balance those two? Very different. Well, we start with the front. Where a traditional house met the street, that really involves the front walk where you see we've got concrete, and I know we can do better than this, so take a look at the plan, we have traditional material. We're going to use a granite curb stock, reclaimed, turned on its side, more contemporary idea of a stepping stone path through a garden to connect to the parking area. Wow, so that stepping stone path that I see right here coming right through this area, and you're talking garden on either side, a good place for a garden, I presume. Great place. Open, light, and color, where we have the kitchen and a lot of activity, so it's well-used. And you're saying thatctually cuts right into this space right here? Exactly. This is the non-victorian aspect. We have parking for two cars, so we want to keep it as high-function. Well, even if we put 'em on bikes, they're going to still want to have their cars, so this has to stay in some form. Exactly, so what we did, we brought that stepping stone path and the modern pattern, it comes and starts to break up the mass of the paving. Hmm, so we end up with two spaces sort of visually, at least, and then these pavers have to break into this rectangular space? We're going to reuse some of these existing pavers, we're going to have the granite and maybe a gravel so that the space is still functional, multi-use, and it's highly practical. But we do have to sort of separate it from the back of the yard. I see you've got something on the plan for a little bit of a divider here. This is where we need some privacy, and I call it the scrim, so there's going to be a little, low retaining wall you can see in the plan. Right down here along the entire back. Along the front of the cars from the back and then the trees will make the visual barrier at the upper level. Very nice, and that gets us to the backyard, an important space for our homeowners, because they've got two little girls. Two little girls, active family. It's got to be clean, functional, open, and lawn connecting to a terrace. Now, what we've done here, the simple connection is there is a terrace level we've shown in stone and connects to the lawn. What we've tried to do is show a planting plan on top of -- no, a layout of stone wall, stone wall, stone terrace. That's the bones, and we plant it up and we have the softness to soften all the lawns. So I'm seeing trees over here at that scrim area and then some of these -- what are these, plants, shrubs? Yeah, these are a perennial border in this area, and this, in the back, we have tall grasses. Very nice, so some privacy from those as well, and, as you say, soften up the stone. So, looks good to me. I guess the real question is, what do the homeowners think about it? Well, they love it, but always budget concerns. Always, right. Yeah. So do you have sort of an alternative? What goes? We do. What we're looking at is reusing what we can of the existing deck structure -- so instead of taking all this out and pne, you're saying maybe take off these weathered boards and use the frame underneath? Keep the underpinnings, exactly, and then go to a surface material. So this looks like ipe, that's a good, traditional look, and these are individual boards, but we've seen this a couple times where it's ipe laid on these modular click-in tracks right there, which is pretty good. Yeah, very easy to put down and take up. Or maybe even put them in stone, which you've got right here. Okay. Well, you know, wherever the budget comes out, and obviously that's the homeowners' decision, the plan looks pretty good to me, so I think we're well along the way. Thanks very much.

Kevin: This entire third floor is dedicated to the master bedroom, with the bathroom up front, a closet in the middle, and this is the sleeping area, and it's really great space, but what our homeowners loved most about it is the roof deck. They love this. There's just one problem, tommy. It's a little high off the floor. Well, there were three risers to get you into this bedroom from the deck or from the bedroom out to the deck, and that's a stairway in a small bedroom that eats up a lot of space. And we don't want that. No, but we actually figured out a solution for that, so if we feel like doing some work, we can get started on removing that deck. I'll give you a hand. All right, kevin, to get started out here, we're going to remove the railing and th we'll take up the decking. Are we saving anything here? No, we're not saving a thing. 
Tom: All right, kevin, let me explain to you how they framed for the flat roof for the roof deck. It all starts with this roof here that I'm standing on. It's sloped in three directions -- this way, this way, and that way, making it a hip roof. I can actually see some of these original rafters, right, these darker pieces that are angled right here. RIGHT. NOW, YOU CAN SEE THESE 2 x 6s RIGHT Here that they actually nailed or sandwiched THE OLD 2 x 4 RAFTERS INTO IT, OUT TO A RING Joist, making it a flat surface. They also cut the top of the rafter coming up on each side, making the roof flat up top and also lowering it a little bit. 
Kevin: Yeah, so they got rid of the peak. So I see the original rafter right here, the darker wood, the two-bys stop, BUT NOW I'M LOOKING AT BRAND-NEW LVLs. What's the story wh these? Hold on, there, we got a lot of work to do. Don't rush me here. I want to remove all this first BEFORE WE EVEN TALK ABOUT THOSE LVLs. And we're cutting this out? We're cutting it out. All right, let's get the saws. All right, tommy, I think I've got it figured out WHAT YOU DID HERE WITH THESE LVLs. Did you frame the new roof right underneath their old deck? I did. Remember, we gutted out all the house, and this is the guest room down below. And right here are the old ceiling ists. Because it was all open, I was able to slide these engineered lumber right up beside them, resting them underneath this wall and the other outside wall. So now we're going to lay the new roof sheathing right on top of the NEW LVLs? Exactly. So does this have a pitch to it already? It does have a pitch. It is a roof and it has to have a pitch. Let me show you. What I've done is I've actually tapered them, so if I hold my level on top of them but I bring my level up so it's level, you can see quite a pitch right here for the water to run off of the roof. Very clever, and so what are the effects of actually ripping these things down to amaller dimension? 'Cause this is carrying a lot of weight now, right? Ll, you're right. You've got a snow load and you've got all of the roof material on here and the people that will be on the deck, so you have to allow for a lot of load. So these rafters that rest on the outside wall here and the rafters on the outside wall over there are actually now not strong enough to span that load. Even though they're doubled-up? Even though they're doubled-up. It all starts with this beam right here. This is a triple 12-inch lvl, rests on the outside wall right here all the way over to the outside wall on the other side. Right. Now, RUNNING FROM THIS LVL BEAM ARE THREE 2 x 10 LVLs. They're attached in this hanger. On the other end, it's actually resting on a beam that we installed in the wall of the house. Underneath or on the back side of all this IS A BIG HANGER THAT WRAPS AROUND THESE LVLs And attaches to this other side of this beam carrying or breaking the span to carry the load. So you're effectively hanging all of these roof rafters off of these two beams. Exactly. And so now we're just ready to lay our plywood right on here? We're going to sheathe right over it and we'll have our pitcheroof. All right, now, before we install our sheathing, I like to put it down with some subfloor adhesive, and then we'll nail it in place. You ready? Ready. Good. All right. All right, kevin, want to nail this? All right, I'm going to get the railing that's going to go on this end over here. This is going to sit right on top of our beam. So tack that there, just one nail for now. Okay, now let me just make sure it's plumb. And so solid wall here, but open balusters off to this side. Exactly. All right, go ahead, nail that in. All right, now, one more down here. Let me make it even with the beam first. Okay, tack it. Now let me check it. Right there. Good. Now we'll do the back wall right here. Now, this is actually a railing that's going to go right here because it is a roof deck. Drop that down in there. All right, I'm in. Now I've got to push my side in. This wall right here that is our railing actually has to be sheathed and flashed and waterproofed. And so it's basically an exterior wall. I mean, I can see the inside of the house right here, so we've got to make this nice and weather tight. That's right. And protect this area. You've got it. All right, you got the level? All right, right... Right there. Good. Now we'll do the corner. 

[00:15:12]


[ Grunts ] straight here, right up tight. 
[ Grunts ] okay, good. Perfect. 
Tom: Ready? Push it tight to me. All right, that's it for our sidewalls. Now I have one more thing to show you to make this all worthwhile. All right, kevin, you get to do the honors. Look at this, tommy, huh? Wow. This is a huge improvement to this roof deck. No more steps in the master bedroom. It's going to be a great space. It is. 
Kevin: Hey, roger. Morning, kev. So this morning there was some debate as to whether or not this space here was going to be stone patio or if we were going to have to re-use the wooden frame. No more debate. Talked to the homeowner. We're going to go with a wood deck. All right, well, you've got to live within your budget, right? That's right. So I guess a lot less work for you. Well, no stone patio, no walls, but it presents a problem with this stump. Originally I was going to come in with the excavator to dig for the patio and walls and pop this out. Now I can't do that. A little too close for comfort for the deck that's here. Okay, so what's the plan of attack? Well, this is a stump, this is fairly typical of what a tree man would leave when he's done, about a foot above grade. Now, this is a lot of material to grind and it would take a long time. It's faster to take it off with a chainsaw. So I'm going to take the chainsaw and come along just above the ground and cut until I remove most of this stump. So, start with the chainsaw but then go to the grinder. You got it. Okay. Oh! 
[ Laughs ] so, roger, you're obviously going to be at this for a while, aren't you? Yeah. Well, richard's waiting for me inside. I'll check back in on you? I'll be here. 

[00:17:18]


Kevin: You have made some good progress on the mechanical systems, richard. Yeah, we've had a good week fighting the ductwork into this building. You know, tommy has fought really hard to get this building really tight. By the time we're done, this is going to be like r-40 in this rafter bay. I mean, we've even expanded these rafters out of here, which is just to get enough insulation in there. That's right, but, now, in this room, we want to get a supply and a return. Here's the return right here. We want to get our supplies. Now, a lot of duct guys would have just run the ductwork right here in this rafter bay. Which would defeat a lot of the purpose of putting all that insulation in. That's not what we want. That's right, it breaks the shell. What we did is we sealed all this duct, insulated it, run it down under the floor, and bring it right here, so when we're done, we have a super-insulated shell that we're not interrupting. Awesome, I love it. 
Kevin: Sounds like roger's still going to town on that stump. 
Richard: That is a big stump. All right, so down here on the second floor, we needed to find a place for an air handler, and even though it's gutted, there really wasn't that many places. Right. So we thought about putting it right here in this closet, stacking it vertically right here. And you see that a lot, but it takes up floor space in a closet. But what we did is we actually put it up above this closet ceiling so it does a bunch of things for us. One, it gives closet access, the other, it gives us service access for the unit and it puts our ductwork now at the perfect height, come right around, and look at this, there's a whole series of closets right here that all line up so they can hide our ductwork right here for the second floor and for the third floor. Great place to hide everything. Absolutely. Our plumbing rough is well underway. I love seeing this. This is cast iron on the stack from the bathroom up above. Nice and quiet when you flush the toilet up above. Yep, okay. All right, plumbing rough is just about done. Shower valves are in, here's a cast iron tub we've got to tip down into place. You'll notice that they ran the radiant floor heating on the floor right here. I love seeing that underneath the cast iron tub. Okay, and we've got some work going on in the front bedroom, too. Yeah, abe did all the plumbing rough here, and so he's got his mafolds right here. He has the cold water manifold for all the plumbing on this floor for cold water, the hot water manifolds going right here. And the manifold's not copper. Right, it isn't, it's a polypropylene, a very interesting product. You can use it in place of copper. But what makes it different is the connection method. We drill the pipe, and then we'll h both the pipe and the fitting, and that'll actually fuse them together. Abe has a special tool to fuse it together. That ishot. It's about 400????. We do both the fitting and the pipe at the same time. You see it sort of deforming the plastic pipe. So this is a connection that's going to replace solder, glue? That's right. It's a fusion connection. It actually makes the material one. Look at that. Now, does that have to set up? We got to wait a little while? 

[00:20:01]


Abe: Yeah, it has to cool just a little bit. That's done. Wow. Never seen it before. You know, it's kind of amazing, in your ancient trade, that we see so much new technology and we see it all the time. I'm always looking for a way to find a way to do it better, easier, or faster. Better, easier, faster, I like those. You have anything for stumps? No, I don't. You go see roger. He's not a happy camper. 
Kevin: Stumps! 
Kevin: Wow. Look at you, huh? Nice. Man versus stump. Who won? Stump. [ Laughs ] so what happened? Well, think about it. You know, up here, we might be, what, 30 inches wide in this, maybe three feet at the most? Nice, straight grain. Going down, it actually flares out, and down here, it's four to five feet wide and it's all gnarly. It's where the roots connect to the main trunk and hold everything together. That's why the tree guys cut it up here, isn't it? Nice idea, huh? Leave the rest for me. So what do you think? Are you going to get it? I've got about five minutes more with that chainsaw and we're ready to start grinding. Let's do it. 
Roger: Let's give it a shot. 
Kevin: What do you think? Oh, yeah! Look at that, huh? Stump none, roger one. Piece of cake. That is big. Unbelievable. Now comes the fun part. Let's get the grinder going. 
[Laughing] We're only half done. All right, kevin, this is the stump grinder we're going to use. If you look on the front there, you see those carbide teeth? I see 'em right here. They're going to just take and nibble away at this stump. Now, this might not be the biggest stump grinder in the world, but it's easy to get in and out of backyards like this. Now, would you just pull the start for me? Ready? Yep. 

[00:22:03]


Roger: Kevin, what we do is we roll the machine up to the stump and we just start taking little bites out of the stump. We can swing back and forth. It's almost like dancing, only the machine's your partner. What we hope to accomplish here is we'll get down eight or ten inches, but we could never get down deep enough to plant here. That stump goes down four feet, and there's no way we can grind down that deep. 
Kevin: So you can't plant anything substantial, but what about, say, grass? 
Roger: It's going to be shallow in there, six to eight inches deep. Grass will do fine, and maybe some flowering plants. 
Kevin: So, what do you think, roger? Down deep enough? 
Roger: Six to eight inches of loam on top of that and we're ready to go. All right, well, looks like you beat the stump after all. Feels like the stump beat me, to be honest. So what's up for next week? We're going to jackhammer out some concrete in the front of the house and prep for some hardscaping. Perfect timing, 'cause I know tommy's anxious to get working on that front...Porch. Or maybe not. Well, until next time, I'm kevin o'connor. And I'm roger cook. For "this old house."

This is a patch, and when they did this patch, you can tell that they used mortar that was way too hard. We're going to start fresh. And we'll bring our beat-up porch back to life. Looks like the only thing that's holding this together is the paint.

Roger: Welcome to miami. Hi, luce. Good morning, roger. What a beautiful day. It's a gorgeous day. So, tell me, what happened to your front yard? Well, I used to have six beautiful, gorgeous oak trees, and they were great because they were providing me with a lot of shade, it was a screen for the traffic, and with hurricane wilma, I lost all of them. The hurricane took all six trees down? Yes, even one smashed a car. Now you're left with a wide-open yard on a main street, and there's another street coming right in. It looks like they could drive into your front door. This is exactly my concern. So I think you need some more trees out here. I was thinking about palm trees. Yeah, palms. Definitely not oaks. I mean, look in the neighborhood. There's already a bunch of palms existing here. But there's a large variety of palms, and we have to pick out just the right ones for your yard, so let's go get 'em. Luce, we are at the montgomery botanical center. Now, they specialize in palms. They have over 120 acres and over 400 species of palms. This is absolutely gorgeous. Good morning. Hey, good morning. Patrick, I want you to meet our homeowner, luce. Good morning, patrick. Good to meet you. Now, patrick, you know a little bit about palms. Little bit. I'm a botanist, and I'm responsible for the plant collection. What makes a palm a palm? Well, it's pretty easy if you just look up there. Palms don't branch like normal trees do. They have a single growing point. There's some pretty neat differences on the inside, too. I've got a sample of a hardwood and a palm to show you. Now, when a hardwood grows, it increases its diameter every year and gets bigger and bigger and bger. Palms are a little bit different. They set their diameter early, and then they only grow upwards. Now, in a hardwood, you have a very thin layer, a quarter of an inch or so, on the outside called a cambium. Now, that cambium layer has xylem and phloem, and that carries nutrients, water, and sugar up and down the tree. Yeah, it's a little bit different with palms. With palms, the xylem and phloem is throughout the entire trunk. So if you get a little bit of damage on the edge, it won't kill the entire plant. Yeah, if we damage a hardwood tree like that, it could cause it severe harm or even death. Now, we have a lot of palms here. Let's take a look at 'em. Yeah. 

[00:32:09]


Patrick: This is a beautiful plant. It's called a puerto rican royal palm. Really nice. This is spectacular. Look at that. But I think it's a little too formal for your front yard. A little bit too much. It's got that nice smooth trunk, really beautiful. This is another puerto rican plant. So there's a lot of different ways the trunks could look. This one's really spiny. Ugh, boy, that's going to keep the neighborhood kids out of the front yard, that's for sure. What about this one over here? This looks like a clumping palm? Yeah, that's exactly right. It's a clumping palm called the bamboo palm. Could work really nice as a hedge. I'm not looking for a hedge. Oh, okay. Well, there's a lot of different trunk forms in the palm family. This is one called the dypsis lanceolata. Interesting plant. Looks like bamboo. I like it, but I'm looking for more screening and low maintenance. We got to remember we have hurricanes here. We want a tree that's going to stand up to a hurricane, can grow in full sun, and get, what, 12 or 14 feet tall? Yes. Okay, well, there's a tree here that's really strong against high winds. We should go look at that one. So this is a mongomery palm. It's a real traditional look. It's what most people think of when they think of a palm. You're telling me this skinny, scrawny, little tree can stand up to a hurricane? Oh, yeah, absolutely. It's from the tropics, where they get a lot of hurricanes, so it's really well-adapted. Well, what do you thin it's a little bit too skinny. 
[ Chuckling ] TOO SKINNY. YOU GOT ANYTHING Else? All right, all right. Let's go. Yeah, this is it. Great palm. This is called bismarckia. Beautiful plant. See how strong the trunk is? It's got that beautiful blue-gray color. Really great. 
Roger: Tremendous color. 
Luce: This is beautiful. This is very different. I like it. Does it come in a smaller size? Yeah, well, these individuals here, they're over 20 years old, so if you get a younger tree, it grows slow. It'll stay small for a long time. So you definitely like this one? Oh, this is it. This is the one I want. Now, we're going to plant six palms in the front yard. I don't want to use all the same variety, so I'd like to find one with a little contrast to this. Great. Wow, look at the shape of this one. What is this palm called? Well, you can tell by the shape of the trunk it's called the bottle palm. Really a strong palm. It's from the indian ocean. Very resistant against hurricanes. What do you think, luce? I like it. I think if we took two of these bottle palms and combined it with that bismarck that we saw earlier, that would make for a great planting. Let's do it. Patrick, thanks for all your help in picking out just the right palms. Happy to help. All right, let's slide this over. Once more. That looks pretty good. Now, whenever we're putting plants in, I love to set them out ahead of time so we can look at 'em. Thanks, guys, for all your help. 'Cause we wanted to do some screening in the front, and I think with that plant there, it'll screen it off very nicely. These two will go on the side. And we kept 'em back. If you look up, we have the overhead wires. I don't want these plants to grow up into the wires. Now, these bottle will grow very slowly, the bottle palms. But this bismarck is going to get up faster, so we wanted to make sure we pushed it back. Now, when I dig trees at home, when I plant them, I have to make the hole two or three times as wide as the pot is, so I would be digging a hole way out here. The roots on the palm are so aggressive that you only have to make the hole about six inches bigger. Okay, now we want to move this tree out of the way so we can start digging. You ready? Come on, up here some more. All right, that's good. 

[00:35:46]


Roger: Just underneath the topsoil is a layer of limestone coral. Now, there's no way we can dig that stuff out with a shovel, so we brought in a small backhoe to make the digging for us easier. Now, it's really important that we don't plant these trees too low. If you plant them too low, they won't thrive and grow. If you plant them a little bit high, they'll get all the water and oxygen they need to grow well. So, to check that height, I'm going to lay this rake right across the middle of the hole. Going to take my tape and measure down. And I have 12" to the bottom part of the rake. Now I'm going to come over to my pot. And we'll see that 12" is right there. That means this tree is going to end up being planted a little high, which is perfect. So right now I'm going to tip this tree down to me. We're going to roll it over a little bit. You ready? One, two, three. Now you want to cut it? Or is it coming? It's coming. All right, luce, come over here and just roll that right in the hole. There you go. Nice and easy. Beautiful. Stand it up. All right, luce, come out here with me. Guys, you can put some soil around that if you want. Now, he's going to cut that open. Look at that. See how nice it looks? We want to make sure it's straight and the wide part is right there in front, and I think we got it perfect. What do you think? Definitely. I like it very much. We're going to backfill with the same soil that came out of the hole. These palms don't need any soil amendments or fertilizer added to the soil. You want to come over to this side, luce? I'll switch sides with you. All right, luce, I like to water as I backfill to get all those air pockets out around the tree and make sure all that good soil is settled down around the roots. Okay, luce, the last step is to spread this mulch. We're going to take and put it on two to three inches deep. No deeper, okay? Take that one over there. Now, what this is going to do, it's going to help hold moisture in where the roots are, and it's going to keep the weeds from growing, too. But the most important thing you have to do is water this tree every day for a week, every other the second week, and then twice a week for the whole summer to make sure it gets plenty of moisture. Roger, this is fantastic, beautiful. I want to thank you. I love it. I had a really great time. Look at this palm. Isn't it gorgeous? 

[00:38:36]


Roger: Guys, this is a complicated one. 
Richard: Yeah? Obviously, it's a blue circle. 
Kevin: Nothing complicated there. You blow up the outside edge, and then you blow up these little pockets in the middle, and it even has magnets on the outside edge. What is it? Not complicated at all, roger, if you've got little kids like I do, all right? Now, there are a lot of trampolines in backyards, and they're a ton of fun. Just one problem. Yeah. Pew! Exactly. Neck injuries, right? You go off. Well, not on this thing. This is a child-fe trampoline. Wow! Ooh, look at him go. Look a wow. Stuck the dismount. The russian judge gave you a three. What?! That's not it at all. You guys know I like to do camping. You like to... Do camping? Do camping. Gocamping. But I like to also sleep on an air mattress. Oh, yeah. This is perfect, but who sleeps like this? That's right. Not me. I like to sleep in a little ball. Get down here, roll myself up. Ahh. Now, you want to know what the magnets are for? So you can fold it up. The magnets will keep the blanket on you. You look like a taco. Portuguese burrito.

You put like 3/4 of an ch, maybe 7/8 of an inch in that baby, the kids just go wild and they love it. Ooh, that's a little cold. Oh, that's cold. Just remember, no diving. No diving, eh? In the history of this show, you have come the closest to getting one right. It's not a pool. It goes in a pool. What you do is you get enough of these to cover your pool. During the day, it absorbs heat and transfers it down into the water, and at night, it acts as an insulating blanket and keeps the heat fromng from the pool. It's a pretty small pool. It's like a water bed for you. A water bed! I'm going in! No diving! Whoa, tommy's doing some sleeping. Not long ago, a light bulb was just a light bulb, and if one burned out, well, there weren't a lot of choices. New technology like halogen, fluorescent, and l.E.D. Has made lighting a lot more efficient. But it means you have to look at more than just the watt rating to pick the perfect light bulb for your house. Output of a light is measured in lumens. Here's the lumens of some common incandescent bulbs. An energy efficient bulb can give you the same output while using less electricity. Another number you need to know about is color temperature, which affects the look of your light. A lower number looks more like incandescent light. A higher number looks more like natural daylight, but that may be too blue for indoors. These new light bulbs cost a lot more than incandescents, but they're going to save yoenergy, and they're going to last a lot longer. Ann marie? Hey, richard! Hey, how are you? I'm well. Thank you so much for coming over. Nice to be here. Welcome to my 1940, two-bedroom bungalow. I love it. Thanks. It's about 1,000 square feet, and it's perfect for me. But I have a problem. All right. I have a 40-year-old forced hot water gas system. Okay. But it's craed, it's leaking water. Oh, boy. So I need to replace it. So I called a number of plumbers and contractors, but I got a variety of quotes. A number of them wanted to just replace it with a newer version of what I have. The old technology again. Exactly. Exactly. And I was hoping for something that was a high-efficiency system. That's why I called you. Well, I hope we can do something. I hope so, too! Well, I think we have a solution forou. Now, your heating system is a forced hot water heating system. In this case, you've got a tor in each room. Now, a convector has heated water, comes up through a pipe right here. Passes through this fin, heat exchanger, and heats up the air. These things are fine. We don't have to do a thing up here. All of our work's going to be down in the basement. Okay. Now, your heating system has pretty much been the standard package around these parts for the last 60 years. It's not exactly new technology. This is a gas-fired cast-iron heating boiler. There's a burner underneath, and that heats up a big block of cast iron right here that's filled with water. All the flue gas goes up through this pipe right here into the chimney. Now, when the thermostat comes on upstairs, it bringon the burner, but it also brings this circulator pump on to send the heated water up through those convectors upstairs. It works. Now, one thing I do notice is right here. THIS THING IS RATED FOR 150,000 BTUs. So what does that mean? It means it's really big. This would be good for a house that's about 3,000 square feet. I have under 1,000. Right. We could actually heat your next two neighbors' houses. That's incredible. All right, but that's not unusual. We see this happen all the time. People have tended to oversize to be safe, and that's inefficient. Now, that's for heating of the house. You have a separate system right here for making hot water for the faucets. There's a gas-fired tank-type water heater, burner right here. Heats up a big tank of water right here. 40 gallons of water. This thing's on 24/7, every day, whether or not you're here or not, to make hot water. The fact is, both of these systems, they work. You have heat, you have hot water. And if fuel hadn't continued to go up, we'd probably just keep doing this way forever. What we want to do today is to eliminate the boiler and the water heater with one device which combines heating and hot water muore efficiently. Say hello to barry cullen. Hey, barry. Hi, how are you? Barry and his crew are helping us with the installation today. What have we got? What we have here is we have a gas-fired combination boiler, and it provides both heat and hot water to the house. And what we call it is a combi. So this one small unit's going to replace both of those? Yeah, let me show you how it works. It looks a little daunting, but let me demystify it a little bit. Before, you had 10 gallons of water in a cast-iron block. Now you have one gallon of water inside this stainless steel block. Here's that circulator pp like you had before, which pushes the water through to be heated inside this block. It goes out to your convectors, gives up its heat to upstairs, comes back cooler and to be reheated. So that's your basic boiler, but it's much more efficient. Where it differs is this. It can make domestic hot water. See this shiny thing right here with the orange and silver? This is actually a very ingenious flat plate heat exchanger. Now, this is a series of plates that are stacked on top of one another. Boiler water goes in this direction through every other plate. Potable water, or cold water, comes the opposite direction through the other plates. Now, the boiler water never touches that potable water. Okay. Okay? But what happens is, the heat from the boiler water is given up to that cold water, thereby making hot water up at your faucets, all right? What's nice about this is this burner doesn't come on to make hot water for the faucets unless you open up the faucet, which means you don't use anything if you're not using any hot water, and there's no tank. Wow, that's amazing. It's pretty cool. Now, barry and his crew have done a good job. You got a lot of stuff done here. You got plywood, the hangers are up. I see gas piping, water piping. Ready to put this up? Sure. All right. Okay. You got it? Okay, good. Now, one of the things about these units, they're so efficient that there's not much left in the flue gas except a little bit of temperature and a little bit of water, so we really can't go into the old-style chimney. We have to actually nt to outside. So we're going to need two holes to the outside. One is for the flue gas to go outside. The other is for combustion air, the air to be burned to come inside. Now we just make up the pvc connections. 

[00:46:39]


Man: Okay, bring it in. Twist it in. That's good. Well, it turns out that this side of the building is really a good location for the sidewall venting. You can see the intake right here. Here's the exhaust. Each of them are going to have a screen to keep out birds and bugs. Now, the codes have clear rules about placement. It wants to be above the snow line so the intake wouldn't get blocked by snow, which it's fine. The other is the exhaust cannot be within 12" of a window, so that's fine. And, finally, it needs to be no closer than one foot between the intake and the exhaust. You don't want to bring flue products back in to be re-burned. Perfect location. Great. All right, barry, the venting's completed now. Yeah, all we got to do now is the piping. All right, so, piping, that means hot and cold piping right here. We also have the supply and return piping to the heating system right here and the gas connection to the new combi boiler. Now, on this old boiler, you had one speed. The thermostat would call, AND YOU WOULD GET 150,000 BTUs OF FIRING Power. With the new device, it's got a modulating gas valve. That means it can modulate BETWEEN 17,000 BTUs UP TO 75,000. So we can always match the load that we need. So how does it do that? Well, it has an outdoor temperature sensor like this. This will mount on the north side of the building, feed back to the control. It'll watch that temperature. On the coldest day of the year, you'll fire it up to full fire just like the old boiler was and give you plenty of temperature to go through the convectors. But on the spring and the fall, which is most of the heating season, it says, "no, we don't need that much water temperature to still heat the building," and that's where you save the energy. Wow, that's great. All right, ann marie, your new combi boiler's ready to go. You excited? I'm super excited. Now, we've got our vent connections done. Here's the hot and cold that goes up to your faucets upstairs. Okay. Now, this is the supply and return piping. That connects to your convectors. And here's your circulator pump that'll send that heat around. Here's your gas piping. That's all done. And electrical's done, as well. Great. So, now, any time we burn gas, normally, there's a bunch of water vapor filled with heat that goes up and out of the chimney. This is a condensing boiler, and what that does is it actually extracts the heat out of the water droplets that would have been lost up to the atmosphere, uses it inside the boiler, makes it much more efficient, but we've got to deal with the water that's left over. This is called condensate. You can see right here that it goes through a limestone neutralizer, 'cause that condensate can be a little bit acidic. This is a condensate pump to pump that water right over the sink. But we're ready to go. Great. Turn on this button right here. All right, barry, why don't you open that hot water faucet. I hear it. I feel it. You got hot water over there? Oh, yeah. You have hot water. That's awesome. Thank you! D now it's going to be great. You're going to have plenty of heat in your house, you'll never run out of hot water, and you're going to save a ton of energy. Oh, my gosh. And you know what else I'm realizing? This is all of my mechanicals, so now my little house just got a little bit bigger. That's right. Let's get this out of your way. Great. All right, see you later, ann marie. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. Bye. You know, it seems like a nice, little machine. I mean, we're talking efficient, compact, you get two devices turned into one. Why isn't this thing in everybody's house? Well, everybody wants this, one appliancat can do both heating and hot water, but it has a limitation, and that's really the size of the house. If the house is too big, you don't have enough available power. The other is domestic hot water. If you got a really big tub, 80 to 100 gallons, this might not fill it at the speed you'd like it to be filled at. But you could take a shower all day long. You could -- that's one of the great things about this. Now, can it heat the house and produce domestic hot water at the same time? Technically, no. In normal mode, this unit is going to try to heat the building, and so the water will leave this heat exchanger, go through this pump, and go out to the system right here. Now, if you open up a faucet, there's a sensor in here that will now divert the water through this valve, through that heat exchanger. Now it's going to heat up that hot water, and it's going to give domestic hot water the priority as long as you have that faucet open. You leave it on for 10, 12, 15 minutes, you'd never notice it that you didn't have heat upstairs. All right, well, you are always showing us new stuff, richard, thank you. So, until next time, m kevin o'connor... I'm rich trethewey. I'm tolva. And I'm roger cook. His old house." I take really long showers. We can adjust for that. We can adjust.

[ Knocking ] I'm jim anderson, and I'm a stained-glass artist. When I first started doing this stuff, IT WAS THE '70s, And for a long time, stained glass was still in churches, people hadn't thought about it in residential buildings. BUT WHEN I WAS IN IT IN THE '70s, We were more experimenting with color and texture and glass and light and all these theories, and it was just a whole new world. It was just -- itas lit-up artwork. These look good. They look perfect. Not too much, not too little. I had bought a building on the south end, and I started making stained-glass windows, started putting them in my house, and I happened to be right in boston at this sort of monumental rush of all those people coming back into the city. I remember the first window I ever made in stained glass, and when it illuminated, boom! And it lights up. Or, like, when you're in the house during the day, boom! And just color just pours through your hallways or lights up your stairwells. What iove about it is there is so much to learn from this medium constantly. 'Cause it's not just about stained-glass windows. Like, a stained-glass window is attractive, but when you put it in a house, it can become like a screen to another room. It gives you an introduction to other spaces, w#IT BRINGS YOU INTO SOMEONE'S FRONT DOOR. It gives you a feeling. It's like a marriage of art and architecture. And it's so permanent. It's le it becomes part of a city, part of a street scene. It's for the whole community, so if you did your front doors in stained glass, everybody gets to enjoy it when they walk by at night. Everybody gets to appreciate it. I would say it's like jewelry on a woman, it's like embellishment on a house, it's like -- it's the creme de la creme, it's the final piece before you put your furniture in. It's like...Perfect.

narrator: THE ISLAND OF SODOR Is surrounded by beautiful blue sea. It has fields of green and sandy yellow beaches. There are rivers, streams, and lots of trees, where the birds sing. There are windmills and a coal mine and docks where visitors to the island arrive. The island also has lots and lots of railway lines. Who's that puffing down the track? It's thomas. Hello, thomas. 

[00:02:17]


[whistle toots] 
- Heo, everybody. Welcome to the island of sodor. 
[whistle toots] narrator: Today on the island of sodor, flynn is called to an emergency. And gordon gets a new buffer. But fi let's see how the engines are starting their day. The engines on sir topham hatt's railway are all special. Some are big. Some are small. Some push freight cars. And some pull passenger carriages. And then there's flynn, the sodor island fire engine. One morning, flynn was in the steam works. Flynn's road wheels were wobbly. Victor was fixing him. Flynn looked worried. 
- Have you finished yet, victor? narrator: Victor chuffed kindly. 
- Don't worry, my friend. All will be well. 
narrator: THOMAS WANTED TO MAKE His friend flynn feel happy. 
- You are a very special fire engine, flynn. You can ride on the rails or roll on the roads. 
- But I haven't rolled on the roads for a very long time. My wheels will wobble. 
- No, they won't. 
- You're fixed. Now you can rescue on the roads as well as the rails. 
- Thank you, victor. Thank you, thomas. 
[horn hos] narrator: And flynn trundled slowly away flynn stopped at a quiet junctio 
- no one is here to see me. I'll try out my road wheels. narrator: So flynn rolleto the road. He wobbled all over the r he didn't feel like fiery flynn at all. Just then... 

[00:04:35]


[whistle toots] Charlie chuffed by. 
- [laughs] Hello, flynn. What's the matter? You look like a big red wobble on wheels. 
narror: FLYNN WANTED TO LAUGH, But he felt silly. 
- They need you at the sodor search and rescue center. You must hurry... 
[laughs] If you can. 
[laughs] narrator: Flynn made a decision. 
- I don't want people to see me on the road. They'll think I'm a big red wobble on wheels. I'll roll back on the rails. 
narrator: SO FLYNN WOBBLED BACK Onto the tracks. At the sodor search and rescue center, rocky was pleased to see flynn. 
- There's an emergency, flynn. Sir topham hatt's shed is on fire. 
- Firefighter flynn ready and steady and raring to rescue. 
[siren wailing] 
- You must hurry. Take the road. It's the fastest way. narrator: Flynn gulped. He didn't want to take the road. He didn't want anyone to see him wobbling. 
- Don't worry, rocky. I'll race on the rails. I'll be there faster than fast. 
- If you say so, flynn. 
narrator: BUT FLYNN Had already raced away. On the tracks, flynn felt fast. Flynn felt fearless. Then he saw butch. Butch had broken down. Flynn slowed. 
- Hello, flynn. I need to be towed to the search and rescue center. Can you help? narrator: Flynn wanted to help butch, but that meant he would have to roll onto e roads, and flynn didn't want butch and his driver to see him wobble. Flynn didn't want them to call him a big red wobble on wheels. 

[00:06:42]


- I'm very sorry, butch. I have to race to an emergency. Sir topham hatt's shed is on fire. 
[siren wailing] narrator: And flynn rattled on. At the level crossing, the gates were closed. Flynn had to stop. Going on the tracks was taking a very long time. 
- Flaming funnels. I'm late to fight sir topham hatt's fire. narrator: Then flynn saw bertie the bus. Bertie's engine had overheated. Bertie's passengers watched and waited. 
- Hello, bertie. What's the problem? 
- It's my engine, flynn. I need water to cool it down. Can you help? narrator: Flynn wanted to help bertie, but that meant he would have to roll onto the road. And now there were even more people to watch him wobble. Flynn didn't want all bertie's passengers to call him a big red wobble on wheels. 
- I'm very sorry, bertie. I have to race to an emergency. Sir topham hatt's shed is on fire. Flynn felt bad. T he didn't want to feel silly, so flynn raced on. At last, flynn pulled up to sir topham hatt's shed. There was a crowd around the burning shed. Sir topham hatt was cross. 
- Flynn, where have you been? This was an emergency. 
- I raced as fast as I could, sir. 
- But why did you come on the rails? I told rocky you must come on the road. narrator: Dn't know how to say at he felt silly on the road. 
- I'm sorry, sir. I-- 
- no excuses, flynn. No more delay. narrator: Flynn looked at the fire. Then he looked at the crowd. 
- Oh, my. Now there are even more people to see me wobble and even more people to call me a big red wobble on wheels. I can't. I can't go onto the road. narrator: Flynn felt terrible. 

[00:08:55]


- I'm not fiery flynn. I'm frightened flynn. Sir topham hatt's shed is burning down, and it's all my fault. narrator: Flynn looked at the crowd. They were waiting and watching. 
- Hooray for flynn. 
- Sodor's firefighting hero has arrived. 
[all cheer] 
narrator: FLYNN LOOKED, And he listened. Then his wheels stopped wobbling. 
- I am fiery flynn. I am sodor's firefighter. I want to be a hero. I don't mind if they call me a big red wobble on wheels. I'm raring to rescue. I'm coming, sir. narrator: Flynn raced to the road. His wheels wobbled, but flynn didn't mind. He was firefighter flynn of the road and rail. 
- Stand back for flynn. 
[crowd cheers] narrator: Water flew into the fire. The flames flickered and fizzled out. 
- Well done, flynn. 
- Thank you, sir, but now I must hurry. I have others to rescue. 
[siren wailing] 
narrator: FIRST, Flynn rescued bertie. He pumped in water to cool bertie's engine. Charlie chuffed to a stop. He chuckled. 
- [cs] There's my friend, the big red wobble on wheels. narrator: This time, flynn didn't mind charlie's joke. 
- I may wobble, but I'm raring to rescue. Bye, bertie. narrator: Flynn flashed a smile. Bertie beamed. 
- Thank you, flynn. Hooray for you. 
ator: NEXT, Flynn pulled up to butch. 
- Here I am, butch, ready and raring to rescue. narrator: Butch was surprised. 

[00:10:59]


- Thank you, flynn. narrator: Flynn raced along the roads. Flynn arrived at the search and rescue center. Thomas was there. 
- Hello, flynn. You are not wobbling at all. narrator: Flynn was surprised. 
- You mean I'm not a big red wobble on wheels? narrator: Thomas laughed. 
- No, you're a big red hero on wheels. 
narrator: AND THIS TIME, Flynn's wheels did wobble... With joy.

[trains chugging] 
[whistle toots] 
naator: THIS IS A busy steam railway line just like the one on sodor. All day long, engines puff up and down the track taking passengers where they want to go. These engines are very busy. But engines don't work all the time. On this railway line, the engines that aren't working are kept in an engine shed. This engine shed is very big. It has to be big because steam engines and diesel engines are also very big. Look how big the wheels are on this engine. There are lots of different types of engine in this engine shed. They are all waiting until they are needed out on the railway track. There are lots of steam engines and lots of diesel engines in this engine shed. Different engines are used for different jobs. Some of these engines are used often, like this engine, which pulls carriages full of passengers up and down the track. Some engines are only used at special times, like this special crane engine. This engine is a little like rocky. The crane engine spends most of its time in the engine shed until its needed. If something is blocking the track, the controller of the railway will call for the crane engine to clear the way. A crane engine like this is very useful, because it can be used to lift and carry heavy objects. Once the crane engine has cleared the track or lifted its heavy load, it clangs back to the engine shed with all the other engines until the next time it is needed. So next time you travel on a steam railway and you see an engine shed, think of all the different types of engine that are inside. 

[00:17:16]


[trains chugging] 
[whistle toots] narrator: On the island of sodor, there are lots of engines. Some are steamies. Some are diesels. Sometimes diesels and steamies are not the best of friends, but they all want to be really useful. One morning, gordon was taking passengers to brendham docks. Diesel, 'arry, and bert were shunting flatbeds. They clanged and banged loudly. That made gordon grumpy. 
- Out of my way. Express coming through. narrator: That made diesel devious. 
- Out of my way. Flatbed coming through. 
[whistle blo] 
- You think you're so grand. 
- But you're not. narrator: Gordon glared at the diesels. 
- I am gordon. I am blue and grand. You are smelly diesels. You are yellow and stripy. Yellow and stripy is not narrator: Gordon sniffed snootily. Then he whooshed forward grandly, straight into diesel's flatbed. Gordon's buffer was bent. 
- Oh, the indignit 
narrator: THE DIESELS CHUCKLED And chortled. Then the dock manager arrived. 
- Gordon, you must deliver some engine parts to the diesel works. narrator: Gordon grunted. The diesels giggled. 
- Then you are to pick up more passengers here at the docks. 
narrator: SO GORDON Was uncoupled from the express. Later, gordon steamed snootily into the diesel works. 

[00:19:18]


- Engine parts coming through. 
narrator: GORDON WAS Far too busy being snooty to see the freight car on the tracks in front of him. Gordon hit the freight car with a smash and a bash. With a clang and a clatter, gordon's buffer crashed onto the tracks. 
- Bust my buffers. narrator: Den and dart were rprised. 
- I don't think that was meant to happen. 
- What he means is, you need fixing. 
both: WE'LL FIX YOU. narrator Gordon was surprised. 
- Diesels can't fix a steamie. That's impossible. Only steamies fisteamies. I must puff away. My pisto still pump, and my wheels still whir. Good-bye. narrator: And gordon steamed away without a buffer. But outside the diesel works, gordon met mavis. 
- Oh, my, gordon. What ever has happened to your buffer? You can't puff on without a buffer. 'S not safe. narrator: Gordon tried to grin. 
- I'm sure I'll be safe, mavis. 
- No, you won't, gordon. Chuff back at once. Den and dart will fix you in no time. 
narrator: GORDON DIDN'T WANT To chuff back, but mavis was stern. 
- Very well, mavis. 
narrator: AND GORDON HUFFED BACK To den and dart. 
- [chuckles] We thought you'd be back. 
- We've found just what you need. 
both: FOLLOW US. 
narrator: GORDON GRUNTED. 
- Come along, gordon. narrator: So gordid as he was told. In the shed, den and dart whirred with pride. 
- This is your new buffer. 
- What he means is, it'll be your buffer while we fix your old one. narrator: Gordon stuttered and stammered. There was a yellow and black stripy diesel buffer. 

[00:21:26]


- This is for diesels. 
- It's good. 
- It's grand. 
- It's a buffer. narrator: Gordon groaned. 
- Oh, the indignity. 
- Don't be silly, gordon. Good-bye. narrator: Gordon huffed huffily. 
- I was right. Diesels cannot fix steamies. I must go. narrator: And gordon steamed quickly away. But outside the diesel works, gordon met salty. 
- How de do, me heartie.

- I'll be fine. 
- An engine's not an engine without a buffer. Them's the rules of the railway. Chuff back quick, me heartie. narrator: So gordon grumped grumpily and chuffed back to den and dart. They were waiting with gorn's new buffer. 
- It's ready just for you. narrator: Gordon shuddered and juddered. 
- Oh, the indignity. 
narrator: LATER, Gordon huffed huffily away to the docks to pick up his waiting passengers. The yellow and black buffer was bold and bright and very like a diesel. 
- I shall pick up my passengers faster than fast. I hope the docks are quiet. Then no other engines will see me. narrator: But the docks weren't quiet. They were busy. There were lots of engines to see gordon with his yellow and black stripy diesel buffer. Diesel clattered over. 
- Honking horns, gordon. You're gordon the diesel now. 
[both snickering] narrator: Gordon felt terrible. 

[00:23:26]


- I'm not grand gordon. I'm yellow and stripy. I am gordon the diesel. narrator: Thomas puffed over. 
- What's the matter, gordon? 
- My buffer fell off at the diesel works. Den and dart gave me this while they fix my bright, shiny steamie buffer. narrator: Thomas was surprised. 
- Bubbling boilers, gordon. I didn't know diesels could fix steamies. That buffer means you can still chuff and puff. narrator: That made gordon stop huffing. 
- Bust my buffers. You're right. 
narrator: AND GORDON PUFFED Slowly away with his passengers. Gordon clickety-clacked along the tracks.

Wswall street urnal"/marist poll shows president barackeading mitt romney in ohio by six points among likely voters, and it shows president obama with a narrow lead in florida where the race stands at 49% to 47% among likely voters. We'll be talking more about ohio and the republican freak-out over polling analysis later in the program. Right now joining me at the table we have michael moynihan cultural editor for "newsweek" ilbeast, and bet stevenson, columnist for "bloomberg view" associate professor at the ford school university of michigan and former chief economist at the obama labor department, and mom to the 3-week-old oliver, congratulations, that's really awesome. All right, it has been five days since sandy came ashore on the east coast as a post-tropical cyclone, the exact location of landfall didn't much matter because it was a 1,000-mile wide storm. Least 109 people are said to ve died in the u.S. And another 60 were killed in the caribbean. As of this morning 2.9 million customers remain without power across 15 states and the washington, d.C. The economic losses are nearing $50 billion. Flooding of new york subways and commuter train tunnels and loss of business accounts for much of that estimate. With an election just a few days away the political media industrial complex brief ground to a halt and then somewhat awkwardly cranked back to life with mitt romney turning a campaign event into a relief rally. President obama heading back out on the trail and pundits growing more and more comfortable speculating consequences of the disaster. Local and area officials had to make practical decisions and give emergency briefings and address the anxiety of their constituents. Governor chris christie seemed to suggest he wasn't taking the election into consideration. 
>> Is there any possibility that governor romney may go to new jersey to tour some of the damage with you? 

[00:02:02]


>> I have no idea. Nor am the least bit concerned or interested. 
>> Right. 
>> I've got a job to do here in new jersey that's much bigger than presidential politics and i could care less about any of that stuff. The president was great last night. He said he would get it done. At 2:00 a.M. I got a call from fema to answer a couple of final questions and he signed the declaration this morning. I have to give the president great credit, he's been on the phone with me three times in the last 24 hours and anything that I've asked for he's gotten to me. I thank the president publicly for that. 'S done as far as I'm concerned a great job for new jersey. 
>> New york city mayor michael bloomberg last night canceled tomorrow's new york city marathon after the critics said the resources were needed elsewhere, after I tweeted about it. I can't help but think tt pushed him over the edge. He said it should not detract attention from the storm recovery and he made news on thursday when he endorsed barack obama for president saying that sandy brought the stakes of tuesday's election into sharp relief. I thought what happened this week and the interactions between the president and chris christy and michael bloomberg are really interesting. I thought the way we think about politics and disaster was brought into relief. And we're going to talk about the substance. We'll talk about the seawalls and floodwalls and climate change and what we have to do -- how we have to reconceptualize our society and think about disaster in the future but first I want to talk about the politics of it. Because I thought the response to chrissy's actions on the right and generally in the media t were fascinating. I -- maybe I'm alone in this. I didn't think he seemed to be doing anything out of the ordinary. It seemed to me like this was more or less politics as usual. That the president when there's a disaster-stricken area the president goes and the governor and they go look at the damage and even from different parties they put them aside for the moment. And people freaked out. And I think the freak-out to me highlighted how much there's been this norm created under republican party of just total implkable oition at all times so that christie seemed ke a betrayal. The other argument is tha christie really has been going out of his way to throw mitt romney under the bus. I'm curious what you think about it. 

[00:04:13]


>> I'll take a shot. You suggested the political media industrial complex ground to a halt. That's ridiculous. The political media industrial complex was whirling even as the storm was coming in. I heard everybody in all the campaigns talking about what impact is this going to have and so by the nature of it they were looking for something. And chris christie gave it to them. Now, a part of it is that chris christie loves the camera, right? He is the giuliani of this moment. He's doing press conferences. He's physically out there not sleeping, very present. But the key on that one is this is the keynote speaker of the republican national convention. It's not just any governor. He's one of the most known republicans in the country. He's the guy that was supposed to make the case for romney and forgot to mention him. And when he took that question, he could easily have said, look, you know, I think governor romney's got other things to . I'm pleased -- instead, you listen to that clip. It went on and on and on and it built toward a crescendo I think the president is doing a great job for new jersey. 
>> And chris christie also i would say not only the commencement speaker but the great hope of republicans, ann coulter wanted him and rupert murdoch wanted him back in the race and he tweeted christie has to come out hard for obama -- 
>> for romney. 
>> I'm sorry, for romney in the next few days or he's a disaster in the next four years. 
>> I think the thing about chris christie on the "fox and friends" things, that he's disingenuous, that it's stagey, he shouts down reporters in press conferences, I think what we see here, this is actually chris christie, this is the way that he is. When he believes the president is being attentive and doing a good job for the people of new jersey, he doesn't care and he's not going to mow-mow to people on fox or anyone. I was rather impressed. At the end of all this he did get a mention from bruce springsteen who he's a big fan of and he's actually said in a concert, this is true, and said the governor has -- 

[00:06:21]


>> someone said, some conservative on twitter said that's what this is all about! He said it wasn't about -- it's not about mitt romney or anything to get to obama. 
>> This is interesting thinking about why is it that the public doesn't -- the public would not tolerate a republican governor saying I am not going to accept money from the federal government to help get the lights back on. We will suffer through this as a state. 
>> Right. 
>> And eschew any help, people wouldn't stand for it. But they wl stand for it when the help is about something a little less immediate. If a republican governor said we're turning down this money to fix our schools or unemployment. 
>> Or to build high speed rail. 
>> Or high speed rail. 
>> Internet. 
>> When the republican governor turns that money down, people don't see the immediate consequences and they don't seem to react. But imagine what they would do if chris christie had stood up and said we're not taking obama's help on this? 
>> I think it's two things. I think that it's absolutely christie actually being who he is. I don't think that whole idea that he was being totally phony is fair. But I also think that christie has been the attack dog for president obama specifically and so he's kind of effusive praise seemed really shocking on the one hand but I think truth has been such a casualty when it comes to the way the republicans have run their political campaign and christy being the number one man for romney, you put those two things together and suddenly it feels like he's on this political campaign for president obama with literally days before the campaign. 
>> Right. I think that's partly because we have this kind of which side of you on feeling down the stretch. 
>> I agree with you, michael, about christie. I never thought he was staged. I thought when he yelled at teachers in town halls, he was being authentically jersey. I didn't think that was stage craft. I thought was being a jerk. Truly a jerk even, you know, even in a totally honest way. 
>> His compassion and his emotionality and even saying that this is not about politics right now, of course, it's always going to be about politics but even that point i think came from a very specific genuine place. He's an emotional politician. So, what he articulates comes from that very specific place. 

[00:08:36]


>> We live in a time where everybody's a pundit. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Right? The person -- no, they're better than most of us. But the person in the coffee shop, you know, wants to talk about -- especially right before an election. >>Totally. 
>> This is something that happens in america. Most americans unlike we of normal characters can shut off politics for a lot of the time. But if you're in the weekefore an election, everybody's going to look at it. 
>> That's right. 
>>> And thecinating thing is we think weeed to explain chris christie. We look to him and know he's a big republicannd all the dynamics and I think they saw him standing there saying what they wanted him to say. Especially at a point where polling shows, like, 80% of americans really would like to have a little bit of rapprochement and then to have berg come in the next day and say this thing tipped me. I'm voting for obama, this is a dynamic significant in our politics. 
>> What I think is fascinating, of course, one of the key arguments for barack obama in 2008, right, he was going to be the person that brought together red and blue and republicans have I think very wisely chosen a strategy of sort of constant implacable opposition, that has made it impossible for him to fulfill that promise. And the irnlny now is that mitt romney who spent most of the campaign and during the primary telling jokes about what a terrible place massachusetts was, bragging about all the vitos, saying this place is a sodomite hell that I come from and the democratic majority that he had to deal with as evidence that he's the person that can work across the aisle there's this fascinating campaign down the stretch about who could work best across the al. Betsy, you made an important role of government in these moments and that's the other subtext here and I want to talk about that and the ideological subtext. ??????

[00:13:43]


>>> You made a good point before going to break about what this highlights about the role of government and I think we tend to have certain scripts in the wake of disaster. First of all, I think there's this back-and-forth about not politicizing it, and i understand a certain impulse, right, which is that you want to not destroy feelings of social solidarity by basically turning people against each other over partisan lines. At the same time, disasters are inherently fundamentally political because they reveal the power relations of a society and the power relations of a society are what constitutes politics in that society. D you talked about the role of government. Obviously the role of government has been this kind of light motif throughout the campaign. "The new york times" wrote an editorial in the wake of a storm saying a big storm needs big governnt. I think there's a general feelings that these are the times we want the state to come in and do things and people have been pointing out this response mitt romney gave talking about fema, the federal emergency management agency, back in june during a republican debate. Take a look. 
>> Fema's aboo run out of money and there are some people that say do it's a case-by-case basis and some people are saying maybe we are learning a lesson that maybe the states should take on more of a role. What do you say to that? 
>> Absolutely. Anytime you have a chance to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further and send it back to the private sector, that's even better. We should take all of what we're doing on the federal level and saying what are the things we are doing we don't have to do and those things we have to stop doing. We're borrowing $1.6 trillion more than we're taking in. 
>> The romney campaign in customary fashion walked i backwards and said we're not sending fema to the states. Michael, as the libertarian at the tae, should he have come back and doubled down on this and said, yeah, fema, should be in the private sector of the states? 
>> Obviously back on his heels on this and it's not necessarily kind of a libertarian issue in a sense, after there was lot of anger about the quote circulating and the piece in the "atlantic" said,look, he's not trying to defund fema, you know, this idea of bringing it to the states and everything. Should he have doubled down? No. This is purely political calculation, I'm not saying -- 

[00:15:58]


>> I'm asking from a ideological perspective. 
>> I agree. Politically it was suicidal. 
>> In fact, what is fema, i don't know what that means. I'm actually a deeper ideological question which is my knee jerk liberal response to this which confirms my priors, right, which is we need the state to do this kind of thing, is that wrong? I genuinely want to know. 
>> No. Look, I think that there are an enormous number of problems with fema, one does not have to look very far online to look for people who would know this stuff very well and say this is a hugely dysfunctional organization for a number of reasons. Is the solution to that to bring it to the states? Look, I think that there's a very, very compelling case to be made for that. I don't think the argument, well, this is a guy t will take all this money and throw it out the window and, you know, good luck getting sort of charity and private companies to do it. I think it's a disingenuous argument. I think there is a smart, sensible argument to be made that on a local level people can pivot and respond to the crises in a better fashion. 
>> One thing about disasters you do want to start with the local level up and start with the front line people f the town sheriff and work your way up the federal government. 
>> That's how it happens anyway. 
>> That's how it happens anyway and it's the way it's structured. Having fema is all about risk pooling, right? The point is that certain areas will get hit by natural disasters mo than others and pool it out across the ud states. 
>> Some of those areas are poor. They don't have theresources. And so in a great big country where there are some very wealthy people who can pay some taxes, it's kind of a good idea to collect up that money in case where some place people don't have the resources. You know, this is a logic of government. But I will say that if we back up a little bit on this, disasters, like wars, like presidencies, like receptions, are big enough that we can all paint on them, right? 

[00:17:58]


>> Right. 
>> We can all put our picture on them. I looked at this thing, I'm a very pro-labor thing, my response is I'm watching union firefighters and union cops and union road crews up through the night, you know, sweating, bleeding, putting out fires, wading through water, union nurses carrying kids to safety, and I'm saying, you know, why does mitt romneyh these people. In fairness, that's not best how I look at it. It's you're going to look at it differently. And, you know, in a weird defense of mitt romney, in a weird defense of mitt romney, he was answering a deficit question there. He wasn't thinking about fema at all. 
>> Right. In fact, he tried to dodge it a little bit. 
>> I think that's really crucial because to me when i think about fema and disasters I'm absolutely confronted by these two americas,he katrina/fema reaction and the sandy/fema reaction and the reality is to argue there hasn't been a significant political response to the significance of fema by different governments and it's not split down party lines. It's simply not true. There was a really great article in "mother jones" that took you through -- 
>> the development of fema competence. 
>> Right. And who had headed fema and the way that presidents had appointed those fema heads were directly related to how they perceived their significance. So, for example, george bush actually allocated michael brown who was the former -- I just had to read this out, because I was just blown away. Michael brown who was the former commissioner of judges and stewards for the international arabian horse association, that's who headed fema. Clinton was the first -- was the first president to allocate the fema head who actually had experience -- 
>> disaster. 
>> -- Disaster management. It's not political. It's about poverty. It's about race. And when we think about disaster preparedness as well as recovery, the ways in which these two americas break down, you see that again and again and again. 
>> It's also I think the other point here is that it's something that will happen i think often is people on the left we get into this defensive crouch around the role of government and so we defend the states' actions in the abstract, but if you toefty activist who are part of common ground and katrina it was government bureaucracy who was their enemy. Anfolks on staten island are frustrated and angry and feeling they're not getting enough attention, the target of that anger is the government bureaucracy and you can't fall into the trap I think as a liberal saying, oh, the state in the abstract governmt has a role to play and not also be very clear-eyed about the failures of specific bureaucratic performance, right? 

[00:20:36]


>> I was going to come back to this idea you said risk pooling. 
>> Right. 
>> I think that that's a really important question because we have to ask ourselvesoes a storm like katrina or sandy, does it hit the united states -- 
>> right. 
>> -- Or does it hit new orleans or does it hit new york, does it hit a state or does it hit the united states? I think it hits the united states and that's why as a country we actually do need to chip in an send the resources to help clean up. And that' why I find the we can't afford to do this, we have one -- or borrowing $1.6 trillion to be indefensive because, of course, we got hit by a storm as a country, we have an obligation. But there's a second issue for the federal government which is can they play aetter role coordinating relief across the country. Getting national guard members to where they need to be, getting water where it needs to be, you know, the states certainly are the ones who should say what they need. 
>> Right. 
>> But are they in a position to actually coordinate where it should come from and how it should get there and I just don't think they are. 
>> I think we've been shown an example even with governor christie talking about the speed at which president obama reacted, because, of course, you think about katrina, you think about the slowness with which president bush reacted and speaking to that point, romney doesn't think there's a united states. He thinks of 47% are the folks in new orleans who don't deserve -- 
>> I don't know if that's a fair characterization. 
>> All right, but let me make my point, I think you say that but I think if you're living in the spaces, you're living with the legacy of katrina or in the ninth ward, you would absolutely not say that's an unfair argument because you're still living with the legacy with the kind of unfairness that made you a refugee in your own country. 
>> Do you know why you need federal government, you need a federal government because in some states there are governors that will not respond to some parts of their state and you need somebody from the outside that will -- 
>> or they might politicize or they don't get the help they need. 
>> To sort of agree you and against my own point in a way of sort of localizing these things is that, you know, george bu's disastrous performance in katrina is nobody denies, even republicans, but the local level performed disastrously, too, ray nagin, et cetera. 

[00:22:41]


>> That's an example. I think that's the point is that the united states, how do you coordinate a reaction. It started with the example of the biggest, you know, the president is the head of the biggest institution in the country. So, who you want institutionally rather than having individual americans respond are two different realities. It's two different americas. 
>> I want to turn ourention to climate change because i think that was a story that foisted itself on the political discussion this week I think for good actually in a way.

>>> my story of the week -- what's at stake? At about 8:00 p.M. On monday night the east-facing windows in my brooklyn apartment started to bubble and buckle inward in a deeply unsettling way. The wind howled and we thought it prudent to move ourselves away from the wall exposed to the elements. That one moment of sharp anxiety was as bad as things got. We were lucky. Our power never went out and my neighborhood is on high enough ground it wasn't flooded by the storm surge. There are a few downed trees that took out parked cars but that was about it. A few neighborhoods over a young couple were out walking their dog at some point that evening and they were struck by a falling tree and killed. They are two of the estimated 109 people who died due to the storm here in the u.S. A death toll that is mercifully lower than one might anticipate given the scale of the damage. Destruction is most evident here in new york city in staten island, in queens devastated coastal neighborhoods and in the powerless precincts of lower manhattan where cars roll through intersections without streetlights and commuters trundle over the bridging walking over an east river whose waters overflowed its banks filling the subway tunnels that connect the boroughs and rendering much of the system unusable. The mta chairman said new york subways have, quote, never faced a disaster as devastating. It's very rare when the subways in this city don't run. But there are some things simultaneously awfulnd exhilarating about those moments when normalcy is suspended. New yorkers will still tell you about the solidarity and fellowship they share with their neighbors on their stoops on the lightless nights of the 2003 blackout. Or the comfort and aid they found in each other as they fled through the streets on foot covered in dust away from the falling towers. Obviously the loss of life and intensity of trauma caused by sandy is nowhere near the scale of 9/11. But it's fair to say the city hasn't been this devastate since that september day. And as many unsung civil servants and first responders and utility workers labor tirelessly to get the city running again, I'm reminded that one of the raw truths of 9/11 is that the first thing a competent government must do is protect its citizens. It can't protect them from everything nor should it try but I think we all recognize amidst the horror of 9/11 we want our government first and foremost to keep us safe. The state cannot eliminate senseless death, but its duty is to reduce its likelihood. It's a conservative insight really the idea that government's job before all else is to keep its citizens secure, to protect them, that everything else comes after. And lefty that I am, I'm reminded in this moment that it contains an undeniable core truth -- and, yet, here we sit with a political system that could barely bring itself to acknowledge or discuss the tangible danger climate change poses to us, never mind undertake the massive sustained effort necessary to combat and adapt to it. Andrew cuomo as careful a politician as you'll see tried to note the elephant in the room without ever naming it. 

[00:29:32]


>> There has been a series of extreme weather incidents. Anyone that's -- that's not a political statement. That's a factual statement. Anyone who says there's not a dramatic change in weather patterns I think is denying reality. 
>> And his endorsement of president obama this week new york mayor michael bloomberg rote in 14 months two hurricanes have forced us to evacuate neighborhoods something our city government had never done before. If this is a trend, it is simply not sustainable. No, it's not sustainable. Things that can't go on don't. It's true, sandy was a freak storm, a bad confluence of a number of low probability events that could conceivably happened in some alternate climate that wasn't warming. But this climate, our climate, is warming, and as it does, low probability events like this will become more probable and more intense. Carbon emissions are trapping extra energy in our atmosphere and with extra energy come more extremes, higher sea levels, drier droughts, hotter heat waves and heavier, wetter storms. We need a crash program in this country right now to re-enginee the nation's infrastructure to cope with and prepare for the climate disruptions that we have already ensured with the carbon we've already put into the atmosphere. As well as an immediate, aggressive transformation of our energy production, economy, and society to reduce the amount of carbon we will put into the atmosphere in the future. This is as fundamental, as elemental as human endeavors get. The story of civilization is the long tale of crusaders for order battling the unceasing reality of chaos. And it is a kind of miracle that we have succeeded as much as we have, that airplanes fly through the air and roads plunge beneath the water and the entire teeming lattice work of human life exist in the ifold improbable places it does. But it's the grand irony that imposing this order on the world we've released millions of years of stored up carbon into the atmosphere which is now altering the climate and threatening the very monuments of civilization we so cherish. We absolutel it within us collectively to beat back the forces of chaos once again, but we must choose to do so. And the time for choosing is now.

>>> All right. Joining us at the table now is claus jacobs a research scientist at columbia university's earth site and eric clinenberger returning to the table, a professor of sociology at new york university. Claus, I wanted to have you here, because "new york times" ran a piece recently, and this is a headline, it says, climate change -- w york is lagging as seas and risks rise critics warn, it was about the fact that the city was exposed to increased risks as climate change brought sea level up. And it quotes you, a report that you did, in 2009. And this is your prediction about what would happen if there was a storm with a sufficiently high storm surge just a foot higher, I believe, than irene, just about. And you said, if the surge had been just that muc higher, subway tunnels would have flooded, segments of the fdr and roads along the hudson river would have turned into rivers and sections of the commuter rail system would have been impassable or bereft of power, the mostrable systems like the subway tunnels under the east rivers would have been unusable for nearly a month or longer at an economic loss of nearly $55 billion. This is I think eerily preshient. What are the circumstances under which you undertook this report talking about wha vulnerabiies of new york city were? 
>> Well, in 2009 first mayor bloomberg and later the state through its agency charged a group of scientists to look at the consequences of climate change and how new york city on the one hand and new york state on the other hand should adapt to it. As part of that study, we in the certa study, we were making a case study in which we had 100-year flood or storm surge hitting new york city. And with a lot of help of the engineering department students at columbia university, we came up with a very d analysis. And it showed that the subway tunnels would flood within 40 minutes and so on. It was eerily, incredibly true what happened four days ago. Right down to detail that the brooklyn battery tunnel would be entirely flooded, the queens midtown town only partly flooded. I mean, it's terrible to be right. The point is here that this is information that was available one to two years ago now. And it shows that just reducing scientific, technical result is not enough. 

[00:38:15]


>> Right. 
>> The political process has not taken notice of the information that we were charged to produce for them. 
>> And this is the fundamental issue that we have up and down this -- this issue specifically on climate but also disaster, right, eric? You can go back and you can read reports, and I did, reports about what would happen if a storm hit new orleans and a storm surge pushed over the levees and the problems that would happen in the ninth ward and the evacuation problems and everything down, down, down, down the line written two to three years before katrina actually happened and the political infrastructure did not make the governing choices that would have prevented it. 
>> We act as if we have a will not to know about these dangers, and when we're warned of them, we freak out. We don't know what to do. We get overwhelmed and scared. We've just gone through three presidential debates in which the concept of climate change never came up once. This was mother nature speaking back and saying, I will be heard. You have something to reckon with. Unfortunately we now live in a moment where this debate will become escapable. And the silver lining that could come out of this is that this could be the kind of event or historic experience that becomes a turning point, that makes a conversation about climate change a fundamental part about -- of conversations about security and governance. 
>> One of other things we talk about with climate and climate mittation and carbon tax and one of the things that's highlighted in parallel to that we also have to take a hard look at how we are engineering our cities and creating a kind of resiliency in the massive population centers. I want to talk about how we need to be thinking about that right after we take this quick break. Surprises him. Morning starts in high spirits, but there's a growing pain in his lower back.

It means that coastal areas, everything that is luckily five feet plus whatever tides you have higher, needs to be looked at it from a land use or urban planning use. So, either we protect entire cities like new orleans, right, and then having to say later on something about that because i think if you build barriers for new york city, you have to have an exit strategy because those barriers will not last forever with rising sea level. 

[00:44:38]


>> Grim. 
>> Which means we have to do something behind the barriers anyhow to protect us just like new orleans was unprepared when the barriers failed. So, we have to prepare for what we do when the barriers fail. 
>> Preparing for failure is a huge part of disaster preparation. It's one of the things that's amazing in your boo about the heat wave is that you begin to see systems fail. The cell phone network gets overused and water doesn't work in high-rises. How do you prepare for failure? 
>> Well, you have to prepare for systems to be resilient whi means you need to invest in infrastructure, you need to update the grid, for instance. Every time there's a heat wave in this country every summer the power goes out and in some cases for days. One barometer to the extent to which climate change is increasing the extreme events, i find myself getting called more and more every year because thee events are regular. You also need to build up structures to provide support and care. Tooften our conversations about these issues are exclusively engineering and physical science kinds of questions. Those matter, no doubt. They're fundamental, but there's a social dimension to this as well, which neighborhoods are affected, which individual people are affected, and it's predictable. 
>> Fascinating, zone evacuated, low-lying residents there were twice as likely to be residents of. 
>>> I want to bring in ed markey, co-sponsor of the only climate bill to ever pass the chamber of congress. Congressman, what is your reaction to the stunning absence of this issue that you worked so hardand labored over and ground out a large bill with tons of technical details to carve votes on and it's now disappeared from the political conversation? 
>> Well,$ I think that -- I think that mother nature decided that $ she was going to inject it into this election. If it wasn't going to be raised $ in any of the debates, then she was going to find a way of having this be discussed. And so this election for next $ tuesday is now framed. It's mother nature versus the $ unrestrained use of oil and coal$ and other polluting sources. I think the public now sees what the consequences are of having $ this issue just be ignored. It's no longer just some abstract issue that might be affecting the arctic. What's happening in the$ arctic is now$ affecting the weather $ here on the east coast and all $ across the united states. And so it's now an issue. And I think that it's really got mitt romney on the defensive, as he should be, because the mitt romney who was the governor of $ massachusetts, my home state, he believed in climate science, but the mitt romney that runs for the republican nomination for president in 2012, he can't believe in climate science, he has to make jokes about it in order to get the nomination of one of the most histocal parties of our country's history and that's a sad state of scientific affairs. >>Or bloomberg the key to the endorsement was the position on climate chang and he talked about the choices being one candidate that sees climate change as an urgent problem that th atens our problem, one does not. I want our president to place risk management above politics, president clinton and president reagan found success while their parties parties, and he can too. President obama has not done a lot to talk about climate on the campaign trail. It's probably going to be a republican house. I believe the stakes in this election are between one candidate who accepts of the science of global warming and one who edges on it. But what is the real difference between the policy that we can see, convince me that if I'm a climate voter that my vote is going to matter on tuesday. 

[00:48:40]


>> Oh, my goodness. Mitt romney says that he's going to roll back the requirement $ that the fuel economy standards of the vehicles which we drive go to 54.5 miles per gallon by $ the year 2026. If he rolls that back, that's equal to 6 billion metric tons of co 2 going up into the atmosphere, that's one whole year of$ total co 2 to the united states. P.M. Obama is committed to$ going forward with it, that's all of the oil we$ import from the persian gulf on a daily basis. On december 31st of this year $ romney said he'll allow all the wind tax breaks to expire so the wind industry is going to $ collapse in our country even though 12,000 new megawatts of wind have been installed in the $ united states this year alone. And barack obama says he's going to extend them and give the same$ kind of breaks to solar going out into the future.$ the president's epa is looking $ at the regulation of green house gases and mitt romney is saying, absolutely not. So, issue after issue, one after another, there is a big dividing line between these two people, and for anyone who thinks that $ there will be no difference if they elect one or the other on $ this issue, they could not be more wrong. Okay? This is a$ stark difference and $ it's going to actually impact how many people$ in the future die, how many people in the future have their lives changed unalterably by climate change here in the united states, not around the world, here in our country.

[00:53:48]


>> That was mitt romney pausing for laughter in talking about the sea level rise at the rnc which is a really shocking moment to me. Esther, you had a question you wanted to ask congressman markey. 
>> I did. Listening to this I think one of the big challenges is the degree to which the science has become so politicized, that evident matters less than which party politician is articulating what may happen with climate change. But when I hear you talk about on a sunny day in 2100 we'llee the seas and the storm rise, i literally hear a hollywood movie featuring will smith and tom cruise. Do you know what I mean, there's an element on the ground it's become so politicized, how does that move. Events matter because they create connection and it humanizes something that has felt abstract and it felt like little due respect to you that it doesn't affect the majority of people, so there isn't the connection. What sandy does is make it immediate, specific, direct and targeted. So, I want to ask the congressman and you about the evidence shows you knew this was going to happen and so, therefore, what happens in 2100 is specific as well, but how do you move beyond the politics so that people pressure makes it more potential legislation? 
>> Congressman, yeah, is there any hope of forward movement in, say, a house dominated by the republican party for political movement on this? 
>> Look it, congress is a stimulus response institution. There's nothing more stimulating than watching night after night, day after day, millions of people paralyzed along the east coast. This is going to have the same impact that 9/11 had on how we protect ourselves here domestically. It will have the same impact that the bp oil spill had in ensuring that we don't ever again have the same lax safety standards and oil drilling off our coastline. This is a game changer. And I agree with what the gentleman said, because this is no longer just a hollywood blockbuster the day after tomorrow. This is now a blockbuster storm which actually hit. So, the day after tomorrow is now today. It's in new york. It's in n jersey. It's in connecticut, and weem are watching this each day. And there won't be any jokes about climate change again. There won't be any dismissal of this again. It won't stop the oil industry, it won't stop the coal industry from trying to block legislation. But I think moderate republicans in the congress above the mason-dixon line are never again going to be allowed to just laugh along with these jokesters from coal country and pretending that climate change is not real.

[00:59:42]


>>> Good morning from new york, I'm chris hayes here with michael moynihan from the daily beast, klaus jacob from columbia university, eric klinberg from nyu and esther armah. We're talking about the ways in which the sandy disaster has inserted climate into a political debate that had failed to mention it and also the broader question about how we create politics of accountability and governance mechanisms that prepare us for the resiliency we'll need in the coming era. 
>> We need to retrofit our cities, let's face it. We see disaster after disaster, yefter year, cities that your unable to withstand the pressures of this new planet we live on, the ecosystem is different, the environment is different, and we will fundamentally need to rebuild at some level. Now, we are already investing tens of billions of dollars in the project of homeland security. We have tried to protect ourselves from terrorism. We have not done a very good job protecting ourselves from these completely predictable routine events. And I think at a minimum we need have a conversation about how redistrict homeland security so that this becomes an agency that actually safeguards us. 
>> Well, this brings up a good point. "A," this point that I'm obsessed with and I ride the hobbyhorse on the show all the time and we have the argument, government good or bad, bureaucracy, good or bad, and bureaucratic performance exists on the massive spectrum. Some really, really work and some are dysfunctional disasters, right? And the question is how do we ve them and get good governance at ourinstitutions. Ed markey said this will be for climate for what 9/11 changed our terrorism policy, and I'm not sure that what the -- what we built -- my inner libertarian is saying uh-oh, and I suspect you feel the same way. 
>> We were talking about this at the break. There is a libertarian argument or a smaller government argument to be made that we should prepare ourselves better for this, because, you know, people can look up robert hicks to look at what happened during wartimes and disasters, if you do fear the size and scope of government growing and just the lig lumbering agencies that don't perform particularly well, they tend to come into existence after major catastrophic events, and this happened after 9/11 and you won't find a libertarian to be a full-throated defender of the department of homeland security, for instance. And that's one of the worries and one of the ways that infrastructure to prevent this type of disaster is important. 

[01:02:17]


>> Is there anyone that believes that the private sector at this moment is capable doing the long-term planning and strategizing that it will take to deal with the threat of climate change and retrofitting cities? I think one of the issues here is that government is the only kind of institution we have that can think about these things over the long term. We have the private sector acting in exceedingly short term manners. 
>> You disagree? 
>> Look, scientists and even engineers thinking about that all the time, and mak statements often they come out as a very inconvenient truth. And the question is, how does the public respond to that inconvenient truth. The real major point here is, for instance, look at fema again, there are two tasks to fema. One is to respond after disasters. But the other they have neglected since clinton is to mitigate, to reduce the risk in the first place. And fema has been gutted from that task. And now we see the effects. 
>> This is stats that come from a political science journal article, disaster spending since 1988, the amount of money that the u.S. Spent on disaster relief has increased 13 times while the amount of spending on disaster preparedness has been flat. 
>> Or reduced. 
>> Or reduced. What we have is the perverse political incentive, what happens politically if there's a politician and there's a disaster, you're on the news every day doing disaster relief and that's when all the incentives to turn on the spigots and make the money flow, I'm not saying that's a bad thing. We don't have the same incentives to prevent the disaster from happening in the first place because what's the political gain from that? 
>> You are more cynical than i am. 
>> We need to place it in context as well, let's remember over the last several years of fiscal austerity, we've been cutting back programs at the local and state levels some fundamental programs that are for the protection of most vulnerable people, services for home care, for health care, for transportation, the kinds of things that we don't perceive on an ordinary level, that we don't discuss very much in the media but that actually produce resilience in communities, so when you see the numbers from fema in some ways they speak for the politics of austerity and i can tell you spending a lot of time with the obama disaster team they are acty worki on politics of resilience which is impressive and imaginative. 

[01:04:56]


>> And the padigm that disasteamplify existing stresses in society. So, what they bring out is all our fallacies, okay? 
>> Go ahead, please. 
>> I was going to say the trouble with that whole issue about the most vulnerable in society who are impacted is that that has helped fuel the political partisan nature of how we think about preparedness and who is going to be prepared. I think what sandy succeeds in doing because it impacted the financial district -- 
>> equal opportunity disaster. 
>> It literally is and you need in terms of the politics how we deal with this issue, you needed an equal opportunity disaster in order to bring a much broader section of theulous to bring behind the science. We were talking at the break that with katrina there was an injection of action but there was a real element of shame and that shame silenced some of the action. The thing about sandy is it impacts republican land, it impacts wall street specifically, my radio station is right on wall street and we ended up under ten feet of water and that conversation helped change the politics as well as the broader people that were impacted by sandy. 
>> I think it's geographic more than anything else. The fact that it hit new york and all of us, you know, live in new york and we also -- 
>> the media center of the country. 
>> If you notice one -- 
>> the financial center. 
>> If you notice one small thing is that staten island has been struggling, you know, unbelievably in the past -- 
>> half the casualties. >>Alf the casualties on staten island, no power, no water. People might have seen this video but a woman pleading with chuck schumer saying we need relief here. And the interesting thing about this is in the kind of media narrative we've heardut staten island and we've heard about even -- people said to me, you know, you and I both live in brooklyn. Brooklyn's fine. Coney island is not fine. I think that this an interesting thing, the geographic thing, i have power and staten island has not been part -- really part of the conversation and I hate to say this but until it's really been politicized, but there's been some failures happening and this is becoming a much more political issue and that's when staten island comes up. 

[01:07:09]


>> Staten island, I want to talk about it for a second, one of my dearest friends is from staten island, we were e-mailing back and forth, I love you, megan, and she was just saying staten island has a strained relationship with the boroughs, it voted to secede in 1997. There are people there who are really suffering right now and going through a lot and one of the things she pointed out there's two hospitals on staten island for half a million people. When the storm hit all the bridges shut down and one of the hospitals, staten island university hospital on the water basically was shut down immediately, so during the storm there's one hospital for 500,000 people on an island and that gets to your point about the broader foundation of resiliency is fundamentally the kind of public services and infrastructure and basic level of social resiliency we have before the disaster even hits, klaus? 
>> Well, the private sector cannot do the planning. They plan for themselves. Not for the public for the infrastructure. And that's what we really have to understand. We need good, informed government that can have the resources which means as taxpayers we have to pitch in. 
>> I'm glad to hear you say that because I thought we were disagreeing about that. But, look, the great symbol of this for those of us who are in lower manhattan who had no power for days, the power came on at 4:30 this morning was to see the glistening tower of goldman sachs downtown where the power was there. They had planned for the company, that's what private sector organizations tend to do. Who is going to plan for the collective? Not just new york city but the collective in this country. 
>> I want to push back slightly on this. 
>> Please. 
>> Yeah, here's the thing i think we set up the false binary when we're talking about sort of free market stuff or limited government people. You know, there is a tendency to conflate libertarian ideas or maybe even conservative ideas which I don't speak for but with an a anarchy. The mitt romney quote that we should put it back to the states. There are people, but I don't think there's a big movement of people that wants to get the government entirely out of the business of preparing for disaster. There's a lot of people that made the argument in katrina that walmart, there's a number of people wrote about this, a few studies about this, that pivoted really fast and provided water. But I don't think anyone would seriously suggest that walmart -- of course, you can, klaus.

[01:12:51]


>>> all right. We're talking about climate change and disaster and the politics thereof and, klaus, you had something you wanted to say to michael. 
>> Well, michael, I heard probably the word libertarian 20 or 30 times. 
>> Yes. 
>> Honestly, I'm sick and tired of it. 
>> Me saying it or chris saying it? 
>> In general. 
>> In general, okay. 
>> The reason is this is a disaster and we shouldn't introduce ideoies into this. We have to think about what's the reality out in the street and those who are really affected by it right now, they couldn't care less about those words. And what is needed is right now response of the first responders, response by the public, yes, by government, and ultimately by the society large. 
>> Let me really defend michael for a second. Let me jump in on your side -- 
>> can I jump in response now? 
>> Yeah. 
>> It is a political issue. It is a politicized issue and we're talking, you know, in the context of what the right solutions are, and I just want to say and be very, very sort of strident about this is that nobody has a monopoly on injecting politics into an issue that should be politicized like benghazi, it's a political issue. We have the bloomberg "business week" cover, I have the thing on huffington post sandy has, in fact, brought together a trifecta progressive policy vindication. I have no problem with people saying that. We have to talk about these issues from a political perspective because the solutions in the future are political and our politicians, ed markey, and everybody else have to fix this thing. 
>> I agree with it completely and I think in terms of the ideological point I tend to be skeptical of people wanting to get rid of ideology because i think it infuses everything. The point michael is making which I think is a good one for liberals to hear is that the caricature version of libertarianism where the government doesn't do anything, I think what you were saying there's a role -- you can call yourself a libertarian and still believe in disaster relief. From the state and that's an important point to hear. The other thing I want to say to you, eric and klaus, and this gets to the idea of the seagat people say one way to protect -- one way we can protect new york is to build some seagates, they do it in -- 

[01:15:14]


>> seawalls. 
>> They do it in amsterdam. It would be -- I think we have an animation of a dutch firm which drew up an animation of what this would look like. Basically you have ships coming through d then, you know, they can pass and we can have ship traffic in the verrazano-narrows when the time comes and there's a huge storm surge, you see the walls sort of come together there and they go up in this sort of sci-fi-esque kind of fashion. And one of the things I want to say here is, you know, when we think about the army corps of engineers, right, that's the state, that's the government. And they have this public role. And they have been disastrously dysfunctional in all kinds of ways, right? There are the levees that they built and tested in new orleans didn't work when they should of. There are all sort of reasons that t shipping channel called mr. Go in new orleans was creating a massive point of storm surge at the heart of new orleans and they ignored the warnings and their own reports about dredging. My questn to you if we do put money up there and commit resources to it and we have a dhs-type thing what assures me that we'll have abetter results than we have from, say, the army corps of engineers? 
>> I t here the key point is to return to what you said before the kind of peoplee use to lead the agencies. I think there's a stark choice for americans to make in the elections this tuesday, you know, do you believe that a particular candidate can actually make good decisions about who to lead organizations like this, when clinton was president, he put james lee witt in charge of fema and by all accounts on the left and the right, he did a tremendous job of revitalizing the organization, to make it work, to protect americans. When bush took over as president, he put michael brown in fema and we all know the story, it was ludicrous to see michael brown criticizing president obama today for reacting. I mean, my goodness! 
>> Right. 
>> So I think that we can't guarantee that any particular agency will work perfectly but we do have to think about which leader is going to put in position people who can act effectively, who will respect the professional workers and government who do such a good job, it was important to hear john nichols talking earlier about the laborers who come out to putting their own lives at risk in situations like this, you know, we need to maintain support for this. And I want to be clear that over the last 15 years, we have seen republican administrations eviscerate the professional workers in federal agencies, we have seen republican governors eviscerate state agencies, and in myiew that's what makes us less resilient and more vulnerable. 

[01:17:44]


>> I just want to say because i think the point that you make picks up this idea that you say that nobody really seriously takes their idea of lessening government a serious point. 
>> I don't mean lessening, i mean privaing the relief to the disaster victims. 
>> The way the republicans deal the head of fema and completely ignoring the importance of that role and being willing to institute somebody who has absolutely no experience and cannot do the job signifies how willing a republican government is to completely negate the importance- 
>> that's an ideological point and then there's an actual sort of partisan record point about whether you care enough to think that these functions are important. 
>> Look, the bush administration's record on this -- 
>> speaks for itself. 
>> -- Indefensible. But I wanted to ask eric and klaus a question, this sort of conversation about money and about, you know, how much money is being sort of allocated for this stuff that's been cut, we have two studies we talked about, one very interesting thing that klaus wrote in 2009 and you had mentioned a few that had kind of rasputin-like way said this is going to happen in new orleans, too. It doesn't strike me and this is actually a question that this is a lack of money. It wasn't as if these projects had started and they ran out of money or the funding was cut. Is it -- am I wrong in thinking that this stuff was never reacted to at all? 
>> Hold that thought I want you to answer after a quick break. ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ??????

>>> klaus, micel asked you a question about resources and preparation, and you had something to say about new orleans and the -- 
>> well, let's take new orleans. Katrina cost roughly $100 billion. The u.S. Army corps of engineers spent I think on the order of $15 billion after the storm to fix the problem. It would have taken maybe $8 billion to $10 billion or something like that to fix it before the problem. For every $1 that you spend ahead of disaster protecting against disaster has been on average nationwide shown to save you $4 of not-incurred losses. 
>> Right. 
>> In new orleans it would be a 10-1 benefit cost. 
>> I should also say there are some people and hascherrer is one of them and say it's still not fixed. 
>> And you have to think about it because we should not fall into the trap what we are in new orleans. So, there's the discussion about barriers. I think all options are right now on the table. What we have to do is spending money so engineers, not levees, but engineers can go through the options and price them out and then see for how long that is od. 
>> I just want to intervene, again, on the political issue here which is that the republican party has been against science and not just environmental science and climate science but the science of engineering, the science of evolution, I mean, this touches something very deep in our political debate right now, and we are at a moment where we need innoive investments in scientific research. We need to think about how to rebuild cities. We need to invest in smart infrastructure. And this is part of t political sion that americans have toe on tuesday. 

[01:24:27]


>> Let me say, thoug science is necessary but not sufficient for these decisions. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Science doesn't tell you what you do. We're still a democratic society. 
>> We have options. 
>> Options. 
>> Right. 
>> And the political process has to decide which way to go. 
>> All right. Klaus jacob from columbia university who wrote an incredibly prescient report about what would happen to new york during a storm surge and was unfortunately borne out this week. It was great to have you at the table. Thank you. 
>> Thank you for your work and thank you for being here.

>>> Mitt romney asking voters what do you want, just tell me, I'll tell you. President obama's revile of general motors and chrysler which in all likelihood would have been liquidated had his administration not kept them above water with a government-led rescue in 2009 is pretty popular in ohio. Popularity is an obstacle to mitt romney who opposed a key part of the rescue when initiated by the bush administration and now finds himself with a stubborn polling deficit in a state he more or less has to win to win the presidency. So, the romney campaig escalatetheir attempts to rewrite the history of the auto rescue and are now simply making things up about the current auto industry that exists today. They claim that president obama sold chrysler to italians who plan to build jeeps in china. 
>> Who will do more for the auto industry? Not barack oma, fact checkers confirm his attacks on mitt romney are false. The truth? Mitt romney has a plan to help the auto industry. He's supported by lee iacocca and "the detroit news." Obama took gm into bankruptcy and sold chrysler to italians who are going to build jeeps in china. Mitt romney will fight for every american job. 
>> I'm mitt romney and i approved this messe. 
>> The ad is aggressively misleading so much so that it caused panic calls from the ohio workers at chrysler jeep plants who feared their jobs are being outsourced and frommed gm and chrysler to set the record straight. The ceo of chrysler wrote an op-ed saying I feel obliged to restate our position. Jeep production will not be moved from the united states to chi that. Jeep assembly lines will remain in operation in the united states and will create the backbone of the brand. There was thisponse later in the day from gm spokesman in "the detroit free press" we've cleared some parallel universe during the last few days not of campaign politics at its cynical worst wil diminish our jobs of jobs in the u.S. And the obama campaign worked up their own response ad and the president rebutted mromney directly. 

[01:30:23]


>> You've got folks who work at the jeep plant who have been calling thei employers worried, asking is this true, are our jobs being shipped to china? And the reason they're making these calls is because governor romney's been running an ad that says so. Except it's not true. Everybody knows it's not true. The car companies themselves had told governor romney to knock it off. I know, you know, we're close to an election, but this isn't a game. These are people's jobs. These are people's lives. 
>> Back with us at the table now john nichols my colleague at the "nation" magazine and betsey stevenson, great to have you back. I should note one small technicality, right, which is they are -- jeep is going to do -- open a factory to produce jeeps in china for the chinese market. So, the point is that they are not moving jobs. There's not outsourcing, they are opening a new facto in china to produce jeeps for the chinese market and I should note this, this is something i learned going to china which is a fun and interesting fact, i think, chinese consumers love american cars. 
>> Yep. 
>> Love american cars. American cars have hugely high status in chinand so american carmakers are very excited about the chinese market to make that point. John, what role is this alto question playing in the politics out there? You've been reporting in that region of the country for years. 
>> It's huge. I mean, it's giant, because the american auto industry when it got going, you know, they started in detroit, it's true. But then they kind of moved out in spokes down to toledo, over to lordstown, across the lake to kenosha, down to indiana. The fact of the matter is there are very few ves in america that are so broadly spread through regions. Now, the way that most of our media covers it, it's just michigan, right? The fact of the matter is, identify was the editor "the toledo blade" for many years, our line always was when michigan gets a cold, toledo's got pneumonia. This is in many ways auto is as big or bigger issue in ohio for a whole bunch of reasons. And the fascinating thing about this is, this is an intentional strategy by mitt romney. It is one of the most remarkable things I've ever seen in politics and I've covered a lot of politics. He went to ohio and he said, i read in bloomberg that they're going to shim your jobs -- he said it straight on. And move it all over. And then they immediately called out. And chrysler -- at fiat, chrysler said this would take a circus acrobat to read the article that way. That's when you shut down. No. Then they go up with an ad saying it. Then they get called out by the head of fiat. And then they get called out by gm. Then they go up with a radio ad that is even more aggressive, and then paul ryan goes out on the trail and goes back to romney and romney's initial arguments about they're shipping stuff over and totally trashing the auto bailout without ever mentioning that paul ryan voted for the auto bailout. It is surreal and I have to tell you "the toledo blade" my old paper, front page stories each day about this isn't true, how are people responding. I think that when the history of this campaign is written, there's going to be a chapter on this and it's going to be mitt romney's -- I mean, it is a high bar, mitt romney's dumbest move. 

[01:33:55]


>> Betsey, can you adjudicate a little bit this dispute about what happened in auto in terms of mitt romney's contention that he was basly for the policy that ended up happening even though he clearly was intervening in the debate to make sure that policy didn't happen. 
>> Well, I think he wasn't for the bailout. I don't think anyone thinks he was. He's on record saying he wasn't. 
>> Right. 
>> But to be fair to him, there were a lot of economists who said -- 
>> yes. 
>> -- This is private sector business, if they can't make it, we need to let them go belly up. There were other people who said, look, we're facing the biggest credit crisis this country has faced since the great depression. They can't borrow the money they need, should we let them go bankrupt because they are in this kind of problem when the entire country's financial situation -- financial industry is having this kind of problem. And that's -- I think it was, you know, a legitimate decision to say we're going to lend them that money. Not everybody supported it, though, and romney didn't. 
>> I want to bring in bruce baumauer from the automakers local 12 which represents jee makers in the plant in toledo, ohio. I want to hear what you're making of all the back-and-forth 
>> it's been quite a week for us you can imagine when the initial remark was made that they were transferring all jeep production over to china. I got in the offices the next morning, I had people in there. I had three generations. I had a woman, her father, and her son who all work at the plant who are in -- she was in tears thinking that there was some truth to that, so it's pretty unsettling for a day or two, but then the ceo came out and squashed that, and we also reminded people that the nothing new about us building jeeps in china. We built jeeps in china -- actually, I worked for american motors in 1979 when they owned jeep corporation and they negotiated in '79 to deal with beijing, which created a company called beijing jeep, and we opened up that plant in 1984. 
>> That's amazing that's, of course, george romney's -- that's old mitt romney's father's old company and it was a pioneer in chinese production back in 1979. 

[01:36:05]


>> Exactly. 
>> I want to hear more about how this is playing out politically and how you understand the stakes of this on tuesday right after we take this break. ] Medicare?

[ Male Announcer ] WHEN YOU COMBINE CREAMY Velveeta with zesty rotel tomatoes and green chilies, you get a bowl of queso that makes even this get-together better. 
>>> All right. Bruce, I want you to tell me if from the outside the basic political contours of this are the auto rescue has been the key issue in the fact that mitt romney has been unable to pull even or pull ahead of president obama is outperforming among certain demographics white men, for instance, is that basic assumption I think we have in the national political press largely accurate? Is that really what it's about? 
>> I think it is. I think the auto recovery has -- the toledo piece of the auto recovery had a monumental success, and the whole northern part of ohio recognizes the importance of that, and I think this was annest, a desperate effort, quite frankly, to discredit that monumental success. 
>> John, you talked about the ways in which and I think is a really interesting part of this, I don't think people understand how much the productive capacity of auto even during normal times is constantly expanding and contracting. So, people are extremely attuned to where sales are going and what's happening because ships will be cut back and places will be furloughed and you'll be rehired in, so people had a real ear for when someone says something on the campaign trail, like, they're closing down your plant. 
>> Well, bruce works with a local -- I used to know when i was in toledo a guy named oscar bunch who was the head of the local there before bruce and oscar, great trade unionist, used to say that my people in the plant have been through so many cutbacks, so many layoffs, so many closings many bumped into other plants that closed because can do it in the uaw plan, and in toledo when plant after plant after plant closed and they develop an ear, and when they hear official -- and we say that politicians lie, when they hear somebody official that they don't think is going to lie about it, it is heard. I've heard steelworker say to me that one of their genuine fears you put stuff like this out, there are folks who think of suicide, think of, you know, really terrible, terrible things. I think bruce will back that up, that there are people whose lives are s wrapped up in having this work in towns that don't have a lot of other options, you play with this kind of stuff, you play politics with this, you're in a dangerous game. 

[01:41:42]


>> Bruce? 
>> I think actually that's what happened, I think it backfired when the comments first came out last weekend there was that real fear throughout the community for two or three days. But now that it's been cleaned out by a lot of different sources, it's turned into a different thing. All I'm hearing now from my members, we had a big rally yesterday about 350 people and everybody thought it was pretty pitiful from somebody who wants to be the commander in chief to try to put that scare into citizens. 
>> Bruce, can I ask you this question -- 
>> yeah, please go ahead. 
>> Go ahead. I just want to tell you we've had the entire international media on toledo this entire week around town. They saw the construction cranes going up and all the -- we're doing a half a billion dollar expansion on the jeep facility right now so that we can improve our production capabilities. We're working two shifts right now of ten hours each, six days a week and we can't even meet the demand for the jeep wrangler and we're hiring right now. We're processing 1150 new applicants. I'm not talking about folks that are coming back from the recovery. We've got all those people back. 1150 brand-new jobs that will be working in the jeep plant for the first time in their careers, when they see that going on, the international media, saw the cranes and the expansions going on, they kind of scratched their head on that comment. 
>> I just wanted to say -- 
>> I'm sorry, you had a estion. 
>> Let's come back and actually talk about the bailout was a success, right? We lent them money, and I think we need to give credit to the autoworkers. We need to give credit to, you know, the adminiration, you know, gm, chrysler, they pulled this -- the got this last chance. They saw it was the last chance and they really restructured and put that money to good use. That's why they paid back their loans. They added jobs. We've added since they hit bottom in 2009 we've added 250,000 jobs in the auto industry in the united states, including parts and manufacturing -- you know, including small parts. But that has been the success, and we have to accept that. Trying to tear that down it's just not factually correct. 

[01:43:43]


>> Here's my question and this goes to you, bruce, I was talking to someone in finance yesterday who was involved in watching this process unfold from the financial perspective in terms of making bets on where the stock was going to go and how creditors were going to be worked through in the managed bankruptcy. And one of t things that was interesting is learning about the way that the auto business works and the fact that it is very exposed to crisis. It doesn't have a lot of resiliency built into it because of actually the way they have set up the business. And so my question to you is, before we declare this a success, has the industry come out of it with more resilience to a future crisis or future downturn than it had going in? 
>> I think -- I think that was key really to the autotive recovery that president obama negotiated and worked out with the companies. It wasn't just a loan itself, but it was the restructuring of the labor agreements, the whole cost structure. Our cost structures are now in line with all of our competitors and it bodes well for future success, and the other piece of it was the ceo and he's brought in some technology to us that we never had before. Especially in terms of fuel efficiency and that I told you about the half a billion dollar expansion. That's going to build vehicles that we're going to build that are for global consumption, not just for u.S. Or northern american but global consumption. So, we'll have those, you know -- if one market is soft and one market's strong we'll have various, a variety of different products and we'll be sending them to different markets all over the world. 
>> You got to chuckle when, you know, sergio marchione is commenting on a plant in toledo. That's globalization for you. Bruce baumhower, president of local autoworkers number 12 in ohio, thanks so much for joining us. 
>> Thank you. 
>>> What do we know now that we didn't know last week? I invest in what I know. I turned 65 last week. I'm getting married. Planning a life. There are risks, sure. But, there's no reward without it.

[01:46:37]


[ Male Announcer ] TASTE IT AND DESCRIBE The indescribable. Could've had a v8. 

[01:48:39]


>>> All right. So what do we know that we didn't know last week? We got another tip on another ceo asking his employees to vote for mitt romney, we'll bring that to you tomorrow. What we know now is that the brother of michigan republican congressional candidate thinks of his family member's candidacy, quote, I've never met anyone in my life who is conniving and dishontest as this guy he told a local reporter, he's by brother so it's hard to talk about this, but I believe if he's elected he'll eventually serve time in prison. We know amazingly that he's favored to win the race for the seat vacated by odd bawl REPUBLICAN thaddeus McCotter. We know that kirry'sehector ral strength comes either in spite of or stranger yet still in spite of his career as sant to impersonator or reindeer farmer. Court documents reported during the campaign saying problem figuring out which one I really am, santa claus or kerry bentivolio. The voters seem to have eccentric taste in representatives. 
>>> We now know what we didn't know about todd aiken. The national republican party sought to salvage its shrinking image with women by distancing themselves from him and that meant yanking their dollars. In a spending period that won't be subject to transparency until after the election is over, it turns out the republican party has opened the funding spigot to congressman aiken. He is launching a nearly $700,000 ad funded in part by a national republican committee. The rnc says it is not them. They have said the nrc would not be funding aiken has for days declined to comment. In you donated to the nrc, because you thought yo money would not help put people like todd aiken in the senate, it looks like you have been had. 

[01:50:41]


>>> We know another realm in which bmoney can shape the public discourse. The university of wyoming took down logs and coal. They said it had to come down because of water damage. As wyoming public radio energy said energy makers and state lawmakers told the school to get rid of it. Marion lewis said, what kind of crap is this? It was the kind of crap coal companies don't want you thinking about. If coal companies don't think you should be thinking about an issue, you should definitely be thinking about it. I want to find out what my guests know that they didn't know at the beginning of the week. Mr. Moynahan? 
>> I know quite a bit after the orm, which was enlightening. I did a bit of reporting aut some of the first responders. What I didn't know is that in all of this coverage, there was a number of very, very heroic people, in specilly the 60th precinct in coney island. They were met with a five-foot wall of water that knocked down a wall trapping two steamfitters. All of these guys. This guy was stuck underneath a fallen wall with water levels ng. Something out of a filament. They went down there and pulled that guy out and literally had to swim up to safety. What I didn't know is how many heroic guys are in brooklyn. 
>> Nyu hospital where the staff evacuated the nicu. The thought of having a premature child and have to watch them walk down the stairs to be evacuated. I want to give a shoutout to the unionized workers. 

[01:52:55]


>> Certainly, a lot about that conversation about justice. How great was that for table tv. We also know that mitt romney has really taught is the degree to which winning for him has become a total destion of democracy, from voting accept pregs tactics. That disconnection was when his character came under question. I was hearing from organizations like family united for racial and economic equality in new york and brooklyn was about the services assigned to low incomes of color. They are talking about where local nurses were talking residents being sent to hospital because there weren't enough services. 
>> Red hook, a neighborhood in brooklyn is really hurting. 
>> John nichols? 
>> I know those fights we had about trade unions and public employees, we see why we've fought. Have seen some historic stories and things that we have talked about. Coming up on tuesday, we are going to have a lot of talk out the races. 
>> What excites me is that there is a lot of action out there, real important people and races running. Everything we talk about wh citizens united and big money coming in, it is coming in down ballot, particularly in judicial races. I will remind folks of the race in michigan where a woman named brigitte McCormick, started their innocence clinic up there. Brilliant professor running for judge, got hit with $1 million worth of advertising saying she is sympathetic for terrorism from a group called the judicial crisis network, not out of michigan. They just don't want her on the court. It was a brutal attack because she had made efforts to help make sure that folks at guantanamo were represented. She stood up for the rule of alaw and got attacked. 

[01:55:00]


>> We got our jobs report and i think what that showed us is that we are making steady progress in this recovery. One of the most telling things out of that report was the august numbers were revised up again, nearly another 50,000. So when numbers were first reported, we thought we were doing terribly, adding less than 100,000 jobs. August, wedded 200,000. It is a reminder of what we have to look at is the history of this recovery. We are steadily adding jobs and bringing the unemployment rate down. Everyone wants it to be faster. 
>> It is a reminder, I have stopped covering the monthly job report because the confidenc interval is so wide. The margin of errors, plus or minus 100,000 jobs. I stopped doing it because it was like this is just a preliminary guesstimate of what it is. 
>> My thanks to michael moye na haan, esther arm ma and betsy stevenson from the university of michigan. Thank you for joining us today for "up." Join us tomorrow at 8:00. 
>>> Coming up next is melissa harris-perry. Her letter today is for michael brown. We will see you right here tomorrow at 8:00. The last day before the election. Thanks for getting up. If we want to improve our schools... ... what suld we invest in? Maybe new buildings? What about updated equipment? They can help, but recent research shows... ... nothing transforms schools like investing in advanced teacher education. Let's build a strong foundation. Let's invest in our teachers so they can inspire our students. Let's solve this.

Die. You've got to get your trucks here on this corner. 
>> The question of this election comes down it this. Do you want more of the same or do you want real change? 
>> Did you hear him? He says I'm tcandidate of change. When you look at the policies, they're the same ones that didn't work. 
>> Ohio, you'll probably decide the president of the united states. 
>> Everyone is paying a lot of attention to ohio. 
>> They sure are. 
>>> SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 3rd. I'm randi kaye. 
>> I'm victor blackwell. Thanks for starting your morning with us. 
>>> The emphasis on the election took a back seat brought on by superstorm sandy. Both candidates put the talking points in their back pocket. But now with just three days left, the candidates are back on the trail with the talking points at the ready. We also have our correspondents spread out throughout the battleground states to bring you more on the election and the final push for both candidates. 
>>> Let's step away from the map and let's get to the message for a moment. Paul steinhauser is live in harrisburg, pennsylvania. Paul, really a flurry of activity and travel for president obama and governor romney. What is their message for these final three days? 
>> Victor, it's interesting, both of them have the same message. Change. They're saying it in different ways. You're hearing a lot about change as they crisscross the campaign trail in the final days. Both were talking about the message yesterday, last night in ohio. Take a listen. 
>> The president says that, you know, it has to be this way. I say it has to change. He says, he's got excuses for us. I say, in fact, no, I have a us. 
>> He says that we need to settle for where we are with this high unemployment and low wage growth. I say this, americans don't settle. 

[00:02:04]


>> Now, governor romney is a very talented salesman. And in this campaign he tried as hard as he can to repackage these bad ideas and offer them up as change. He says something, now suddenly he's the candidate of change. But, we know what change looks like. And what he's trying to sell, that's not it. 
>> You're goingo hear a lot more of that between now and tuesday, election day, of course. As both candidates reach out to that very small sliver of uncommitted voters and as they try to reach out to their own supporters to make sure they get to the voting stations. Victor? 
>> The mantra of real estate is location, location, location. Works for politics, too. How is that playing out with the campaigns? 
>> Oh, yeah, it is so important right now. You know, we have about eight battleground states and we consider cnn on the map. This is where the candidates were in their final four days. Yesterday through tuesday. Let's start with president obama. Where he goes is where he thinks he can win. Ohio, ohio, ohio. The president was there yesterday and back there today and monday. Two stops in iowa. Very important state. He'll end his campaign monday night in iowa, of course, that was the state that gave him his first victory back in the iowa caucuses back in 2008. Mitt romney, ohio is so important for him, as well. No republican has won the white house without winning ohio in modern times. Pennsylvania where I am, mitt rom economy coming here tomorrow where I am and paul ryan coming here today. That's why we're here. Listen, mitt romney thinks they can grab pennsylvania away from the democrat, a state the republicans haven't won sinc 1988. 
>> Paul, thanks. Randi. 
>>> New numbers on where things stand in florida. Take a look here. Thnbc news/"wall street journal/"marist poll. Florida is the biggest of all the expected swing state with 29 electoral votes. 

[00:04:16]


>>> On the campaign trail in ohio former new york mayor rudy giuliani offered a scathing critique of the president and said president obama should resign. It happened at a rally for mitt romney yesterday. Mr. Giuliani slammed the administration on a lot of topics. Benghazi, others. 
>> They're real excited today becausunemployment didn't go back to 8%. Ility 7.9%. They should be ashamed of themselves. The greatest country on earth, the greatest country in the history of the world and our growth is at 1.2%. He should resign! 
>> The founder and ceo of news corp rupert murdoch is also sounding off on the election via twitter. He blasted chris christie for praising president obama as the two leaders towards the storm damaged state this week. Christie, while thanking obama must redeclare for romney or take blame for the next four dire years. Anderson cooper looking where they focus their attention or whether the battleground state hold any surprises. Countdown to election day, that airs tomorrow night at 8:00 eastern. 
>>> And now to the latest on superstorm sandy. After much criticism, new york mayor michael bloomberg canceled the new york city marathon for the first time in its 42-year history. It was set to take place, as you know, tomorrow. Bloomberg insisted the race would not have req diverting resources from the recovery effort, but it was clear that the marathon was controversial and divisive. 
>> The race typically attracts 47,000 runners from all over the world and 12,000 volunteers and more than 2 million spectators. Critics say it just wasn't right to use generators for the marathon when some people had not had food and power for days.

>>> The lights are starting to come on for families in the northeast, but not fast enough for others. Five days after the storm, more than 2.5 million customers are without power across 15 states and d.C. It could be at least another week before power is fully restored and the cold weather is not helping matters. 
>>> National guard troops are helping to clear debris so crews can get back to putting that power back on. They're also helping in the search for survivors and delivering food to those in need. 7,400 army and air national guard soldiers and airmen from nine states have responded to this storm. 
>> I was in the new york area covering the storm this week for anderson cooper's show and it was, it was something to see up close and personal there.

>>> The heart ache is growing for families across the northeast as sandy claims more lives. 
>> The storm is now blamed for 106 death in the u.S. New york state was hit with the worst with 48 of those deaths and 22 people died in new je overall, the storm has killed 175 people when you include the number from canada and the caribbean. 
>>> The superstorm left entire communities devastated and hes broken in half or completely washed away. I had the chance to see some of it first-hand this week. I saw heartbreaking damage and found a danger still lurking. For days, this part of the new jersey coast has been a ticking t bomb. Natural gas lines have been spewing gas. We took a boat ride to see the threat for ourselves. The damage trully unimaginable. We came out here in search of the natural gas leaks, but can see there is plenty of damage here, as well. Just take a look at this house here in the distance, this is in e town of manalokin completely broken in half. Swing over here, this house used to be over there on land and now it's sitting in the middle of the water. People up and down the coast have been anxiously waiting, wupdering if their neighborhood might explode. Here we came across another house, you see it there behind me, it is split in two. You can smell the gas in the air. It was getting stronger and stronger as we get closer to it. The gas company has responded to 1,300 gas leaks and they have cleared all of them but you can still smell it in the air. Rob checked on his house and snapped this photo of a gas crew working to fix the leaks. Williams said the gas crews were overwhelmed. The gas company saysthey didn't even know how bad the problem was because they could only survey the damage by air. Once they were able to get closer in a boat like we are today, they were able to see just how dangerous it was. They, too, smelled the gas and they, too, realized they had a real problem on their hands. The gas leaks forced the mayor of to shut the town down today. Purging the gas lines from pt pleasant beach to seaside park, as well as long beach island. Turning it all off may make it safer for 28,000 customers, but they are sure to be without natural gas for some time. 

[00:13:17]


>> Good news, victor, they did get all the natural gas off. The company did confirm that for me, but the problem is they were trying to save the system, they didn't want to have to rebuild it. In getting all the gas out of the system they flood it with water which destroys the pipes and it will cost millions to try to rebuild entire systems. 
>> Very expensive cleanup. I was fully prepared to see water inside homes, I was not prepared to see homes in the water. You're on a boat, did you hit anything there? 
>> Actually, we were the eyes for our boativer of the boat because he said, I need your help because there is so much stuff in the water. Believe it or not, we drove over a home in the water. U could see it on his radar. We drove over a home. 
>> That was unbelievable. 
>> They have sunk to the bottom. 
>> Imagine coming back and find out your home is not here, it is down there somewhere. 
>> That's the situation for at lease homeowner. It was pretty shocking. 
>>> But our miguel marquez heads to vegas after the break for a deep dive into one key factor in tuesday's election. 
>> As this county goes -- oh! 
>> We'll see what he found in sin city and if he had a soft landing. Wow. I love you, james. Don't you love me? I'm a robot. I know. I know you're a robot! But there's more in you than just circuits and wires! Uhhh.

We are three days away from election day. Hard to believe. It's coming up pretty fast. Millions already voted but many more lining up on tuesday to make their choices. 

[00:18:36]


>> These last two days will be wild for both campaigns. Let's take a moment to break down the numbers and show you just how wild. We'll start with eight. The number of states that governor romney and president obama will stop in over the next three days. That's not counting the surrogates. 
>> When you throw in the surrogates, we turn the knob to 11. Here's a favorite of mine, number three. That's how many obama events bruce springsteen, the boss, is playing on the final day of the campaign. 
>>> Sky high unemployment, falling home prices, widespread foreclosures. Nevada was dealt a pretty bad hand when it comes to the economy, but the state and its six electoral votes is still one of the most important battlegrounds in tuesday's election. The r could hinge on whether voters are betting on a strong, economic recovery. Our miguel marquez headed to las vegar a unique perspective on the nevada vote. 
>> Her we are top of the stratusphere. As this county goes -- oh! In a city that fell harder and faster than just about any place in the country. This better be a very close election. The stratusphere hit hard. 
>> Reporter: The vegas landmark sunk $20 million into a new rest raubt raunt and the sky jump thing and, most importantly, 100 new jobs. 
>> Do ai think las vegas is through the worst of it? 
>> I drive to work and see things going on that I haven't seen for a little while. 
>> Reporter: Things like construction and homes being built in the place that once had the nation's highest foreclosure rate. 

[00:20:38]


>> There you go, yeah. 
>> Reporter: Chefck gifens charts the decline and rise by a sort of entree index. At the low point of the recession how many dinners were you doing and what are you doing now?

>> Hard to be excited about obama if you have not worked. I love obama. I understand the appeal of romney in this situation. 
>> Reporter: Like voters everywhere, he I tired of the campaign. 
>> Obama has been here more than celine dion has. If we are going to have the great country we had once, this is not a democrat or a republican thing. This is going to be an every single american thing. 
>> Very funny guy but also very serious in that moment. Recovery here across nevada is spotty at best. The best number, though, we heard while here is that the price of houses has gone up by 1% in the last month. It's the first time that number has risen since 2007. Miguel marquez, cnn, las vegas. 
>>> We'll know after tuesday whethernevada's tough economy becomes a factor in the presidential r victor? 
>>> Just as nailiting as the presidential election, th balance of power of congress is also one to watch this election season, specifically the senate. Right now democrats hold the majority in the senate. But they don't hold it by much. 51 seats to 47 seats for republicans. There are two independents who usually with the democrats. This election 33 seats up for graband the democrats are fighting to keep most of them. Now, this morning, a look at t the, some of the closely contested races that could tip the scale either way. Okay, let's go to, first, massachusetts. With a hotly contested race between republican scott brown and his democratic challenger elizabeth warner. The president's popularity in mitt romney's home state may be enough. Just maybe enough to tip the scales. Let's go to indiana. The race between republican rid murdoch and democrat representative joe donnelly seemed like it was going to the gop until this happened. 

[00:23:18]


>> Life is a gift from god and even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that god intended to happen. 
>> Well, you know mourdock's abortion comments sparked national outrage and a new poll out says it may cost mimsome support because donnelly now has a double-digit lead over him in the republican-leaning state, actually. Let's go to pennsylvania where bob casey found the need to campaign a little harder. Tom smith started closing the gap against the democratic incumbent and the national republican senatorial mmittee just dumped $500,000 into the campaign. Tommy versus tammy. Tommy thompson is neck and neck with tammy baldwin. Paul ryan state is democratic and baldwin's lead is within the margin of error. In missouri, republican todd aiken is staying in the senate race. His campaign was thought to be doomed after he made the comments about pregnancies that result from rape. 
>> It seem toz me, first of all, from what I understand from doctors, that is really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thivg down. 
>> Now, republican leaders, everyone from mitt romney and all the establishment pretty much urged akin to drop out. He refused. He's hoping to take the seat HELD BY clare McCaskill. The polls show him leading on her and a last-minute of cash infusion for his campaign. A lot of races to watch very closely and you can believe we'll be doing that right here for you.

>>> It is 6:29 here in the east. That makes it 3:29 out west. They do not call this "early start" for nothing. Welcome back. I'm victor blackwell. 
>> I'm randi kaye. Thank you for starting your day wis, nice and early. We are in the home stretch, just three days left until the election and in the final weekend of campaigning, predz obama and mitt romney are hitting the trails hard in those pivotal battleground states. Romney speaking a couple hours from now in port smith, new hampshire. 
>>> Asd to the polls, you may see officials from the justice department. 780 federal monitors are being dispatched to enforce laws. The group in 51 jurisdictions and 23 states on tuesday. If you want to file a voting rights complaint, you can contact your local attorney general's office. 
>>> We got the final employment report and results were mixed. 171,000 jobs added in the month of october. But, the unemployment rate ticked up marginally to 7.9%. In a tight presidential race, the candidates each gave their own take. Governor romney called the numbers, a "sad reminder of the state of our economy." President obama said we had, "made real progress, but still have further to go." 

[00:30:20]


>>> There are reports now that at least 22 million gallons of gas are headed to the northeast to help relieve shortages following superstorm sandy. It's made for some long lines as residents wait hours to gas up their cars and get fuel for generators to cut down on wait times, 12 new jersey counties will go to a rationing system. That starts at noon today. On odd numberays only customers whose license plates end in an odd number can buy gas and same goes for the even days. 
>>> New york mayor michael bloomberg has canceled the new york marathon for the first time in 42 years. People were outraged by his earlier decision to go on. He said in a statement that the race had become controversial and divisive. 
>>> And people on the new jersey shore certainly need some support. John sady lives along the shore and he shot this cell phone video of the aftermath. Take a look. 
>> That's the boardwalk two blocks in on central avenue. And that's where the boardwalk was on the ocean. 
>> And john is on the phone with us this morning. He's a business owner in seaside heights, new jersey, andives in toms river. John, I was in your area this week. I'm so sorry for what you all are dealing with there. Are the conditions any better now this morning for you? 
>> They're mixed. They're mixed. We are really happy with the response from the governor with the electoral department. We had people from alabama, atlanta, three actor trailer loads, telephone polls went over thursday. That response has been outstanding. However, it's been a little slow, I would say, in the search for door-to-door to help some of these people. That has been a little bit embarrassing to the government. 
>> Right after the storm actually happened, though, and came through there. You took in five local families. A lot of people had no where to go. Where are those people now? Are they still with you and what made you decide to take themin? 

[00:32:26]


>> They're going to be with me a long time. There is no wher for themo go. These are the volunteer firemen from seaside heights. We have a police officer and some other emergency personnel. They literally have no place to go. 
>> I was up there and I'm curious because I did this boat tour and I took a look to try to find some of this natural gas that, as you know, was spewing from the system there. I know it was, you were spelling it in your area. Where I in manalokin they shut that down. 
>> It was really money versus lives. It turns out that sea wat would have seeped into the system and the whole main line would have been replaced which would have taken six, seven, eight months and $100 million. The governor, again, shut the system down, the main line down. However, that caused an enormous amount of problems. No one in the houses that are okay have no heat. I mean, just one disaster is going to turn into anoth. 
>> Like 28,000 people, from what I understand, without access to natural gas. Do you think they were putting lives at risk, though? I know this was their last resort in order to shut the system down, but you think the were trying to hold on to the system and try not to shut it down? 
>> No. In my opinion, they had to weigh that cost versus a life of a fireman and, in new jersey, in my opinion, we weigh life by how much you make in new jersey. That comes down inhe court system. Your income of what you're worth when you die. 
>> I want to ask you about this popular nightclub along the shore, the bamboo bar, it is a favorite of the mtv cast "jersey shore." How is the bar doing? 

[00:34:30]


>> Bamboo bar, we have two clubs, are both fairly well. I would be able to get back up and operating within a month. However with no utility, no water and no gas. And it's government regulation. Forget it. If anybody had to deal with the dep and the building departments of new jersey, it takes you two years. All the wealthy people I know are going to take their money and run. 
>> Listen, I hope things do improve for you there. It is really a terrible situation and just so difficult getting around and surviving day-to-day. John saaddy, thank you very much. 
>> You're welcome. 
>>> Inow this sounds like a stretch, but stay with me here. What does the hit tv show "breaking bad" about a family running the meth lab have in common with the debt.

>>> good morning, washington. Take a look there. You have to take a look at this. Get in front of your tv and look at that capital building right there. Just beautiful, busy day. Busy week certainly ahead in washington. So, let's get back to politics now and the finalsh to election day. A state that we weren't paying much attention to is now back in the spotlight. We're talking about pennsylvania. Mitt romney and paul ryan will be there this weekend. Jill biden and joe biden will make stops for president obama, not to mention all the money being spent on a last-minute blitz. The latest poll out of pennsylvania shows a tight race. Three points within the margin of error, but can romney win it. john McCain made a final push like this on the sunday before the electionn 2008 and he lost. The same plan and same result for george w. Bush in 2004 and bob dole in 1996. 

[00:39:51]


>>> Let's check out florida and that's where we find, long, long lines. Some people waited in line as long as five hours to cast their early vote. Today is the last day for early voting. We'll take you live to florida next hour. How close is the race there? Take a look. This poll shows president obama with a lead, 49-47. 
>>> Both campaigns are finding some talking points to drive home their closing arguments. Here it is. Unemployment ticked up to 7.9% while the economy added 171,000 jobs in october. That's more than most expected. Earlier, I spoke with bill gross who runs the world's biggest mutual fund pinco if these numbers are enough to move voters and the markets. 
>> I'm not sure it is, victor. Actually, the election may hinge on the length of gas lines in new jersey and new york on monday as opposed to the number of jobs announced on friday. In any case, the job creation number is sufficient going forward to certainly level the unemployment rate and, ultimately, over time, to produce a lower unemployment rate. It's a positive for the democrats and the obama administration, at least short term. We know that the election is about the economy. It is about, you know, two different visions in terms of an obama plan that basically suggests raising taxes on the wealthy, you know, to lower the deficit and romney plan that suggests tax reform that ultimately will produce higher growth. You know, I'm not so sure that either one of those have been detailed specifically so that voters understand, but, nonetheless, that's what tuesday is all about. 
>> Earlier this week, bill, you spoke to cnbc and you sounded a little, let's y, jaded about the election. Let's listen to what you said and then we'll talk about it on the other side. 

[00:41:52]


>> We spent $5 billion on this election for what? To prove that it's a government of the superpac by the superpac for the superpac to prove that basically who wins at this point we'll be at four years in the future. But let's look to something different as opposed to this red and blue state theology that is basically the same. 
>> Does theatter which candidates wins then or do you think we're headed for a fiscal cliff off this fiscal cliff either way? 
>> Well, I think so. And I do think, although there are differences between romney and obama in terms of their policies, I do think both of them, you know, are subject to, as I mentioned, superpac to the best government that money can buy. Going forward we should examine something different from the standpoint of policies and standpoint of government that allows u.S. Voters a significant choice. 
>> I want to talk about this really interesting op-ed you wrote for the "washington post." You compared the u.S. Debt crisis to crystal meth addiction. You said, "hooked on the temporary high of tax cuts and increased entitlements over the past several decades, the nation's capital is approaching the end of the line traveled by most addicts, reform or suffer the consequences." Explain this. Is this part of the new normal th you predicted after the '08 financial crisis? 
>> It is. It suggests that the u.S. Faces a, you know, fiscal cliff decision over the next few months that is $1 billion to $2 billion deep. But a grand canyon over the next few years that is over $1 trillion wide. Our cbo, our congressional budget office he conservatively estimated that the gap of gdp which is an amount totaling $1.2 trillion that has to be closed over the next few years. Either via higher taxes or lower expenditures going forward to keep our debt from escalating into the spanish and italian and greek area that, you know, is reminiscent of crystal meth and addiction.

>>> Bruce springsteen, billy joel, aerosmith, christina aguilera, mary j. Blige showed up last night to help raise money for victims of superstorm sandy. The concert aired live and we don't know yet how much money was raised for the red cross relief efforts, but cnn is also extending a hand to the survivors of sandy. Visit cnn.Com/impactyourworld to learn more. 
>>> Well, as the day breaks, the search for survivors and victims of superstorm sandy will continue. 
>> So far we know that that 900-mile storm has killed at least 106 people in the u.S. Cnn jim clancy followed the national guard as they went door-to-door in a search and discovery mission in new jersey. 
>> Reporter: A sometimes forceful systematic search for survivors. Dozens of members of the u.S. Army aair force national guard joined members of the ocean county prosecutor's office to probe seemingly abandoned homes on long beach island's whole gate community. In distress situations they forcibly opened homes to call out for survivors. The prosecutors are on hand because they have jurisdiction if any bodies are uncovered. But in most cases, it was a straight forward call to ask if anyone was inside. 

[00:49:22]


>> National guard. 
>> This part of the mission is search and rescue. Pretty much nobody has been here. So what we've been doing is trying to see if any residents that had stayed over during the hurricane survived. That's basically what we're looking for here, any survivors. 
>> Reporter: Homes already ripped open by superstorm sandy were searched inside and out while these guard teams from new jersey kept a sharp lookout for signs of life anywhere around a hometrying to ensure no one would be overlooked. Devastating waves broke on these beaches, ripping away huge amounts of sand that was then carried across the island, leaving two or three-story homes perched dangerously their now shallow pilings. Six-feet high making road access impossible, not waiting for those road to be cleared, the coast guard joined in the search and rescue mission to the far southern end of the island. Their work almost done, the search teams mark each house and each street with red tape to document which homes have been checked. They found some residents, but none wanting to leave. Like carl clark, who road out the storm and still refuses to leave, but thinks it's a good idea to keep the island closed for now. 
>> That is a good thing, in my opinion. You know, we have to restore this infrastructure. Bring anybody back yet. I'll stay here and look after home and our neighbor's home and watch out for, you know, looting. Anybody that doesn't belong here. 
>> Reporter: Carl and the residents not on the island can rest assured that 100 plus national guard troops marching through freshly plowed sand drifts are also on the lookout for everyone. 
>> Jim clancy joins us live now and carl clarke and his decision to stay ba, he's now seen what has happened to this to. What did youlearn from him about moving forward and all the work that it will take to rebuild this area of long island? 

[00:51:26]


>> Well, you know, there'a tremendous amount of instruture because carl says if I leave, i can't get back. Like many residents, he's worried about his stuff, his place. He loves it out on the island, as so many people who live here year round do. There is a sense among them, all right, we'll give the city a chance. A guy trying to get out of to the island, the police turned him around and he didn't have permission to be out here. Probably a resident to check on his home, probably next wednesday they'll be able to do that. By keeping everybody off the island, they're earth movers pushing the sand off the roads that you saw there in that report. There's drifts six feet high in some places. It's impossible for people to travel in some places. So, give them a chance go in and to work on infrastructure and check the gas lines and electoral lines and determine which homes may have to come down because they're so dangerously damaged bythis superstorm. There's a lot of work to be done. It will take several days. They think if we can do it up front and keep everybody off the island, that's going to be better for everyone. But, you know what, I mean, obviously, a lot of people that say, no, my house, I want to be there. There's a debate, no doubt about it. 
>> So much work to do. Jim clancy, thank you so much. Now, for more information about sandy and what you can do to help those affected check out cnn.Com/impact. 
>>> Three days and counting until election day and we are covering all the battlegrounds for you.

Everyday you see all the ways all of us at us bank are helping grow our economy. Lending more so companies and communities can expand, grow stronger and get back to work.

=======================================================

Point, two point. That is well within the margin of error and, finally, here is the national picture and it could not be closer. Our poll of polls shows 47% apiece. Presidentbama is slamming governor romney over an ad his campaign is running in the key battleground state of ohio. Watch. 
>> Look, I understand governor romney has had a tough time here in ohio because he was against saving the auto industry. And it's hard to run away from a position whfn you're on videotape saying, let detroit go bankrupt. But, but, you've got to own what you say. This isn't a game. These are people's jobs at stake. These are people's lives. You don't scare hard-working americans just to scare up some votes. That's not what being president is all about. 
>> The president was responding to thisomney ad that implied the autobailout plan failed and chrysler will move jobs to china. That's a claim that chrysler has vehemently denied. 
>>> On the other side ofohio, mitt romney sharpened his attack oobama focusing on the economy. 
>> Now, I know when we're elected the economy and american jobs will still be stagnant. But I t waste any time complaining about my predecessor. I will spend my effort trying to pass partisan legin unrelated to economic growth. From day one I'll go to work to help americans get back to work. 
>> Romney cled yesterday's job's report, "a sad minder the economy is at a virtual stand it still." Unchanged at 7.9%. While the obama campaig tuted the 171,000 jobs added with improved numbers in september and august. 
>>> We have crews spre across the country following the campaigns on the last weekend before the election. President obama will make his first stop today and paul steinhauser following mitt romney in pennsylvania. Let's start with dan in ohio. What is on the president's schedule sph. 

[00:02:12]


>> Well, you can expect that the president will continue to hammer away at this mitt romney on the auto industry. You pointed out there at the top of the show how this was a big push by the president yesterday in going after that ad by suggesting that jobs from a jee plant would go overseas to china and, in fact yesterday, the president was recounting that he heard that some employees had gone to their managers with concerns that they would lose their jobs through china. So, the president using this big push to show, in his words, that mitt romney is massaging the facts. So, we expect that the president will continue to make that arment here today. The reason for that is because, as you know, so many jobs here in the state of ohio dependent on the auto industry and the bailout is something the president has been touting for a long time, but certainly ramped up in these final days as the president makes a big push to election day, victor. 
>> The president took a few days off the campaign trail to deal with the superstorm. How is he staying on top of the recovery efforts while he's campaigning? 
>> That's right. He does continue to stay on top of it. A white house official telling us that overnight the white house did receive briefings and this morning he will convene another meeting with his emergency management team or his homeland security team to get updates on the response that's taken place by federal authorities. He'll also be talking with governors and also mayors, governors from the states of new jersey, new york and connecticut. And then we're told that later in the day various high-level administration officials, cabinet secretaries will be fanning out across the impacted areas to not only survey the damage up close, but to listen and to find out what the needs are so that the needs can get to where they're needed most, victor. 
>> Busy, busy final weekend. Dan lothian in ohio, thank you, sir. 
> Let's move from ohio to pennsylvania. A state that seemingly wasn't in play but noweems to be a focus for the campaigns. Paul steinhauser is live in harrisburg, pennsylvania, this morning. That is where paul ryan will be later today. Paul, good morning to you. I guess the question is, is pennsylvania really in play? 

[00:04:31]


>> That's what everybody is asking, randi. The last time a replican won pennsylvania in a presidential election 1988. George herbert walker bush, it's been a while. But what's going on here? Paul ryan, as you mentioned, he's coming right here to harrisburg, that's why we're here. On the flip side, it seems that the oma campaign now putting some surrogates here. Jill biden, the wife of the vice president will be here in pennsylvania later today, as well. Guess what, former president bill clinton coming to pennsylvania to campaign on monday. YOU TURN ON THE TVs HERE, RANDI, All you see are campaign commercials. I saw a ton in the local news. 10 million in the final days and the romney campaign is outspending the obama campaign two to one here in pennsylvania. 20 electoral votes at stake. Here is the latest poll in pennsylvania. Franklin and marshal, a four-point advantage for the president. Very tight. That's within the sampling error. The president used to have a double-digit lead in pennsylvania. Now it's getting crowded. Randi, the obama campaign says this is a sign of desperation by the romney campaign that they can't win in wisconsin, ohio and that's why they're coming to pennsylvania. Romney campaign says just the opposite. They're trying to expand the map and they think they can do it here in pennsylvania. 
>> If you look at the math and it does work, it can certainly l a big prize. This is a popular but pretty unsuccessful strategy for republicans, right? They have tried this over and over. 
>> Yeah, go back four years ago. john McCain and sarah palin came here and didn't work out. You go out, george w. Bush tried it and bob dole in '96. No republican has been successful since 1988 here in pennsylvania. We're going to keep our eyes on pennsylvania today with paul ryan and tomorrow when mitt romzey comes through and iuess we'll find out on tuesday who was right. Randi. 
>> We certainly will. Hopefully we'll find out o tuesday the way this is going. 
>> Yes, good point. 
>> Paul steinhauser, thank you very much. 

[00:06:33]


>>> Much more ahead this hour. 
>> Here's what's coming up. 
>>> Sandy has brought devastation across the northeast, but it may also have been the october surprise. We have the latest on the recovery efforts and sandy's impact on the election. 
>>> Battleground wisconsin. Three days left and now it's all about the ground game. We'l you to one of the contentious swing states. 
>> I'll tired of bot obama and mitt romney. 
>>> She can't vote, but she's already crying about the election. Find out why this toddler just can't take it any more. Cheerios cholesterol as part of a heart hediet. That's true. ...But you still have to go to the gym. ?????? The one and only, Cheerios ?????? things you. For you, life'about her.

>>> Good morning, atlanta. Nice to see some lights on. Atlantans are pretty lucky there. Some power in the city. A balmy 48 degrees. 11 minutes after the hour and this morning more people in the northeast will find they have power for the first time since monday. About 2.7 million peopcould, though, be in the dark for another day. In some areas, some people are banned fromtering their homes and the national guard is checking for more victims. The death toll from superstorm sandy rose to 106 last night, that's just in the u.S. Cnn jim clancy is in long island beach, new jersey, an area where houses were floating down the streets. Jim, we hear some good news of some signs of improvement this morning. 
>> Well, you know, the improvement is going to come and certainly they're out there working every day. They're digging away. They're trying to literally like snow plows tear through the sand dunes that have built up. Some as high as sixfeet on this island, covering up roadways and plowing through all of that and they're working on, I've seen people coming out and checking the power lines and we have peopleg out and the entire underside of some of these homes that were up on stilts or posts or whatever you want to call it, pylons. They may have to come down. All of the homes, they're ensuring that they have a little bit of stability. You know, this was quite a storm. I talked to one of the residents, he refuses to leave. Search and rescue yesterday, guy name carl was telling me that the perience of this storm was the experience of a lifetime. Listen. 
>> It was a surreal experience and probably the worst of my life. The water reached near to the first floor, but never came in. At the height of the storm, it was like a white water rafting scene coming down the street. And as I looked out and I said to my wife, come see a house and she said, no, stop drinking. I said, no, we haven't had anything. As we watched this house float down the street right past our house and, as it did, it hit our car, which had been fine until that point. Our car had been on blocks. Spun our car aroun and parked it here as though it was intended to be. At the heigh the storm, the water was above the windshield. And there's the house. We're fine. But, you know, it's devastation here. 

[00:13:12]


>> Now, carl clarke says that because he can't come back to the island yet, he's not going to leave. Refuses to do that. He has some propane, plenty of foodplenty of water. These are boat people and used to doingme of that. All the residents are asking when they can come back? Wednesday perhaps at the earliest according the mayor. It may be longer than that. Randi and everybody, back to you. 
>> Well, jim, we know that carl is one of the few people left on this island and that other people can't come back. I know you're having difficulty hearing me. How frustrated is it for these people who can't make it back? 
>> Very frustrating. I mean, victor, you know, they homes here. They're attached to this island. Many of them live year round and some have summer homes here. But they want to come back. They see the possibility that there's water in my basement. That is going to compound the damage unless I get that pumped out. I need to do that right away. Let me on the island, let me do that. Because they have to do all this heavy work and we slow them down in the long run. Everyone bringing in their own contractors and nobody move in the streets and all kind of oblems and, so, I mean, a lot of heart ache because of the people. I get the phone calls. Some of our cnn employees have houses here, please, check on my house. They don't have any word yet. The city set up a website and the website, I don't have the address right off the top of my head, I should. I think if you do a search on this township of long beach island, you'll find it. And they're taking photographs of the various houses, the various neighborhoods to give people an idea of what situation they may be in. Victor, back to you. 
>> Jim clancy reporting live for us this morning, thank you, jim. 
>>> We have seen so many horror stories. Communities torn apart by flooding and high winds and the devastating fires destroyed dozens of homes in queens, as well. 

[00:15:15]


>> One of the most heart wrenching tales comes from staten island. Gary tuchman has more on the story of two little boys caught in that storm. 
>> Reporter: A ford explorer on the side of a reet in staten island, new york. The car seats remain where two little boys, brandon and conner moore were sitting as eir mother was driving during hurricane sandy desperately looking for shelter. What happened is sad, horrifying, terrifying. She was driving her suv down this street and plunged into this hole during the height of hurricane sandy. She then got out of the vehicle with her 2-year-old son and 4-year-old son, remember, it is pouring rain, torrential, the winds 90 miles per hour and she comes over here to this tree and holds on to the tree, grabs the branches and grabs the tree and holds on to it and holds on to her sons at the same time and she did this, according to police, for hours. That's what she told the police. She went up to this house behind me and knocked on the door and a man was inside and plead would him to let them inside the house. The man would not let her in with her sons. She went to the balcony and wasn't able to break in and ultimately flood waters came and washed her sons away. Everyone was hoping for optimism, but no hopes that the boys would be found alive. Police divers walked through that swampy marsh, sadly, the bodies of both children were found not far from each other about a quarter mile away from where glenda last held them. Family members say glenda is too distraught to talk to us. We wanted to meet the man who live in the house where glenda sought protection. Nobody answered the door, but while we were standing near the house on public property, an angry man appeared. 
>> Stop, no cameras here. 

[00:17:17]


>> Can I ask you a question, did the woman knock on your door? 
>> No, sir. 
>> Reporter: Alan did not want to say his last name, but the house in question was his and he says he was inside during the hurricane. Police say glenda knocked on your door and asked to go inside -- 
>> no, absolutely not. 
>> What she told the police was not accurate? 
>> No. 
>> You saw a man come to your door? 
>> There are stairs in the back of the house and he must have been standing at the bottom of the stairs. 
>> What did he do? 
>> He took the concrete flower pot. I can show you. Two of them, he threw one of them through the door. 
>> What they're saying is after you didn't let her in, she threw it and tried to get in. 
>> I had to stay there all nigh I sat all night with my back against the door in the kitchen. 
>> Let me ask you, the man threw the flower pot. He asked me to come out and help him. 
>> So, did you help him? 
>> What could I do to help him? 
>> I had these shorts on and my brother's jacket. I had a pair of shorts on with flip-flops. 
>> You did not see a woman and two children? 
>> No. 
>> You saw a man? 
>> A man, yes. Must feel terrible for this woman and her children. 
>> Of course, it's a tragedy. She shouldn't have been out. Shouldn't have been out on the road 
>> well, a lot of people are, sir. They look for help sometimes. 
>> There nothing I could do. Mayor said, people said rescue workers, don't endanger the lives of the rescue workers. If I would have been outside, i would have been dead. 
>> Reporter: Alan said he talked to police. Gary tuchman, cnn. 
>> Conner and brandon moore are believed to be among the youngest victims of superstorm sandy and that man asked why would anyone be out driving during the storm? The moore house was filling with water and glenda grabbed her boys and tried her best to escape. She was trying to make it to her sister's house in brooklyn, but a strong storm surge and battering wave ended those hopes and the lives of those two little boys. inkjet slow.

=======================================================

So I think I would dot in this der. The democrats mos likely to get ohio. And thenay virginia and then florida. So if they get florida they get all three. Yeah it's good for 
>> and all the money that mitt romney's spending in pennsylvania, I mean, that shows that they want that, they need that state. 
>> I think you're right. They need it. Atest jobs numbers right now that came out on friday, chris, they show unemployment ticked up. It was a tenth of a point to 7.9% level. But employers added 170,000 jobs. That beat expectations. 125,000, three months in a row of 170,000 or more. So they're three months in a row of that. And obviously we're not in nirvana here but clearly, the way we look at these jobless numbers now. Two ways. We look at the percentage, and i do think obama would have been in trouble if it had gone back up to 80 that would have been the wrong direction. But the fact that it went to 7.9, and added so many more jobs than predicted was pretty good for him. I would say he got by at least, probably got a slight plus out of friday in terms of romney's statement, for example, was definitely tone-deaf when he came out friday morning and said -- yesterday morning and said, it's bad news. It's not bad news. 171,000 new jobs is good news. 
>> Chris, when we were just talking about florida, virginia, ohio, is there a chance that if those all go one way, we'll turn the lights off early on tuesday night, wednesday morning? 
>> Well, I think the american people would benefit from a clear winner. And I say it totally objectively. I don't think we need to have some diabolical problem in ohio or florida messup. We don't need that for this country right now. We have enough division. We need a clear verdict where the american people have made their verdict. I'd like to see the popular vote coincide with the electoral vote. I think it would be better for our country. It may not. And if that is the case we've got to be grown-ups about it and accept how our constitution works. We got through it in 2000, where al gore got more popular votes. He didn't run around the country saying I really won. He accepted the constitution I thought rather graciously. We'll see if either guy, if they're in that situation this time, does it so graciously. 

[00:02:10]


>> Well that -- 
>> I think it's important that they do that. I think that's patriotism in action. I think if anybody runs around saying I've got the popular vote. It doesn't mean anything. And I can see -- well, I have my own suspicions. 
>> Back to your point, the electoral versus popular vote split. Tom brokaw is coming up in office politics and he said almost verbatim exactly what you did, chris. Thank you so much. 
>> Good luck over the weekend, alex. 
>> Thanks. We're having a good time up here so far. Democracy plaza rocks. All of you can watch a special edition of "hardball" tomorrow at 7:00 eastern.

[ Male Announcer ] SOME DAY, YOUR LIFE WILL Flash before your eyes. ?????? ?????? make it worth watching. ?????? ?????? the new 2013 lexus ls. An entirely new pursuit. 
>>> You are looking live at democracy plaza, rockefeller center here in the heart of manhattan. The broadcasting headquarters for our coverage of the 2012 election. Welcome back to "weekends with alex witt." In just a moment we're going to take a look at two new critical swing state polls and a last check on early voting. Who's winning in that? First the aftermath of hurricane sandy. Right now nearly 3 million homes are without power across the northeast. More utility crews are being deployed to the northeast from across the country. The federal government set up temporary housing for out-of-statue tillty workers in new jersey. The latest death toll stands at 109 victims in the u.S. With more deaths in the caribbean. Many of the victims lived in new york city, the borough of staten island. The president is monitoring the cleanup effort and meeting with federal and state officials this morning, administration officials will visit storm damaged communities in new jersey, new york, connecticut, and west virginia. Let's get the latest on the relief efforts from people still grappling with the aftermath of sandy. Michelle franzen is in staten island this morning. Od morning, michelle. 
>> Good morning alex. Staten island, the hardest hit in new york city, suffering the most damage and obviously the most lives lost here. Take a look at these boats at the marina, on the water, pushed up from sandy's force, into homes. Inland it was flooding and just the sheer force of sandy that destroyed homes, and displaced some 500 people who are now estimated to be living in shelters. And many of them don't feel that they got the help they needed in those initials days and were forgotten out here yesterday. Homeland secretary janet napolitano made a visit here. Fema now here, red cross, the national guard. Napolitano promising that staten island and other areas will have the resources they need for the long-term. In the meantime, just sandy's sheer force has left a mark on many people's lives. 

[00:09:27]


>> When I came home there was water coming down, my whole first floor and my second floor is destroyed. A group of men helped put down the garage door to protect it. It's uninhabitable. And else where around new york city, power is slowly being restored to sections of lower manhattan that was out. And in new jersey, destruction along the jersey shoreline will be long and slow process. The governor telling people, trying to brace them, when they finally get back to their homes, if they have homes, that they will not recnize their area and it will be a long haul ahead. Also, alex, gas rationing starts in new jersey, beginning at noon today, and there will be long lines, no doubt, again. Boats on the sidewalk as a backdrop. Thank you very much, michelle franzen. 
>>> Now to politics. Just three days to go until the election. The latest nbc news poll show an extremely tight race between president obama, mitt romney. In the key swing states of ohio and florida, that's where both candidates have been spending a lot of their time. Joining me now is mark murray, nbc news senior political editor, a edo keith congressional reporter for "the washington post." Hi, guys, ready to go? 
>> Good morning. 
>> How you feeling? 
>> Let's talk about these polls you put out there, mark. What did you find in florida, and ohio? 
>> Well, in ohio, president obama has a six-point advantage among likely voters. 51% to 45%. In florida, it's closer. President obama at 49% among likely voters. Yet mitt romney at 47% among likely voters. One thing that is helping president obama is that early vote, the erwhelming number of people who've already voted early say that they are backing president obama. Mitt romney has a little bit o a better score over obama on the economy. In florida, but in ohio it's presidobama with the slight edge on who would better handle the economy. 
>> Okay, so what is the interpretation of these numbers, though. Does it mean it's all about getting out there to vote? I mean, it looks like president obama has the lead with the early voting. 

[00:11:32]


>> He does. Andactually, just look at the totality of the poll right now. These two states, ohio and florida, are perhaps the biggest electoral prizes come election night. If president obama is able to win ohio, he secures his midwest firewall, as long as he's able to win wisconsin and iowa. Meanwhile, on florida, that is a must-win state for mitt romney with its 29 electoral votes. If somehow he loses that state, you can actually see president obama getting past 270 without winning other battleground states. And so those two states might be the most important to watch come election day. 
>> Absolutely. Especially those 18 electoral votes in ohio. Ed, you're joining us from columbus, give me a check on the mood there. 
>> Well, you know, I think the poll you guys just put out confirms that the president is ahead here, and the fact that the gap appears to be widening ever so slightly, at least in your survey, is telling. I think a lot of this is, you know, the fact that they believe that, you know, he saved the auto industry or at least has campaigned on that. Remember you can't make a car in michigan unless you have the parts made in ohio. I think a lot of people here appreciate that realization that the president really and his administration have done what they did. Another thing to keep in mind about ohio, I saw this vividly a few weeks ago when I was here, e obama campaign never left ohio. And you talk to their people, you talk to their volunteers on the ground, and they say, we've been doing this now for five years in a sense. Almost six years. You go to the cleveland suburbs, there are obama campaign offices just two doors down from where they were four years ago. And the same people are showing up. There's something about the fact that they've been able to hold on to the support they had over five or six years ago, and really just continue that playbook all the way through this year. 
>> Yeah. 
>> And build upon whatever they were able to do back then. 
>> I think someone suggested that the president has almost tripled the number of offices there in the state of ohio, as mitt romney does. Can I ask you quickly about ohio's provisional ballots, ed, and the probability or chance they may hold up the results in that state? 
>> Well, they could. And people here call it the nightmare scenario. The reason is that all of the registered voters in this state received an application for an absentee ballot. So if they requested one sent to their home, and they don't fill it out, and they show up to vote on tuesday, they're going to be told you have to fill out those provisional ballot because we already sent you one that you didn't mail in. State law says you have to wait ten days before you open those provisional ballots and count them. Now this will matter if the margin is close. Let's say it's under 100,000 and say 200,000 provisional ballots were cast. But state officis are convinced that they'll be able to call the election tuesday night, that they won't have this problem. But certainly both parties have been, you know, alerting people to the possibility of this. They've put lawyers in place. They have poll watchers all across thetate ready to monitor this. But certainly could be an issue to watch tuesday night. 

[00:14:24]


>> We do not want to be counting BALLOTS ON NOVEMBER 17th. That would not be a good idea. Mark and ed, get back to it. We'll see you here again. Thank you so much. 
>>> In this week's office politics, my conversation with tom brokaw. We talk abouthe crossroads this country has come to and what the history books may say about this election. But I began by asking tom how hurricane sandy compares with the many other natural disasters he has covered. 
>> You know, in an odd way, it reminded me of being in the big earthquake, the mountaintops and the things about this hurricane, obviously, is that it hit in our most concentrated centers of population.D our most crucial financial districts. So, it brought everything to a stop. Now, how the rest of the country reacts to this, you know, it's hard to know. When it hits new york, and it hits new jersey, and hits connecticut, you're hitting the densest population mass that we have. And when everything comes to a stop, transportation services, small businesses, large businesses, it has a -- a reverberating effect across the country. So this one, I think, will be in the history books. 
>> Sandy, the human tragedy, you hate to reduce it to political terms but there is no den this in an election right now. How does sandy affect this election? How do you see that playing out? 
>> I honestly don't know whether it will alter someone going into the voting booth and change their mind. Thatll go either for romney or for obama based on the hurricane. I do think that you can take the measure of what happened to the campaign process. It kind of it in place for a couple of days. And arguably, you can make the case that didn't help governor romney. Because he seemed to be on a roll at that point. 
>> Momentum -- 
>> but it's really hard to know until we start to get the results, and hear what people say about how it affected the voting pattern, and it affected their behavior, quite honestly. I do think that president obama, arm in arm with governor christie, with the kind of picture that the campaign must have said thank you, god, because what that did was say to the country, republicans and democrats can work together, because that's what the countrynt wants to see. I think the united states is more fractured than I can remember. And that's fed, in part, by the ability of people with special interests to, if you will, fan the flames on the internet. Which they try to do. Division is good for them. They want to pit one interest against another. But I also think that the economic downturn undermined for a lot of voters their confidence in the country and where it was going. A lot of the assumptions that they had grown up with were kind of wiped out. You can make a good investment in your home, it will be the best thing that you can do. Suddenly your home is worth half as much as what you paid for it 

[00:17:26]


>> I think regardless of whom you vote for, when we all woke up the day after the election the last go-around there was a sense that something good had been accomplished. We hadlected our first african-american president. Do you ink, if barack obama is not elected, tom, that it negates some of that? It dispels some of that accomplishment? 
>> I don'tnk it has anything to do with the african-american. The president would be the first to say I'm being related by what I did in office not in terms of the color of my skin. 
>> But in terms of history judging it? 
>> I think 9 sense of history will be did he succeed as president? That's the test. We don't give people an automatic pass, quite honestly. They have to measure up to the job that we expect themo do for everyone. He did inherit a very difficult situation. Economically, two of the longest wars in the nation's history. But for the first time of years, until the election of 2010, he seemed not to have an extraordinarily clear, firm idea of how he wanted to lead the country, and how he wanted to -- how he was going to persuade the rest of us that it was in our best interest in the way that he was going to lead the country. 
>> More of our conversation today at 12:00 noon. We talk about similarities with this election to previous ones and the 180 the weekend before the election. In just a few minutes the latest on early voting. What does it indicate for tuesday's outcome? Up next the wake-up call from hurricane sandy. Is the storm forcing us to confront climate change, and face new worst-case scenarios? ??????

>>> Welcome back to democracy plaza at rockefeller plaza, the headquarters of our coverage of the 2012 election. In just a few minutes we're going to get a snapshot of early voting. Is it a preview of things to come on tuesday? Meantime, somewhat of a bombshell, new york mayor michael bloomberg threw his support behind president obama is week. His reasons? Climate change. His evidence, hurricane sandy. Joining me now is carl davenport, energy and environmental coent for the national journal. Ral, welcome, good morning. 
>> Thanks, good to be here. 
>> I know for the past few months you've written a few pieses about global warming. One came in september, proved especially futuristic here. No laughing matter. You wrote about how global warming is already affecting the coastal residents. Even before the storm, what kind of an impact are we talking about? 
>> We are already seeing the global -- the bottom line impact. We're seeing higher storm surges to coastal residents. Everywhere from florida to new hampshire. We're seeing increasednsurance costs. We're seeing bottomline costs as there are more and more storms, not just storms like sandy, but in the northeast they're seeing more and more of those 100-year storms, inside, two storms like that inside a decade. So higher and higher bottom-line costs to taxpayers, homeowners, insurance companies. Even before sandy. From these rising sea levels and increase intensity storms. 
>> So coral, where does the conflict come from, en, within the scientific community? Because it seems like there are two camps on the legitimacy of climate change. 
>> The journal -- the national academy of sciences, the journal, proceedings of the national academy of sciences took a survey ofentists who work on this a couple of years ago, and there was agreement among 97% of scientists that fossil fuel emissions from human activity lead to global warming. Are warming the sphere. That's an incredibly high consensus. So it's 97% in agreement. 3% in disagreement. At this consensus. At this point the scientific consensus is very, very strong that burning coal and oil and fossil fuels is warming the planet and leading to these extreme weather situations. 

[00:24:25]


>> So, this question really, then, is directed to the 3% of scientists as we look at the latest cover of "business week" it speaks for itself, coral, we had new york city mayor michael bloomberg endorsing the president in a piece largely focused on climate change. Is this a wake-up call and could it end the debate? 
>> The problem is you can't ever say any one specific weather event is caused by climate change but you can look at the growing stack of reports saying we know we're going to see more of this. The national academies of sciences have put out reports saying climate change will lead to increased flooding and storm surges in the northeast. That's been known. We often know that climate change will lead to increased drought in themidwest. We already got a preview of that this summer. We know what's coming. You can't say any one specific storm, but we can see we will see more intense storms, higher storm surges -- 
>> yeah. 
>> -- The data is there, you know, all we have to sort of -- we have a map ahead of what's coming. 
>> Absolutely. Coral davenport, we'll have you back again to talk further about all the data. Thank you very much. 
>> Good to be here.

>>> We're in democracy plaza in new york and across the country democracy has been in action at the polling booths already with early voting. So, who's winning? Joining me now with all the early voting stats, michael McDONALD PROFESSOR OF GOVERNMENT And politics at george mason university and head of the u.S. Elections project. Welcome back. I guess it's all about you, because have to ask you about the latest national tolley, michael. What do you know? 

[00:29:20]


>> We've got over 25 million people that already voted and that's just from the jurisdictions that reported data, so we're probably much higher than the 25 million. 
>> Okay. What about florida, party breakdown, do you know the numbers? 
>> Let's look at the states now, the democrats are leading if we ok at party registration which isn't quite the same as self-identified party from a poll and we see the domes do have about a 2 1/2 percentage point lead right now in the state of florida among the early voters. And if we look at some of the other states, too, things are looking pretty good for obama in most of them. If we just take the top-line number. However, if you look at 2008, obama was doing much better at this point in time, so the democrats are really, you know, I would say have to be aittle bit concerned in florida at this point. It's not -- 
>> yeah. 
>> -- Good for them as 2008. It's going to be a very close election there. 
>> We were throwing up the numbers there in colorado but, you know, it all begins in iowa. I would love to take a look at the numbers from iowa. 
>> Iowa, we've got a large number of ballots in as well, and if you look at the numbers it looks very good for obama from the top-line number. However, obama's not doing as well as he did in 2008. I mean, that's a general trend across the country. We knew obama would not win be seven percentage points in this election like he did in 2008 so we've seen the margins draw down in all of the states and that's what we're seeing in iowa. There are troubling signs for obama here as well which is over the last few days more republicans are returning their ballots, they're catching up in terms of the returned ballots -- 
>> is that true in ohio? 
>> We don't have good information out of ohio so i can't tell you that, but we're seeing the trend in colorado, iowa, north carolina, and we're seeing it in florida among the mail-in ballots, and denver a lot of mail-in ballotsn the table at this point. 
>> ALL RIGHT, michael McDonald, thanks for the weigh-in. We'll see you again. That's a wrap for "weekends with al witt."

=======================================================

Ofby getting a look aa snake. 
>> We're on a chase to remove a venomous snake from a local school. 
>> There are infinite hiding places. This is definitely want a stake would come to an area like this. 
>> Letter, we go to the northern territory and spend some time with a crocodile handler. 
>> One day, we wilhave enough members in the wild. 
>> We begin our show in one of the most iconic cities in the world. But we are not going to be spending time at the upr house opera house. We are going to see what it is like to be a snake wrangler in the biggest city in australia. It is a beautiful spring day in sydney. And with the sun shining today, it doesn't take long for this next to come out. Welcome to a typical workday. 
>> We have a red bellied blacksnake. 
>> Rob is a snake catcher. 

[00:02:00]


>> Once yohim, you have to grab the snake. 
>> It is time to go to a local school where they had a black snake coming out of the walls. Rob locates the hiding spot right away. 
>> There is a gap in there. All of this looks like the concrete slab of the building. In between the brickwork, there is a hiding place probably goes all the way along the wall. When you have a situation like this, you have infinite hiding places. That is exactly why snakes go into an area like this. I can guarant -- 
>> luckily for robb, one of the teachers was able to spot the state. With the cell phone picture, he was able to determine if it was an average sized red bellied blacksnake. His plan is to clear the area so that the snakend come out and lay in the sun again. That will take a few hours, so in the meantime, he takes us to a nearby park. 
>> When europeans first arrived to settle australia, they came off the boat, and one of the first creatures there would have encountered was a tiger snake. 
>> He removed this make yesterday. Tiger's makes love frogs, so they can be found near water. They can handle cold weather quiteell and can be found as far south as tasmania are up in the snowy mountains. Rob then did something that gave me the chills. He picked up the state with his bare hands. Rob's trick is to t the ske under the least amount of stress. By doing that, he keeps himself much safer. 

[00:04:29]


>> You can get him some uncomfortable, but you never want to be complacent. 
>> While we wait for things to clear up back in town, we take a look at eastern brown snake. This little snake cost a lot of commotion. She made her way into a little cavity near a he. Brown snakes have a reputation for containing a very strong venom, so any time he hears they are in a residential area, he is quick to locate it. 
>> Like lightning. You see what she is doing? She is living up to her reputation of putting up a big show. 
>> She has the ability to go around quicker than a larger stake be dead because she is so light-bodied, when she moves around, I can control her easily. She is going to open her mouth, it will look kind of scary, but all she is trying to do is get away. 
>> Brown snakes are the main species in sydney that he will remove from backyards, businesses, and schools. 
>> You have to keep your eye on them. They can be aggressive. They are in their homes. 
>> While rob shows us these snakes, he still has a school on his mind. Coming up next, it is back to school. We see if his wit and c strategy works out. 

[00:08:04]


>> A comeback to "wild about animals." We have been spending our day going around sydney with rob. At a local high school, there is a snake reported. 
>> Rob thought that the best solution would be to clear the area and allow the state to come back to bask in the sun. 
>> We might get maybe four fatalities a year, if that. It is not really a major problem. 
>> The reason they named the snake, they considered them death. Along the way, people started calling it a dead snake. 
>> His passion for such an intimidating species drives him to educate people about the realities of snakes. 
>> I am the guy that comes between snakes and people. 
>> He feels he is protecting snakes from people. 
>> The way people think, the farmer mentality. A snake is a dead snake. I have always hated that saying. Snakes are nowhere near the threat that people think they are. 
>> It has been a few hours, so we are open now that the snake has come out to warm up in the sunlight. Rob's plan has worked. He is in sight. 

[00:10:25]


>> She was not that hard to catch. Anyways, there we go. 
>> All the red-bellied blacksnakes are venomous, but they are by far the least the end of the venomous snakes in australia. 
>> Not a very risky species. No single fatality on medical record from one of these. You do not want it on a playground full of kids and I'm sure we can relocate her where she can have a much better life away from school kids. 
>> It is another day atork for him. He will report this snake and then move him away from civilization. Tomorrow, he will wait for his phone to ring with the next call for help. Coming up next, one dangerous profession to another. We visit a crocodile handler in darwin. Darwin. 

[00:13:34]


>> Welcome back to "wild about animals." We just spend some time with rob the snake capture. Saltwater crocodiles are at the top of the food chain in australia. When dealing with these prehric killing machines, it is best to stay on your toes at all times. 
>> All my handlers can go into this state because it is direct contact with crocodiles. 
>> She is used to direct contact with crocodiles. She is a crocodile handler in darwin, australia. That means dealing with one of the most notorious and aggressive predators in the world. 
>> You want to find out where they're bad points are, where they attack from. 
>> She and two other handlers today are with the newest handler. 
-- Crocodile. To put that in perspective, about two feet longer than the average car. 
>> We believe he may have been shot at in the wild. 
>> By slapping the water, luke is getting wendell's attention. 
>> He knows exactly what is going on. 
>> One of the challenges that they have is a simple one, patients. 
>> These guys have got all the time in the world. He knows exactly where he needs to be d where he shoulnot be. 

[00:15:42]


>> Where you should not be. That is the magical question. They have been down to a science. 
>> When they launched out of the water, they can come out three- quarters the length of their body in an instant. We know that we have to be that far away from them at all times. If we come within a meter or something like that, that is within his strike area. 
>> There are an estimated 200,000 saltwater crocodiles living in the area and the highest numbers are in the northern territory. Wendell, like all the other crocodile's here, will not become tame or develop any loyalty. 
>> Oftentimes, people think it is possible to tame these animals, train them like a dog. I would never trust them, they are so unpredictable. 
>> You may notice that when bill is missing part of leg. Chopper is another local crocodile. 
>> He can easily shoot himself high. I amn a safe environment as well. 

[00:17:47]


>> And that sound is omething that anyone with experience around crocodiles will no. 
>> My heart races. I get a littlevous but I am confident. Hearing that out in the wild, it is like hearing a lion roar. Where is that coming from? My heart races. 
>> For her, a day at work has herself surrounded by little teeth. And big teeth. It is a job that she has dreamed about. To be up close with one of the world's best predators. Coming up next, a plan to save as many indoles from extinction. 

[00:20:26]


>> Tasmania is on the australian island located south of the country's main land. One native animal is in trouble but there is a plan in say -- in place to save their species. Recently, the tasman and double population has decreased rapidly. There is a tumor disease that had been wiping out the population steadily. So fast and wild tasmania and devils -- 
>> this is a 1,200 acre site where healthy animals are brought to repopulate and lived. This was started as a safe house, far away from the site of the tumor disease. 
>> On the forefront of the population is the australian reptile park. The park now has over 20 tasmania and devils. Many will be relocated into the wild to help ensure the species has enough numbers to survive. 
>> Want to make sure there is not a runt. 

[00:22:28]


>> Human contact. 
>> There are others that receive more hands-on care. 
>> They get fed five times a day. 
>> Hand of raising allows the part to have a few on-site that people can see. 
>> Even until 18 months old, they are quite happy to be around each other. But when they get close to two years, they want to become independent of one another. 
>> And they can climb. 
>> This action is quite natural. Baby devils look to hang onto their mom with their paws and with their mouth, really serving as another tool. 
>> They like to hang on to something. They do not like to call. 
-- To fall. 
>> One thing kelly tries to teach people, especially americans, is what tasmania and devils are really like. 
>> Everybody thinks about the cartoon character. He is not reflect that. They are not the best runners in the world. Their legs are completely on a proportion with them, so they cannot run fast. 

[00:24:36]


>> Seeing them up close helps the park and the devil arc. Now these animals may have a chance for the future. 
>> If we can keep breeding them, maybe one day their numbers will be strong enough to be back in th 
>> and impact on australia is significant. 
>> We can see that we can save a species. Devil arc was created because we needed a safety net for the animals. Mainly, we do not want to lose an australian icon. It would be really awful to lose it. Strike two

We bevel cut the sides and added a roundover all on the bottom for a little shadow effect. Next it's on to the lid where we made the burl veneer panel and then surrounded it with a bevel-cut frame and finally added a decorative inlay strip.

They're a lot of fun and you get to learn a lot of techniques. Plus, this one esn't require very much material. I love this little box too. Right away you notice the lid with its tapered sides, that great-looking veneer panel, and even some inlay strs that we've added. We added a little personality to the sides of the box. 

[00:02:00]


We bevel cut the sides. Then we added splines at the miters to give them a little strength and some nice decoration. The last thing, we carried that burl veneer over to the inside of the box. With all this g on, you might think it's a hard project to build, but we've got tips and techniques that make it easy. It all starts with a good set of plans. If you'd like a set of the free plans for this burl veneer top contoured keepsake box, just go to our website, woodsmithshop.Com. You've got the plans so it looks like it's time to head to the shop and start building. I'll get on it. This box has a lot of interesting features, but it all starts with the base. It has the tapered sides and this interesting joinery on the corner, but the base starts out as just four basic pieces of wood. That's two pieces for the front and back and then two pieces for the ends. The key thing here is all these pieces are a custom thickness, 5/8 inch thick. To make sure they're all exactly the same thickness, I started out with one long board and sent it through the planer a few times to get down to 5/8 inch thick. Then I cut the four pieces to rough length. I cut one more piece for a test piece. With all these pieces cut, I can start to work on the joinery. The first part of that is to cut a groove for the bottom. The bottom is 1/4-inch plywood, which is a little less than 1/4 inch thick. So to cut it, I've installed a rip blade on the table saw. A rip blade has a nice flat grind on the teeth. And I've set the outside tooth of the blade so it's 3/8 inch from the fence. Then I can make one pass on the test piece and on all four pieces for the base. 

[00:04:03]


After that first groove is cut, I'm going to make a second pass to widen the groove to fit the thickness of the plywood. So in order to do that, I just tap the fence over and make a second pass on the test piece only. Now for the moment of truth: Does the plywood bottom fit in the groove? Yes, with a good friction fit. So now all I haveo do is go ahead and cut that same groove on all four pieces for the base and then set up to miter the pieces to final length. After cutting the groove on all four pieces, the next step is to cut a miter on the ends of all the pieces to create a mitered corner at all four corners of the box. To do that, I've installed a crosscut blade in the saw and tilted the blade to 45 degrees. Then I also installed an auxiliary fence on the miter gauge and added a piece of adhesive backed sandpaper to hold the piece steady, and then this fence also pushes the waste piece all the way through the blade. When I'm all set up, all I have to do is cut the miter. After cutting a miter on one end of all the pieces, the next step is to cut all these pieces to final length. The key thing here is to cut th second miter so the front and the back are exactly the same length and the two ends are exactly the same length. To do that I've installed a stop block on the auxiliary fence. All I have to do is put the mitered end up against the stop block and make the cut. I'll make the second cut on both the front and the back. 

[00:06:08]


I've got all the pieces mitered to final length. Now I need to dry assemble them in order to get a measurement for the bottom. But as you can see, with mitered corners, this gets to be kind of mess and I can't hold it together very well. There's a little trick for doing that. I applied painters tape to each of the miters, and I just roll this over. It will hold it together so I can get my measurements for the bottom. Then I can cut this plywood bottom to final size when it's cut, I'll just unroll everything and put a little glue on the miter joints and a couple little dabs along the groove for the bottom. Then I'll slip the bottom in place and just roll these pieces right up on top and tape it together nice and tight and just go ahead and let the glue dry. With the box all assembled, I can go ahead and cut slots for splines that go with the corners. Those splines reinforce the miter joints. If you use a contrasting wood, it adds a nice decorative touch to the box. To cut them, I've made a simple jig. It has two pieces that cradle the box. Ere's a vertical piece that rides against the rip fence. I've gone ahead and set the rip fence in position for the lowest row of slots and I've made some test cuts to establish the blade height. Now I'm all set to go ahead and cut the slots. I make a single pass and rotate the box and keep working my way around. I've got the first row of slots all cut. 

[00:08:08]


Now all I need to do is reposition the rip fence, and I can cut the remaining two rows just the same way. I went ahead and cut some spline material so the thickness matches the size of my slots. I'll dab a little glue on each one ! And slip them right in place. Then to hold them in place, I cut this wedge block from a piece of scrap. It fits right into the corner and I'lbring a thin piece in on the outside. Then I can add a clamp and I can hold all three splines in place while the glue sets. Once the glue dries, I'll bring in the flush trimming saw and go ahead and cut those splines flush. Once I've cut the splines flush, I'll go ahead and sand the box side smooth. Before I shape the box sides, I need to cut a mortise for a continuous hinge that will hold the lid. To do that I'm going to use a trim router. I've equipped it with a small straight bit. Even though this is a small router, these thin box sides don't offer much support. To solve that, I'm going to add a couple support blocks, just some scrap pieces I'll stick on with carpet tape. With those in place, I'm ready to rout. I't the bit to cut the full depth of the hinge since there's no mortise in the lid. I'll rout out the mortise and square up the ends with a chisel. With the mortise cut for the hinge, you can go ahead and start shaping the box. That starts here at the bottom. The first thing to do is create this roundover and a foot on the bottom of the box. 

[00:10:09]


I did that over at the router table where I installed a 3/8-inch roundover bit and made a pass along one edge, turned the box, and made another pass until I'd gone all the way around. The result is this nice roundover and a small shoulder that forms the foot. The next step is to bevel the box sides. To do that I've set the saw blade to an 11-degree angle, and I've adjust rip fence so that when i make a pass, the bevel cut will intersect the top of the roundover. So I'm all set to bevel the sides. I'll make a pass on one side. Then flip the box end for and bevel the other side. Now all I need to do is readjust the rip fence. Hen I can bevel off the ends in the same way. A little light sanding and we're ready to move on to the lid. Bryan, I've got the box all set to go. The thing I like about this box are these beveled sides. It gives it an interesting, unique look. We're ready now to add the lid. I've got one here. I'm going to get that in place. This lid couldn't be simpler. It's this beveled and shaped hardwood frame that wraps around the figured veneer panel. The veneer is a great choice because it's easier to find andess expensive than solid figured stock and it's easy to work with. We wanted to set the veneer off so we added this decorative inlay strip around the edges. They're a great choice for customizing the box. You can change up the look completely by adding different veneers or different inlay strips. The veneer panel is a place to start, so I'm going to the workbench and get going on it. Bryan, I think we've got everything ready to go to get these veneer panels going. It looks kind of challenging dealing with veneers and thin stuff sliding around, so instead of trying to be exact, we'll start out with this oversized piece of plywood. 

[00:12:10]


It's extra wide and extra long, which makes thinasier. We'll just cut some veneers to match. We need a nice looking veneer for the outside, but it also has a veneer on the inside, so we need to veneer both sides of that plywood. To get all that stuck down, we're going to use a hide glue, a more modern version of hide glue. This is pretty nice. It goes on pretty easily. It gives you a nice open time so you can shift around your veneer if you need to. It doesn't soak in quite so much as other glues, which means it's nice for accepting stains and finishes. It might soak in a little bit, so to deal with that, we're going to use this melamine covered particle board. The glue won't stick to it. These act as calls so when we apply the clamps, we're going to get a nice even pressure. Things will be flat and smooth. To start this we're going to build this sandwich. Start out with the call. We'll a piece of veneer and the plywood panel. The process is, going through it, put a bunch of glue on your panel and then spread it with a notched trowel, sort of a spreader, and get it even. Then we'll flip that over on top of the veneer and repeat the process. Get some more glue on here, spread it out a little bit mor and your next piece of veneer. Add that veneer and the last call. Completed our sandwich so it's rea to be clamped up. A whole lot of clamps go on there. The more clamps the better to get even clamping pressure. Once that's dried, you want it to be nice and good and dry. It's an oversized panel. We head to the table saw and cut it to final size and finish up all the detail work on it. Let's get to work for real and get this glue and clamps on. Once the glue on the panel was good and dry, I spent a couple minutes at the table saw cutting the panel to final size. I made it ready for the next couple steps and that's a pair of rabbets. I've already cut one of those rabbets. I cut around the outside edge of the panel. 

[00:14:11]


To do that I used a straight bit at the router table and made a pass along all four edges. Once the rabbet was complete, it formed a tongue. That tongue fits a kerf that's going to be cut in the frame pieces and positioned everything so I have a nice flush surface. Now the panel is ready for the second rabbet. That's going to be cut around the inside edge of the panel, and it's going to be sized for a piece of inlay. It's going to wrap around there like this. I'm going to use the same straight bit as I used before. I've already repositioned the fence, so I'm ready for the cut. Just like before, I'll rout the rabbet along all four edges, holding the panel firmly against the table. That takes care of the rabbet. I'll take a look here. We've got a great fit for the inlay. I'm ready to head to the bench and glue it in place. The router table make quick work of cutting the rabbet. Now it's ready for the inlay strips. To cut those inlay strips and miter the ends, I made this cutting jig. It's got a groove and holds the trim strip right in there. Press it in place, flip it over, and then we'll use a chisel to nip that right off of there. Then we can slide it down and do the other end. Then we can glue it in place on the panel. To do that we want to use molding and trim glue. It's very tacky, sets up really fast. Great for this kind of work. It's good that it sets up fast because it's hard to clamp these inlay strips in place. So you put in the glue and hold it in place till it sets. Once all the inlay is in place, we're ready for the hardwood frame. We're going to do that at the table saw. Having the inlay strips around this veneer sets it off, but what's going to set off the whole panel 

[00:16:13]


is this detailed hardware frame that wraps around it. The frame part is pretty simple. I planed them to final thickness and they're cut to final width. All the frame parts are extra long. I'll miter those to final length later because there's a couple steps to do first. That starts with cutting a groove on the inside edge of all the frame parts. The groove is sized to match the tongue on the panel. It's located so that once the panel is installed, everything is nice and flush. To cut the groove, I'm going to use a rip blade. I've already set the height to cut the groove to the correct depth, and I've set my rip fence to position the groove correctly. So I'm ready to make the cuts. I'll use a push block to push the workpiece safely over the blade, making sure to keep the top face against the rip fence. I've completed the groove on the inside face of all the frame pieces, but there's one last step before I can miter them to length. Let me show you what I'm talking about. On the inside of the frame, I need to cut this small bevel. That really sets off th veneer on the inside. The nice thing is, it's an easy cut to make. I've already tilted my saw blade 30 degrees, and I've positioned the rip fence for the cut. Just like before, I'll use a push block on each workpiece and keep the top face against the rip fence. Cutting the bevel on the inside face of all the workpieces was pretty quick. The next step is to miter all the pieces to wrap around the panel. To do that I've tilted my miter gauge to 45 degrees and I've added an auxiliary fence. There's sandpaper on here to prevent the workpiece from slipping. The first step is to miter one end of each workpiece. Cutting a miter on one end of each workpiece was the easy part. The challenging part is cutting the miters at the opposite end so you get a good tight fit around the panel and that the miters are nice and tight. To help with that, I switched my miter gauge to the other slot. 

[00:18:16]


I've re-angled it. To help out with the accuracy, I've added a mitered stop block. That's going to allow me to sneak up on the cut d ensure that the pieces on the opposite side of the frame are exactly the same length. To make the cut, I'll butt the workpiece into the stop block and make a pass through the blade. That takes care of the last miter. Now I can check the fit of the entire assembly. That looks pretty good. I can head over to the bench and glue everything up. Once the glue dries, I can head back to the table saw and complete some final shaping on the lid. With the lid all glued up, I'm ready to do some shaping here at the table saw. What I want to do is create this raised profile around the top of the lid. That's going to take a couple cuts. The first cut creates a shoulder around the inside edge. After raising the blade for a shallow cut, I'll make a single pass along each edge. The second cut is this bevel. That's going to meet at the bottom of the shoulder. After tilting the blade and repositioning the fence, I'll make a pass around each edge. Adding this beveled profile to the lid really gives it a great look. A little sanding and I'll head to the router table and finish up the final shaping. This lid is really starting to take shape. Like the top of the lid, the bottom of the lid requires a couple cuts. Let me show you what I mean. The first cut is a shallow rabbet around the outside edge of the lid. To make that cut, I've installed a straight bit in the router table, I've raised it for an 1/8-inch cut and positioned the fence for a 1/2-inch wide rabbet. I'll make a single pass along each edge, pressing the lid firmly against the table. That takes care of the rabbet along the bottom edge that's going to allow the lid to rest firmly against the box. 

[00:20:17]


There's one last thing to do, and that's round over this outside edge to provide a smooth, comfortable grip. For that I've installed a roundover bit in the router table. Just like before, I'll press the lid firmly against the table for each pass. That completes the roundover, so we'll take a look here. You see we've got a nice smooth roundover. All that's left is to check the fit on the box. There we go. We've got a great fit for a great looking box. Whenever I need to create a large hole in a workpiece, I usually turn to my set of forstner bits like this one. They do a really good job of cutting smooth, accurate holes. But I'm running into a problem here because the hole I need to create is 2 1/2 inches in diameter, but my largest forstner bit is only 2 inches in diameter. The solution is to use a two-step process that uses a hand-held router and two common router bits. The first bit is a rabbeting bit, and you can see that here. The rabbeting bit consists of a cutting edge and a bearing on top that controls the width of the rabbet. This rabbeting bit is set for 1/4-inch rabbet, so that means I can enlarge the size of the hole by 1/2 inch overall. I'm going to start by cutting a rabbet around the edge of the hole. You can see the rabbeting bit created a stepped hole here. Now the upper part of the hole is at the final size I need. I can't use the rabbeting bit anymore because there isn't going to be any material for the bearing to ride against. That's where the second step of the process and the second bit come into play. For that I'm going to use a pattern bit like this. The pattern bit has straight cutting edges and a bearing on the shank end. 

[00:22:19]


That bearing is set flush with the cutting edges. The bearing is going to follow the shoulder of the rabbet like a pattern to finish off the rest of the hole. Let me show you how it works. You canee I have a smooth, accurate hole and it's just the size that I need it. Working on a long workpiece can be a bit of a challenge, especially if you want to work on the edge of it. You clamp the piece in your vise, but when you push down on the end, it moves out of position. So a simple solution is an old-style hand screw. Bring it into place, lock it down. Now that workpiece isn't going anywhere, so you can do ever you need to do. To finish o the box, I added a brass continuous hinge along the back edge. Then I'll add a little brass chain to support the lid. Now I can go ahead and finish the box with some spray lacquer, both the box and the lid. To finish it all off, I'm going to put a piece of black felt inside the box, and I have a beautiful burl veneer lid on a keepsake box. I hope you got some good tips on today's show.

=======================================================

Thes delivering closing arguments, making their final case for your vote. It's an election about the economy, so let's look at the evidence. Jobs. President obama's argument, he's gained back every job lost under his watch. That's quite a feat, but romney says not good enough. 
>> We're going to create 12 million new jobs and more take-home pay. 
>> Reporter: 
>> How is that possible, major economic growth. The economy grew at a 2% annual rate during the third quarter, better but not nearly enough to significantly boost hiring. Romney will be much more than that to keep his jobs promise. How about housing. Prices in some areas are rising, foreclosures slowing, but this is america and what will really get the economy going again is you. Consumer spending rising, consumer confidence the best in four years. There's no doubt president obama inherited an economy in crisis, and his supporters will tell you he's turned things around. 
>> We have made real progress. 
>> His final argument, he deserves another four years to finish the recovery. Mitt romney says his business experience and his big ideas are what america needs. You've heard their closing arguments. Now it's decision time. And that makes you the jury, and the jury in ohio may determine the te of the nation for the next four years. In ohio that's where we find my good friend ali velshi, cnn's chief business correspondent and john avlon is there with him as well. You have to go back to 1960 until youd the last time the winner of ohio did not end up in the white house. Unemployment rate in ohio 7%, guys, below the national average. It was 8.6 president when president obama took office and shot up to more than 10%. Ali, that looks like a positive trend for the president. How does governor romney make the case that it would get way better way sooner if ohio makes a change for romney, ali? 
>> Well, he does it by approximating to some egree. He does it by saying this state has prospered under a republican governor. Look, this is a state that is split. It's a virtual dead heat. Obama's got a bit of a lead, but as you know it's within that statistical margin of error so it could be a few points off one way or the other. It will come down to who comes out to vote. The last few days will be about encouraging those who have already decided. There's very little left in terms of evidence as to what you could do to possibly tell people I'm your guy. The question is you are sort of leaning towards me. Do I go out and do it. Mitt romney has made some errors in the last week or so in ohio, particularly with this issue of jeep and chrysler, getting money in the auto bailout and supposedly transferring manufacturing, having intention to transfer manufacturing to china. That is not playing well in ohio. 

[00:02:45]


>> Let's talk about how the polls are playing in ohio. It's not possible to overstate the importance of ohio in determining who is going to win tuesday. No republican has ever won the presidency without taking a state. Let's take a look at very latest data. A cnn/orc poll of likely voters shows president obama with a three-point lead, but that's still inside the margin of error. This is a dead heat. That's why we call them swing states. A separate nbc news/"wall street journal"/marist poll shows a wired margin for the president, a six-point lead. John, do one of these guys have the clear momentum heading into tuesday, or is it still just absolutely up for grabs? 
>> Well, christine, let's put all the partisan spin aside because there's a lot of that going on in the final days and hours of an election. What we've seen in the polls is president obama having a small but steady lead. Mitt romney has been unable to kind of reverse that momentum here in ohio. A couple different reasons. Take a look at poll. President obama big lead with women. Governor romney, big lead with men. Governor romnehas a two-point edge with independent voters in our poll, but president obama has an almost 20-point lead with self-described moderate voters. 
>> That's interesting that there's a distinction those two. 
>> A very important distinction and hasn't happened in political history. Tea party moving to the right. We're just in the toledo where the jeep plant s.Unemployment was 13% in that city when president obama took office. Now it's at 7% rate. Manufacturing, the middle class, these are the sweet spots of a democratic pitch, and they have been able to say that mitt romney, a state where the bain ads, have had an effect would not be a good stewart that have reinvestment. President ama's core argument here is economic and it's also saying, look, the policies that mitt romney will put in play are the same policies that got us in trouble in the first place. The raw politics of this are fueling the ground game right now. 

[00:04:48]


>> Let's talk about the numbers. The u.S. Economy added 171,000 jobs in october as you both well know, surprisingly strong number. It may end up being the final cal football, really the last thing you can give a speech on or cite a press release on. Both candidates wasted no time spinning the numbers. Listen. 
>> He said he was going to lower the unemployment rate down to 5.2% rht now. Today we learned that it's actually 7.9%, and that's 9 million jobs of what he promised. 
>> This morning we learned that companies hired more workers in october than at any time in the last eight months. 
>> So lvhi, do voters care or is it just noise? 
>> It's a jobs report you can spin is it either way. U wanted to say the unemployment rate is higher, it could, as the romney camp did. They didn't mention, all day they didn't mention the 171,000, and you didn't hear the unemployment rate being discussed by the obama campaign. What we found on the road from florida all the way through the swing states, through virginia and to here is that largely people areerested in two things with employment, their own trend and their community's trend, right, because they know they prosper, particularly small businesses, if unemployment is lower in their community. We were in florida where the unemployment rate is higher than the national average, but housing had improved and things were looking better. We were in virginia where unemployment is lower, but a lot of that is due to government spending, and now we're in ohio where as you know, in youngston, that plant that was almost shut down, three shifts making the chevy crews. The toledo plant, they associate this with jobs and prosperity, and the auto industry and the other manufacturing industries, what you have is generations of people working in those industries so the trend does actually matter, and the trend favors president obama right now. 
>> So john, you close it up for me. Ohio. You guys are there. It is so important. I mean, people in ohio must feel like the belle of the ball. Everybody wants their vote. They have spent so much advertising money. 

[00:06:59]


>> They know it. 
>> If romney loses ohio, john, can he win the election? 
>> The path is very, very, very difficult without ohio, and that's why the obama camp has made it a fire wall, which is the reversal of political trends in the past. Usually ohio is the republican firewall in the election. A couple things, the fact that ohio use unemployment rate is lower than the nation's, very rare, hasn't happened in decades. Obama campaign has invested heavily in early voting, president obama had a very significant lead among those voters, so the romney camp is going to be all about election day. That's their -- that's their long ball but it could not be closer. Every vote matters here in ohio. Both camps doing everything they can to get out their vote on tuesday. 
>> Every vote everywhere. Get out and vote, everybody. Vote early. We'll talk to you again at 1:00 eastern time so I'll see you again soon. Thanks for dropping by. A smaller more efficient government or an invisible hand to assist and protect those in need? President obama and mitt romney, guys, they have very fundamentally different visions of government and what it should do for you. It is capitalism on trial.

>>> With three days until the election both candidates offer a fundamentally different vision for america. The question for voters, by brand of capitalism do you want? Mitt romney is pledging smaller government, less regulation. He says that will unleash the power of the private sector. President obama says government needs to be there to help those who have fallen behind and make sure that everyone gets a fair shot. 
>> We've almost forgotten what a real recovery looks like. What americans can achieve when limit government instead of limiting the dreams of our fellow americans. 
>> As long as there are families working harder but falling behind, as long as there's a child anywhere in this country who is languishing in poverty and barred from opportunity, our fight goes on. 
>> It's time to choose your capitalism, folks. Voters say the number one issue in this election is jobs, the economy, but many of the economic forces at play have been building for decades. Not the past four or five years. Globalization has sent millions of u.S. Jobs overseas. A struggling education system has left many americans unprepared for the high-tech knowledge jobs of today and income inequality is growing. The wealth gap between the richest americans and the typical family more than doubled over the past 50 years. A recent report from the economic policy institute found the rich were 288 times wealthier than the median household in 2010. Eduardo porter is a columnist for the "new york times." Welcome to the program. You say in america we've built a more cut-throat form of capitalism than other industrialized nations, as you put, it quote, more than citizens of other countries, we fend to believe that success, like failure, is deserved. By eduardo, will the outcome of this election really change the fundamental nature of our government, of the kind of capitalism that we've created? 
>> I would say no because the capitalism we've created is not a function of a democratic administration or a republin administration. In fact, over the last 30 years through democratic and republican democratic administrations we have built a form of capitalism that is consistently different than that experienced in many other parts of the industrialized world so the fact that our capitalism is somewhat harsher with conditions you see in other industrialized countries it's not a republican or democratic construction. It's a construction we've done over three decades. The u.S. Safety net is worn out. When it comes to spending on social programs the u.S. Ranks 25th. France, sweden, austria spend much more on the u.S. Social net as a percentage of the economies. Europe's economy is in recession. The u.S. Is still growing. Maybe that's proof that our cut-throat version of capitalism works despite the social costs. 

[00:14:14]


>> One of the reasons the american economy is now growing is the government has done substantial stimulus spending whereas one of the reasons that europe is in such bad shape is that they have actually been cutting government spending from their former baseline, so, in fact, in the past couple of years, the trends have been -- have been opposite what they have been for 30 years. The europeans have been much more austere, you know, countries like britain cutting government spending whereas in the united states there was a big effort, which is now sort of like dwindling, but there was initially a very big stimulus effort. 
>> Just 30 seconds left, the fundamental issue here is americans want the benefits of big government, medicare, social security, jobless checks when they need it, loans to buy a house, loans to go to college, but they also want small government, and that small government thing resonates, you know, we don't want to be like europe. You know, it's almost a case of politicians lying to voters in some cases. They basically tell us we can have everything. 
>> Well, that's right, and, you know, the small government desire is very well entrenched in the united states, and that is a very -- a very strong political driver. So when you tell them, look, you know, if you increase the tax take, you know, by 10% of the economy, you'll be able toet these better social outcomes, first thing they see is higher taxes, and there's a very ng reaction against that. 
>> Nicto see you this morning. Have a really great weekend. Thank you. 
>> Thanks for having me. 
>>> This election will likely be decided by a handful of key battleground states. One of them my home state of iowa.

[00:19:17]


>>> A hand full of swing states will likely decide this election. Let me show you how different these states are when it comes to jobs. Let's head out west first, nevada. The highest unemployment states of the tossup states, 11.8%. Colorado closer to the national average at 8%. Ohio, we just told you, 7% there, and in the unemployment rate has been drifting lower. In florida, 8.7%. Finally, iowa, my home state, it has one of the lowest jobless rates in the country at 5.2%. There the problem is finding workers. My friend poppy harlow is in des moines this morning. That seems like a good problem to have, finding workers. A 5.2% unemploynt rate is enviable. 
>> Reporter: It is. But it's not just about that top line number here. We were at a local small business, they make steel ucts, and the guy there told me, you know, I'm having a hard time finding the people with the skills to fill my jobs. At the same time, he is enormously concerned about the deficit, about government spending, and about debt. He told me if I ran my business the way the government runs its house, I'd be out of business, and that is what we hear across iowa, city to city, whether they lean right or left, they hate the debt here, and I spoke to this one guy in des moines, bob bradshaw. I think he sums it up pretty well. Listen. Is it the jobs or ist the deficit? 
>> Both. You know, if we're not bringing it in, we shouldn't spend it. And if it's, you know, tough on us to make it better for our kids, I'm willing to sacrifice now to make it better for our kids. 
>> So interesting. And also people talk about the quality of the jobs, too, right? So even though the unemployment rate is 5.2%, worried about how much debt we have, the deficit. They're al worried that the quality of the jobs that are available aren't maybe what they used to be. 
>> They are. And they said, look, poppy, it's not just about that 5.2%, it's about the jobs that we're getting that are being created. They're lower paying jobs, the hours are less. And that's a very big deal here, christine.

>>> a live picture of new york city, saturday morning in new york city just days after super storm sandy ripped through the east coast, we're here with a live edition of "your bottom line." This is far from over here. Catastrophe experts say the storm could rack up $50 billion in damages. Millions of you are still without power. And the paper work is just getting started. 
>> We lost our house, our pool, and god only knows what else. 
>> Unbelievable. It's like a war zone. 
>> I'm not exactly sure where to go from here besides calling the insurance company. 
>> That's the first step. Then comes calculating the loss and cashing the che in sandy's wake, tens of thousands of homeowners are now asking if a tree falls in a hurricane, who pays? 
>> If the tree hits your house, yo call your insurance company and file a claim. You're going to be covered for the damage that that tree does to your house, for anything that's in the house, and for the cost of removing that tree. 
>> Jean salvatore of the insurance information institute. 
>> How does wind damage -- that comes under your homeowner policy. 
>> Correct. Wind is covered. Wind is one of those sard disasters that's covered. 
>> With sandy's wind came water. 
>> Most people buy flood insurance from the national flood insurance program, so if you have a flood insurance poll circumstance you're going to be covered for that. 
>> About 14% of home owners in the northeast have flood insurance. More than the 5% who were covered when irene howled through. Will some people who don't have flood insurance be able to get relief from the federal government? 
>> People need to get in touch with fema and to find out what is available to them. There might be some sort of disaster aid or loans. 
>> Another enduring image of sandy. Flooded cars. 
>> You're covered for a lot of natural disasters under the comprehensive portion of your car insurance. So that's going to cover wind it's going to cover flooding. 
>> Keep notes. Find as many receipts as you can. Be thorough with the claims adjuster. No damage is too small to mention. Keep your patience and perspective. 

[00:27:17]


>> A home can always be rebuilt. As long as we have our lives and we're safe. 
>> Well said. Millions of americans have been affected by sandy, but millions more will be affected by a very different kind of impending disaster. This one will not cost lives and property. I want tery clear about that. But it will have powerful consequences. I'm talk about the fiscal cliff. If congress and the psident don't act by the end of the year, nearly all of you, 90% of americans, will see your taxes rise by an average of $3,500 per household. What about disaster relief? And the congressional budget office says our economy would be pushed back into recession. I want to put congress on notice here. This week, we saw something unbelievable. And I'm nong about simply these homes swallowed by sand and water, trees pulled from their roots. Lower manhattan's skyline darkened. Horrific images in america. And we also saw bipartisan cooperation. New jersey governor chris christie, one of the fiercest critics, put aside politics for the good of the residents. Both men heaping praise on each other. 
>> I cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state and for the people of our state. And heard on the phone conversation with him, I was able to witness it today personally. 
>> I think the people of new jersey recognize that he has put his heart and soul into making sure that the people of new jersey bounce back even stronger than before. 
>> Those people all there, all americans, all solving a problem together. It took a devastating superstorm to bring our political leaders together. Congress, pay attention, because the fiscal cliff is coming. It's time to fix it. Otherwise, come next election, the american people will be your judge and jury. 
>>> E back later today on "your money" at 1:00 p.M. I know you've got some smart questions and opinions, you always do. Tweet them to me now, post them on our facebook page, and I'll try to get them to you when we see you later this afternoon. "Cnn saturday morning" with randi kaye continuesight now.

Exercising your entrepreneural muscle. That's coming up next. 
>>> Hi there, everyone. I'm j.J. Ramberg. Welcome to "your business." The show dedicated to giving you tips and advice to help your small business grow. Halloween is coming, which made us think about the question, are you doing anything, even inadvertently, to scare off your customers? We want to show you a few things you could be doing better. So I ask you, what does a carnival freak show performer have in common with a modern sales professional? Maybe more than you think. Who better than a seasoned carney to show us how to seal the deal? When the moon comes up and the fog rolls in and the crowd arrives, the freak show begins. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> oh, yeah, good times. 
>> The entertainment that I do is something unlike what you would normally see in an everyday situation. I do a little bit of fire eating, fire breathing. I hammer a nail into the center of my face, drill myself in the face with a power drill. 
>> Seth carny of boston, massachusetts, is an old school carnival performer with an old school carnival knack for separating people from their money. 

[00:02:00]


>> At the carnival, we had a little running joke that it cost $2 to get in and $7 more to get out because the $2 admission to get in covered our expenses to be on the lot, but the inside money from the pitches is what paid everybody's salaries for the week to be there. 
>> Halloween is a busy season for seth. By night, he's outside performing as an evil clown, roping in the crowds at the haunted mansion. By day, he's a medieval torturer inside king richard's renaissance fair. 
>> Welcome to the torture show. I look extremely intimidating in this outfit, but it works to my advantage when I'm trying to sell because I can make fun of myself in this outfit. They love me. They really love me. I'll stand at my bone shop cart, and I'll tell people, oh, especially reserved customer, oh, you don't have to be afraid of me. I'm really just a big fat teddy bear. 
>> Teddy bear? Bone shoppe? That's right. When he's not on stage can shocking audiences with fiery torches, seth spends most of his day in front of his cart selling colorful curiosities. 
>> What sparks your fancy here? 
>> There's a lot of good stuff. 
>> Very good mix of different dead things. It makes great christmas tree ornaments. Put a little string in the back of the skull here. There is an t form to pitching. You need to be able to read people. You're not just saying, hey, give me a couple bucks. You have to say, hey, I'm going to show you something really cool, and at the end, you're going to feel like you want to give me a couple bucks, and that's okay because it's worth a couple bucks. 
>> If you expect a carnival trained pitchman like seth to take an aggressive sales approach, then you'll be surprised by his strategy. 
>> I was taught how to pitch by classic carnival pitchmen, and the way that we pitch d the way that I was taught to pitch is a soft sell. You can just be the quintessential, stereotypical car salesman that's trying to push someone into a sale. People need to be comfortable with what you're selling. They need to be comfortable with you first as a person. 

[00:04:15]


>> For seth, the soft sell starts with a tough guy costume and a large dose of self-deprecating humor. 
>> If you want to see a fat guy eat fire, breathe fire, and then hammer a nail in his face and then stick fishing hooks in his eye sockets, this will be the show for you. What do you say? Our first show is 11:30. 
>> We watched him successfully working the crowd to come see his 11:30 show. 
>> You'll have an 11:30 date today, and it will be done. 
>> Yeah, I have a date at 11:30 with two beautiful woman. You ladies have a wonderful day. First, they're looking at my costume. While they're doing that, they're listening to what I'm saying. Now I've got them really hooked. 
>> For seth, sales is all about getting people hooked, and he's very good at doing that. 
>> Yes, when people approach the bone shoppe cart, I'll gauge what people are interested in at the cart, and then I'll kind of try to gauge how their reaction is to different items. 
>> Back at his bone shoppe, he says the next step towards making a sale is recognizing that different personalities require different approaches. 
>> How a person dresses says a lot about them. So if someone's going to wear a very loud clothing to a renaissance fair, they're probably a very open type of person, very talkative type of person. 
>> I am totally going to molest you now into buying something. 
>> All right, molest away. 
>> I'll be right there to say, hey, how are you doing? Let's talk some bones. But if they are a little reserved, they might be wearing like a lighter toned clothes, very neutral colors, nothing flashy, nothing gaudy, nothing to make them stand out. I might approach that a little differently. 
>> We also have the economical one-piece skulls. Just kind of walk up very casually. Is there anything I can help you with? Do you see anything that you like? They might be a little soft-spoken at first. They might say, well, I was kind of wondering about ts. Oh, well this? I'll take it right off the shelf. 

[00:06:25]


>> What are these? 
>> We have beaver, coyote, raccoon. Any feel for you? Pick anything up and play with it. We even have minks. The minks are cute because you can make necklaces out of them. And I'll put it right in their hands and say, oh, this, you can touch it. It's okay. Hold it. And just stick it right in their hands and say, check it out. It's okay. It's dead. It's not going to hurt you. And what they are picking up on a subconscious level is they appreciate that. Th I'm taking time to speak directly with them. 
>> Finally, seth says, the conclusion comes when the customer's face and body language tell you that they're ready to buy. 
>> They will constantly be looking back at an item while you're talking about it. That's telling me that they're very interested in this item, and if the price just doesn't seem quite right to them and they're getting ready to walk away, I'll say, you know what, tell you what, just because i know you really want that, I'll make you a deal, just for you. When in reality, it's the same deal I would make for anybody. Now they feel like they're getting that extra special deal. 
>> For a carnival pitchman like seth, the line between performance and sales gets blurred. 
>> It's really a mental mind trip for the senses of I'm laughing, I'm shocked, I'm laughing, I'm shocked, and your brain just goes through a tornado of emotions. 
>> His technique may have been unusual, but his sales approach works, no bones about it. Let's fire up this week's board of director michael goldberg is a managing partner at bridge investment fund, and colleen debase is special projects director at entrepreneur.Com. Lots of puns in that too. I apologize. Thanks so much for joining us, you guys. One thing that I thought was so funny in there is he said i gauge them by their clothing, in this particular case, but there were differences, right? Different degrees to how much you dressed up, and he noticed that and sells to differently. 

[00:08:35]


>> I think it's classic. I think of my own portfolio companies, and if we only had someone like him out in front, sometimes our sales folks, when you're doing projections before the customers in front of you, you think you can sell anything, and you know what the customer needs. But it's very different when you're actually engaging with a customer, and making the sale is so tough for small businesses. In that instance, he's reading his customer, and he's going in for the sale. 
>> There's nothing passive about what he's doing. Do you have to be that active in order to me that sale? It's a lot of work. 
>> Yeah. When I was watching that, I was thinking, this might be kind of a scary segment for a lot of people, especially aspiring entrepreneurs because a lot of people who are drawn to start a business, they want to do it because they're really passionate about something. They don't have that sales background, and salesmanship can really scare people off. He's obviously not scared about this. What I would say is for anyone who is sort of scared off, kind of do what he's doing, which is to be really excited and enthusiastic. I mean, that just comes shining through when you watch this guy. I think, if you're an entrepreneur and you've created a company where you're really passionate. We always say, don't start a company unless you're passionate. If you're really passionate about your product or service, it makes the job of selling that much easier. It's contagious. You get people excited too. 
>> One thing that I thought was interesting, and he had a different reason for doing it is getting him to hold. I was thinking of this concept of escalation of commitment. Get someone to do a little something and then get him to do the next little something, and then suddenly they do the big thing that you want. Getting them to hold it may, in turn, make them more apt to buy it later on. 
>> Not every small business has a product that so easily held in the hand. But I think the concept applies to anyone. Let's say you're a software company or service company, you may be able to do a pilot. There's ways to get your product a try and buy. I think for really early stage companies that are trying to get the revenue, it's important to do something where they can touch it. It's not always going to be in the physical, but it could be a piece of software, another service, but I think the concept is right. 

[00:10:47]


>> Thanks, you guys. 
>>> Facebook can certainly be a powerful way to improve your line presence and grow your business, but what is actually bringing in sales and what's not? Here now are five tools to help you analyze your business' facebook data. One, page lever. The site provides detailed fan profiling of your page by categories like age and gender. You can try it free for 14 days before choosing a plan that fits your business needs. Two, simply measured. This tool provides excel based reports in web view so that entire reports can be shared with the team. Three, edgerank checker. You can get overall industry reports, not just reports pertaining to your business. There's a free plan available, but additional features are only accessible with the paid account. Four, buddy media. See how well your brand measures up against others in the same industry using the sites 0 to 100 scoring system. And number five, unilyzer. With it, you can track single or multiple fan pages and offers social media trending and side by side comparisons. 
>>> Who would have thought, in the middle of an election, the fitness regimen of a campaign hopeful would be getting so much attention. P90x is the workout of choice from vice presidential candidate paul ryan. It's part of the beach body family, which includes some of the most popular in-home fitness and weight loss solutions on the market today. We sat down with beach body ceo to get everything from telling it like it is to the importance of being self-aware, in this learning from the pros. ?????? No one can stop us now ?????? 
>> for anybody who works here, it's just fun to see when chili from tlc is doing brazil butt lift, and she tweets about it or paul ryan talks about his p90x. So many politicians, celebrities, actors talk about doing this, but the thing we're very careful about this is to not s the star show. The stars of this business are the customers. They're real people who don't have the financial incentive to look great in front of the camera. ???????????? be the first customer is, i think, one of the most important things for somebody to really give themselves distinction in the marketplace. It's very easy to see a need out there and think, oh, I can solve that need. Unless you viscerally feel the problem, you're not going to solve that need in a way that is going to be really competition proof. We never sort of open the doors and said, hey, come on in and pitch us your product. Instead, we looked at, again, using ourselves as the first customers. What would we like? We just develop products that are a way to gratify our own desire to live a healthier, more fit life, in a way that can also fit into regularife. As a company grows, you can't be the ceo of the business and do everything the way you did when you were just four people. So we've had a few ideas that were really good ideas that were really going to meet a certain demand, but then as they get delegated, the product doesn't end up being what you originally set out to create. The delegation cannot be weak. It's got to be really clear, really strong, and then there has to be some follow through. ???????????? 

[00:14:41]


>> one day john came into my office, and he said, I was just at a hotel, and they were offering p90x classes in the gym, and I said, well, that's funny. We don't let people do p90x classes. People want to do p90x, turbo fire, insanity, brazil butt lift, they want to do these things at their gyms. Our job is not to tell people they have to do it at home. Our job is to give people great programming they can do anywhere. We want beach body to be synonymousith results. That's all we care about. In 2012 in the spring, we launched certifications so that a personal trainer out there or group exercise instructor could have a brand attached to the work of training people. ???????????? 
>> to be self-aware. So just like the player who asked to be taken off the field if he's not running at his fastest so that he can get a play of rest, that's what's important for an entrepreneur to do. You can't be a great ceo if you're pushed to your limit and you're being short with people and you're snapping at peopl and you're not making good decisions. You've got to check out. Do you want to be the richest guy in the cemetery, or do you want to be a person who had a truly healthy, fulfilling life. That's what we try to help people and inspire them to do. 
>>> When we come back, we will answer your small business questions, including what nonprofits can learn from for profits? And with small business saturday coming up, a look at how local businesses in austin, texas are working together with local growers to get customers to shop small. moments. When you lost the thing you can't believe you lost. When what you just bought, just broke. Or when you have a little trouble a long way from home... As an american express cardmember you can expect some help. But what you might not expect, is you can get all this with a prepaid card. Spends like cash. Feels like membership. 

[00:17:11]


>>> Do you want to make sure your employees are working to the best of their ability. I learned from from a working who was working at cooking.Com. Whenever someone would turn in their project, she would say, are you sure this is done? If it is, turn it into me. It set a tone. It basically said to people, i don't accept any slackers here. Also, people loved working with her, because she set the bar high and then helped people reach it. So "it's your business" tip number 69, set expectations high from the start. Small business saturday is COMING UP ON NOVEMBER 24th. As many of you know, it's a day dedicated to getting consumers to forego the big box stores and shop small. Nowhere is the buy local movement greater than the progressive city of austin. As we first told you last year, it's there that local farmers and suppliers are working with distributors to give residents the chance to stock up with items from their own proverbial backyard. 
>> Here, piggy, wiggy, wiggy. 
>> It doesn't get more local than this. Green gate farm, located on the outskiof austin, texas, is run by erin flynn and skip conig. They raise rare breed hogs in a wide range of organically grown vegetables. 
>> In farming, there's heavy up front costs -- a barn, a tractor, fencing -- it takes a long time before you're going to see a profit. 
>> Green gate is a very small, very local business. It provides food for about 100 families a year and at the same time provides income to a fair number of other local businesses and suppliers. 
>> We're growing rare breed guinea hogs. They need organic feed. That supports the feed mill. We need fencing. That supports the supply stores. Then there's a butcher. I need to hire who's going to start making fine sausages, who wiell it to a restaurant. 
>> More and more, local business owners are discovering that spending their money within the community brings a boost to the local economy.

>> So the buy local movement is, when you buy local, the money stays in the community, so it's better for the local community to shop with small, independent vendors. 
>>> That's austin-based mason arnold. He was born an raised in austin, texas. His 6-year-old company, greenling, regularly buys produce from green gate farms along with most of the other organic farms in the region. Greene greenling distributes this locally grown produce to homes in austin. As a disstrib tore of locally grown foods, they offer familiar and exotic new produce to customers like lynette of austin, texas. 
>> It challenges me to make something I would never buy in the store. 
>> In this way, they are introducing new customers to new product from local suppliers. Robbie larkin is a local austin angel investor. He puts some of his money behind greenling and a few other slow money businesses. 
>> You put all of these businesses together. It is not just investing in a farm but in the infrastructure of food and making sure that infrastructure of food stays in your community. We provide jobs. We provide healthy jobs. It's not just how much okra are you going to get this week? 
>>> It's time to answer some of your business questions. Michael and colleen are with us once again. The first one is from richard. He writes. I have created a series of EDUCATIONAL DVDs. I would like to start a business that among other things wld SELL THESE EDUCATIONAL DVDs TO Schools as part of their lesson plants and to retail outlet's in box sets. How do I determine a value weighs when looking for investors which I would need to produce investors? 
>> Old school. I think the reality is that investors, there is going to be something in between what an entrepreneur thinks that their valuation is and what an inor thinks. A lot of accelerators are saying, for $25,000, we are going to take 10% of your company, regardless if you are SELLING EDUCATIONAL DVDs OR Anything. That's sort of setting what i think is sort of the right level on the floor. 

[00:21:37]


>> What about this idea of convertible debt? It sounds like for what he is doing, maybe this is for frien or family or somebody who is interested in the educational world. The idea of don't set the valuation at this first round. Say this is debt. When we get our next round and we have more sophisticated investors, with he will convert that into equity. Do you see that happening a lot? 
>> I see that happening a lot of times. In a local community, we have an organization called jump-start which has a green field fund that sports on the otts. They are deploying their capital income companies in the way you are saying. When the next set of investors come in, it converts into equity and it avoids the valuation conversation. That certainly is a method that a number of investors are using at an early stage. 
>> I would say I think this person is a little bit ahead of themselves in talking about valuation. It doesn't sound like they have a product yet. There is a huge lean start-up movement we have been hearing a lot about. I think theyave a bill, a minimal version of whatever this is they want to sell. They need to have something to even impress an investor with. They need to, I think the way to start is to build something and see if people will buy it and you learn a lot from that, just from having that minimum version of auct. 
>> This is from chrissy who wrote, I am in the process of obtaining a 501 c 3. Would you give the same marketing advice to a nonprofit as a for-profit business. I would in many respects. 
>> It is kind of a yes and no sort of question. Yes, the basic principles of marketing are the same whether you ar a for-profit business or a not for profit. You need to get the word out about your organization, boost your many manlg, talk about how valuable you are to whoever it is, whether it is customers or to donors. I think marketing when you are a nonprofit, it is a little bit trickier, because people are going to expect you to be really stand-up, to be really well-intentioned and to be knowable. With your marketing, you can't be really aggresve. You can't be too irreverent. Even humor can offend people. You have to be careful. 

[00:23:51]


>> One of the things that you have almost built-in is you have this mission and this cause. So it's a little bit easier often to connect on an emotional level than it would be maybe with a product or a service. So you should really play that up. 
>> I agree. The one point that colleen made was in a nonprofit, you may be marketing to potential customers of your product or service and then the donor. Many nonprofits, their revenue stream has both a donor aspect and then they are selling their services. There is going to be different messages for both. The donor side, absolutely. You are hitting them on the emotional piece and the mission piece. On the service side, you may be competing against for profit companies that are selling similar services. So I think it's really sort of honing your message to both the donor and the potential sort of customer audience. 
>> That's something for all of us to remember for everything. Your elevator pitch needs to be different for your audience, no matter what kind of company you are. 
>>> Now, a question about going big. 
>> As a small business owner who owns a real estate agency in atlanta, what's the best way to expand nationally? 
>> The first question would be, I think to think about why do you want to expand nationally? 
>> I see in my own portfolio companies, I invest in medical companies that are commercializing in the u.S. We often take a regional approach to begin with. As we think about expanding nationally, I almost think of it as a continued regional expansion. 
>> At entrepreneur, we write about franchising and cover a lot of franchises. I think that is also a route that this person could go. I don't know about real estate so much but for any business owner that has a successful business and they want to go national fl the beauty of franchising is that you pass a lot of the cost of opening new locations on to your franchisees. The draw back is you have to spend a lot of time and energy and money coming up with training programs and manuals. 
>> You as the business owner go into a different business. You aren't selling the product anymore, you are -- 

[00:25:57]


>> selling your company to perspective franchisees. 
>> If any of you have a question, go to the website. Our address is openforum.Com/yourbusiness. Hit the ask the show link to submit a question. If you would rather, you could send us an e-mail. That address is yourbusiness@msnbc.Com. 
>>> Colleen and michael both had some really helpful advice about how to improve your business. Now, let's get some great idaho yas from small business owners like you. 
>> I truly believe the best advice you can give someone is to hire up. Always hire somebody who is at least as good as they are or better at what they want them to do, because by doing so, they will never make you look bad and you will have the very best talent to do what you need to do. 
>> Prioritize the number of contacts that you make in your business to make sure your network continues to expand. It is the only way to insure you will be referred, that people will want to hire you and will remember who you are. 
>> People are traditionally terrified of economic downturns. They are not good. There are opportunities all of the time in economic downturns. One of the things that I have learned is that a receptionist a horrible thing to waste. I would never wish a reception on the country if we could avoid it. There are huge opportunities there. You simply need to figure out how to leverage it. 
>>> Do you wish you had a streamlined way to pay all of your vendors? Check out our website of the week. Invoicecentral.Com is a secure web service where you can receive and pay invoices all in one place. Save time by scheduling payments in advance and also set reminders so you never miss a payment or incur a late charge.

=======================================================

Wiing ohio and the race right now in ohio is close to a dead heat. Let's look at the two latest polls. First, our own cnn/orc poll of likely voters shows president obama with a three point lead. Now that is inside the statistical margin of error. So that's about as close as it can get. And nbc "wall street journal" poll gives the president a six point lead in ohio. A little better for obama. Still very close. Now obama may be the top prize for the candidates right now l are other important battleground states. We'll take through over the course of the next hour in a way that only cnn can. John avalon and I traveled more than 1800 miles on cnn's battleground bus tour as t race for the white house reaches its conclusion. Ter where I go, the economy is the most important issue in this electio I've been traveling with john avalon. He joins me now a does my good friend christine romans. She joins me from washington. Jim acosta from did he back to you, iowa, whereitt romney just landed. Brianna keeler is in milwaukee, wisconsin, traveling with president obama. Let's start here in ohio. The state has a very complex economy. Here's some of what we've been hearing from voters on this trip. 
>> Just a lot of depressed areas. A lot of jblessness. 
>> Just looking at the unemployment rate, it's so scary to me. 
>> The last four years has not been very good for our small business. 
>> With the debt crisis, our country has, that burden is going to be on us in the future. 
>> All of the skills I had are obsolete now. 
>> I'm not up at the white house. I don't see rich people all the time. I see a lot of poor people. 
>> Shut down, closed, reduced wages, ship the jobs overseas. We lost 55,000 factories. 
>> We're probably never have the things that we did 30, 40 years ago. 
>> Balance the budget. We keep spending more and more. Somewhere along the line it's going to come back and haunt us. 

[00:02:02]


>> They didn't plan for us. Now we have to clean up the mess that they made. 
>> John avalon joins me now. We have been on that bus from florida through north carolina, through virginia, through and into ohio. The economy is number one concern. Once you get into ohio, you're touching a lot of the concerns. In the eastern side of the state where we were, natural gas was an issue. They have fracking. But now this auto and manufacturing stuff is playing. Mitt romney ran this ad about the auto companies taking bailout money. Manufacturing in china not working for them so well. 
>> Not working for them. We were in toledo last night. Talking to people on the street, they this taken offense from that ad. That's where that jeep plant is. Folks have been calling jeep and saying is it true? I heard this ad. Is my job in danger? Not true. Executives from chrysler and gm me down hard on the romney campaign for it, calling it the most cynical kind of campaign politics n that area andry area here matters, you can tell that particular campaign gamut backfired. 
>> But mitt romney is still kpetive in ohio. 
>> This is a mainstream republican state. There is a reason no republicans won the white house not winning ohio. There is a deep republican tradition in this state. The fact that it's an obama fire wall is what is remarkable. This is a state that mitt romney could do well. He should do well. Running the obama's campaign core strategy appealing to middle class voters, working class whites in this state makes a big difference when it comes to ground game and that critical early voting. Mitt romney has had a real problem connecting to those folks. 
>> Who is he leading with in ohio? 
>> President obama is leading with women. He's leading with centrist business 0 points. Losing independents by two points. Losing white men by a considerable margin. Leading with folks who make $50,000 a year. So the national themes are evident here in ohio. 
>> When you say independents and centrists, you're describing them as two separate things. A lot of viewers think independents means centrists. 
>> In the past, they have. One of the fascinating things about this election, the impact of the tea party on independent voters, it moved them to the right. So you see independents edging toward mitt romney. President obama had a decided edge among moderates. Fascinating new division in the electorate that we're seeing playing out. 

[00:04:19]


>> Stay here. We'll talk more about this. Brianna keeler is in milwaukee. The president will be there lar today. Three days out. This is the final chance for the president to make his case to voters. What's the final message going to be? 
>> Reporter: He's countering, ali, mitt romney's message where he is talking about being the candidate of real change. We've been hearing president obama say that's not true. President obama saying that he is the candidate ofchange, admitting that the change has been slow going as far as improvement to the economy. But still urging voters to have patience with him. Remember, yesterday with those jobs numbers out, he pointed to private sector gains, trying to show that things are heading in the right direction. The other thing, he's trying to say to voters you know . You may not agree with me all of the time. But you know I am a man of my word. And that you know what you're going to get. Obviously, the insinuation being that with mitt romney, voters don't. And then the other thing, this is very important especially here in wisconsin, especially where you are in ohio, talking about the auto bailout and how that has affected obviously in ohio, one of eight jobs tied to the auto industry. Here in wisconsin, a lot of jobs tied to the auto supply industry. He has an easier time on the ecomic message. You look at a number of battleground states and this is true in wisconsin and ohio, unemployment here, significantly lower than the national average. 7.3% in wisconsin. 7.0% in ohio where you are. So the auto bailout message seems to be resonating a little more in these places, ali. 
>> And there are a lot of people, a lot of conservatives and republican supporters in both of the states who say the states have republican governors. So who do you give the credit to for the lower unemployment? The president or the republican governors? Stay there. We'll get back to you. Jim acosta, three days to go. Mitt romney spending time in iowa today, a state with one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. Job creation isn't an issue in iowa. What is the issue? What is it they're voting on? 

[00:06:29]


>> Reporter: Well, ali, I think iowa is a part of a battleground strategy. If you can't win ohio and talking about that just a few moments ago with brianna and john avalon, then you need iowa. Then you need wisconsin. Then you might need pennsylvania which explains why mitt romney is heading there tomorrow. Getting back to the auto bailout issue, tikd a top republican source last night at this event in southern ohio where they were kicking off the swing state blitz with the different surrogates for the gop nominee, they feel like they have been working hard to mitigate that issue, pointing out that, you know, while, yes, mitt romney did oppose the auto bailout, he would have supported financing for those companies coming out of bankruptcy. You know, obviously there is this question of whether or not those companies would have been intact coming out of bankruptcy. And even being in a position where fellow financing would have helped at that point. But they have been trying to point out and ads are very controversial, no doubt about it, that while thes companies have been bailed out, they have been creating jobs in china. I talked to this one republican source who said why aren't the jeeps, why aren't the cars being made in ohio and then sold over in china? That is the message that they've been trying to say with respect to that issue. When it comes to pennsylvania, they look at pennsylvania and say, hey, you know, there are some of the same demographic advantages for mitt romney in that state. You get outside of the urban areas like philadelphia and pittsburgh, you have a huge chunk of pennsylvania in the middle. Full of rural voters. You don't have the baggage of the auto bailout. So that is partly the reason why they're looking at pennsylvania in the hopes that if ohio doesn't work, pennsylvania might. 
>> I was going to ask you about pennsylvania. That was a bit of a surprise that republicans are taking another turn back into there. Does come down to philadelphia and pittsburgh which send to be overwhelmingly blue. Very interesting that romney campaign has taken a turn there. Latest polling shows president obama up four points. Jim, stay where you are. We'll get back to you. Christine, I want to ask you about something jim said. It is such a hot button in this state, this idea that american companies are making vehicles in china. Why don't they just make them in america and ship them over? This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the entire auto industry. For decades and decades and decades american auto companies have made cars in the countries or the regions in which they sell them. I want to remind americans, when they buy toy oat yaz and hond yaz and hyundais and they buy nissans in america that are assembled here, back home somebody says why you shipping our jobs to america? So it really shows a fundamental, fundamental misunderstanding by romney camp to try and get under people's nails about jobs. They may make jeeps in china for the chinese audience. General motors does the same thing. This is not news. 

[00:09:23]


>> This shows you, ali, that auto making and making things is in the dna of modern america. It also shows that you if you can make a message, spin a web ad based on the fears of manufacturing and auto manufacturing in particular, it resonates in america. It's what we defined ourselves by for, youknow, since world war ii. It's a message that clearly the romney campaign thinks is going to work for them. Otherwise, uldn't be doing it. This whole idea about detroit and the bailout, this is -- this has been something that has been torturous for both campaigns from the very beginning. And it's not something that anybody wanted. Remember, the financial crisis happened -- the financial crisis happened and the auto bailout happened, you know, started by president bush and pushed and followed through by president obama. This is something that fundamentally bothers a lot of people. The american auto industry almost went out of business. That's something that really plays in these ads. That's why they're doing it. 
>> Christine, we're going to speak to chris ratner. He says that mitt romney is simply not telling the truth. The language that steve ratner uses is a lot nicer than the language I've been hearing in ohio about thosf ads. This is not helping mitt romney in this state. Stay where you are. I'm coming back to you as well. 
>>> President obama is trying to save his job but has he done enough to save yours? That's the big question with the jobs report that just came out. We'll be right back with a special live edition of "your money" from ohio. lights and sounds vying for your attention. So we invented a warning you can feel. Introducing the all-new cadillac xts. Available with a patented safety alert seat. When there's danger you might not see, you're warned by a pulse in the seat. It's technology you won't find in a mercedes e-class. The all-new cadillac xts has arrived, and it's bringing the future forward. ?????? ?????? ?????? 

[00:13:40]


>>> there is no doubt that friday's jobs report is positive. That doesn't mean that it's the best thing you've ever seen. It doesn't mean that 171,000 jobs that were added in october was the right number. It is not negative. They need to convince voters that they can create jobs. It's not enough. So which one is going to do better? 
>> Companies hired more workers in october than at any time in the last eight months. 
>> Unemployment is higher today than when barack obama took office. 
>> All right. If voters believe job creation is moving in the right direction, president obama could win. If they believe that it's not improving fast enough, mitt romney could win. I want to bring christine romans back in with a look at the final jobs report before tuesd election. Christine, you have done everyone a real service by breaking this down and showing people what this means. I have said for ten years, please be careful with that unemployment number. It doesn't tell you the full story. Sometimes it goes down whether people lose jobs. Sometimes it goes up when people gain jobs which is it what happened on friday. Please, christine, please do what you do and let our viewers understand why sense is utterly nonsense. I don't think we should have a 7.9% unemployment rate. There is so much misinformation out there. 
>> Before I give you the numbers, you can have an unemployment rate tick up to 7.9% and that can be guy thing. 
-- Be a good thing. That means people are looking around saying, hey, I know somebody who got a job. I'm going to try again, too. So that can be what happens. Many economists are telling me that's probably what happened in the month of october. We know the economy added 171,000 jobs in october. Bureau of labor statistics revised numbers also for august and ember. That adds another ,000 jobs. That means the economy has added 194,000 jobs net-net since the president took office. That number may be higher once you get preliminary revisions and they're made final early next year. The bls estimate that's it undercounted jobs in 2011 by 389,000. That means the economy added more than half a million jobs since the president took office. You won't hear the romney campaign talking about that. Ey're focused on that unemployment rate. It stood at 7.8% in september. The same when the president took office. It ticked up to that 7.9% in ocr. High unemployment is never a good sign. Americans don't have jobs need to be in the labor force actively looking for work to be count the as unemployed. Size of the labor force increased by 578, in october. That's a sign that the economy is improving enough, ali, for americans to start looking for work. 

[00:16:39]


>> Please tweet out how the unemployment rate is infecting the economy. This is really important. These are two surveys. There is the household survey and establishment survey. There is the unemployment rate, percentage. The establishment survey is the number of jobs created. Everybody needs to hear that. So thank you, christine. Stay there. I want to bring in harvard economistist ken rogoff from the international monetary fund. One of the world's leading authorities on financial crisis. Ken, let's now put aside the conspiracy theories and the nonsense about whether it's good or bat. We know it is positive. But, it's not enough. But 171,000 isitive. Can you call this a recovery? It's still going to take you years and years to get back to normal. So this was a good month as christine said not just because of the jobs that were recorded for october, but revisions saying, hey, there were mob jobs 
-- more jobs in the last couple months. I think both candidates, I hope whoever wins is going to show us something better over the next four years. But it is not easy after a financial crisis like this. I don't think it's going to be possible to get galluping growth quickly. 
>> Ken, let me ask you this. The reason I picked that 250,000 number, different economists say different things. Both campaigns, the romney campaign says it a lot. The obama campaign agrees, say they can create 12 million jobs if four years. That's three million a year. That is 250,000 jbz a month. 80,000 more than we're seeing. They both assume, by my calculations, they assume a 4% gdp growth. We're at 2%. Now increasingly, surrogates from both campaigns have told me they can do it with a 3% gdp rate which is what we might actually see next year. Now former congressman, you know him, vin webber says fiscal and government restraint is the key. Listen to whate said. 

[00:18:49]


>> We're not seeing any element of that from this administration. No fiscal restraint. Only higher taxes on capital as well as on labor. That's a bad mix. 
>> So that's the answer that the republicans are putting forward. Fiscal and government restraint will kick up your gdp growth to the extent you'll create more jobs. Ken, do you buy that? 
>> Well, I -- looks to me like their plan is to cut taxes. You hope you get really fast growth. I think the deficit would go up a lot for a while. We would get growth. But I'm not sure it would be anything like we sawunder reagan. E is so much debt out there. There is so many headwinds. There's europe, t administration would do less on cutting taxes if at all and probably raise spending. That's really where the difference is between the two. One of them wants a smaller government. One of them sees the government doing more things. That's a big difference. 
>> You know more than I do. Quick answer, do you think either of them will get the 12 million jobs in four years that they're promising? 
>> It would be a very good outcome. I think it's a long shot, frankly. 
>> Your answer is smarter than mine. I said I'd wear a dress for a week if it happened. You're in less danger. Thanks very much for being with us. 
>>> Let's get back to ohio. Let's get back to the auto bailout. President obama bailed out the auto industry. Mitt romney says the bailed out auto companies are using that money to ship jobs to china. We'll get to the bottom of what really happened with the auto bailout next on a special live edition of "your money" from ohio. ] pro. Monarch of marketing analysis.

[ Male Announcer ] GOOD CHOICE BUSINESS PRO. Good choice. Go national. Go like a pro. 
>>> The auto industry is back at the center of the presential race in ohio. President obama says mitt romney is stirring up worker fears but the romney camp says the president mishandled the auto bailout. Back with the facts in 90 SECONDS.#@0y0y3??o????????y 

[00:23:55]


>>> We're live in ohio, a state where manufacturing is key. A big portion of that manufacturing is autos. One in eight jobs in ohio connected to the auto industry. I want to drill down on something I spoke to christine about earlier. There are 76,000 people in ohio employed in auto and auto parts manufacturing. Only michigan has more. But that number would be much smaller if the u.S. Government hadn't bailed out the automakers. Let me say that again. The number would be much smaller if they hadn't bailed out the automakers. The center for automotive research found that between 2009 and 2010, the bailout saved 1.5 million jobs across the u.S., save $$100 billion in personal kmk and saved the government $29 billion in what wou have been lost revenue. It did still cost the government money though. Here's why it matters. Both presidential candidates spent millions of dollars campaigning in this state. President obama leads mitt romney, barely in, a race this tight the auto bailout could swing the vote. Now survey conducted by ohio newspaper organization finds at 29% of likely voters are more likely to vote for obama because of the auto bailout. That's compared to 21% who say they are less likely to vote for him as a result. Mitt romney tried to cut into the president's support with this ad. 
>> Obama took gm and chrysler into bankruptcy. And sold chrysler to italians who are going to build jeeps in china. Mitt romney will fight for every american job. 
>> Now there seemed to have been some calculation that the romney campaign made that they would somehow benefit from this ad, that jeep was taking jobs from the united sta moving them to china to build jeeps there. Chrysler's ceo says it's simply not true. He writes on the company's blog, "jeep production will not be moved from the united states to china. Jeep assembly lines will remain in operation in the united states and will constitute the backbone of the brand. It sin accurate to suggest anything different." The man who president obama pictured to the czar to save the auto industry is stephen ratner. I asked for a response. Stephen, good to see you. How do you respond to this ad? I'm here in ohio where these jeeps are made. Thaid that what mitt romney has said is wrong. Tell me what you know about this. 

[00:26:18]


>> I think chrysler and general motors actually responded more forcefully than I have ever seen a company respond in 30 years in the business in terms of the adamancy they expressed. The facts are what he said. It makes good business sense for jeepto begin to produce jeeps in china for the local chinese rket. Those are jeeps that are not going to really get -- could not be realistically exported from the u.S. They need to be built close to the home market, just like every other automaker does. General motors has huge operations in china, ford does, theation companies, german companies. It's good business sense. So there are no jobs being moved. 
>> All right. The nonpartisan congressional budget office says the auto bailout, while it has given the government some money because of tax revenues it didn't lose, will end up costing taxpayers $20 billion compared to the $18 billion profit that came out of the banking bailout. Is there a chance that taxpayers could get their money back from this a bailout? 
>> There is a chance. It's unlikely. And I and the president and larry summers and tim geithner were clear from the beginning with the american people through the press that we did not expect to get a the money back. First, there was $17 billion that went into general motors and chrysler tend of 2008 as bridge loans. Companies were not prepared to go through the restructuring that we undertook. That money will never come back. So that's most of the amount that you just cited. The point I would make ist if at the end of the day the american taxpayer losesed adds billion, $10 billion, even $20 billion on this auto rescue and save the 1.4 million jobs you referred to earlier, that's a very good trade for the american taxpayer that's what government is here to do. To use its resources, prudently, carefully, surgically to achieve a great benefit. 
>> Now a lot of americans still disapprove, though, about just 44% of americans actually approve of the auto bailout. That is according to a gallup poll. If we saved a lot of jobs, why is it that so many americans, do you think, are unconvinced this was the right thing to do and that it was a waste of money? 

[00:28:27]


>> Actually, ali, when the president made tse decisions, the percentage of americans who APPROVED IT WAS DOWN IN THE 20s. I think some polls were even lower. Look, I get the fact that the american public hates ts. I hate bailouts. But what I think the people who not yet -- who have not yet come onboard don't fully appreciate is the enormous economic devastation that would have occurred largely in michigan and ohio and midwest and across the country as those 1.4 million jobs disappear. So I think the public has come a long way in terms of appreciating this. We'll see on tuesday whether the voters of ohio appreciate what was done. 
>> It's unusual but this is one of those things where both president obama and mitt romney say absolutely opposite things. President obama says that mitt romney was not prepared to do or did not support what president obama did with you. Mitt romney says that you guys did largely what he was suggesting you do. Wh the auto industry. Tell me what your perspective is on this. 
>> The basic fundamental difference between the two is that mitt romney says he would have not used any federal money to help these companies except possibly on their way out of bankruptcy. The problem with that approach is that there would have been no out of bankruptcy. They never would have left bankruptcy. These companies had no cash. They could not afford to pay their suppliers. They could not afford to pay the workers. They could not afford to keep their lights on. If we had not provided the money we provided in the spring of 2009 before they went in bankruptcy and during the bankruptcy, they would have never come out of bankruptcy. 
>> All right. Ephen ratner, you would know. You were theuto czar. You were involved in it. Good to see you in, stephen. Thank you. 
>> Thank you, ali. 
>>> With three days to go before election day, the battle for the battleground states, like ohio, is raging. We'll check in with our reporters across the country right after this. Your watching a live edition of "your money" from ohio. Rogaine? it. I was skeptical at first. But after awhile even my girlfriend noticed a difference.

>>> you're watching ann romney. Thiowa. Mitt romney just landed there. They came off a plen and ann romney is speaking at the podium. We're going to drop into that in just a moment when mitt romney starts speaking. In the meantime, we'll keep a very close eye on that. I want to bring you back to iowa for a moment. That's where I am right now. Iowa -- I'm sorry, ohio. That's where I am. Ohio made decide this election along with a handful of other swing states. Cnn has reporters across the country in the key battleground states. Poppy harlow is in ohio. John zor he will yoe is in florida. Let me show you how different these states are when it comes to jobs which is the most important of the economic issues. As you know, the economy is the most important issue out here. Let's look at nevada. It has the highest unemployment rate of the so-called tossup states. 11.8%. Colorado's much closer to the national average. It's at 8%. The national average is 7.9%. Here in iowa, it's lower. Florida, much higher, 8.7%. But iowa has one of the lowest jobless rates in the country. It has for some time, 5.2%. They actually have ablem finding workers. Let's go back to iowa where mitt romney is speaking. 

[00:34:43]


>> I know most of you here have decided who you're voting for in three more days. But you have some neighbors who haven't made up their minds yet. And so I want to make sure that I give you all the arguments you need to make sure that you convince some of them to come vote for our team. Paw e paul ryan and I want to bring real change to america. So some folks are putting aside the demands of daily life and focusing on this campaign. They want to know what the future is going to hold depending on who becomes the next president. Who's going to affect their life and their family's life and who is going to affect the country in the way it will make the greatest difference. You can remind them that words are cheap. You can say whatever you want to say in a campaign. But what you can achieve, results, those are earned. Those can't be faked. You see, four years ago you could remind them that candidate obama made a number of promises. Then go andook at the promises and say how did they do on those? He was going to be a post partisan president. He's been most partisan in dividing -- 
>> we'll keep an eye on mitt romney's speech in iowa. Poppy, that seems like guy problem to have. In des moines and other parts of iowa, the unemployment rate is very low. They can't find workers. But that's also not ideal for them. 
>> Reporter: Right. No, it's not. In fact, ali, this is the front page of the "des moines register." Iowa's shrinking jobless race is misleading. One of the business owners i spoke with during my week here said I can't find the right people to fill the jobs. But those top line numbers here are good for the president, 5.2% unemployment. Housing prices that all but surpassed this state as strong farming sector. The people here really care about one big picture thing, ali. That's the deficit. They hate the government's spending. And they're looking at the future. What's ahead for their kids? One of the guys I talked to here in iowa that really sums it up is chad moran. Take a listen to him. 

[00:36:55]


>> Fiscally, I just don't see how we can sustain ourselves. I mean europe right now, these big, huge great empires, countries and all that, they're going bankrupt. And it's going to be us. 
>> Reporter: He is one that is in line with that, line that we hear from romney that we're on a path to greece. We both think that is a bit deceiving. Does he think that our future is in question when it comes to spending. We'll tell you the jobs issue here is also lower paying jobs, more part time work than full-time work people tell me here. They're having a hard time even though that 5.2% looks better than the rest of the country. 
>> Yet another reason why the percentage unemployment rate never tells the full story. It looks great in iowa. But there are still lots of issues. I'm hearing the same thing in ohio, by the way, people who while jobs are their main issue, they're concerned about the deficit. They're also concerned about the quality of jobs and the wages they get and benefits. Thanks very much for that. John zorella is surrounded by long lines of early voters. We were in florida earlier on this battleground state. Housing a big issue. The value of housing. What you are hearing? What is the big issue that you're hearing from voters there? 
>> Reporter: You know, ali, it's funny. Yore mentioning the big lines. It's about a two hour wait right now from where I'm standing. It was four hours earlier this morning. So a lot of people exercising their right on the last day of early voting. I was chatting with some of the people here. As you mentioned, jobs is a big issue for everyone. Health care has come up and many people saying off the bat, big issue for them. And women's rights. Those are the three things i heard the most from all the people here. The jobs, health care, and women's rights from the people i just talk with in line. You mentioned housing. That's huge. All of the foreclosures in the state, particularly in the single family housing industry, that has been hit very, very hard. So many foreclosed existing properties out there hard to get much construction going in that sector. You know, just a couple hours up the road from here at kennedy space center, yesterday retired the last of the three space shuttles, atlantis, putting an end to the space shuttle program. It is over. At united space alliance alone, 4,000 skilled workers laid off. So the aerospace industry, the space industry very hard hit. And so jobs there are very critical. And, of course, overall in the state the whole construction industry that has not recovered at all. Ali? 

[00:39:34]


>> Right. We're seeing pockets of recovery in floda. Pockets of home price increases. Still, a long way to go. John, thank you very much. 
>>> Busy day for mitt romney. The last event of the day will be in engelwood, colorado tonight. And that's where cnn reporter is. What is -- what you are hearing? What matters most to folks in colorado and what's romney's plan to win them over? 
>> Reporter: Governor romney is going to stop here and speaking at that theater behind me a little later today. And he is going to make the case, he's been making over the last two weeks, it is about jobs. Now set person who is going to make jobs more secure over the next four years. And he's got a dwling number of people would will listen to him. In this state, 1.6 million people have already voted. Now they are expecting by tuesday5% of the voters will have already voted. Romney's case now is to try to energize the people who are left. It is the number one issue here. It is all about jobs. Ali? 
>> Thanks very much. We'll be checking in with you later in the day as mitt romney heads to colorado. 
>>> Now the u.S., The u.S. Is headed back into a recession at the end of the year. If leaders in washington don't act. Neither candidate has a plan to fix the thing that is most serious right now. Neither politician wants to tell us what it is if they had one. We'll tell you more after that the break. And I honestly didn't think I would ever quit.

If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. With chantix and with the support system it worked. It worked for me.

>>> Well, it's the largest problem that next president will face and neither candidate is saying anything about the fiscal cliff. That combination of $7 trillion in tax hikes and spedding cuts that is set to hit at the end of the year starting at the end of the year. Their prescription is a debt REDUCTION -- A NUMBER OF CEOs, More than 80 ceos have gotten together and called for a debt reduction plan that roughly follows the simpson bowls plan that reduces spending, increases tax revenues. They backed the bipartisan plan as a framework or a starting point for negotiations. Norm ornstein is from the american enterprise institute. He's the co-author of the book "even worse than it looks." Norm, we talked about this last week. We know you held the tea party responsible for standing in the way of any plan that president obama put forward. So would a mitt romney win break up that deadlock and rep a new republican party that could actually get things done?

>>> Sorry about that. We had a bit of a technical problem. I'm in columbus, ohio. The final stop of the cnn election express battleground bus tour. Norm ornstein is standing by. You have seen my frustration for this 2,000 miles where the presidential candidates are not talking about barack obama mentioned it in the last debate, very serious problem. What's the best prescription for getting this solved? Who is going to do it? Barack obama or mitt romney? 
>> This is one of the key debates. Mitt romney has pivoted back to the center, saying I'm going to bring bipartisanship back. Obama said the republicans haven't been working with me. Ifre-elected, they'll be forced to. 
>> Why will they be forced to? 
>> They embraced the strategy of obstruction, and filibusters in an unprecedented amount, and it has worked to some extent, except when it comes to solving problems. What a lot of political scientists believe is if obama is reelected, the status quo would kraekt an urgency to not take the country over the fiscal cliff. If one party gets a big idealogical victory, they'll want to go over the cliff and see if they can roll in the new year. Here's what's important. We talked to all of the swing voters. You get the frustration about the hyperpartisanship, the division, and real frustration about the deficit and debt. Can we get a balanced bipartisan plan? That's going to require both sides to give. That sense of being able to give a little bit has been missing. 
>> Let's talk a little bit about if mitt romney wins, about the fiscal cliff. 
>> Harry reid said the other day he would not work with a president romney if he was elected. That bipartisanship mitt romney is talking about would not be achieved. In effect, what he would do is what the republicans have done to president obama. Every action creates an equal and opposite reaction. That's what promised by the democrats. That cycle of insightment that spirals on. 

[00:51:42]

[00:54:58]


>>> norm ornstein is a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute and the co-author of the book "even worse than it looks." I introduced you and then i couldn't hear you. I thought you were mad. 
>> I was talking. Good, so the question you asked is whyare people not talking about the fiscal cliff and what would happen if mitt romney got elected? I was bemoussed by david brooks' logic in a recent column when he said the house republicans and transigence is a part of this and it wouldn't be different under obama, but under romney, of course, they would go along. And I just think that's false. I think if you have a package like the one being worked out in the senate where you could get 75 senators for it, simpson-bowles type package, 90% of the house republicans have signed on to trover norquist no taxes pledge. No way half of them would violate that, so there's no deal under romney. It's more likely to happen, although it's still dicy, under obama. 
>> And john was sort of saying the same thing. Let's bring bob in. A senior lecturer at harvard business school. He also served as the secretary of economic affairs for mitt romney when he was the governor of massachusetts. Bob, let's pick this conversation up. If mitt romney wins next week's election, how is he going to deal with the intransigence that comes from those members of the republican party that did sign grover norquist's pledge to not see taxes raised under any circumstances. Even mitt romney, does he reach across the aisle, compromising mitt romney, may not be able to penetrate that. 
>> There are three key points there. First is whoever is elected president, where believe congress is going over the cliff. There's not enough goodwill on either side to reach an agreement. They'll try but they won't make it. Second of all, they will reach a compromise at the end of february because that's when we get to the point when congress has to vote on increasing the deceiling. And there are enough congress people who are scared of that vote and will not vote for an increase in the debt ceiling unless there is some fundamental reform. And the third thing is, the key to all economic growth is productivity. That's why I have recently written aook called "extreme productivity boosts your results." We don't increase that, all of the other stuff is a side show. 

[00:57:35]


>> That's an interesting point, bob. You're having a conversation about stuff that is real and matters. We're dealing with a congress that is intransigent largely for political reasons. Why do we think congress is going to behave differently? 
>> I don't think they're going to behave differently until the end of the year because they're not forced to. They can delay the fiscal cliff for two months. They can play some game. But they cannot delay the debt ceiling. If we default at the end of february on our debt ceiling, that's a huge disaster. So that's the forcing issue, and that's what I see the compromise being resolved, whoever is president. 
>> Norm, we have less than a minute left in the show. Whoever becomes president while they're busy thinking about the transition if there's a transition or thinking about the inauguration and new term, they have to put their mind to this. Does this become headline news starting the week after the election. 
>> Assuming we have a resolution of the election, but the key here is how the markets react. We hadn't gotten much reaction leading up to the debt limit debacle last time which was generated deliberatelyy house republican leaders. Now that you have the business community involved and they were largely awol the last time we had a crisis, and if we see a substantial market reaction just as we had with t.A.R.P. After house republicans voted it down the first time in 2008, we may get a reaction, but I think bob is right. It may take until getting close to february. 
>> Okay, I hope you guys are right that eventually they will get something done. Thanks to both of you. Bob pozen and norm ornstein. And norm, I forgive you for not speaking to me earlier. 
>> There you go.

[Rattles shaker, rattles toning sticks] beautiful. I recommd zumba fitness because it makes you feel good, the music is fantastic, you look better after doing it, you feel better... It's something that you don't want to miss out on. 

[00:08:30]


[???...] 
>> Tanya: You don't have to be a dancer to get a dancer's body. We break every step down so anyone can follow. It's easy and it fun. Zumba fitness is for everyone. 
>> I've always been heavy all my life, ever since I was a child. I remember how I felt when I was that big, and I never thought I would be able to have a second chance the way I have had. By following the zumba fitness program, I've lost 102 pounds. I've gone from a size 24 to a size 5/6! I have not had a surgery. Zumba fitness has reshaped my body.
