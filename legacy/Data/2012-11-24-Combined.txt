=======================================================

Beyond was all around me. My dream was a dream no longer. I suppose I was here because this was something I had to do-- not just dream about it, but do it. I suppose, too, I was here to test myself, not that I had never done it before, but this time, it was to be a more thorough and lasting examination. What was I capable of that I didn't know yet? Could I truly enjoy my own company for an entire year? And was I equal to everything this wild land could throw at me? I had seen its moods in late spring, summer, and early fall, but what about the winter? Would I love the isolation then, with its bone-stabbing cold, its ghostly silence? At age 51, I intended to find out. Another 100 yards, and I broke out of the brush to my pile of cabin logs I had cut last July. I sat down and leaned against them, and while I chewed on a chunk of smoked salmon, my eyes wandered over the peeled logs. That had been a big job last summer-- hard work, but I enjoyed it. It was cool in the timber, and there were mornings I could see my breath. I had harvested the logs from a stand of spruce less than 300 yards from where they were now piled. [sawing noise] The logs were a great deal 

[00:02:00]


lighter now than they were then and could be handled easily enough. >> female narrator: It was in the late spring of 1968 that Dick Proenneke decided to leave civilization behind to live in a pristine land yet unchanged by man and to roam a wilderness through which few other humans have passed. While carving out a new life in this remote valley known as Twin Lakes, Dick would not only keep daily journals but would film his Alaskan odyssey with the help of a tripod-mounted camera. >> It was time to be moving on. I was anxious to get to Spike's cabin to see if it was the way I had left it last September. [birds cawing] About 500 yards more through the spruce and the willow brush, and there it was, its weather-grayed moose antlers spreadinjust below the peak of the roof, a tin can on its stovepipe, and its windows were boarded up. [nails squeaking] The cabin had everything needed to set up housekeeping until my own cabin was completed-- a good stove, two bunks, and a roof that didn't leak. It's May 22nd. Up with the sun at 4:00 to watch the sunrise and the sight of the awakening land. It seems a shame for eyes to be shut when such thin are going on, especially in this big country. I don't want to miss anything. [water gurgling] 

[00:04:01]


Today I would hike the five miles down to the lower lake to pack my third and last load of gear, my tools with which to build my cabin. This time, with the binoculars along, I would have an excuse to stop now and then and glass the slopes for game. From this high vantage point, the hills seemed to come alive with animals. I suddenly didn't feel so alone anymore. Almost noon before I got back to the cabin. The rest of the day I devoted to my tools. I carved a mallet head out of a spruce chunk, augered a hole in it, and fitted a handle to it. This would be a useful pounding tool, and I hadn't had to pack it in either. [pounding] The same with the handles I made for the wood augers, the wide-bladed chisel, and the files-- much easier to pack without the handles already fitted to them. [water rushing] Hope Creek has cut a big opening into the lake ice. Was it too early to catch a fish? I took the casting rod along to find out. It didn't take long. After several casts, it happened with the suddenness of a broken shoelace. I slid the 19-inch trout onto the stones. Fish with my beans tonight. 

[00:06:05]


It's May 25th. Breakup is not the spectacular site it was last year. A big wind would have cleared the thin ice out yesterday. As I loaded tools on the packboard this morning, the rotted ice began to flow past in quiet exit. [pastoral music] 
??????   ??????
When you have miles and miles of lakefront and picture views to consider, it's difficult to select a building site. The more a man looks, the fussier he gets. I cleared the brush and hauled up beach gravel and spread it to a depth of several inches over an area roughly 20 feet by 20 feet. I felt I had made the best possible choice. It would be 11 feet by 15 feet. Its front door would face northwest, and the big window would look down to the lake. A pile of logs-- which ones to start with? To make a notch fit properly, you can't rush it. Make several saw cuts an inch or two apart almost down to the pencil line, and whack out the chunks with an ax until the notch is roughly formed. Then comes the finish work, the careful custom fit. I have just the tool for the job. [serene fiddle music] 
??????  

[00:08:24]


[sawg noise]        ??????
One log in particular required considerable hewing to straighten it. I must say white spruce works up nicely with an ax and drawknife. [scraping] Enough for this evening. The job has begun. Tomorrow should see more working and less figuring. It's May 29th. Only a few chunks of ice floating in the lake this morning. By noon, there was no ice to be seen. It was good to see the lake in motion again, and it was even better to slip the canoe into the water and paddle to work for a change. I glided silently along over a different pathway. The cabin is growing. 28 logs are in place. 44 should do it, except for the gable ends and the roof logs. It really looks a mess to see the butts extending 

[00:10:25]


way beyond the corners, but I will trim them off later. You can't rush it. I don't want these logs looking as though a Boy Scout was turned loose on them with a dull hatchet. [pouing] [sawing noise] [scraping] I was making good progress today when I heard a plane. It was Babe Alsworth. I watched the plane glide in for a perfect landing on the calm lake. Plenty of groceries this time, and among the supplies, rhubarb plants. They should be put in the ground right away. I found the frost about four or five inches down. I planted 15 hills of potatoes, tucked in some onion sets, and put in a few rows of peas, carrots, beets, and rutabagas. Not much of a garden by Iowa standards, but it would tell me what I wanted to find out. Finally back to the cabin-building. I'm a better builder than I am a farmer anyway. 38 logs are in place, and I am almost ready for the eave logs. I cut the openings for the big window, the two smaller ones, and the opening for the door. [sawing noise] Five logs were very special. These were the 20-footers, which, along with the gable ends, would be the backbone of my roof. Two would be eave logs, two would be purlin logs, and the last and the straightest 

[00:12:27]


would be the ridge log. As it stands now, the cabin looks as though logs are sticking out all over it, like the quills of a riled porcupine. [scraping] [pounding] I've made good progress today. My cabin logs have magically changed form in the ten days since I cut the first notch. It's June 7th, and I do believe the growing season is at hand. The buckbrush and willows are leafing out fast now. The rhubarb is growing, and I notice my onion sets are spiking up through the earth. Those window frames have been on my mind. Decided to do something about it. First I built a sawhorse workbench, then selected straight-grained sections of logs cut from the windows. With a thin-bladed wide chisel, I cut deep along the line on each side. Worked fine. I smoothed the split sides with the drawknife. The result was a real nice board, so I continued to fashion others. Put them in place and nailed them in. [pounding] I finished the day cleaning the litter of wood chips. I mounded them in front of the door, beaver lodge style-- quite a pile for 11 days' work, enough to impress that beaver. It's June 9th. 

[00:14:28]


Today would be a day away from the job of building. I'll look for the pole timber for the roof uplake. [serene music] 
??????   ??????
After beaching the canoe, I walked through the timber, crossing and recrossing the creek that had its beginnings in the far-off snows. [water rushing] Good piles were not as plentiful as I figured, and I worked steadily to get 48 out and back to the beach by noon. The mosquitoes were out in force. To peel the poles, I made a tripod of short sticks on which to rest one end and put the drawknife to work. I rafted them up and moved them down the lake to my beach. A good pile, but I doubt there will be enough. Today I would secure the roof poles over the gables. A cabin roof takes time. [pounding] Soon I will be ready to saw the ends and fill the slots between the pole butts under the eaves. It's June 18th. Everything looks as though it had a bath last night. Must have been a good shower, and I never even heard it. 

[00:16:28]


A check on the livestock this morning before going down to the roof job. A few caribou cows and their calves just up-country from Low Pass Creek. Nothing else in sight. Should be a bear passing through one of these days. [sawing noise] These fillers should be called squirrel frustraters. Give those characters an entrance, and they can ruin a cabin. I finished filling the slots between the roof poles and caulked joints with oakum. I chinked around the blocks on the outside. Anyplace I could get a table knife blade in got oakum. [tapping] [sawing noise] Next was a job I had been thinking about--a countertop, some window ledges, and some shelves. I decided ripping them with the ripsaw was the answer. I could go down the middle of a log 5 inches in diameter and 42 inches long in 15 minutes. Couldn't complain about that. [sawing noise] I think I have sawed nearly everything that I need. Now to trim the edges and start building. [pounding] 

[00:18:28]


I need a fish for supper, so I took the fly rod down to Hope Creek. The grayling were feeding greedily, fins and tails swirling all over the surface. A fish snapped the fly from the leader the very first cast-- a handsome grayling, 17 1/4 inches long, enough for my needs. 

[00:28:57]


It's July 2nd. After a peaceful trip downlake, I located ten seasoned spruce stumps. I was anxious to try making hinges for the door. I worked the wood to shape with an ax and drawknife. Now to saw the fork in the butt end. 45 minutes, and I had half my hinge made. Not bad. [sawing noise] I put some finishing touches on the door planks I made Sunday. Now the door is ready to put together. Too many men work on parts of things. Doing a job to completion satisfies me. My roof poles are still too wet for the tar paper, so I will work on my double-deck bunk-- four posts with two rails on each side and two large and two small on each end. I augered 1 1/2 inch holes and trimmed the rail poles to fit. Now when I get some glue, I will knock it apart and glue it back together. With a few leftover poles, I built myself a chair 

[00:30:58]


and a bench. It's June 27th. A good rain it was last night. Today would be a pole-hunting day. I need about 30 to make the slats for my bunks. After peeling the poles,up strong. It brought rain, and it furrowed the lake as rough as a cob. This lake can really change its personality in a hurry, like a woman-- all smiles one minute and dancing a temper tantrum the next. Tomorrow is Sunday. I will go someplace. Next morning, I loaded my camera gear and started up the trail to the hump. It was good to take a break away from the cabin. As I topped a ridge along a dry wash, a wolf came up from the other side 30 or 40 paces away. Then in a wink, she was gone. The wolves had made a kill. All that was left of the young caribou was the backbone and rib cage. The skin was badly torn and pulled down over the front legs, as you would peel back a rubber glove. [bird cries] It looks like the wolves aren't the only problem the caribous have. What was a bull caribou doing down there where not a breath of air was stirring? Insects were whirling around me like sawdust blown from a power saw. The bull also was having a battle with the tiny fiends-- stomping and shaking, twisting and turning, and shivering his hide. [insects buzzing] 

[00:33:02]


He would lie down and get back up again. No rest at all. Why doesn't he climb to a breeze or take a swim? Anything but stand and fight something that he can't hope to kill or scare away. With a yell and a waving of arms, I spooked him. He threw his antlers back, and off he clattered over the stones and up the creek. Good luck to you, old boy. It's July 3rd: a cool, damp morning with fog coming off the slope like the smoke from many campfires. No wind now, so it's a perfect day for the tar paper job. I lapped the felt paper four to five inches. I need just one more strip 20 feet long. I must admit the cabin looks better already with the start of a roof. Next I unrolled thpolyethylene and tucked the edges to get at least four thicknesses to tack through, and I fastened her down. [tapping] Next I built a carrying rack for the moss. I filed the blade of my round-point shovel, and I was ready for the moss-cutting detail. I cut out rectangles about, oh, 18 inches by 36 inches and 8 inches thick. Two chunks double-decked on the rack made a good load. 

[00:35:03]


Once around the edge of the roof, and the cabin took on a new look. I feel guilty about the tar paper and the polyethylene because they're not true wilderness cabin materials, but I am convinced they will do a better job of keeping the weather out. It seems I have cleared two acres of moss, and still the roof isn't covered. A beautiful, still evening. The cabin is beginning to look as though it belongs. This morning, I cut, hauled, and peeled 11 logs by noon. I would spend the day on the construction of the john, an important consideration in any new home. Materials to finish the front required lots of time ripping boards from the last of my cabin logs. It was 12:00 when I finished the last cut. Four boards would make the door, and the fifth would make cleats to hold it together. I made the hinges from a gas can, and they looked almost store-bought. And then the final touch-- saw out the crescent-- and the john was done. July 23rd: a day to hang the door. I put the door into the opening and fastened the top and bottom hinges. I checked and rechecked my hinges to see that they were in line. I pulled the hinge pins, set the door on edge, and sawed it nearly through for a Dutch door, which I intended it to be. I daubed on some glue and nailed it fast. 

[00:37:07]


Door works quiet and easy with all four hinges secure. Not perfect, but plenty close for rural work. I must devise a latch for it, not just hooks, like a barn door. [wood creaking] [tapping] All I needed was a lock. I would like to see a bear try to figure this thing out, but I suppose he would just solve the problem by wiping the door clean from the wooden hinges. After finishing the latch, I went blueberrying up on the Cowgill Bench. I found a good patch. I fear the blueberries really took a nipping with the heavy frost not so long ago. I find some berries big and healthy, but many are small and shriveled. When my can was nearly full, I noticed a movement across the creek, something yellow and brown-- a big bear not 50 yards away. I think I've picked the wrong blueberry patch. Lucky for me and him, he didn't like my smell. July 31st: A tin-bending day. Made a water bucket, a wash pan, a dishpan, a flour pan, and storage cans. My cabin kitchen is shaping up. I needed a big wooden spoon to dip hotcake batter 

[00:39:07]


onto the griddle. One spoonful, one hotcake. In the woodpile, I found scraps of stumpwood that looked suitable. It took me no more than an hour to turn out a good-looking spoon. I must make a wooden bowl or two later on. [scraping] [sawing noise] Today is the big day. I will load all my remaining gear into the canoe and paddle down to my new home. The lake is dead calm. A perfect day for moving. Everything found its place, and there was lots of room for everything, not a cluttered look at all. Five inches of foam rubber on my new bunk will make it just about right. I can hear Hope Creek real plain. That will be a pleasant sound to go to sleep by. And the view from my window isn't too bad either. Best sleep in a long time. The sound of the waves lapping the gravel beach and the never-ending rustle of Hope Creek: no better sleeping pill. The woodpile needs attention. I must drop a few spruce snags and buck them into sections. Dry standing timber makes the best firewood. [sawing noise] 

[00:41:08]


There is a rhythm to the saw as its teeth eat back and forth into the deepening cut, but I must admit I enjoy the splitting more. I heard a plane. It was Babe, at last, with supplies. He had brought in some fresh groceries that needed refrigeration. I had dug down a foot into the moss just yesterday and found frost and lined the hole with a gas can box. The thermometer in my cooler box under the moss reads 40 degrees, and here it is close to 80 degrees today. While cultivating the garden, I rolled out a few potatoes that looked like walnuts-- not record breakers for size, but they had real smooth skins. The crops to grow at Twin Lakes are potatoes, rhubarb, lettuce, onions, and radishes. My green onions look pretty respectable. I am getting hungry for a fish. After many casts at the mouth of Hope Creek, I was on to one. I worked him in easy, for I was fish hungry, and I didn't want to lose this lake trout. I could see him browning in the pan as I dressed him out, and I left his entrails for the birds. Fried potatoes, onions, and fish--you can't beat that. Time to take a break away from the cabin. I would go up high today. There were many bands of sheep, ewes, and lambs scattered here and there. I spotted six big rams on Black Mountain. 

[00:43:08]


Two had better than a full curl. A man could lose himself up here. One bad step, and I would keep right on going down the mountain. But risk now and then is good for a man. One misstep here, and a man would have to settle with the Lord right here on the mountain. [water rushing] Close at hand, the mosses and grasses were full of tiny flowers. It is another world of beauty. The more I see as I sit here among the rocks, the more I wonder about what I am not seeing. A flickering movement off to my left. The stones seemed to move and turned into a mother ptarmigan and her brood. The young were just as camouflaged as their mother in her plumage of summer. They were feeding, huddled like chickens as they worked along the slope. [ptarmigan chattering] Not too far away, I spotted a mother brown bear with two cubs. It was probably the same family I had seen at different times during thepring. 

[00:45:10]


She was rounded out like a cask. Must be lots of vitamins along those slopes. It was getting late and a little chilly, and it was time to leave. I had taken a long look into the heart of the high places. It's September 6th. This would be the morning to start the fireplace. I had been packing flat stones from the bed of Hope Creek for the past few days. The sound of geese heading north made me even more anxious to get the project under way. The lake was moon-still, a good morning to haul some sand, four loads of sand. [sawing noise] [pounding] I won't cut that hole in the back of the cabin too high until I find out how this rock-laying is going to go. Today is spent on the outside. The chimney is a good 12 inches high and 9 inches thick. I hated cutting into those logs that I had fitted with such care, but it had to be done. [tapping] [scraping] It's September 8th. I roughed out my arch today with my ax and then finished it off with the jack plane. I set it in place and spiked it to the posts. All my stones in front of the fireplace have been collected in my travels up and down both lakes, the high country and the low, so they are representative of the entire area. 

[00:47:14]


Today while it was still frosty, I cut the notch in the rear overhang of the roof to let the chimney through. My collapsible form couldn't have worked better. I'm glad I took the time to make it. By tomorrow evening, I had better be done, since the last cement sack will be empty. After two weeks, with fingertips worn thin and tender, I'm ready for the cold weather. [fire crackling] 

[00:57:54]


This new day is clear, calm, and 28 degrees. There's white frost on the brush and on the gravel of the beach. The lake is like a huge puddle, grinning with the reflections of the fall colors well along on the mountains. Today was meant for canoe travel. I would go to the lower end of the lower lake where the Chilikadrotna River begins its long, swift journey to merge with the Mulchatna and the Nushagak. It would be a paddle of 8 1/2 miles one way. It was a joy to travel the flat lake. I dug the paddle deep, and the canoe slid along easily, furrowing ripples to either side. Near the lower end of the lake, I spotted a fine caribou bull. He was acting strangely. When I saw him wade into the lake, it dawned on me: he wanted to cross to the other side. The race was on. He would show me how fast a bull caribou can swim. I didn't want to get too close in case he turned on me. He could overturn my canoe with no trouble. Maybe he figured he couldn't get rid of me on land, so he did what he would have done with a wolf in pursuit-- take to the lake, swim, and lose the enemy. The caribou is an animal of the open country. It seems he likes to get up on the high ridges, where the breeze blows to keep the insects away. [serene music] 
??????  

[01:00:01]


 ??????
The bull moose, which I haven't seen much of all summer long, doesn't seem to fear me or much of anything now. After several hours of violent thrashing and destroying a patch of willow bushes, the bull was free from the blood-covered velvetlike material. It seems this time of year, the bulls lose all their good sense during the rutting season and come right out in the open, afraid of nobody, and that's when hunting season opens, and that's the end of him. I woke up this morning surprised to see four inches of snow on the ground. Looks like I finished my fireplace just in time. It's a frosty morning at 23 degrees, 35 degrees in my cooler box, and the lake water at 42 degrees, but the pressure is off. The fireplace is built, and what little there is yet to do can be done regardless of the weather. [serene music] 
??????   ??????
It's the end of September now, and if I was going to stay the winter, I would need more meat. Today was the last day of sheep season, and the sight of four good rams in a bunch convinced me. Although this handsome bull makes it tempting, lucky for him I like sheep meat 

[01:02:01]


better than caribou. I opened and closed the season with one shot. The search for meat is over. I hated to see the big ram end like this, but I suppose he could have died a lot harder than he did. The pelt must have weighed 100 pounds when I dragged it from the water. Nearly all the blood had soaked out of the beautiful white hide. I put my smoker into operation, and I kept it going all day. Sheep liver and onions for supper--a satisfying day. September 23rd: Clear, calm, and a frosty 20 degrees. Hope Creek is beginning to ice up. put the thermometer in the creek mouth: 31 degrees. If the creek stopped moving, it would freeze up in no time. [water gurgling] [sawinnoise] Today I would cut wood to build up my supply. This business of taking wood out of the savings bank and putting none back has been bothering me to no end. Plenty of meat hanging from the meat tree, plenty of wood, my cabin tight and warm. I looked forward to freeze-up. [wolf howling] 

[01:04:19]


It's November now, and in preparing for freeze-up, I made a sled out of spruce poles, using the spruce runners I had put in traction. The frame was held together with pegs and short pole bracings. I planed the runners smooth and painted them with a film of wood glue. [pounding] With its deck poles, handles, and crossbars, it would be a vehicle in which I could push a good-size load. Too bad I didn't have a caribou to pull it. [wind whistling] Dead calm and zero degrees. The wind and snow died during the night. It's important that I keep my pathway to the lake open. I chipped through three inches 

[01:06:19]


of ice to fill my water bucket. In a short time, I will have a safe highway for miles in each direction. Freeze-up has arrived. It's warm inside my cabin, a toasty 40 degrees. Peppery ram stew for supper, just the way I like it. It's got everything in it but the kitchen sponge. [serene music] 
??????   ??????
Dead calm and zero degrees. The lake ice has increased one inch in 24 hours. It took one hour to the gravel bank of the connecting stream-- not quite as fast as paddling. I saw big wolf tracks in the drifted snow, then I saw many more wolf tracks--a bad sign. About 100 yards farther on, a calf dead on the bank. They had not fed on the carcass at all. I butchered it up into sections. Blood was frozen on his hind legs. Evidently one of the wolves had hamstrung him while the rest of the pack had held his attention. 

[01:08:20]


Had they done it just for sport? Suddenly the wolves lost a few points with me. I loaded up the sled and headed for home. I chopped off a chunk of moose hindquarter. The meat shattered like ice. The magpies soon took command, but there will be plenty for all. December 31st: 32 degrees below 0 during the heat of the day. Today I hiked a couple of miles down the lake. I do believe winter at Twin Lakes is better than summer. I crossed a wolverine track that was headed for Low Pass Creek. I must be on the lookout for that character. On such a trip, snowshoes are a must. With no wind, I could travel all day in -45 degrees and be comfortable. It is warmer on top of the pass than it is along the lake. Moisture must make the difference. My face and fingers felt the bite and the cold as soon as I reached lake level. It was good to be back at the cabin. January 2nd:45 below, a land without motion. In the dead of winter, nothing seems to move, 

[01:10:20]


not even a twig on the willows. The thickness of ice is now a strong 28 inches. In this very cold weather, the hole in the ice gradually closes in from the sides until it is a hole no longer. January 9th: What do you know? Here comes Babe in the T-Craft on skis. He brought a burlap sack half full of butter beans, 50 pounds of sugar, and a big box of dried apples, also some mail. He also brought me two pairs of heavy socks that his wife, Mary, had knitted for me. It was just like Christmas. February 21st:26 degrees, snowing and blowing, 27 inches of snow on the level. My snow shovel works well. My paths are beginning to look like small canyons with steep white walls. I wish brother Jake could be up here to see this. February is almost gone, and that didn't take long. Still, the snow depth stays at 27 inches at my checking station. It settles between snows. On the way back to the cabin, I cut across the wolverine track, the one that's been eluding me for so long. And then there he was, the one 

[01:12:22]


with the ferocious reputation. He didn't look so ferocious to me. It's very warm in the sun but cool in the shadow of the mountain as I snowshoed back to the cabin. The end of March: the sun was warm, and the eaves dripped. I do believe the days of snow and ice are numbered. On one of my trips, I had notid a huge burl on a dead spruce tree. Today I would go back and salvage it. I slabbed it with a four-inch cut next to the tree. The cap would be about seven inches deep, and perhaps from that, I would carve a bowl. Two slabs on the packboard and in for lunch. The slabs will make interesting tabletops. After lunch, I dumped the two-pound coffee can of cranberries I had picked into a pan to cook them in their own juice. A fistful of sugar was next, followed with a shot of corn syrup. When the mixture cooled, I poured it off into empty bottles. Now those sourdough pancakes would have an elegant topping in the morning. April 22nd: it is good to see bears on the mountain again--a mother and two fine-looking cubs-- good company for a man out here. Most people would think a bear den to be a smelly place. On the contrary. I have found them to be clean and fresh, as if the bear walked in, laid down, 

[01:14:24]


got up, and walked out. With the receding snow, the caribou are starting to show themselves again, and I'm sure the wolves are not too far behind. There are many ptarmigan in the willow flats. The roosters are full of cackle, and they are fast coming out of their winter plumage. [ptarmigan clucking] [water gurgling] I have made it through my first winter at Twin Lakes. With the arrival of spring, it feels good to get back to work on the projects that have been on hold. And the new cache will keep the bears and other critters out of my food supplies. >> narrator: Dick Proenneke would spend the next 35 years alone in the wilderness, carefully documenting life at Twin Lakes until 1998. At the age of 82, Dick decided that the -50 below winters were becoming too much of a chore and it was time to leave this one man's wilderness. Dick has since formally entrusted his homestead to the Park Service of Lake Clark National Park. His cabin will be maintained as a historic site, and he may return to stay in it at any time he wishes. And while he may not make the trip physically again, his spirit will always linger in the perfect notches of his logs. Captioning and audio description provided by the U.S. Department of Education.

>> Gregg: A dangerous developing standoff. Mass demonstrations and protestors battling riot police. Rallying against a sudden power grab against the islamist president. 
>> Heather: I'm heather childers. Here is a live look at tahrir square. Group of hard-core demonstrators vowing to stay until until mohammed morsi invokes a decree granting himself absolute power. This is how bad the violence got. Thousands clashing with police and morsi supporters and new pressure on the president to back down and fear that violence will flare up. Steve? 
>> Reporter: The number of those tents put up by protestors has grown. They are intent to stay there throughout the week but the number of protestors on the street has declined dramatically over the last 24 hours. On late friday there were up to 40,000 people on the square. The protests did turn violent here in cairo and other cities. Buildings torched. Police cars torched. A lot of tear gas and pepper spray in the shutdowns between protestors and security forces. And morsi and the top justices. Many chief justices here in cairo and across the country they will no longer to go work until the president repeals his decrease for a power grab. We're seen what could be a show down on the streets. That is when supporters on tuesday and saying that he is trying to be a dictator will face off. Both opponents and supporters of the president hauling out people and major marches expected on tuesday. 

[00:02:12]


>> Heather: Steve, thank you. 
>> Gregg: Contest in the background on egypt's president morsi. He was elected in june of this year after a revolution overthrowing president hosni mubarak. He is head 6 muslim brotherhood. He is the first freely elected president and first islamist to be head of an arab state. They accuse him of trying to monopolize powers, the courts and media and parliament and in the end, sharia law, imposing strict islamic principles. 
>> Heather: It raises new questions coming one day after egypt help broker a cease-fire in the gaza strip. Former u.S. Ambassador to the u.N. John bolton joined us earlier to weigh in saying it's no coincidence. 
>> He didn't wait but one day before moving here. So whether he had a wink and a nod from president obama or whether whether he felt emboldened in the wake of the cease-fire to believe the u.S. Would not criticize him or do anything major to stop this power grab, I think we'll have to find out in the next few days. The timing is not coincidental. You can b bet on that. 
>> Heather: Coming up the latest reaction from the white house to the turmoil in egypt. We will have a live report from washington. 
>> Gregg: New signs of tough challenges ahead for gaza. Number two leader of hamas now saying the group wl not stop arming itself. A commented suggesting that indirect negotiations on the border deal could be very difficult. In the meantime, life at the gaza strip returning to normal after the week long strikes. Tens of those of children heading back to school. Cease-fire appears to be holding. Conner powell with more on that. 

[00:04:15]


>> Reporter: This is still fragile cease-fire. It is important to point out that the cease-fire is holding but still massive challenges has to be dealt with. Israel and hamas will send representatives to cairo to continue negotiations through the mediators. Later this next couple of days or so probably starting on monday, but there is talks from hamasaying they will continue to rearm and continue to fight, but right now the cease-fire is holding as part of the agreement. Israel said they will ease the blockade around gaza, but israel wants guarantees for security because these are two of the really big points that will be worked out in the coming days. Still, life in the holy land is beginning to return to some type of normal life here. Schools are reopening on both sides of the border. Yesterday. Israeli children went back to school in southern israel. This coming as stores and markets are reopening and in gaza, palestinian children returned to school for the first time in more than a week. This comes after the rockets and missiles have stopped. There are some signs of legally progress. Also we are hearing that palestinian officials in gaza are being able to go out and take boats out and say the fishermen are able to take their boats out. There are positive signs, also most of the israeli troops that begin to mass along the border they have withdrawn from that area. Border is being paroled by hamas and israeli troops but a much smaller contingent. All signs of progress in terms of keeping this cease-fire going forward. There are some big issues to be dealt with in the coming days. There is a real concern that this fragile cease-fire could be brokep with any type of flare-up of violence. We will be watching over the next days and weeks. 

[00:06:16]


>> Gregg: Conner, thank you. 
>> Heather: U.S. To the ambassador to the u.N. Susan rice blaming the intelligence committee for her claim that the benghazi consulate attack grew out of a protest over an anti-muslim film. That is before the truth emerged that was coordinated attack carried out consulate security asked for more protection. She is responding why she repeated her initial assessment on five different talk shows just before the election. 
>> When discussing the attacks against our facilities in benghazi, I relied solely and squarely on the information provided to me by the intelligence community. I made clear that the information was preliminary and that our investigations would give us the definitive answers. 
>> Heather: Let's bring in bob cusack managing editor of the hill. It wasn't me, it was them. Is that good enough to get her off the hook for going before the five sunday talk shows repeating and saying it was a spontaneous protest against an anti-islamic film. That is enough? 
>> I think susan rice is not going to get all the blame. This administration has said contradictory things, don't blame the messenger, these are not lines in a play. When you appear on the five sunday shows and make those claims, you are putting your credibility on the line. The problem here is if she is nominated to replace hillary clinton the media as well as fox news and libyan president was saying it was an act of terrorism and the white house was saying different things on that. That is the problem here. If president obama no, ma'am niats rice we'll have a bruising confirmation process. 

[00:08:22]


>> We know in the initial assessment that was put in the initial report and the language was softened. President obama said that she had nothing to do with benghazi, a quote, so why was she is person to answer the initial question. Do you think it may have been she knew he was anxious to get that nomination for secretary of state and would go along with the talking points unquestioned? 
>> I think it's a very good question. That is what republicans in congress are asking. Why would you put somebody out there that doesn't have a direct involvement in it. And obama bytrongly defending her at that press conference, he has boxed himself in. If he does nominate her, he is picking a fight with congress or if he backs down, if he doesn't nominate her he will look weak. 
>> Heather: Way tonight take a look at this. It was opinion piece by maureen dowd. Rice should have realized when a gang showed up with mortars known as hotbed of sympathizers and islamic training camps... Zbleelts that raises two good questions. Why didn't she realize there had to be something more to this attack and as a result why didn't she look at the classified intel that she had access to? Why wasn't her and not hillary out in front initially? 
>> Hillary clinton was fairly quiet in the days after this. Why wasn't hillary clinton up on capitol hill or on those sunday shows. There is lot. We still don't know a lot of answers. Mike rogers has defended the intelligence community. There are a lot of questions ongoing investigations but it will be fascinating to see if obama goes forward and decides to nominate rice. 

[00:10:33]


>> THERE IS A john McCain and lindsay graham, they have threatened to block her possible nomination. McCAIN CALLED HER COMMENTS NOT Very bright. As result he and others are accused of being racist. Is questioning her qualifications specifically following her benghazi statements, do you think that is racist? 
>> Democrats have been certainly suggesting that. Of course republicans say that is ridiculous. YOU LOOK AT GRAHAM and McCain who have been constant critics of the obama administration but you look at center, susan collins who has strongly supported rice in her lowell as u.N. Ambassador praised her at her initial confirmation hearing. Collins is saying that rice has to answer the question or she won't vote for her. That is major problem for the administration. I think it's a good move by rice she is trying to dial it down. SHE IS WILLING TO meet McCain. The temperature has to come down a little bit in order for her to possibly be nominated. If at this level it will be tough. 
>> Heather: Should she still be nominated? 
>> I think it will be very close to get the votes she needs. If the new congress, they will need five republican votes. It will be tough to get five republicans and very close. Could they pick up o of a few? Yes, but that is assuming if all the democrats will vote for her death. 
>> Bob, we appreciate. >>. 
>> Gregg: An explosion that ripped through a building damaging several other homes. What police now say is a real miracle. 
>> Heather: And pope benedict xvi crowning new princes of catholic church. What is striking about these six what they are not. 

[00:12:34]

[00:25:47]


>> Heather: Welcome back. Looking at tahrir square. A tense hard-core demonstrators growing at this hour. Demonstrators clashing with riot police in the fog of tear gas. Demanding that president morri revoke a decree granting himself near absolute power as there are new questions about the timing of in this. 
>> Molly: The obama administration says egypt has a, quote, constitutional vacuum and needs to figure out big governmental issues of checks and balances and rule of law, quote, through democratic dialogue. The president's opponent john McCAIN WHO WILL OBJECT FOX NEWS Was a bit more direct today mentioning mohammed morsi saying that president morsi should renounce his power grab before things get out of hand hash tag egypt. President obama who spent part of his day promoting small business saturday at a bookstore in virginia spoke to morsi on wednesday to thank him for his personal leadership in negotiating a cease-fire between israel and hamas. Now one u.S. Ambassador to the u.N. Says morsi is taking advantage of his part in that cease-fire. 
>> He didn't waited but one day before moving here. So whether he had a wink and nod from president obama or whether he simply felt emboldened in the wake of cease-fire to believe the u.S. Really wouldn't criticize him or do anything major to stop this power grab, i think we'll have to find out here in the next few days. The timing is not coincidental. 
>> Molly: Now there are protests and counter protests on his his decision to fire the nation's top prosecutor. The state department says the moves, quote, raise concerns for many egyptians adds and for the international community. One of aspirations of the revoluon was to ensure that power wouldn't be overly concentrated in any one institution but the statement did not mention morsi by name. 

[00:28:14]


>> Gregg: The fragile cease-fire between israel and hamas appears to be holding with both sides declaring victory but the threat of a conflict between israel and iran is still looming large. World watched as israel's iron dome defense system protected lives and property by intercepting 421 rockets from gaza, that is 84% success rate. What did they learn from this latest conflict. Let's talk about that with a lieutenant general, great to see you. If israel launches a tactical strike to take out iran's nuclear sites, they can expect retaliation not just from iran but two other countries, talk to us about that. 
>> They are going to get strikes from gaza as hamas did just recently in this eight-day conflict but they didn't get anything out of lebanon like they did four years ago. That is what they've got to be very fearful of, upwards of 50,000 missiles in lebanon that could rain down on israel at the same time coming from gaza. They could expect an attack on iran they would get missiles from both leojsz in addition to iran. They gained a lot of experience in this exercise far more so than when I was over there four years when they had an operation. They had nothing to stop the missles coming in. 
>>> Now from what I understand hezbollah and lebanon have armed themselves with far more advanced weapons but the israelis have to be concerned about their bases and airfields. 
>> Absolutely. Because the airfields will be attacked simultaneously with attacks on civilian population. They are going to be trying to generate sorties toward iran, not towards lebanon and gaza. 

[00:30:28]


>> Gregg: What about preparations for moving ground forces into both gaza, maybe to some extent on the west bank, but into lebanon? 
>> I think they are going to have to do both when they attack iran's nuclear sites because the air power will be in that direction. That will be the air campaign. The ground campaign has to be in lebanon and gaza in that priority and simultaneously to take out those key launching is sites. 
>> Gregg: During the eight day conflict between hamas and gaza and israeli defense forces, how good was the intel and to what extent were they in degrading the missile systems in gaza? 
>> It was superb. Many of the targets they hit. When you saw the video that you saw on television they got huge secondary explosions that meant the targeting was spot on. The way they did it, they kept it in a very tight area so they didn't have nearly as much as collateral damage as they did four years ago. They improved greatly and it's because of of their intelligence. They get great credit for that. 
>> Gregg: The conflict between hamas in gaza and the israelis appears to be quite cyclical. There is a pause and then it's breached generally by hamas firing rockets into israel. Then there is a military escalation. There is an exchange and then a cooling-off period and another cease-fire. I talked to dan gillerman, well known ambassador in israel. He said the only way it will end is stamp out hamas. Can that really be done? 

[00:32:28]


>> First of all I agree with the ambassador. I think he is spot on. With the ideology they have that calls for the destruction of israel the only way you are going to defeat them is actually get them on the ground. Now that is going to be very challenging because a lot of them have a backdoor to go into egypt. With president morsi being a muslim brotherhood, he is supporting them, although he played a key role in this truce. The fact is to stop this from happening they are going to have to destroy hamas. 
>> Gregg: Hamas will rearm with iranian made rockets and other weapons that are smuggled in through gaza through sudan and egypt. Egypt says, of course, and did just several days -- we'll that I can sure they don't rearm. You don't believe that, do you? 
>> Not at all. Egypt has been letting them come through the corridor and their part of the problem. When we had mubarek there, he was pretty good about cutting the flow of weapons. That is one of new challenges that the israelis and united states has in stopping this continued growth of hamas and aggressiveness. It's a big challenge. I don't have an answer. Until egypt weighs in and tries to stop it, it's going to continue. 
>> Gregg: Can the united states, because we give egypt $1.5 billion in aid each year, exercise influence to force egypt to capitulate? 
>> We better. If we don't it's going to get works. That is our best bargaining chip. That is an excellent point. That is our best bargaining chip. 
>> Did benjamin netanyahu, who by the way up for reelection, make a mistake by se of his critics claim by not under taking a ground invasion in gaza to really go after hamas and weapons? 

[00:34:35]


>> I don't think he did it this time. He is very precarious position. He has an election coming up. He has continued growth of nuclear capabilities in iran that he has put focus on. He has got his eye on the top prize. He is not going to be pulled off his desire to stop the nuclear armament by iran by a second target in gaza. 
>> Gregg: Lieutenant general, it's good to see you. Thank you. 
>> Heather: Pope benedict xvi presiding over a very special ceremony to elevate 6 new cardinals. This group is much more diverse. Made up entirely of non-europeans including one american. The pope says that his new selection completes the elite group that will choose his successor. Lauren green has more details. 
>> Reporter: You know two very important observations, you just said about the new members they are relatively young and native european or italian but the group is heavily weighted weighted with both. It was at a ceremony in rome. They hail from india, nigeria and united states. Pope is expanding the hierarchy where the church itself is growing. 
>> It's really quite striking the range from asia to africa to latin america, the number of people that he is bringing into the college of cardinals now. I would see I more in positive terms. I don't think it is a walking away from europe. He definitely appointed a lot of europeans several months ago. This is making the balance. 

[00:36:38]


>> Reporter: And less than a year after the previous one and they say the pope is eager to keep the number of cardinals at the required 120 who are under the age of 80 and eligible to choose his successor. God only knows when that will be. 
>> We have no indication that the pope is anything but good health but at the same time 85 is 85. He clearly wants the college of cardinals to be at full staff going forward. 
>> There is a bit have controversy about the lone american. Archbishop james michael harvey has been in charge of the papal household for several years and direct superior of the pope's former butler who is new jailed for stealing. They is seem by some vatican insiders away from the pope's inner circle. 
>> Heather: Lauren green reporting. 
>> Gregg: A vew report examines homeland security and suggests the administration is refusing to identify enemies of the state as terrorists. Millions of americans are doing shopping at small businesses today. 
>> And success of these mom and pop shops could tell us a lot about the entire economy. We'll take look into the future. cold... DayQuil, But I still have a runny nose.

[00:42:11]


>> Heather: Today is small business saturday. Even president obama taking parted, taking his daughters to an independent bookstore in arlington, virginia today. This is why, small businesses are so important to our nation's economy. Take a look at these numbers. According to the u.S. Small business administration, they represented 99.7% of all employer firms and employ half of all private sector employees. What does it tell us about america's economic future. Gary is president of coltbaum capital management. Thanks for joining us. So this is about main street, not wall street. You heard I said about small business saturday. Can this help small businesses from ending 2012 in the red? 
>> Any concerted effort to put small business front and center is huge. Small business has had it rough. Access to capital has not been easy. We had a tough economy. Even though they are fighting the big businesses, you see the videos of people standing in line walmart. You are not hearing about people standing in line at uncle bob's flower shop. It's the driver and engine of all business going forward. 
>> Heather: In terms of new jobs added by small businesses, this is another great statistic when you take a look at importance of these small neighborhood community businesses. Small firms, they account for 65% or 9.8 million of the 15 million net new jobs that are created. So we're talking about creating new jobs when you are going out shopping in these stores? 
>> Of course. 50% of all workers is small business. It's been the engine of growth throughout the united states. If we can get them off the ground and get capital flowing again and feeling confident again, they are at the create more stores and then we get into a cycle. I don't know if today is really meaningful overall but the fact we're talking about and many other people and president was out talking about it small business, that is good news and hopefully it continues. 

[00:44:42]


>> Perhaps something that making this day more important for these small businesses are the tax hikes and the tax increases that they are facing come the end of the year. A tax increase for top net income earners, from 35 to 39.6% in 2013. For all intents and purposes that involves small business owners? 
>> It's a lot of them. There is a fight going on. The left saying it will not affect small business too much. The right is saying it will. There is a lot of politics going on. My only question is how taking money out of anybody to put into washington, d.C. Which is has been very ineffective with our capital is going to help -- i don't get it. Somebody runs a small business and make a few hundred thousand a year to tell them you are going to pay $15-20,000 a year plus obamacare, I on don't think that is good news. I wish they had a better idea. Elections have consequences. I gather taxes are going up. 
>> Heather: According to ernest & young they are projecting that that tax rate will kill 710,000 small business jobs. People, individuals support businesses help that? 
>> Yes, it's going to help. Look, there is a reality. Dollars do speak when all said and done. Businesses are not just businesses they are people. They are making decisions based on their bottom line. When you are small, a few thousand dollars could mean an extra employee or not. I know some people say that is not true. I would like them to put themselves in their shoe. 
>> Heather: So every dollar counts. Get out there and supported small businesses. Happy thanksgiving. 
>> Gregg: President obama and house speaker john beern is set to meet again to try to, boehner to s try to avoid spending cuts. How close are they to striking a deal. 

[00:46:54]


>> Heather: A live look at tahrir square a day after morsi granted himself near absolute power that led to this. 
[ Speaking arabic ] now we need a little bit more... 
[ Male Announcer ] AT HUMANA, WE UNDERSTAND The value of quality time and personal attention. Which is why we are proud to partner with health care professionals who understand the difference that quality time with our members can make... That's a very nice cake! OHH! [ giggles ]

[ Male Announcer ] HUMANA. ?????? ?????? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA7??fV$ >>. 

[00:50:57]


>> Gregg: The world watching a pivotal moment for the middle east. Mohammed morsi decring his word is above the rule of law. Starting a ferocious reaction from a whole lot of egyptians as we look back to the two years that put him in power, is egypt better off? Ambassador is former ambassador to the united nations for special political affairs, are they better or worse now? 
>> They are in a process. President morsi's move was clearly an overreach. Where they are now is negotiating a constitution. What opponents of morsi will say in shaping this constitution they will put in to place into effect a permanent of dominance for the muslim brotherhood. That is why they are so up in arms because they fought against mubarek for many years. 
>> Gregg: Isn't that what is happening here. He has usurped all power, he has pronounced these untouchables and new fair oh of egypt and they are calling him. Tens of thousands have taken the street to denounce morsi and burning the offices of muslim brotherhood in two cities. Where do you see this going, ambassador? 
>> There was broad support for mubarek after and many people in the streets of cairo and egypt think that the former regime got off lightly. With that said, I think there is a widespread ceiling they are entering a new phase in which the fundamental institutions and democratic protections are in jeopardy. That is why morsi needs to step forward in any new constitution these checks and balances that are so important need to be maintained and there isn't going to be a continuation. 

[00:53:02]


>> Gregg: I am wondering if he is going to the opposite direction. Could it be the goal of the muslim brotherhood and morsi to turn egypt into a repressive state governed by sharea law and maybe this is the first step? 
>> It's certain lay long term goal. The question is in the short term with morsi with his new found standing on the international stage. If he is smart, he is going to play again this for the consolidation of his power but not overstep his bounds. The important thing is to look at the constitution and look what is in there and to make sure that minority parties and secular parties and democratic principles are protected. 
>> Gregg: Do they stand a chance in the opposition of lawyers and other groups, do they stand a chance of stopping the muslim brotherhood especially if their goal is strict sharea law? 
>> They have to engage and make sure that this doesn't cross the line. I think that people are watching closely. As you can see from the streets of care row they been on the take it standing down. 
>> Gregg: The timing of this would be embarrassing for obama after one day was heaping price on morsi for mediating the israeli-hamas cease-fire. Instead of silence, should president obama now condemn this in the strongest of terms and maybe threatened to threatened to withhold billions of aids also morsi recants? 
>> I think you'll have to see coming down of his position this won't be a wholesale power grab. The administration will be watching closely. Up to now they have been muted on it. I think they will have to as senator McCain they will have to take a harder line. This is a process unfolding. It's about the constitution. That will be critical. 

[00:55:13]


>> Gregg: Senator john mccain sent out a tweet. President morsi should renounce his power grab before things get out of hand. ONE OF THING that McCain can do is rip up the purse strings, egypt will get almost $10 billion from the imf and united states. We could whole thf money? 
>> The imf money has been agreed upon I think for some $4.5 billion and u.S. Assistance is under congressional authority. A lot of that goes to the military. I think the military has had a long relationship with the united states and it will be interesting to see what they feel about these changes, as well. 
>> The military and ministry of interior is the only thing that morsi hasn't taken over yet.

[01:00:05]


>> Hello, everyone, I'm heather childers, welcome to a brand new hour inside america's headquarters. 
>> Gregg: I'm gregg jarrett. And one of the top governors fighting for the controversial school voucher program. It's headed to court and the outcome could have a ripple effect all over the country. Our legal panel weighs in. 
>> Heather: And small business saturday, part of the country that really needs it. The region hit hard by super storm sandy. We will have a live report. 
>> Gregg: And saying goodbye to a television icon. We look back at a man america loved as good guy and hero for six decades, from "i dream of jeanie" to the reboot of "dallas". We remember larry hagman. 
>> Heather: But first, a fox news alert on our top story, thousands of protesters taking to the streets of egypt. Rallying against a sweeping power grab by president morsi, this is a live look at tahrir square and the judges are being called on to walk off the job. The protest against the egyptian president. Steve harrigan is streaming live from cairo, egypt. So, steve, how serious a challenge are the judges to morsi and his decree? 
>> Heather, I think this move by the chief justices here in cairo and other judges across the country is a serious challenge to president morsi, basically they're saying they will not go back to work, no prosecution is going on across much of the country until those decrees issued by the president, giving him power that can't be challenged by the courts, are overturned. Keep in mind that others could follow the jges in this action, and already three aides to president morsi have resigned over his power grabbing decree, this could be the start of something bigger in the government, heather. 
>> And the number of protesters, they appear to be down in the square somewhat. Is the protest beginning to fade? 

[01:02:11]


>> I think it's too early to talk about a fading protest. Of course, numbers were huge on friday after friday prayers, upwards of 40,000 people in the square. Down today, but there are major marches planned in the days ahead. Sunday after morning prayers and then again tuesday. Both sides calling out their supporters, those who support the president and those who think they're trying to become a dictator. It's really going to be a basic test of will, which sides can get more people out on the streets and how calm or violent will these protests be? 
>> Steve harrigan live. Thank you, steve. 
>> Gregg: The truce with hamas seems to be hoding. Militants in the gaza strip were firing about the same amount of rockets into israel during the the eight day conflict, killing dozens wounding hundreds on both sides. With the relative rurn to normal, tens of thousands of children in gaza are going back to school. Later in the newscast we'll get the latest on the cease-fire and a report from connor powell in jerusalem. The white house is keeping a close eye on the clashes after mohammed morsi gave himself sweeping new powers, all of it days after the obama administration praised him for hisole in brokering the mideast cease-fire. Molly henneberg at the white house. I suppose it's no coincidence on morsi's timing here. 
>> Middle east say no president morsi was riding high on the world stage after helping to negotiate the cease-fire between hamas and gaza and made a move to consolidate power in egypt. Here is more on that. 
>> So, now washington has to make a choice, are we going to put more pressure on morsi, but if we do so he may not work with us, instead rising the gaza peace. So it's going to be difficult for the administration to deal with. 

[01:04:17]


>> Reporter: The state department says morsi's move, quote, raises concerns for many egyptians and for the international community, gregg. 
>> Gregg: Molly, what will the president obama administration do? Are we getting any hints here? 
>> So far the obama AtMINISTRATION IS NOT CALLING Out morsi directly. President oba, who spent part of his day today, promoting small business saturday at a bookstore in virginia, spoke to president morsi to thank him for his quote, personal leadership and handling the cease-fire. Days later after the power grab, the department said in a statement, quote, the current constitutional vacuum in egypt could only be resolved by the adoption of a constitution that includes checks and balances and respect fundamental freedoms, individual rights and the rules of law consistent with egypt international commitment. And the state goes on to say we a call for all to resolve issues peacefully and through democratic dialog. Gregg, no mention of morsi by name in that statement. 
>> Gregg: Very interesting, all right. Molly henneberg in washington, thank you. Heather. 
>> Heather: Well, a flash fire at the u.S. State department sends four people to the hospital. Officials are now investigating the cause of the fire which has since been put out. The amount of damage done to the building is not yet known. D.C. Police though do not suspect any foul play. 
>> Gregg: As we just saw in molly henneberg's report, president obama getting into the holiday spirit doing a little christmas shopping on small business saturday. Mr. Obama and the first daughters, malia and sasha shopping at an independent bookstore in arlington, virginia, and the president kind of keeping his list top secret. Maybe something there for first lady michelle obama. I would-- 
>> maybe. And you were shopping with your two young girls. 
>> Gregg: A little yesterday. 
>> Heather: Very similar. The president at just one of the small businesses around the u.S., Hoping to see a jump in holiday sales, mom and pop shops promoting big discounts, urging customers to buy local, after the destruction caused by super storm sandy, small business owners in the new york city area may need a holiday spark. Anna kooiman is live on babylon, long island and providing a spark, hello, anna. 

[01:06:35]


>> Reporter: Hello, everybody, and today is small business saturday and it's a difference this year because of super storm sandy, the northeast is reeling and the owner of rumors gift shop in long island says sandy couldn't have hit at a worst time. She depends on a percent many her sales the last through months of the year, but she's happy that her vendors are allowing her to delay payment. 
>> I was in tears, actually, over that, because I was a scared. I don't want to lose my credit, my good name, my good reputation so they're sticking by me. 
>> This business is like your child, isn't it? 
>> This is my other home. 
>> And well, from staten island to long island, local businesses are urging customers to give back to their local communities and help provide neighborhoods devastated by the storm. Last year on small business saturday, an estimated 100 million people participated in the growing annual event. The economic impact of sandy has been estimated by moody's alytics in the 50 billion dollar range and some is from the lost economic activity and airlines canceling flights and casinos not being able to take bets. The u.S. Small business administration is making loans are up to 2 million dollars available to companies trying to get their heads above water. 
>> We've been on the ground for weeks now and working closely with families to help them get back on their feet as quickly as they can. 
>> Reporter: And regardless of the hit in sales, many of these small businesses took around the region, heather, amazingly, many are taking a portion of their profits earned today on small business saturday and giving them back to sandy relief effort. 
>> Still providing help. Thank you so much, anna, appreciate it. 
>> A heartless crime striking hard hit victims is super storm sandy and fire and flooding damage in the breezy point section of new york city, looted over thanksgiving. And one couple had a $25,000 coin collection along with jewelry and watches stolen. The break-ins happening wednesday or thursday when many people were away to celebrate a holiday. 

[01:08:48]


>> Heather: Dozens of building inspectors are in springfield, massachusetts right now assessing the damage from a massive natural gas explosion that happened there. The blast injured 18 people, most of them first responders. And police received reports of a gas leak and evacuated downtown springfield about an hour before the explosion. The blast destroyed several buildings, blew out windows for blocks all around it. 
>> Well, he played a scheming oil tycoon and a cheating husband, but television audiences held their breath when somebody shot jr. Actor larry hagman has died. He made jr ewing from tv's smash hit "dallas" a household name. Before the actor drilled for oil in texas he fell in love with a jeanie in a bottle. Dominic di-natale is live in los angeles with more. 
>> Reporter: Hey, and larry hagman, in the height of his dallas career, believed to be the most famous actor in the world and his charismatic portrayal of the smirking dark jr ewing and launched them into stratospheric fame. 
>> Charismatic, you know, and charming, but that evil side, that macavelian plotting that constantly went on. 
>> And he just became the character he portrayed on the show and he was definitely the master. 
>> When they redid dallas, he was on it again, what a career, 80 some years, he was 81, yes, he worked for most of it. Pretty amazing. 
>> Hagman died in a hospital in dallas, texas friday afternoon and it was due to complications from his battle with cancer says his family. And his final moments were not just his relatives, but his long time friend linda gray who played his on-screen wife sue ellen, she says he brought joy to everyone he new, generous, funny and talented and she was going to miss him enormously. 

[01:10:55]


>> And his role as tony nelson on "i dream of jeanie" andlators in the his career, he took serious roles in oliver stone's "nixon" and "primary colors" he's been working on the second series or had been latest for tnt due to air in january. So word yet, gregg, from the network how the series will deal with hagman. The series was almost built around a character jr. Hard to imagine where they go from here. 
>> Gregg: Dominic, thank you very much. It put dallas on the map as a city and glamourized the wealth you know, the cowboys and cattlemen and oil riches and so forth. 
>> Heather: And people still associate dallas to this day. 
>> Gregg: Sure, just the name dallas, you don't always think of the city, you think of the tv show and jr ewing. 
>> Heather: And the big belt buckles. A shocking report. Is the obama administration putting the u.S. In danger by refusing to identify enemies of the state as terroris. 
>> Gregg: And we are approaching, like it or not, the fiscal cliff. Huge spending cuts and tax hikes, but president obama wants to raise taxes on rich americans. How about sitting with voters? Instead of raising tax rates on the american people and accepting the damage it will do to our economy, let's start to actually solve the problem. Now let's focus on tax reform that closes special interest loopholes and lowers tax rates. You know what? And it won't kill the country if we raises taxes on millionaires a little bit.

[01:16:26]


>> welcome back, time for a quick check of the headlines, pope benedict xvi presiding over the ceremony today. To elevate six new cardinals. The group is significant in that it is made up entirely of noneuropeans including one american. The body of former palestinian leader yasser arafat will be exhumed to determine if he was poisod when he died back in 2004. The detection of radioactive substances found on his clothes is reopening the investigation. And former championship boxer hector matcho commachoo died this morning at a hospital in puerto rico, unconscious since being shot in the face on thursday and the boxer's mother making the decision to take him off life support. 
>> The time is running out for the president and congress to avoid falling off that so-called fiscal cliff which would mean mandatory spending cuts, tax hikes for nearly all americans come january 1. President obama wants to raise tax rates on the top 2 or 3% income earners by letting the bush tax cuts expire for those making more than $250,000 a year, and take a look at this. The post election rasmussen poll find that americans are roughly split on that idea. 43% favor. 41 oppose it, 15 not sure. Joining us now christine with the spokesperson for former vermont governor howard dean and also president new communications, joins us, former republican manager and aid to the house leadership. Christy, let me start with you. Look at his news conference, you remember this, the president makes this big claim that a majority of americans, in fact, he said more than voted for him support his idea to raise taxes on incomes above 250. But that poll we just showed, just aired shows that's not true. They're split. His idea doesn't even have close to the support he claims, agreed? 
>> Disagree, no. With all due respect to mr. Rasmussen. 

[01:18:29]


>> There's the poll, does that look like-- 
>> polls said a lot of different things, gregg and what most polling at that asks people about the bush tax cuts show resoundingly they're in favor of ending them for the wealthiest americans. 
>> Gregg: Name one poll. 
>> There's a pew poll from october shows two-thirds of americans. 
>> Gregg: Pow? 
>> Pow that's the poll. 
>> Gregg: It's a little biased wouldn't it. 
>> I would believe that rasmussen is the only poll that called obama-- called the election at that there was going to be a huge romney win, he was not exactly right on that one, gregg. 
>> Gregg: That's true. 
>> So, most polling is going to show that americans are in favor of the bush tax cuts. 
>> Gregg: Trei, two-thirds of those, and want tax hikes and spending cuts to reduce the deficit. And one fourth want spending cuts only. 68%. There are the numbers on your screen. Doesn't that number, 68%, mean that it's politically perilous for your party, republicans, to oppose raising taxes on the top 2 or 3%? 
>> Well, no, they -- it's got to be part of the equation and I think that speaker boehner made that clear, but gregg, let me first start by saying i happen to care very much about the 43% in that poll, but it doesn't erase -- it doesn't erase the fact that a majority of them do not pay taxes and it also doesn't erase the fact that most people support tax increases on other people as opposed to themselves, but i think the american people are a little tired of polls. The election is over, talking points should be over, and it requires compromise to solve problems in this town, something that's been lacking for years. By both sides of the aisle. And so, the issues you're talking about in terms of the specifics, whether it's the tax rates or these deductions, it just cannot be across the board. There are unintended consequences, to be getting rid of deductions, deductions that small business owners count on. Deduction that is people who are putting money back in the economy count on from a real estate investment standpoint and charitable donations as well. 

[01:20:37]


>> Put a cap on it, which wouldn't eliminate deductions, on limit the overall amount you deduct. But, christy. 
>> Yes. 
>> That poll we showed, 68% i just showed trey. 
>> Right. 
>> The deal on raising taxes has to include spending cuts, shouldn't the president endorse the plan put forth by his own debt commission, simpson bowles, of having a 3-1 ratio of spending cuts for revenue increases? 
>> Well, look, I agree. I think most americans are reasonable and they support a balanced approach that does include both tax in. 
>> Gregg: How about a 3-1 ratio. 
>> I agree with that 68%, i would consider myself one of them. What they want are smart cuts. They don't want to cut popular programs likf medicare, social security, paid into all of our lives-- 
>> and the debt, don't they have to be reformed or modified? 
>> I think the john boehner and mitch mcconnell are going to have a tough sell in front of the american people and a reason why paul ryan was a pretty unpopular vice-presidential candidate. People do not want to cut those programs. 
>> Gregg: And during the 2008 presidential debate, the president promised and i looked it up and double-checked it today, he promised that he would have entitlement reform accomplished and put forth by the end of his first term. Hasn't done it. Why not? 
>> Well, I think we need to talk about smart cuts first, and what that means is getting rid of waste and fraud and abuse. It means getting rid of these things. 
>> Gregg: He's breaking his promise, isn't he? 
>> I don't know that that's right. I think when we talked. 
>> Gregg: I watched the debate today, they had a clip. 
>> Sure. 
>> Gregg: Of it on youtube, you can take a look at it. And there are 258 americans signed onto the grover norquist pledge never to quote for a tax hike, closing tax loopholes. Speaker boehner says I'm willing to break it and do the latter on deductions and exemptions and saxby chambliss the senator said it's time to ditch grover and his pledge, is it? 

[01:22:39]


>> All bets are off. I mean, listen, we're in a mess and all bets are off and we shouldn't be held to political organizations that are influencing our elections in terms of getting this mess taken care of, but you know, listen, I have a novel idea for the president. Why doesn't he public size an itemized list of his spending cuts he's prepared to put on the table before asking american people to pay taxes. I mean, it's simple. When you have a credit card debt and you don't ask other people to pay for it or you don't borrow money to pay the interest on it, you make hard choices on your discretionary spending from a weekly basis or a monthly basis, this is just a business that's been run poorly and it's-- 
>> would you agree the president doesn't have a terribly good track record when it comes for proposals for budgets and cuts? The last proposal he submitted to congress not a single member in either the house or the senate, not even his own party voted for it. 
>> Gregg, as you know, that was on a procedural matter th has nothing to do with the substance of the bill. 
>> Gregg: Are you kidding? 
>> When the-- yes, the president has presented an extremely balanced sensible approach. The kind of cuts the democrats want to make are things like getting rid of funding, military planes we haven't used in 30 years because they're outdated and democrats want to do things like get rid of those tax breaks for the wealthiest 2%, which, by the way we're talking about people who make over $250,000 a year. It's almost no one. And really sensible approaches. 
>> Gregg: And trey, last question to you, you heard the clip in our intro, bill kristol, a conservative. Really, the republican party is going to fall on the swords and half of whom voted democrat and half of whom live in hollywood. Is he right? 
>> No, it has to be a balance. I think the republicans are prepared to take -- to take on tax revenues here, but at the same time, let's not take the baby out with the bath water here, let's not, let's not take people -- take confidence out of people from investing back into the economy and real estate and take people away from making charitable donations, it's a mess and it's going to require a balance and the president did not get a mandate and require both people working together. 

[01:24:59]


>> Gregg: And christy, and i gave each of you an equally hard time. You bet. And good to see you. 
>> You, too. 
>> Thank you, f the state as terrorists. And u.S. Government and accountability office investigating both the homeland security department and the justice department. Peter doocy has this report in washington. 
>> The department of justice has not even identified what topic should be covered in their countering violent extremism or cve training despite the fact a report from the accountability office from 210 violent islamic extremists are known to radicalize in america and 80% began since 9-11. And representative susan collins says the administration of the identification of 2009 shooting at fort hood said it was workplace violence, they're not properly learning who they should be on the lookout for. 
>> In order for the press to counter this threat to better understand its roots and how it may develop among certain people in our own country. We have to be willing to name the threat to understand it in order to counter it. 
>> The gao report says plainly that misinformation about the threat and dynamics of radicalization to violence can harm security by sending low he cal stake holders in the wrong direction and unnecessarily creating tensions with potential community partners, but thee is a bright spot in the gao report. The homeland security department is known as effectively identifying to their partners the elements that training on countering violent extremism programs should cover. Heather? 

[01:27:01]


>> And that's peter doocy reporting in washington. 
>> Egypt crippled by a new wave of violence after the latest power grab. So, what's next for egypt in its relationship for the u.S.?

>> it is the bottom of the hour, time now for the top of the news. Building inspectors on the scene in massachusetts, examining the damage from a massive gas explosion, and destroying dozens of buildings. 
>> Gregg: Police nabbing one of the fbi's ten most wanted. Joe signs was busted in gardhara, mexico and is now back in l.A. Accused in a string of gang rethe lated murders. And a day of violent clashes in egypt after president morsi's power grab. Egyptians rioted after morsi gave himself new powers, side lining the country's judges. 
>> Gregg: And tens of thousands of children in the gaza strip now returning to school as the fragile cease-fire between hamas and israel appears to be holding. This as families on both sides of the borders continue picking up the pieces. Connor powell is reporting in jerusalem. Just two days ago it appeared that israel and hamas were on the brink of a full on war, but the cease-fire continues to hold and there are encouraging signs that life is returning to normal here in the holy land. Israeli children returned to school yesterday, and now, markets and shops are reopening, now that the threat of rockets has ended in today's palestinian children and in gaza also returned for school. As the cleanup there begins. No doubt there are still channels, but so far, both sides seem willing to continue the cease-fire, part of the agreement calls for an easing of the blockade around gaza, it's not exactly clear what that means, but we have seen some evidence that the palestinian fishermen in gaza are now being allowed to fish off the coast, something they were not able to do previously when the restrictions were in place. And gone are the massive amounts of israeli troops from the border, instead it's now just small groups of hamas and israeli soldiers patrolling the border. No doubt the cease-fire will be tested in the coming days and weeks and months ahead, but both israel and hamas are sending envoys to egypt to continue building on the small amount of progress that's already been achieved. Gregg? 

[01:33:51]


>> Connor powell in jerusalem. Thanks. Violent protests across egypt after president mohamed morsi gave himself sweeping power and away from egyptian courts. And many egyptians feel they feel they replaced dictator with mubarak with morsi. And let's bring in fox's national security analyst kt mcfarland. Kt, is it deja vu over again? And we sat here last year and mubarak overthrown and saying it's a pharaoh, and morsi declared the new pharaoh himself? 
>> Yeah, you talked about this a year ago during the arab spring and I said this is a three-act play and revolutions are always three-act plays, and act one get red of the dictator and act two it's the rebel's turn to govern and often not very good at it and the pro democracy rebels who got rid of the dictators they themselves are often swept away and that's act three. That's where we are right now in egypt with a new dictator. Yeah? 
>> I'm sorry to interrupt you and I wanted to ask you also, and probably getting ready to go into this. And as we take a live look at tahrir square, the judges are called on to walk offer the job in protest against morsi, you also have the opposition leader moed el baradei says that it's not possible unless morsi rescinds the powers he's given himself. Are those the things that morsi wants to happen. A lot of judges were appointed by mubarak and he would want them out and does he really need to negotiate or have any dialog with the opposition? Does he want that? 
>> No, he doesn't. And here, this is the final piece in the entire mosaic, and morsi being a complete pharaoh, a dictator. The first thing he and the muslim brotherhood got was a the parliament. Now, a muslim brotherhood controlled parliament. Then the presidency and next the independent army and military. And morsi got rid of the top generals appointed by mubarak and put in his own guys, the muslim brotherhood generals. And the next step was the independent press, state-owned press and media now has been replaced with muslim brotherhood advocates. Now the final step is that independent judiciary, they have now said, well, you can't take us out and morsi says, forget it we're not going to play by your rules, your rules won't even apply to us. So, there's a final step in the progress. Now, what's the end of this? They want to have a new constitution which really does create sharia law and creates an islamist state along the line of the most islamist states in the regions and we've been snookered, 18 months ago a pro u.S. Dictator, albeit, but a pro u.S. Dictator and peace and now months later, islamist country, muslim brotherhood, and threatens the entire region. 

[01:37:14]


>> Heather: What do we do now. The financial card hold the backing to egypt? 
>> The one card we hold. Egypt is the largest importer of wheat. They cannot feed their people unless they import wheat and don't have the money. They run a shortfall. A billion and a half a month if they don't get that brought in by somebody, whether it's a loan or a gift or some kind of assistance, then the egyptian people really are hungry and they're cold and they don't have cooking fuel. And so, that's the big lever we have. Not only the aid that we give them, but coordinate that others give them and I think it's time that we really should tell them we want something for that money. 
>> Heather: And I didn't get a chance to ask you about this, but I spoke with ambassador john bolton earlier today about the timing of all this and he says absolutely no could he he incidence, I have a feeling you would agree. Thank you. 
>> And brokered the peace? 
>> Exactly one taye later. Thank you. 
>> Gregg: One of the busiest shopping days of the year and with 147 million people out shopping this holiday weekend and they're all here in front of our studios, we'll tell you why many americans say they are now feeling more optimistic about the economy. 
>> Heather: They are right outside our doors. Plus, one governor's controversial new school plan may be headed for the supreme court. Does his-- or do his opponents have a case? ?

>> Actually, I don't think that they do and while initially on their face they seem to, the supreme court in recent years made very clear that you're not guaranteed an establishment argument just because you might be funding a religious enterprise. What you need to show is that it promotes a religion or supports a particular religion which these pieces don't do and it was very clear in sellman and the supreme court has stopped taking on these cases and clearly established in 2002 that no, parental private choice is protected and this does not violate. 
>> Gregg: When you saw the supreme court taking the case or not. And the issue here has been, just to be clear, that, you know, some of the vouchers go to schools that are religious and therefore you're violating the first amendment, but now what, david? There's something else here beyond the first amendment. Isn't there an equal protection alleged violation here? What do you think? 
>> Absolutely, gregg. You know, in governor jindal's louisiana they have a ranking, ab, c, d, e, and f. Only the children from those at e and f, the children of those schools are able to get the program. And it discriminates against the other children no question, violating that. And gregg, back to the other subject, 85% of private schools now are now religious in nature. So, this is a very different argument that took place in the 60's, '70s and '80s, a strong establishment clause right now and also create discrimination andt segregates kids into different religious sects because the schools are different religions. 
>> Gregg: Rachel, what do you think of that. 
>> The equal protection has more teeth. The establishment clause, the supreme court made clear how they feel about that, but the equal protection argument is where they might get some hearing on this and that's because, I mean, later cases, school vouchering and privatization of the schools really took off after brown v board of ed was decided and a lot of people decided they didn't want their kid to go to public school anymore because there was going to be a mixture of different races in the public schools and so they started to do these voucher programs, basically shutting down public schools to open up private ones more to their liking and said he no, no, no, you're not allowed to do that and so I think that's going to be the argument that has more teeth here basically you're desegregating our school system by privatetizing. 

[01:46:22]


>> Gregg: David. 
>> The parents, all taxpayers are going to have to pay for the private education of these children and public education for many more children and it's arguably, gregg, on top of everything else, an unconstitutional taking under the 14th and 15th amendment. 
>> I don't agree with that. 
>> I've got to tell you, and the take-- the neighbor's kid-- unconstitutional taking of my tax dollars to pay for my neighbor's kid. 
>> The same amount of money that would otherwise be spent, isn't it? 
>> No, because the moneys that would otherwise be spent is going to the public school system at large. Now you're adding on to that and paying for johnnie next door to go to a catholic school and perhaps mohamed on the other to go to a muslim school. 
>> Gregg: An argument on that, unconstitutional taking, isn't it, rachel? 
>> I don't necessarily agree with that. It boils down to the parental choice and the money is going to get spent where it gets spent. If you want to accepted your kid to private school, that's a choice to send them to private school and don't necessarily have a free pass to pay taxes for the public school. 
>> Gregg: I think if they made vouchers available to all schools, regardless of the grade that the school gets. 
>> Exactly, gregg. 
>> Gregg: And then the arguments-- 
>> how about pouring money into the public schools and vetting teachers better and-- 
>> we could spend hours on that one. David, rachel, good to see you both. Thank you. 
>> Thank you, have a good one. 
>> Heather: Coming up president obama ready to start his second term, but he's now facing some serious economic issues, the looming fiscal cliff and big unemployment numbers. So, do americans think he's doing a good job of running the country? We have the latest polls from scott rasmussen up next. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Aaaaaaaaa allegiance flag of the united states of americaca... Our disabled veterans pledged to sacrifice life and limb to ensure our way of life.

[01:51:22]


>> with president obama looking ahead to a second term. His administration a facing a number of obstacles including the fiscal cliff of course, and high unemployment as well. 
>> In a poll taken just before thanksgiving, majority of americans are giving the president high marks, 54% of voters approve of the job he's doing, while 45% disapprove. So, let's bring in scott rasmussen, and rasmussen reports. He just won the election. 
>> He's gotten a bounce, 50% job approval on election day. Up 4 points now. 95% of democrats think he's doing, and republican aren't impressed. 87% disapprove. It's more than just the job approval rating. Right now 41% of voters tell us the country is headed in the right direction, about as high as it's been during president obama's time in office. 
>> You know, scott, there's a big debate on capitol hill and across america, some groups saying, look, what we really need to do is just cut spending. Other people saying, no, no, no, we just need to hike taxes and you polled folks on that, what did you find. 68%, two out of three said we need a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts. Two significant things here, first, 52% of republicans agree with that. So a majority of republicans are saying we may need to include tax revenue in this mix. The other thing, voters by a 2-1 margin say when the mix is put together, we want to see more spending cuts than tax hikes, but we expect that when congress and the president get together they'll agree on more tax hikes than spending cuts, so there's a lot of skepticism in this. 

[01:53:47]


>> And scott, there's whether or not it's your money or someone else's money, when you're talking your own money how many people are willing to pitch in with more and high taxes. 
>> If they believe that spending is going to be cut and again, people are skeptical on that, 42% say they'd pay a little more in taxes to help balance the budget and 42% would not and people who earn more are more likely to say they'd kick in extra tax revenue. 
>> In the news conference, we were talking about this in a political segment a short time ago, the president said a majority of americans, in fact more americans than voted for me agree with my argument that we need to raise tax rates on those making more than $250,000. What did you fd when you asked that question. 
>> When you ask about raising taxes on people who earn more than $250,000 a year. People say yes. If you discuss rates and other things, it's trickier. A proposal that we focused on recently whether you should get rid of all tax deductions for people who make more than $250,000 a year and people saying yes, you should. The interesting thing, people in upper income brackets are okay with raising the rates, not okay with losing their deductions. 
>> Gregg: I was talking to christy a short time ago and she said, oh, when I cited your poll, she said, well, scott rasmussen, rasmussen poll is same fol overwhelmingly predict add romney victory before the election. Would you like to straighten the record out. 
>> We didn't show any candidate ahead for the margin of error for months and we ended up showing governor romney up a single point the day before the election. In fact, we showed president obama ahead in the electoral college going into election day. 
>> Gregg: I thought as much. Thanks for setting the record straight. 
>> Heather: And we have managed to survive black friday, we've passed it by now and how many people actually participated this year, do you know? 15% told us they were going to go shopping on black friday itself. 15% of all americans, the group that amazes me the most though, 11% finished their shopping before thanksgiving, finished. And about 8 million people told us they finished in the period in one week leading up to thanksgiving. So, while I was worrying about my turkey dinner and who was going to win the football games, they were out shopping, who knew? 

[01:56:18]


>> Scott rasmussen, good to see you. 
>> Heather: And by the way, chapel hill won today. I know that much. 
>> Gregg: A big one. That's going to do it for us. Rick folbaum and arthel neville take over the top of the hour. 
>> We'll see you 5 p.M. Eastern, bye. Or live to your seat high above the atlantic ocean. It's what drives us to create eco-friendly race tracks, batteries that power tomorrow's cars, nearlyndestructible laptops, and the sustainable smart towns of the future.

=======================================================

???????????? 
>> hello everybody, and welcome to a brand new hour inside america's news headquarters, I'm rick folbaum. 
>> Arthel: I'm arthel neville. And the g.O.P. Reaches out planning to push a brand new immigration proposal next week. We've got a fair and balanced look at the bill and if it had a chance to pass. 
>> Rick: And lining up six of the most diverse cardinals ever, and the new generation of catholic leaders. 
>> Arthel: And the new high-tech toys out there this christmas. Never fear, consumer reports is here with the top picks for under the tree. 
>> Rick: But we begin with a fox news alert on the political crisis that is now unfolding in egypt, where just hours ago, the country's highest judicial body calling for a national strike. The protest of a prove by the president there, mohammed morsi granting himself sweeping new powers, a move that since resulted in the violent and widespread protests they've seen. And steve harrigan is streaming live from cairo with the latest. Where do the protests go from here? 
>> Rick, the numbers are down today from what we saw on friday and we're likely to see more large scale protest demonstrations in the coming days, after sunday morning prayers and again on tuesday. What we're likely to see then are really competing margins, those who support the president, who feel like his moves are necessary, to break the log jam and to move the country forward and those who think that the president is trying to achieve a dictatorship. Those who are trying to block him. So we're going to see more large scale protests and the other things to watch resignation is, three presidential aides have recently resigned in the past two hours and the judges are refusing, so if it continues to grow, this could put much more pressure on the egyptian president and we're looking at tahrir square and reminded when the crowds were protesting hosni mubarak, who are they and how united are they? 

[00:02:21]


>> Certainly a lot of similarities both with the scenes and even some of the chants shall the same chants used against hosni mubarak, but this time the muslim brotherhood is not backing the supporters and they back the president instead and among these opposition people on the streets are really 20 different political groups. There are liberals, there are people who fear islamic law, there are people who want the old days to come back and hosni mubarak, so, it's a really mixed bag of protesters and the question is, will they have-- will they have the momentum and the willpower to keep coming out day after day and able to stick around, rick? 
>> Steve harrigan streaming live from cairo, thank you very much. 
>> Get some background on president morsi's rise to power. He was elected in 2012 with a strong mandate winning more than 51% of the vote, as leader of the muslim brotherhood, he was the first islamist elected to be head of an arab state. From the outset morsi had been plagued with allegations that his party wanted to be in the political landscape and a moral code based on strict islamic principles. 
>> There are signs that things are beginning to get back to normal as israel begins to ease border restrictions into gaza after a cease-fire agreement with hamas the other day and that ended eight days of cross border fighting which claimed the lives of 166 palestinians and six israeli civilians. As part of a truce brokered by egypt israel agreed to ease more restrictions of gaza border blockade after they first took over in 2007. 
>> No doubt the white house is watching the developments in egypt very closely as the timing of this sweeping power grab raises new questions. President morsi's move coming just a day after egypt helped broker a cease-fire between israel and hamas. Molly henneberg is live in washington and molly, we heard that the state department put out a statement on this, but omits one thing which is what? 

[00:04:29]


>> His name, president morsi's name. Instead the state department says the decisions and declarations in egypt quote, raised concerns for egyptians and the community. And assuring that power would not be overly concentrated in the hand of any one person or institution. But it does not call on president morsi directly to reverse course. Republican senator john mccain who will be on fox news sunday tomorrow was a bit more direct, saying in a tweet, president morsi should renounce his power grab before things get out of hand, hashtag egypt. And the president called morsi one day, to thank him for a cease-fire between hamas and gaza. 
>> And morsi's actions now putting the obama administration in a tough position, molly. Tell us more about that. 
>> Now that morsi fired top prosecutor and put himself above the judiciary system the white house will back off more public support of him and a former ambassador to the u.N. Under president george w. Bush says that morsi is taking advantage of his part in this cease-fire. 
>> Whether he had a wink and a nod from president obama or whether he simply felt emboldened in the wake of the gaza cease-fire to believe that the u.S. Wouldn't really criticize him or do anything major to stop this power grab, I think we'll have to find out here in the next few days, but the timing is not coincidental, you can bet on that. 
>> The obama administration says that egypt has a constitutional vacuum and needs to figure out governing issues such as checks and balances and rule of low and democratic dialog, arthel. 
>> Arthel: Molly henneberg, thank you very much for the report. 
>> Rick: New details on a fire that broke out at the state department building in washington, reporting four people injured and three rushed to the hospital with one in life threatening condition. The fire reportedly started this morning while work crews were repairing some duct work. A full investigation is underway. 

[00:06:42]


>> Arthel: The holiday shopping season taking on new meaning for retailers struckling to recover from super storm sandy. Stores this manage today reopen are promoting huge sales in small business saturday in hopes of recouping some of their losses. Anna kooiman from long island, new york. 
>> It's small business saturday, but because of superstorm sandy the northeast is reeling economically and has more significant for people like the owners of rumors gift shop. And says that sandy could not hit at a worse time because she counts on 40% of her business in come in the last three months of the year and consumers are more concerned about necessities than gifts. 
>> And the west side slip area, they're out of their homes, they're living with relatives, living all over the place and they're trying to meet with fema, meet with insurance people, meet with restorers, they have no time to shop. They're busy trying to put their lives back together again. 
>> From staten island to long island, local businesses are urging customers to give back to their local communities and help neighborhoods ravaged by storm. Estimated 100 million people participated in the annual event. And in the 50 billion dollar range with about 12 billion in new york city alone and 20 billion of the total is from lost economic activity, for example, airlines canceling flights and restaurants not serving meals and casinos not being able to take bets and shop owners are hoping small business saturday helps their bottom line. 
>> We were closed for ten days, which is a major freakout. When the rents here are not low. 
>> Mom and pop shops getting a big boost on this small business saturday. New york city mayor michael bloomberg announcing 5 1/2 million dollars in matching grants to some of the hardest hit businesses in new york city. Arthel? 
>> Keep the boosts coming. And thanks, anna. 

[00:08:46]


>> Rick: Investigators in western massachusetts are trying to figure out what led to a massive natural gas explosion that leveled a strip club and damaged more than 100 other buildings, including a day care center located right next door. The blast leaving a large hole in the ground, sending 18 people to the hospital, including several emergency responders, and police saying it could have been a lot worse, but they'd already evacuated part of the area after reports of a gas leak late last night and the explosion happened an hour later and the exact cause is now under investigation. 
>> The actor who played one of the most beloved television villains of all time passed away. Larry hagman played jr ewing on the hit series dallas. He was 81 years old. And dominic di-natale, is live, and has fellow cast members and legions of fans, I'm one of them. 
>> Reporter: And arguably the meanest man on tv, arthel, fans are warmly remembering jr ewing. And the evil cheater with the wicked smirk always up to no good. 
>> He's charismatic, you know, and charming, got that evil side, that macavelian plotting that constantly went on. 
>> He just became the character he portrayed on the show and he was definitely the master. When they redid dallas, he was on it again, right? Yeah, what a career, 80 some years, he was what 81 i believe, 81, yeah, and he worked for most of it. Pretty amazing. 
>> Reporter: And the recollection to his fellow cast members of the cbs series which ran for an incredible 14 seasons and patrick duffy who played jr's brother bobby, he says I have to say anything more at this juncture is too soon. And linda gray, played his alcoholic wife sue ellen, was with him in the hospital when he died. And I'll miss him enormously and victoria principshe said, look out, larry is leading the parade. And starring in the show eye dream of jeanie and barbara eden described him as a texas tornado we've lost not just an actor, and television icon, but pure america, and producers of the latest series of dallas will replace him, they are not saying so far. After all, how do you, just how do you replace jr? Arthel? 

[00:11:34]


>> I don't think you do. I just don't think so. I don't know, but you know, a great loss with huge and warm memories for everybody, it seems. Thank you, dominic. 
>> Rick: All right. When we come back, pope benedict xvi crowning some new princes of the catholic church and insiders tell us what's striking about these six which is what they are not. We'll explain. 
>> Arthel: And plus, republican leaders getting serious about immigration reform, backing a plan to high school workers, and can it survive opposition from democrats. 
>> What we need is a demand based guest worker program that allows companies who cannot find american workers to bring the foreign workers that they need. 
>> The system needs to be modernized and needs to take into account the opportunities that it creates for investors or for jobs. from Is bigger than we think ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold? There's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies. Prescription TAMIFLU attacks the flu virus at its source. So don't wait. Call your doctor right away. TAMIFLU is prescription medicine for treating the flu in adults and children one year and older whose flu symptoms started within the last two days.

The flu comes on fast, so ask your doctor about TAMIFLU. Prescription for flu. ]

[ Female Announcer ] SOME People like to pretend a flood could never happen to them. And that their homeowners insurance protects them. 
[ Thunder crashes ] it doesn't. Stop pretending. Only flood insurance covers floods. ?????? ?????? visit floodsmart.Gov/pretend to learn your risk. 
>> Welcome back, time for a quick check of the headlines. And d thieves striking a new york city neighborhood, ravaged by fire and flooding during super storm sandy and three homes were looted over the thanksgiving holiday and more than a dozen during the the week prior. President obama is doing his part this small business saturday. And the president taking his daughters to an independent bookstore in arlington, virginia. And a u.S. Trucker accused of taking military ammo was freed. He claimed he was delivering the goods to phoenix when he accidentally crossed into mexico and sentenced to three years in prison, but was released with time served. . 

[00:16:57]


>> A new push by residentials in washington to take on immigration reform and showing new support for a plan to recruit highly skilled foreign workers, but this proposal has been defeated by democrats before. How will it bear this time. Martin frost, former democratic congressman from texas and a former deputy assistant to george bush, and good to see you on this holiday weekend. Thank you for joining us tonight. And congressman frost, let me start with you and explain why democrats were opposed to this, looking at something identical just this past september. 
>> Look, the only way you do immigration reform is on a comprehensive basis. I was in congress when we passed simpson in the 1980's and you don't do this piecemeal. You have to address the dream act and address what bringing the high income and highly educated people in and do you this all at once and I will tell you, having been in congress, there is no harder vote, no more contentious issue than this. And the immigration reform makes social security rem look like a walk in the park. So, you have to put this all into one package and that's the only way it's ever going to pass and the republicans can try to make a few points by peace mealing this, but they know also that a final analysis, a bipartisan package that covers the entire subject. 
>> Let me explain for people because the congressman didn't answer my question here, which is why democrats have been oppose today this, the stem job act and-- 
>> and the question, I'll just explain it for you because i know the reasoning here there's a feeling by a lot of democrats that this-- 
>> don't try and speak for me, I'll be happy to answer the question, it has nothing to do with other kinds of people that are left behind. It has everything to do with the only way you do immigration reform, as I said earlier, is on a comprehensive basis where you address all the issues not just one little piece of it. 
>> Rick: Understood and I'm not trying to speak for you, congressman frost, I have a lot of respect for you, I want the audience to understand why this particular bill was shot down democrats in the past and they felt it excluded immigrants from poorer nations where people might not have nd of income to get the skills in order for people to come over and brad, let me get the congressman's larger point. Why not go for something big instead of piecemeal. Republicans no secret, did not fare well with immigrant communities, why not more comprehensive. 

[00:19:35]


>> We've seen what happens with comprehensive bills by democrats, thousands and thousands of pages that nobody reads and public can't digest it. I don't see why it can't be done piecemeal. Right now we have a lottery system where we invite people in america who want to come to america. It should be a needs test. If america needs the kind of talent, high skilled talent, scientists, academics, we should be encouraging those people and insourcing talent that can help grow our job base. Again, I can't understand why democrats would be defense this particular legislation to invite people to km here to create jobs in america and democrats have been railing about outsourcing and this is a good bill that insources the kind of talent we need to get america back on prosperity and back on the road to recovery. 
>> Congressman frost? 
>> Just remember, brad, during the the campaign your nominee, governor romney, got to the right of newt gingrich and to the right of governor perry on immigration because he didn't want to consider reasonable approaches and the earned legalization and dealing with 12 million people who are here right now, putting those people on a path to citizenship, people who haven't violated, haven't committed a felly who have had jobs and family here, that's what you have to address first and then you can address the other little pieces, but you've got to do this in a one package, and there was a republican senator, senator simpson from wyoming, as you may recall, was the lead senator on this, when we passed comprehensive immigration reform, since the 1980's, and you can pass a complicated bill. You can't pass immigration piece by piece, it just doesn't happen. 
>> Rick: Go ahead, brad. 
>> I happen to think it's a good start the republicans understand there's a need and we have a problem. We right now have over 50,000 visas away when they want to come here and should give away 50,000 visas for people america need here. A difference between wanting to come here and america needing the kind of people that we're attracting. So, I agree that we need immigration reform. I don't believe it has to be singly a comprehensive bill. I think it can be chopped up and I agree with martin that certainly there are other issues on immigration th important, but nothing more important than stopping and correcting a system that hasn't worked well. 

[00:22:06]


>> Rick: Congressman, what do you predict the second term. The president on the record saying he thinks something can get done, what do you think? 
>> I think he will propose a system close to what newt gingrich proposed, earning legalization, which the republicans rejected years ago, that's a starting point. You don't let everybody stay here that are here with an illegal status. Take the hard working people who have jobs and families and haven't committed any other violation of the law and you figure out how to deal with these people and provides a very strong labor force for the united states. You wouldn't have construction jobs in my home state of texas or where I live now in virginia if you didn't have a lot of hispanics who have come to this country who want to work hard. All they want to do is be able to earn a living for their families and you've got to deal with this group of people and then you can deal with the people, the highly educated people and I'm for that and i supported that in congress and supported the proposal to give a green card to every graduate student. Foreign graduate opportunity that graduates from an american college or university with a degree in engineering, start with some. You can do that, clearly we can do that. You can't do it, you can't do it-- you can't do it a little piece at a time because members of congress and both parties hate voting on immigration and only vote once. You have to give a comprehensive bill. 
>> Our economy right now needs skilled workers, about people who want to come here and we should fix the system that's broken and not only that family friendly and keeps families together and some families have one member of the family come here on a green card and they have to wait several years before they're reunited and this bill corrects that. 
>> They can't work once they get here, but they can come and be with their families. 
>> Gentlemen, thank you so much, good see you both. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Pope benedict xvi, elevating six new cardinals today. You may remember he elevated cardinals last february, but the new group is made up entirely of non-europeans including one american. And today's choice will help choose his successor. 

[00:24:25]


>> And with the crowning of the six new cardinals, appropriate benedict is it putting his seal on the papacy and decades to follow. Appointing well over half the men who will vote for his successor. While all are fairly young, the cardinals stand out for what they're not. They're neither european or italian. And the cardinals hales from philippines, one from the united states, annal elevation of lebanon signals how important the region is to the catholic church for its need to help stabilize for the future. 
>> He's emphasizing the importance in the middle east and he's putting someone in there who really, I think, is a peace maker and is willing to dialog with all the different parties. I think that's very important. 
>> And all of this has been in relatively good health. 85 years old and slowing down and aware of his mortality, and benedict is eager to keep the college of cardinals at 120. The number needed to vote for the next pope, which may likely be someone that he has chosen. 
>> Benedict has put a stamp not only on the college of cardinals, but on the bishops that he's been appointing around the world. And that is part of his legacy and it will be interesting to see how all of that plays out. 
>> Now, there is a bit of controversy about the lone american in the group of cardinals, archbishop james michael harvey and papal council. The direct superior of the pope's former butler accused of stealing the pope's private papers. And some are seeing a lateral move away from the inner circle. 
>> Lauren green, thank you very much fwor the report. 
>> Rick: Coming up, picking up the pieces in israel and gaza, how life there is getting on after a cease-fire that ended eight days of virtually nonstop violence. 

[00:26:28]


>> And a new report that consumer confidence is on an upward swing amid black friday madness. Why doesn't the nation's unemployment number reflect the same progress? now. Try this... Bayer? This isn't just a headache. TRUST ME, THIS IS NEW Bayer Migraine.

>> and thanks for spending part of your holiday weekend with us. This is the bottom of the hour and here are the head lines. He was an actor playing the oil man we loved to hate and larry hagman played jr ewing for many, many years died at age 81. 
>> Arthel: The body of former palestinian leader yasser arafat will be exhumed to determine whether he was poisoned when he died in 2004. The detection of radioactive substance on his clothes is reopening the investigation. 
>> Rick: And former boxing champ hector matcho commacho was unconscious and after being shot, his mother decide today take him off live support. 
>> Arthel: People in the badly battered city of gaza trying to get back to normal even as many in israel say their government gave in too soon. Connor powell has more from our jerusalem bureau. 
>> Three days into the cease-fire, arthel, and it continues to hold is extremely fragile, but encouraging indications that life are returning to normal. Israeli children returned to school yesterday and markets are reopening now that the threat of rockets have ended and today, palestinian in gaza have also returned to school as the cleanup begins. No doubt there are still challenges, but so far, both sides seem willing to continue the cease-fire and part of the agreement calls for an easing of the blockade around gaza. It's not exactly clear what that means, but we've seen some evidence that the palestinian fishermen in gaza are now allowed to fish off the coast, something they were not able to do previously when the restrictions were in place. And gone are the massive amounts of israeli troops from the border, instead it's now just small groups of hamas and israeli soldiers patrolling the border. No doubt the cease-fire will continue to be tested in the coming days, weeks and months ahead and those in israel and hamas are sending envoys to egypt to build on the small amount of progress that is already being achieved. Arthel. Connor powell, thanks.

>> New allegations of political correctness gone wild in the obama administration, a new report showing the department of homeland security avoiding using the term terrorists, and that has some lawmakers very concerned. Peter doocy is reporting in washington. 
>> Reporter: The department of justice has not even identified what topic should be covered in their countering violent extremism or cve training, despite the fact that according to a report by the government accountability office from 1989 to 2011, 210 violent islamic extremists are northern to radicalize in america and 80% began after 9-11 and the face of terror is changing and republican susan collins, says the identification of the 2009 shooting at fort hood texas as workplace violence is one reason that law enforcement agents nationwide are not properly learning who they should be on the lookout for. To counter this threat to better understand its roots and how it may develop among certain people in our own country, we have to be willing to name the threat to understand it in order to counter it. 
>> The gao report says plainly that misinformation about the threat and dynamics of radicalization for violence can harm security by sending local stake holders in the wrong direction and unnecessarily creating tensions with potential community partners. But, there is a bright spot and the gao report, the holm secured department is noted as effectively identifying and communicating to their partners, the elements that their training on countering violence extremism programs should cover. Rick? 
>> Peter doocy in washington, thanks so much. 
>> Well, the holiday shopping season is in full swing this small business saturday. New reports suggest more americans feel the economy is improving now than anytime during the the last decade. This despite high unemployment, gallop polling shows christmas spending is surging after a three-year slump so is there another factor at play here or is this simply a disconnect between perception and reality? Bringing in now ed butowsky, from chapwood industries. You're looking at unemployment rate at 7.9%, a bonanza black friday, a great gray thursday, and spokes are spending money, what gives? 

[00:35:53]


>> I'm not sure what gives. The survey-- I'm happy to hear people are more positive and I want the economy to recover. The question really is, what has changed since the election? Because we still have very high unemployment and you know, today, it was announced that 80 new regulations were put in place by the obama administration and when these people hear new regulations what that means is a slowdown. Every time you hear regulations that means you have to hire lawyers and consultants and the question, what is making this economy better and quite frankly, arthel, I think it has to do with the idea there hasn't been a major negative jolt to the economy and that's why people are feeling better. 
>> Arthel: And in the survey you're talking about analysis for bloomberg associated the associated press and consumer according to that analysis, hey, we're optimistic the economy is going to improve in the next 12 months, but you say, ed, that the folks who get it are concerned about the future of this gountry. So, what are those guys on the other side, who are wearing the rose colored glasses, what is it that they're missing? 
>> Well, what they're missing is reality. I mean, the reality is that prices are rising across the board, their wages are down, and you have a lot of regulation coming in and again, as I say that, that means a slowdown in business, there's not a lot of positive things and then attach on top of that, obamacare which people don't know how it's going to impact them. So businesses are going to slow down, they're either going to be paralyzed or just slowdown and they're going to stop hiring so you're going to start to see less money into the economy, so be happy for now, but what those people are missing is the reality that business is not-- the climate is not good and people out there every single day and small business day, every one of those people are not looking to prosper, they're looking to hold on right now. That's not a good environment when a small business person's goal is to survive and not, the goal isn't to prosper. That's a problem, arthel. 
>> In the meantime, ed, you thought the gallop polling saying spending $770 this christmas season and pretty much close to where it was last year, 764. So, maybe it's combining optimism that things are going to get better with the sentiment that, you know what? I'm going to treat myself. I'm going to splurge now and tighten the belt come the top of the year. 

[00:38:09]


>> I hope anybody who is buying me a gift doesn't hold back this year, but arthel, I've got tell you, we're going to have to watch it carefully and it's typical because people have watched me for a number of months, know how i feel about the way the economy's being handled. I'm not happy with it and nothing has changed. Let's just hope and pray that things get better and let's hope that the fiscal cliff, we get that resolved and hope that prices start to, don't keep going up like they are. Let's hope that the tax situation doesn't get out of control and hope all of the negative things that could happen don't happen, but if they do happen, you're right, arthel, get ready because january and february are going to be rough months out there. 
>> Arthel: Well, we hope it doesn't come to that. We want everyone to have a, you know, good income and et cetera. And by the way, as someone told me you have pretty deep pockets if you want to buy me a christmas gift, no problem. 
(Laughter) 
>> I already did. That's what I've done all weekend.

>> as thousands of egyptians take to the streets, the nationwide protest growing concerns among the u.S. And the rest of the international community after president mohammed morsi grants himself exspansive powers and sparking instability in the region. And how should the the u.S. React. A professor of law and political science at university of southern california good to see you, susan, as always. 

[00:44:06]


>> Good to see you. 
>> Give me, first of all, susan, your take on morsi's power grab, does it surprise you and should the u.S. Be leery or perhaps more so some would say? 
>> You know, it's very disappointing, I guess it's not that surprising. The rule of law is a pretty tricky business and it's not as if egypt had the rule of law before, but I guess the only thing that doesn't disappoint me that in fact dare I say pleases me is to see egyptians, prosecutors, judges, strange bed fellows, coming together and standing up and recognizing that you can't have democracy without the rule of law. 
>> Arthel: Yeah, the supreme judicial council saying this is not good. Let me ask you this, some are saying this, did the-- tell me what you think, did the u.S. Give morsi too much praise publicly? 
>> Well, you know, I think it was a great deal of hope. Morsi stood up, he was willing to get engaged in the process and trying to negotiate a cease-fire, we obviously need to deal with the elected leaders in countries, even if we would not necessarily have supported that result. And so, I think, I understand and can appreciate why the u.S. Praised him. I think at the same time you've heard the u.S. And u.N. Spokes people denouncing this power grab and making clear the point that you and I both realized which is the rule of law is essential to a democratic society and it's essential in the long run to economic growth and improved standard of living. But, at the end of the day, this really is up to the egyptian people. They're the ones who are going to have to stand up and show the courage and show the determination to send the message to this man, that they won't have it. 
>> Arthel: Up to the egyptian people, but egypt gets a lot of aid from the u.S. So what should the u.S. Do now? Does the u.S. Put more pressure on morsi to make sure that he does what he needs to do to maintain the peace treaty between israel and hamas? What do they do? 

[00:46:13]


>> Well, obviously, I think right now we're putting pressure on. At the end of the day, human rights has to be a basic principle in our foreign policy, and it has to be a basic principle in foreign aid because you and I both know the fact that a leader is willing to cooperate with the west, to, to try to diffuse the situation in the middle east, is also going to be a policy and so, the u.S. Is stuck with the balancing act in which the most important thing is may do in the long run is give rhetorical support, at least, and information and communications to the people in egypt so they know what's going on and they're in a position in this modern day to express their rights. I mean, they fought a revolution against a despotic government and it would be a sad thing for them to having done that, and having had a democratic election, and end up in the same boat. 
>> Yes, and so let's talk about morsi and the muslim brotherhood. Where does this put them on the world stage, politically speaking? 
>> Well, I think there's going to be pressure from all sides. Look, I think you're going to have pressure from within, pressure from without, inge a lot of pressure, not to use too many times, on the muslim brotherhood, to prove that it's something other than an outside insurgency group, to prove that it can indeed exercise power, in a responsible way and the irony is, morsi, in a way having done that, having acted as an international leader has now grabbed defeat from the sauce of victory in the international community by accompanying that with a power grab. 
>> Complicated, interesting pieces and so it's what, about an hour and ten minutes from now, are you going to watch the usc-notre dame game, just asking. 
>> I'm going to keep my fingers crossed. My kids are in town and it hasn't been a great year for usc, but we continue to fight on. 
>> Arthel: Fight on. All right, go trojans, all right, susan. 

[00:48:15]

(Laughter) 
>> all right. And finally, carol, tell us, we have literally 20 seconds. 
>> And that's the v tech, the v tech the second generation kids tablet and the both are great, I think for kids and seem to enjoy them and like playing the games on them and the camera edition is a wonderful edition and this camera actually rotates and in front and pictures of yourself.

=======================================================

>>> Welcome, everyone, to this anderson cooper special, bullying, it stops here. Here is new jersey's rutgers university. We've come here, all of us, drawn together by the power of absence. The absence of kids, of young adults, of future parents and friends, healers and leaders. None of whom will ever be. All of whom have left us because as young adults or as children, they were bullied beyond their capacity to endure. They are the reason we are here. We owe them and we owe them more than talk. In the years since a wave of bullying suicides struck the country and got worldwide attention, there's been too much talk and not enough action. A year ago, rutgers freshman tyler clementi, that young man right there, his life was thrown on to the internet. It was more than he could bear. He went to the george washington bridge and took his own life. Almost a year to the day from tyler's suicide, jamie rodimeyer lost his battle with bullies. Took part in a campaign online and hoped it would get better. Some night he outlived that hope. The bullying outlived him. His sister and friends were taunted the night of his wake at school. We have come to know jamie and tyler this past year just as we came to know so many children. These are the faces of other students, other students who have taken their own lives after being bullied. The bullying happens every day in school and online, sometimes we don't know about it. Sometimes we just hear stories about it and sometimes it is even caught on tape. Watch. 
>> Get off my book bag. 
>> Okay. 
>> Move! Move! 
>> What? Why you punching me? No. No. No. Why you stabbing me witht? 

[00:02:10]


>> I'll knock your face off. 
>> You heard the other kids say give it to him hard. That's a boy named alex. Some of the abuse he endured every single day. It's from a remarkable documentary called "the bully project." We will show you more of it tonight on the program. Our question tonight, the reason we are gathered here, is to make sure that alex's story and all the other kids' stories of bullying don't become a never-ending story handed down through generations of bullies and victims and hurt and loss. Tonight, we want to say and say out loud the bullying stops here. We want solutions and tonight, we hope to begin to find them. DR. phil McGraw is with us. So is bullying expert roselyn wiseman. You will meet so many brave students tonight as well, parents, members of the rutgers community. My friend kelly ripa is here as well. She's got three kids and like any mom, worries and jane lynch, who is raising a young daughter with her wife, will also join us tonight. It's been a year since tyler's death and the issue came to a lot of the country's attention then. I WANT TO BRING IN phil McGraw and rosalyn wiseman. Phil, what kind of grade would you give in terms of progress that's been made this year on the issue? 
>> Well, I would give a real high grade as far as intention to both legislators and administrators and teachers. Teachers are heroes. Come on, these are people that work for very little money, they are very dedicated, but I would give us a very low grade for execution. I would give us a low grade for what we've accomplished and I'll tell you, it's because we're going at this from the wrong point of view. We're dealing with this with bullies as criminals and then their victims, and we can't see them in that way. There's got to be intervention with both. It's not just -- they both need help, they both need social skills training, they both need things that they can only get if we put it into the curriculum. It can't get in the curriculum if we don't put money behind it and we don't make it just as much a part of the students' day as we do history, math and science. 

[00:04:18]


>> What kind of grade would you give to educators, to schools? 
>> I would give to legislators and educators about a c-minus for many of the reasons dr. Phil spoke of. Because it's so punitive. Because it doesn't understand the complexities of the issue. We have good people who are intending to do well who are reacting to anxiety and are not thinking through how this impacts a school. But what I do give -- who I do give an "a" to are the kids and young people who are making videos and songs and music videos, all these different kinds of things they're trying to express that's really authentic to their life experience and they're sharing it with other people. 
>> I don't give the kids an "a." 
>> Why not? You're disagree with me? 
>> I give the kids that, do what you're saying, get on youtube, those reaching out for their own experience. What I don't give an "a" to are the kids on the bus that sat there and watched that happen and they're just as guilty as the kid that was doing it. 
>> One of the amazing things, we conducted a study and will show you the results throughout the hour. More than 75% of the cases i think it was, kids don't intervene. Nobody intervenes. We're going to look at the importance of intervention, how that really can make a difference. When I first started to try to understand the bullying issue, i saw it very simple. There were bullies and victims but after really researching this and talking with dr. Phil and other experts, what i realize now is that it is far more complex. We decided to team up with sociologists who are doing really ground-breaking research on bullying. We launch an in-depth investigation at a top ranked high school, the wheatley school, on new york's long island. We wanted to really look at how this problem plays out in one school and what's really interesting is that in doing this study, the sociologist believes we have uncovered larger truths about schools and about bullying nationwide. Take a look. 
>> They call me gay. 
>> I would get comments like you're fat, you're disgusting. 
>> Like a lot of schools in america, the wheatley school has a bullying problem. 

[00:06:19]


>> They physically abused me, mentally abused me, emotionally abused me, and I admit, I had thoughts of suicide in ninth grade. 
>> More than 700 students at wheatley were asked very specific questions about aggression in their school. Like did a student at your school pick on you or do something mean to you. Did you pick on or do something mean to another student at your school. The results were eye-opening. A key finding, bullies, what researchers called aggressors, are often also victims. 
>> Do you think somebody is an aggressor and somebody is a victim or do you think it crosses over? 
>> Everyone is a bully and everyone's a victim. 
>> Everyone's a bully? 
>> Like you bullies, I bullied. Whether you know it or not, you bullied someone. 
>> The study also shows why kids bully. Sociologist robert farris calls it social combat, using aggressive behavior to climb the social ladder. 
>> It's a race to the top. By getting to the top, you view yourself as one of the important people of your school. That's the reason why bullying occurs. 
>> The study found the higher they get, the more aggressive and victimized they become. 56% of wheatley students surveyed said they were involved in either aggression, victimization or both. And over 80% of incidents were never reported to adults. 
>> Joining us now are two teens from wheatley you just heard from, bridget was rated by the research as being in the top 5% of victims and also interestingly in the top 20% of aggressors. Kind of surprised to hear that. Josh, a senior, who is rated as the top 5% of victims and also the top 5% of aggressors. We are also joined by the study's author, robert farris and kelly ripa is in the audience with us, a mom of three. Bridget, you say that everybody is a bully at one time or another and everybody is a victim. What do you mean? 

[00:08:23]


>> Well, either -- there's the obvious bully who picks on someone else and is like what that video showed, there can be a physical bully, there can be an emotional bully that attacks whether behind the computer or it's just you two, it doesn't have to be like I'm going to punch you in the face and stuff like that but threatening is bullying or you can bully yourself. It's not going to go away. It stays with you. 
>> It's interesting, to me this study you did was really eye-opening and we picked wheatley because it's an excellent school that really does take this problem seriously but the results are very similar to schools around the country that you also studied. The idea of social combat I find fascinating. Explain that a little bit more. 
>> Well, one of the things i think we found at both wheatley and other schools I studied was that there's really kind of two types of patterns going on. One is where maybe a vulnerable kid who's a little bit different in some way who is kind of violated the unwritten codes of social life in a school is getting piled on and picked on relentlessly in sort of a chronic fashion. But then there's this whole other sort of hidden, actually more common form of aggression where kids are using it a little more tactically to climb the social hierarchies and that's much more prevalent in all the schools we've seen. It seems to peak in the middle to upper ranges of the status hierarchy. 
>> Josh, this rings true to you. You had two friends who turned on you to try to advance themselves. What happened? 
>> As their life went on, they felt like oh, we can make new friends, be cooler, go to parties every friday, saturday nigh but this kid oh, he's a nerd, we got to hold him back. Out of nowhere, like one day you're close buddies hanging out. The second day they're treating you like trash. 
>> Do you think you are both a victim and aggressor? Because you scored about the same on both. 
>> I can definitely see the victim part. I went through a lot with that. But the aggressive part, I don't really see because I'm not all that -- I'm pretty quiet in school. 
>> A lot of kids didn't actually see themselves as aggressors. 
>> Yeah. They may not realize they have done something that was interpreted as mean to a peer. So kids may not always be aware of it. That's certainly the case. 

[00:10:25]


>> Kelly, you've got three kids. Does the idea of social combat, to me that was an eye-opening phrase. 
>> I think it makes a lot of sense because nobody wants to be the kid that is suddenly turned on, I think, you know. If you are sort of swept up in the group and you see a good friend who is at the top of the social food chain, say, and suddenly the tables have turned and suddenly this sort of popular kid has become the victim in an attempt to take over the social hierarchy, i don't think there's going to be a lot of interference because nobody wants to be the person that is suddenly turned on. 
>> Does that idea ring truth to both of you? 
>> That's what I've been writing about and teaching about for 20 years. Teachers, administrators, parents, will look at this and say that's just the way this is. That's the way human beings are. The thing we have to consistently say to people is degrading people is never right. It always comes down to what you're being degraded by race, by socioeconomic status, by class, not having as much money, from where you come from, sexual orientation, it always comes down to that. 
>> The other thing is -- adults who say this has always been around, yeah, that's true, but online bullying, bullying is now, you talk about this on your program, is not just in schools anymore. It is 24 hours a day. 
>> The problem with this, you were talking so much about the impact of bullying after the fact, what happens is the victim takes over for the bully when the bully leaves. The bully leaves, but the victim repeats it in their head over and over and over, this internal dialogue where they repeat and even enhance and embellish what the bully said and therefore, embrace it from the inside out. 
>> You had an account and time and time again I hear kids talk about this, I know it's not as popular as it once was, but people can say things to you and people would say horrible things to you. You kept it just because -- why did you keep the account? 

[00:12:26]


>> Because they weren't all negative. I did get a few nice ones. 
>> That was enough to make you want to keep it? 
>> Well, no. I also liked to respond to the bad ones. I did respond, because if you were just like all right, I see what you're spending your time doing. 
>> Plus you want to take the temperature, see if they're still on you or not. You want to check to see there were 100 last night, 80 tonight, it's getting better. 
>> I could get seven in one hour, seven in a week. 
>> Also, didn't it feel like if you didn't respond it was weak? You couldn't let it pass? 
>> Sometimes they would write back and say oh, look at you, you know, not writing back. 
>> We got to take a quick break. Up next, more startling research from the study on bullying, including actually some good news on bullying. We will also talk to the principal wheatley. 
>>> Welcome back to "bullying: IT STOPS HERE."w? Before the break we were talking about results of a pioneering study. We discovered that high schools are a social battlefield with students rising for supremacy. To rise on the social ladder they use bullying to improve their position. More often than not, it just doesn't work to really improve your social standing long-term. The other key is that we're learning about the importance of kids intervening to help other kids. Dr. Phil talked about this earlier. In 77% of aggressive incidents, no bystanders intervened. 77%, and that has got to change. Joining the conversation is jacob, another wheatley student. He caught our eye because the study ranked him as one of the students who most often tries to stop bullying in his high school. Also with us is the principal of wheatley. First of all, principal, it is, I think, incredibly brave of you to allow us to do the study in your school and I want to stress that your school takes this problem very seriously and it's one of the top ranked schools in the country. Were you surprised by some of the results? 

[00:17:35]


>> I was surprised somewhat. I have worked in a number of different schools in a number of different social and cultural contexts overseas in the city and what I've found in my experience with kids is that kids are kids are kids. And unfortunately, these dynamics occur in all places. That's not to excuse it or tolerate it. But you can't be a high school principal and not acknowledge and recognize problems such as drugs, alcohol, sex and bullying. These are all issues, many of which are tied into the issue of self-esteem and sense of self which is something that's developing in high school kids. 
>> Bob, you talk about the power of bystanders to actually stop this. 
>> Bystanders form the majority of a school and they have -- they're the ones who allocate status. Collectively. They decide who's cool and who's not. They have this sort of power to step in and change the culture of the school and intervene in specific situations. 
>> And that's a hopeful thin because if you can get the norm being kids intervening, that can change the dynamic of bullying. 
>> Absolutely. But they have to have the faith and trust that their teachers and administrators will do right by them. And so what I want to applaud is you saying -- this is a problem that happens. The more information that I can get about this problem, like doing this evaluation, helps me do right by my kids. That's the kind of principal we have to have. 
>> Jacob, you're one of the top interveners in the school. Why do you think that is? What is it about bullying that you've seen that makes you want to intervene? 
>> Well, I believe that no one deserves to feel bad about themselves or have other people view bad of them, so if you have the opportunity to make someone feel better about themselves or prevent it from happening then i believe you should take it. 
>> Did you know that you were one of the top interveners? 
>> No, I didn't. 
>> You must have been incredibly relieved. You open up the study and you're like phew, I'm the intervenor. That's good. How do you, principal, how do you get kids -- more interveners? How do you build that number? 

[00:19:50]


>> The power of the intervener was very exciting to me because this study in the research clearly showed that if you are friends with someone who is an intervener you're more likely to intervene the next time. So this sense of cultural norms which I think you spoke of earlier, the renormalizing the culture, you can change. And the key is from students. 
>> And I was interested in your study to see that bullying doesn't actually work. As a strategy long term, to get to the top of the social hierarchy, it's nonsustainable and it doesn't really work? Is that correct? 
>> On average it doesn't. 
>> Sometimes it does? 
>> It works in the moment. It just doesn't work long term. Immediate gratification is there and that's the most powerful reward a kid can have is immediate gratification but it doesn't work long term, right? 
>> There are some exceptions to that. It depends on whom they're picking on. I don't want to get into details on how bullies can be successful, but there were exceptions to it, but by and large, that is the great irony, that it is not working, and actually, even sort of more surprising is it increases the anxiety and depression of the bullies themselves experience. It increases their anxiety levels and their depression levels and I think they end up hating themselves on some level. 
>> Why do you think it doesn't, by and large, does not work as a strategy for becoming top of the heap? 
>> If your goal is to climb to the top of the hierarchy, excel in something. There's a lot better ways that are respected and admired. Play the flute. 
>> That will do it. The old play the flute. Yeah. You were in the band, weren't you? 
>> There are a lot of better ways to do it. And I don't think kids are really fooled by the aggressive behavior. They're not overly impressed. 
>> They don't trust the bully so they stay away from them. 
>> Do you think that's true? 
>> Absolutely. The thing that is so amazing, you watch kids go through this process, they realize they are paranoid about constantly having to reaffirm their power positions so they're never sure who their friends are and if they really will back them up. If they back them up it's because they fear them so loyalty becomes that you're backing up somebody because they're doing something unethical, but loyalty is not speaking truth to power, and friendship is really speaking truth to power. 

[00:22:13]


>> Kids are getting caught up in the status games and what they should be doing is focusing on coming out of high school with a handful of really good friends. Having good friendships is really protective. It may not prevent any bullying from occurring but it helps kids heal. 
>> We got to take a break. An up-close look at one school system where seven kids have taken their own lives. We'll talk to students up ahead. 
>> They would call me "fag" and "gross" and tell me I'm going to hell and stuff and it makes you feel like you're the grossest person in the world. Of more-- more shopping, more dining out...

>>> When we first aired this town hall a year ago, controversy swirled around a school district in minnesota over their so-called neutrality policy when it came to discussing sexual orientation. The district faced two lawsuits and a federal investigation. Earlier this year, the school board voted to change the policy. The lawsui were settled with payment to the plaintiffs and with that settlement, the government agreed to drop their investigation. Here's that story. 
>> They would taunt me in the hallways and I felt like I could never escape it. I promise you it will get better. I have so much support from people I don't even know online. I know that sounds creepy but they're so nice and caring and they don't ever want me to die. 
>> They don't want me to die. Jamie lived in new york where an anti-bullying law was passed last year but laws differ from state to state and bullying policies differ from school to school sometimes in a district. In minnesota's largest school district, seven students have taken their own lives in less than two years. The school district is now facing a federal investigation and a lawsuit from two advocacy groups and several students. The allegation? Pervasive anti-gay harassment. The students suing say the district's policy of barring teachers from talking about homosexuality jeopardizes their safety at school. They want the policy changed. The school district in a heavily conservative area declined to speak to us, citing the ongoing litigation but did defend the policy to cnn in april. Watch. 
>> All the students come with parents in this community and rents have a wide range of beliefs. We serve them all. 
>> That's the superintendent of the school district. With us now, four students who were fighting back. Le, damian, brittany and dillon. And also with us is activist and actress jane lynch and also SUNNY HOSTIN FROM truTV. Kyle, you told me yesterday about an incident that happened to you in the bathroom and what happened? 
>> I had to use the bathroom and I walk in the door and these people were just watching me. They were just staring at me. I go into the stall and I hear laughing. I hear laughter. And I look up and I have something dripping down my head and someone was peeing on me. 

[00:29:10]


>> How often do you get bullied, do you get pushed around? 
>> Almost every day. 
>> Damian, how about you? You are straight, but your two dads are gay, and you're on a gymnastics team which people make fun of you for, and what do people say to you? 
>> Gay, faggot, gay boy. 
>> Brittany? What do people call you? 
>> They call me [ bleep ]. And even words I'm ashamed to say even to this day. 
>> If you go to a counselor in your school, brittany, what do they tell you? What do they say to you? 
>> They tell me not to use that language. That's not appropriate. And -- 
>> but you're not the one using that language. 
>> Yeah. I explained to them what they would say and how they said it use that language or just forget it, ignore him or walk away like it didn't bother you because if you act like it doesn't bother you it will stop, but it never did. 
>> Dylan, you have been recently taken out of school and now you are home schooled. Did you not feel safe in school? 
>> Kids made me feel like I was the grossest person in the world and th walls and say, here comes the he/she. Or here comes the trash. And they made me feel gross and I didn't feel safe at school so I just left. 
>> Damian, if -- I know you had an incident where someone called you the "n" word. Did teachers do something about that? 
>> Y they were more -- they would take care of it faster than they would have if someone called me gay or faggot. 
>> So if someone uses a racial slur, teachers respond, you're saying. 
>> Yeah, right away. 
>> But if someone calls you the "f" word, what happened? 
>> They would shrug it off and tell me not to use that word like britney said. 
>> Anderson, can I jump in? 
>> Yes. 

[00:31:12]


>> I have to tell you, as a parent, I'm sitting here and I'm stewing with rage. I just feel so angry and so upset for the four of you and your class experience and it seems to me that this is all backwards. Instead of taking it up with the kids who are tormenting daily and using abusive language and being abusive to the students, this young man can't even go to school anymore. He shouldn't be the one having to stay home. The bullies and the aggressors should be made to stay home or expelled from school. I just want you to know that people do care about you. I care about you. I really feel touched for your experience. Really. 
>> Jane, you and your wife are raising a daughter. When you hear these kids what goes through your mind? 
>> You know, these kids do need to know that they are loved and that it's really, really sad that they don't have an advocate and I think this neutrality policy is abdicating their responsibility, the adults' responsibility of protecting these kids and it's really very sad. 
>> Sunny, the school district is facing a federal investigation and a lawsuit. What could happen? Is this criminal? 
>> Certainly. A lot of this behavior is protected by federal law. These are civil rights' violations and I think that's what the problem is here. These children aren't allowed to be their authentic selves, and our laws have to protect that. Don't we want our children to grow and be their authentic selves. Not try to be someone that they are not. And act in this sort of shame-based way. I think the law should be here to protect the most vulnerable in our society. 
>> The idea of a neutral policy, a policy where you do not use specific words, does that work as an anti-bullying policy? 
>> No, that plays right into the bully's hand, because it stops well-meaning people from speaking out, and makes these children feel like they have no recourse. I want to go back to whathe superintendent said, we have a variety of beliefs, and we need to address all of the beliefs. The single belief that a superintendent of a school should be focused on is the health and dignity of the children. That is it. 

[00:33:25]


[ Applause ] 
>> do you think it would make a difference if you could talk to teachers and talk to counselors? Do you think it would make a difference in your lives? 
>> Yeah, I do. 
>> How so? 
>> I think if people understood what we were going through that maybe, just maybe they'd understand and if they would just listen to us speak and actually, meet us before they jump to conclusions, maybe this wouldn't happen. You know, I have prayed every day that I didn't have to go back to school. And I go -- 
>> you pray every day you don't have to go back? 
>> Yeah. I would hide under the seats of the bus and -- 
>> you would hide under the seats? 
>> I would. 
>> I understand that at one point, how many kids did you know who were bullying you? 40. 40 kids? 
>> Yes. 
>> You can identify 40 kids? 
>> Yeah. 
>> I want to thank you kids for your courage and strength. I think yore so impressive and so brave and I think you have tremendous courage. Thank you. I appreciate it. 
[ Applause ] 
>>> coming up, we'll show you what happened to this little boy, alex, after the bullying that happened to him was caught on camera. Before we go, I met kyle yesterday and all the kids yesterday and kyle loves lady gaga. 
>> She's amazing. 
>> But yesterday when i interviewed kyle and I was talking to him and I said is there anything else you'd like to say, and he said he would like to sing a song and he said that today when he sat down and he said, can I sing? So kyle is going to sing his favorite song. 
>> Great. ?????? Hold your head up and you'll go far ?????? ?????? listen to me when I say ?????? ?????? how beautiful you are because god makes no mistakes ?????? ?????? on the right track, baby I was born this way ?????? ?????? don't feel regret just love yourself ?????? ?????? and you'll stay on the right track ?????? ?????? baby, I was born this way ???????????? 

[00:35:44]


[ cheers and applause ] 
>>> the so-called neutrality 
>>> the so-called neutrality policy has since been changed and the new policy reads in part that the staff shall affirm the dignity and self-worth of all students regardless of sexual orientation. The settlement also required the district hire staff to improve the climate for lgbt students and more closely monitor and report bullying. The government dropped their investigation but the departments of justice and education will monitor the district for five years. One last update. Two out of the four students you just met have since left the school system, including kyle, who, yes, is still singing.Kr the china, hand-carved on the side of a cliff is the guoliang tunnel. What?! You've got to be kidding me. 

[00:38:59]


[ Derek ] I'VE NEVER SEEN A ROAD LIKE THIS. There's jagged rock all the way around. This is really gonna test the ats on all levels. 
[ Derek ] THIS ROAD IS THE MOST UNEVEN SURFACE, And it gets very narrow. Magnetic ride control is going to be working hard. The shock absorbers react to the road 1,000 times a second. It keeps you firmly in control. Whoa! 
[ Male Announcer ] THE ALL-NEW CADILLAC ATS. Cccccc 
>>> welcome back to this special 
report "bullying: It stops here." From the campus of rutgers university. So much bullying today occurs online as we talked about as well as in school. It's rare that it's actually caught on camera. There's an extraordinary documentary called "the bully project" which has been shown to the e department of education. Parents featured in it have met with the president and first lady. It gives you a look at some of the horrors that some kids face. In is what 13-year-old alex faced on a school bus in sioux city, iowa. 

[00:41:19]


>> Get your ass off my book bag. I'll beat your ass. 
>> Come on, . 
>> No, no, ouch! Why you punching me? Why are you stabbing me with that? 
>> I'm going to knock your face off. 
>> Give it to him hard! 
>> Joining me now is the filmmaker and kelly ripa, jane LYNCH, DR. phil McGraw and rosalind wiseman. The film is really extraordinary. I know kelly and I watched it last night and we have all seen it, but I know you spent a year in this school. Did it surprise you what you saw and were able to actually capture? 
>> It didn't surprise me and it was sort of, I think, the goal of making the film was to get out there and to show what kids go through. To show what kyle goes through. To give it something really real so that we can stop denying it so that we could stop sort of saying this is just a rite of passage. It didn't surprise me. And I think -- the scary part is it didn't surprise a lot of people. 
>> You were so concerned about alex, the little boy on the bus, you actually showed the footage to his mom? I want to show another clip from the film. 
>> At some point you've gotten used to this and I'm not. I'm not used to it. I didn't know and I'm not about to get used to it. Does it make you feel good when they punch you or kick you? Or stab you? Do these things make you feel good? 
>> No. 
>> Well, I don't know. I'm starting to think I don't feel anything anymore. 

[00:43:21]


>> You watched this last night with your kids. 
>> That was the moment that i think scared me the most when he said, I don't feel anything anymore. And you see a boy who has been failed on every level. My children were afraid of his experience on the bus, and they watched it, and it terrified them. It is very far away from what their experience has been at school, and when he said, i don't feel anything anymore, well, kids will go to great lengths to feel something and i feel like somebody needs to intervene on his behalf in the right way. 
>> Well, that is what bothers me about this. Look, these bullies have parents and where are the parents? If your child is a bully, it is your job to know that your child is a bully. It's your job to know that. It's your job to intervene at that level as a parent. It is your job to talk to the school. 
>> I have talked to a lot of the schools who have tried to intervene with the parents of bullies and the parents don't recognize it as a problem. 
>> That's what I'm saying. They don't see it because a lot of times it's modeled in the home. There's aggressive behavior in the home either verbally or physically and that becomes the norm. These kids are not born this way, anderson, they learn this. It is a social skill deficit that they learn, and their parents need to know that and intervene. 
>> The place where we stop it is the public forum of the school. Because we can't control these homes. But we can control what happens to kids at school. And we can have -- we can push for more empathy and more understanding. That's where we have a chance to make an impact. 
>> What bothers me is I don't think you can put a fence around the school. I hear administrators say it happened off campus, it wasn't actually on school. It was in a chat room, it was this, it was that. You have to take down the fences and boundaries. We are responsible adults, and if we know this is going on, we need to caucus and talk to the parents and have a discussion about this. And not to come in and put the bully under the jail. You're not going to punish this out of the bully. That young man that was doing that on the bus, that bully, to me, that is a tormented child. The bully. There's something going on. 

[00:45:36]


>> But when he went home that night for dinner and his mom said how was your day, what did you do today, he didn't say you know what I did, I tormented this little boy alex and i punched him and I strangled him and I told him I was going to stab him. 
>> He said it was fine. 
>> Fine. 
>> Jane, do you agree with -- that the school is the place to address it? At least it's the most obvious place to or not that it's easy but the easiest place to address it? 
>> I think changing the hearts and minds of people is almost a fruitless enterprise. I think you have to institute it in the schools. And there has to be real -- there has to be real consequences for the kids who bully. These kids are not shot out of a vacuum. They come from a home that instills certain values and certain behaviors and there's really nothing we can do about it but at our schools and at the legislative level we can do something about protecting these kids. 
>> If I can comment on what you're saying and jane, you were saying that it does have to happen at the school, but here's the point. If that's going to happen, then we have to teach the teachers what to do. These teachers don't know what to do. They haven't -- nobody has sat down and given them courses and life skills and intervention with these kids and teaching empathy. We can't ask them to do it if we don't teach them what to do and we don't fund it so it can become part of the curriculum. 
>> I think that's an excellent point. We do need to help with professional development. Not just teachers but administrators, cafeteria folks, bus drivers, all the support personnel. You hear this when administrators, teachers watch our film they'll say, like, i don't have the tools. 
>> We've got to take a break. We'll be right back with the panel. 

[00:51:24]


> Welcome back. We're back on our panel. 
>> You captured a moment for me in the film that will stay with me forever and it sort of crystallizedverything perfectly. The two boys coming in from recess and the principal is there to greet them. One is distraught and one is chasing him and she slows them down and says what's going on. 
>> Let's actually show this. 
>> He's offering his hand and let this drop. You may go. Cole, I expected more. 
>> He does this every single day. 
>> Then why are you around him? 
>> I don't. He comes to me. I try to get away from him. He follows me and he follows me and he calls me a [ bleep ]. 
>> Honey, that is not right and he should not do that. You know what, he was trying to say he was sorry. 
>> He already did and he didn't mean it. It continued on. 
>> You didn't mean it when you stuck your hand out, either. So that means you're just like him. 
>> Incredible. 
>> I was screaming at the screen. I was screaming at the screen. 
>> You see this all the time? You work in schools. 
>> I do. I work in schools and I see it and what is so infuriating is that we often say to kids, they should trust us. They should believe in adults. And when they have adults in their life who have failed them in this way or fail the way the kids have been failed, why should children believe that we can do differently? Why should they take this enormous leap of faith? And reveal this vulnerability? And all of this fear? There's two things that I talk to teachers all the time about. One is that they are at the bridge. That if they're good teachers and they are in math or french or spanish, the kids will talk to them. The second thing teachers need to do regardless of what they teach is if kids use the word fag or retarded or any of that stuff, they say to the kid who said it, mark, or whatever your name is, if you say that word and you are saying this word to put somebody down, it is not acceptable in my classroom. Are we good? We're good. It takes ten seconds and it sends a message to every single kid in that classroom what the teacher really stands for. 

[00:53:38]


>> But they don't say it in front of the teachers as often as they say it away from the teachers and that involves the parents. Everybody keeps saying the parents just know what the kids tell them. If you're a parent, it's your job to observe your child and know what they're doing. Show up when they don't know you're going to be there. Observe them when they don't think they're being observed. Find out how they treat other people. I've had parents on the show that said my 5-year-old would never be aggressive with anybody else and I put him behind the mirror and let them watch and the kid is stabbing another kid with a barbie doll like psycho, 
>> one of the things I'm hopeful for with our film and the conversation, conversations that we're having, is that parents will feel more empowered to have those conversations. Not just if they're afraid their kids a bully but if their child is being bullied. 
>> It's more than conversation. They need to see what you saw. 
>> Hopefully the empathy to have the third conversation, to have the fourth conversation. The sixth conversation. For fathers and sons, you know, it maybe is great advice to say go on, get that bully and it will stop. But when it doesn't, and it's the second and the third and the fourth conversation, you know, how are you going to be able to talk to your son? 
>> I want to bring in stu snyder from the cartoon network. Cnn has teamed up with the cartoon network, time inc. To create a facebook app. Explain what the app is. 
>> It's a great platform where young adults, kids and adults can get together, take a pledge to speak up, to stop bullying and also create a community where everyone can share resources so that we all can make a difference. To date, 40,000 people have taken the pledge to speak up against bullying and I'm really requesting that if anyone hasn't taken that pledge, to please do so and hopefully by taking the pledge, we all are able to speak up and stop bullying. 

[00:55:41]


>> Thanks very much. If you or anyone younow is having trouble thinking about suicide, having thoughts like that, we have resources to help on the ac360.Com page. I want to thank everyone here, especially the kids who are here today, who have had the bravery to speak out about what they are facing every single day. This is not just a problem for the kids who are here and for their parents. This is a problem for all of us, that all of us have to solve together. So much is at stake. Let's not let our kids down. Bullying, it can stop here. Thanks for watching.

=======================================================

Animal emergencies and is suitable for family viewing. Coming next, a moose loses its way in near-blizzard conditions. Can this large animal be saved? And birds caught in an oil slick. This is "animal rescue." 
[Captioning made possible by telco productions, inc.] thanks for joining us, I'm alex paen. Be prepared to witness extraordinary efforts of dedicated individuals helping animals in trouble. Let's begin our show with this amazing animal rescue true story. 
>> This unfortunate moose was spotted by passers by, stuck for hours at an incredible distance from the shoreline. 
>> At the first initial onset, when officers accessed the situation, they weren't exactly sure about ice conditions and things like that. At first it was believed that the only option was possibly dispatching the moose. Once things lightened up, and around 8:30, we had a chance to reassess the situation. They were able to see that there was a chance of getting out to the moose and trying to help. 
>> You guys walk up...[Indistinct]. We'll hook up another line to that so we're not running you out. 
>> Ok. 
>> Several emergency teams were called to the scene. And it was decided that two rescue swimmers in full cold-weather water gear would approach the moose in an attempt to coax the animal back to safety. Snow had begun to fall, and the temperature dropped well below freezing, making conditions for this brave effort even more difficult. This definitely was an unusual case for the rescue units. But given the poor weather, you have to wonder why such an attempt would even be considered. But these compassionate individuals said they wanted to do all they could to help this wild animal stuck in such a hapless state. As they prepare to march out to the animal, safety precautions are near completion. A strong rope is brought out with the intention of pulling the animal to the shore, if they can get it around the moose safely. Slowly nearing the seemingly tranquil animal, the two rescuers really don't know how e moose will react. Remember, this is a wild animal in distress, albeit one that can't stand up right now. Or can it? The presence of the rescuers appear to have given the animal a new impetus to get up. But unfortunately, the ice is too slippery. 

[00:03:32]


>> Aw! 
>> He's trying. 
[Indistinct chatter] 
>> I don't think he's even in the ice. I think he's just on the ice and can't stand up. 
>> If they can just get that harness around him. 
>> But they won't be able to reel it up at this point. 
>> Oh, ok. Do you want us to keep it from getting tangled, or do you guys got all that-- 
>> yeah, we got both sides. It'll be fine. 
>> The exhausted moose appears to cooperate with the rescuers as they try to place a harness around the animal so they can use a rope to pull it to shore. 
>> [Indistinct] and then he should be able to get up. 
[Indistinct radio chatter] 
>> but pulling the large animal over the ice is not as easy as the rescuers think, especially since the moose attempts to gain its footing from time to time, and then slips back down on the cold surface. The weather is also getting worse. Blowing snow decreases the visibility. However, the rescuers don't give up. It's amazingly slow going, as the rescuers continue to pull this several hundred pound moose. 
>> Tell you what I'll do, is you wheel it back out, I'll move the truck. We'll get a better angle, eh. 
>> We should be ok. Just slow. 
[Indistinct chatter] 
>> little progress is made, as the moose still wants to walk but can't gain any traction. The animal slips out of the make-shift harness, and now the rescuers need to reposition it and start the process all over again. It finally is up. But now what? The rescuers still aren't convinced the moose is out of the woods yet, or in this case, off the ice. 

[00:06:22]


>> Oh, just there he went. 
>> The wayward moose is moving. But in what direction? It certainly is not heading to the shoreline. The rescuers now must come up with another plan, 'cause their muscle power didn't work. They'll consult with the other team members, as the moose is now upright, but still alone way out on the frozen bay. 
>> What were you guys trying to do out there? 
>> We pulled him in to where there was a little bit of hard-packed snow. And just--we tried 3 or 4 times, pulled him, let him stand up. He wouldn't stand, couldn't stand. Finally, we got him to some hard pack and he finally got up on his back legs, and then the front legs. 
>> Was the moose scared? 
>> Oh, I think so. Happy to see us, though. 
>> He let you help him? 
>> Yep. Yep. 
>> No sign of panic? 
>> Uh, no, I don't think so. He was tired. He's been out there for a while, apparently. 
>> As you can see, he finally made it out of the water, so 's just standing there. We're just waiting for the mnr to arrive to see what the next step will be. 
>> Well, right now things seem to be under control. We're much better off than we were a couple of hours ago. The ministry is on the way. We have the feed company with their horse trailer. Hopefully with the rescue going on, we'll be able to transport the moose safely away. 
>> The new plan calls for a snow vehicle to approach the moose carrying wildlife officials who hope to tranquilize the animal so they can pull it off the ice. 
>> Hopefully what we're gonna do is we're gonna out on the ice with the [indistinct] and lift him on carefully with about 4 guys, right onto this platform here, and then drive him out so we don't have to drag him along the ice and he doesn't get any gouges in him and start bleeding. And that'll be probably the best thing to do. The quickest way to do it, too. 

[00:08:32]


>> You have to weigh the safety of, you know, all the officers, all the people involved here with the life of the moose. We've got 30 people here. Everyone's concerned. 
>> Maybe we can see if we can get it to move. 
>> The problem is that he was up 4 times. He just can't get any traction. I guess he's so cold and so worn out from trying to get up. It's been there for an hour now. 
>> If it's injured, we'll put him down. If he's not injured, we'll try and tranquilize him and see if we can't hobble it and get it off the ice and take him somewhere where he should be. 
>> The moose senses something is going to happen and slowly walks away. He probably would run for cover in the forest, but, as you can see, there isn't any here. Still trying to get away, he falls once again in his attempted escape. Nonetheless, the animal is still close enough to be darted successfully. The tranquilizer is safe and does no harm to the animal. The first dose apparently is not enough, and the moose gets back up and walks away. So a second dose is administered, and this time it works. The drugged animal is now ready for the rescue team to load onto the wooden platform to be pulled back to shore. 

[00:11:12]


>> Looks like it's a happy ending. Right now he seems to be doing pretty well. We're gonna move him as fast as possible, that's the idea here. The sooner we can get him into his own environment, the ministry will give him a drug to reverse the affect of the tranquilizer, get him up, and get him going as soon as possible. We're gonna wat--we're gonna follow through the operation till the end. Looks like a happy ending, though. 
>> "Animal rescue" returns right after this brief break. 

[00:14:04]


>> As you know, we travel around the world featuring all types of great animal rescues and showcasing those dedicated individuals helping animals in trouble. Watch. Nearly 600 beaches and miles of rocky shoreline have been tarnished by the spill. Tons of heavy fuel oil leak from an old single hull tanker named the "prestige" that sank 133 miles off the northwest spanish coast. Local animal groupsnd members of ifaw, the international fund for animal welfare, rush to various locations trying to rescue birds covered in the thick sludge. 
>> The team here at the "prestige" spill is a wonderful international team. We've got people from 8 different countries here. But we also have local people from the unity of galicia who are working on the ground, and then today, we've seen the international cooperation with portugal, who have allowed us to bring these birds 600 kilometers from the rehabilitation center in pontevedra. Um, so it's really, truly an international effort. 
>> Hundreds of birds were brought into this small building where volunteers worked around the clock to help the injured creatures. 
>> When the birds come in covered in oil, the first thing that we do is to hydrate them and feed them. They're very weak when they come in, and they need to be strengthened up in order to go through the washing process to take the oil off of them. So they get fluids and food, and when they're strong enough, they go through the washing process. It takes a long time to wash an oiled bird. It's a process involving washing up liquid and a toothbrush, and it takes several people to hold the animal while we do the washing, and then the rinsing is extremely important. They get rinsed with a high pressure water source for almost an hour, depending on the size of the bird. They then go to a pen where they preen themselves until they're fully waterproof, and at that point, we monitor them until they're ready to be released. It's a real pleasure to see these birds go back to the wild. It's where they belong. They shouldn't be in captivity for any moment longer than they need to be in order to be rehabilitated. It's also very sad because we have over 350 still at the center with between 40 and 50 birds coming in every day at the moment. We know that this spill is likely to go on for many months yet, and we're right at the beginning of this crisis. We expect these birds to join up with others of their kind and hopefully spend the rest of their lives in the wild, and they should meet with others that are in the area and head south on their migration. 

[00:16:59]


>> Many of these dedicated animal rescuers say the magnitude of this oil disaster is hard to grasp. But it doesn't deter their commitment to help. Meantime, thousands of soldiers and civilians continue the arduous task of scraping the gluey fuel oil from sand and rocks stained by the spill.

=======================================================

Ore. Come to mind. Separated only by a few hours by car, these two cities have activities for any age. We are or to kick things off in seattle. The city gets a reputation for rain, but that is not entirely accurate. In fact, boston, houston, miami, and new york city have all reached more rainfall in a calendar year, and that is good to know because this town can be a perfect landing spot on a nice, sunny day. Seattle is a vibrant city with lots of energy. We are going to start at one of the most iconic places in town, pike place market, to take part in a local tradition. We are at the pike place market. I have never been here. Have you? 
>> One I was young. it has been around for so long. Relocation, fresh produce, but there is one lesson to draw a crowd. 
>> This is were there for the fish. 
-- Where they broke the fish. 
-- Throw the fish. 20 years ago, the workers were trying to figure out a way to get the fish to the front from the back without having to walk across every time. To make things more efficient, they came up with a quicker method. 
>> How hard is it to catch fish? After a few warmup throws, it was time for us to try the real bang. 

[00:02:01]


-- T>> hey! 
>> Yeah! 
>> We just caught fish, -- 
>> and try to throw it back. 
>> Luckily for all three of us, everyone caught a fish without getting too much heat. So we rinsed off and went to another part of the market that has been growing popularity coming in quite a strange way. 
>> They are on the wall here somewhere. 
>> You know those things your teacher tells you not to do in school? I am doing it. The gum wall, as it is known, started 20 years ago, and basically became a random spot to put your chewing gum. 
>> I think I still have some fish scales on me from that. Gum on the wall. A little disgusting. Ready for something a little cleaner? Up next, we get a taste of flying, in more ways than one. And later I had to portland for a lesson in climbing. "Awesome 

[00:05:17]


>> welcome back to "awesome adventures." I met up with conner and isabella at pike place market to throw some fish with the locals. Now I want to learn more about their home city. There is something about the pacific northwest that really inspires you. What do you do for fun? 
>> I play fast pitch softball. 
>> I do everything from hip-hop dancing to ballet. 
>> There is a place around here where you can do skydiving, some cool flying things. That is where we are going next. You are not excited about that? 
>> Iam. 
>> I know you are excited. On the way out, I noticed connor giving isabel an impromptu dance lesson, so I wanted to see what it is all about. 
>> One thing that people know how to do nowadays is gliding. You are basically moving your weight back and forth between your feet, whichever way you feel comfortable. You got it. 
>> We wrap up the dance party and made her way across town to catch some air. 
>> That was awesome. 
>> Hey, guys. You ready to get some flying done? What is the first question you have when you see something like this? 
>> Can we go up high? 
>> We have an instructor that will take you up. You are truly going to experience what the body flying profession is all about. 
>> Body flight progression is the official term of us jumping into a wind tunnel and experiencing the next best thing skydiving. 

[00:07:26]


>> This entire building is the entire wind tunnel. It is exactly what it sounds like. Week recirculate the air. We are capturing hurricanes, sticking it in a bottle, and that for when you in there to fly. 
>> After a safety briefing, it was time to give it a shot. Conner led things off. 
>> Connor is doing fantastic. His stance ability is paying off. He is aware of what his body is doing, he is comfortable in that position. Very good. Good job. Every construction that he is giving her well help her fly more stable. 
>> You have a nice arc, smile. Nice, stable body position. 
>> Good job, guys. >>, I was really nervous at first. My heart was racing, but then i went inside and then I let the air take me. 
>> There are no words to express how much fun I had. 
>> This got the adrenaline racing. For our last adventure, we slow things down a little bit. Our last stop in seattle kept things going at the museum of flight. And here with the curator at the museum of flight. What do we have here? 

[00:09:29]


>> You have the largest independent air and space museum anywhere in the world. 
>> The museum contains over 160 aircraft. Including ones dating back to 1916. 
>> How do you get the planes in here? 
>> It is not an easy task. We have to spend a great deal of time making sure that all the weight and balance and connection ports on the aircraft are exactly right. 
>> In addition to the massive collection on the floor, they also have a flight simulation center. So we decided to put connor and is about through the three-step flight process. First, they had to get familiar with the instruments. Next, a walk-through of aircraft. Similar to what most pilots when the court before they take off. 
>> What is the hardest thing to do to become a pilot? 
>> Probably the hardest thing is learning how to land. You have to be checking out all of your instruments, your controls, and you need to make sure everything is coordinated. 
>> After the checklist, it was off to the simulator were two kids who had never even driven a car, were going to try to fly a plane. 
>> Pull back on it. We are getting to the end of the runway. There you go. We are in the grass. 
>> It will not turn. 
>> Oh my gosh. 
>> I would not be flying a plane. 
>> Landing was the hardest part. The first time I tried it, i kind of smashed through a couple of houses. 

[00:11:30]


>> I could not even take off, i went through a couple of yards. 
>> The museum of flight was a great way to learn about aviation history, and gave conner andsabel a chance to be a pilot for a day. Unfortunately, monday in mday in 

[00:14:10]


>> welcome back to "awesome adventures." Our trip to the pacific northwest starting very hands-on and then shifted to flying, in a few ways. Now it is time for me to meet up with daily and rachel outside of portland, ore. For an outdoor work out with some notes and one very tall rock. 
>> We are about to rock climbing on rooster rock. 
>> Leading our trip are caper and ben. They will be insuring that we have a safe and fun afternoon. How high is that? 
>> About 200 feet over the columbia river. 
>> I know in terms of technique, I know you want to use your legs a little bit. 
>> The bulk of it you want to do with your legs. A lot of people, when the first start climbing,>> they use their arms. You see what is below you, so you grab onto the rock, but the harder you pull on, and the faster you will be burned out. Focus on slowing down, looking around. There is a good foot hole. Raise your foot and put it in place. 
>> How are you feeling? 
>> I think I am feeling good. 
>> This part does not look to bed. That part -- 
>> that is the exciting part. 
>> The scary and exciting part be done that is the thrill. 
>> It is so fun. It is so pretty up here. 

[00:16:18]


>> I feel like I'm on top of the world right now. 
>> Climbing up the rock was one thing. Getting down, however, was put a lot more faith in those ropes. Caper showed us that the way back down was to repel the them this is more wrecking them the stuff I was doing before. 
>> Meeting we had to lean back and slide down the road. Easier said than done. 
>> We are rebelling all the way down there, just sliding along our route. 
>> I am nervous. 
>> I am scared, actuallycaper showed us that the way back down was to. 
>> I am not looking forward to this part. The climb up was easier. 
>> Whatever comes up must come down. Rachel and bailey and I conquer ou 

[00:19:05]


>> I just climbed 200 feet of rooster rock, but we learned getting back down would mean putting all our faith in these groups. 
>> He keeps on saying -- saying that. It is a chill climb. 
>> It is a little more than that been done this is the scariest part of what we do, going over the section. Not only repel, but transition from the vertical to horizontal position. 
>> Nice. Go ahead and relax. I know it is hard. That is better. 
>> That was nerve wracking at first. It is hard to trust all the systems to work, but you get the hang of it halfway through, and then you are just bouncing down. 
>> When you are afraid of heights, it is the best thing. Conditioning, flooding. 
>> I just rappelled down the side of the huge cliff. And experience. It was good. 
-- What an experience. 
>> Everything is a double and triple checked. 
>> Chris was terrified. I think he got more and see anticipating his turn. 
-- Antsy anticipating his turn. And experience. 

[00:21:21]


>> Rock climbing was one of the most thrilling adventures we have done this year, so it took the rest of the day to relax before I met up with bailey and rigell again on day two. 
>> How are you feeling after the rock climbing? 
>> When I woke up I was sort. 
>> My arms hurt a little bit. 
>> There are a lot of grit activities along the river. What do other people do? 
>> In the winter I ski a lot. 
>> I do not come out here very much but I know a lot of people come on here to sail and do different boat activities. 
>> Getting on the water son of like a great idea to us, so they got an introduction to kayaking. 
>> I want you to do some strokes with the title where you have some deep strokes off the side of the bow with your off-hand, a kind of like you are reading your wrist watch. 
>> To get started, connie, as have to paddle the right way -- taught us how to paddle the right way, and have to get back on the kyak if we fell off. 
>> After they were rock climbing, today we are kayaking. I am mostly looking for to going fast through the rapids. 
>> After the safety briefing, we made our way up the river to begin our trip. 
>> There is deep water below, so you need to be careful. 
>> The part of the river we went down was a mixture of class one and class to rapids. 
-- Two rapids. After getting warmed up, it was time to put our skills to the test at a class 3 rapid at end of our trip. It did not take long to realize we were about to head into some challenging, rough waters. 

[00:23:39]


>> The waves got pretty huge, tossed me around. My kayak flipped. It was all right. 
>> I saw him upside down, and then I saw his head popped up. I was laughing a lot. Then I just felt proud of myself for making it through. 
>> Pretty good. I think the river won the battle. 
>> We do n need to talk about it. I tried to correct, t it's sort of -- 
>> yeah. 
>> That is a big white water for the first time in a kayak. 
>> The last two days I have had more adventure than probably my entire life. 
>> I did not know the court had this much to offer. There are a lot of interest to have. It has been super fund.

>> Announcer: The llowing is a paid presentation for the nutribullet, brought to you by nutribullet, llc. 
[??????...] 
>> ...My muscle aches, my backaches really started to decrease significantly in one week. 
>> The first night that i actually used the nutribullet, I actually slept really well. That was exciting. That was phenomenal. 
>> The bad cholesterol, which was 290, went down to 190. 
>> The changes that I saw in myself and my family were just amazing. 
>> Announcer: Join these people and thousands just like them and discover a machine that finally has the power to take years off the way you look and feel. Learn from nutrition expert and bestselling author david wolfe, who speaks to sold-out audiences around the world, why he calls this the most significant discovery of his lifetime. Introducing the nutribullet, the superfood nutrition extractor. The nutribullet is not a blender, it's not a juicer. It's a breakthrough in nutritional science that can change your life. The nutribullet's high-powered motor with bullet-exclusive cyclonic action breaks down and pulverizes food on a cellular level, opening up their hidden nutritional value that can reverse the effects of aging and supercharge your metabolism to fight off aches and pains, colds and flus, and even improve vital heath markers like cholesterol levels and blood pressure. So, take an exclusive seat at our nutribullet seminar workshop with longevity expert david wolfe as he shows us how to unleash the power of food to fight arthritic pain, balance hormones, supercharge your immune system, lose weight and turn back the hands of time five, 10, even 20 years with this incredible machine, the nutribullet, the superfood nutrition extractor. 
>> Greetings, everybody. I'm david wolfe. Welcome to my workshop. Today we're gonna talk about nutrition. Why? I'll tell you why. Because over the last 30 years, we've become the most overfed yet undernourished nation in the entire world. This has created an epidemic of high blood pressure, obesity, depression, stress and a whole lot more. That's why I'm so excited to bring you a machine that's going to change your life the way it changed my life. This is the nutribullet, the world's first nutrition extractor. A nutrition extractor is not a blender, it's not a juicer. It's completely different from anything else out there. This machine is designed to break down the cell walls of your food, releasing, unleashing the nutrients inside, transforming ordinary fresh foods into superfoods. Now I'm gonna show you the difference between smoothies from a traditional blender and what we can create with my nutribullet. Let me show you what I'm talking about. O.K., We're gonna put kale in for chlorophyll and fiber. We're gonna take some pineapple for the vitamin c and a little bit of flavor. We're gonna put in some cucumbers, great for hydration, great for the kidneys, put in some cashews for the creaminess and the protein. And of course we're gonna add some flax seeds in to get the omega-3 fatty acids. And then we're gonna add spring water. Let's get the lid on there. Put on the extractor blades onto our nutribullet. Are you ready? 

[00:03:44]


>> Audience: Ready! 
>> Look, this blender is just mixing stuff around-- it's not breaking anything down. But the nutribullet with its 600 watts of compact power and bullet-exclusive cyclonic action combined with the specially designed extractor blades turning at an amazing 10,000 R.P.M.s PULVERIZING THE CELL Walls, unlocking all that hidden nutrition so your body can actually absorb it and use it. Now, I've got a strainer here, we're gonna pour our blended smoothie through and see what is left over. What's gonna make it through? We've got unbroken flax seeds, lots of fiber... Here, let me show you this. This, ladies and gentlemen, is what we call a smoothie. 
[Audience exclaims] now let's see what happened with the nutribullet. I take off the extractor blades, looks like we've got quite a beverage in here. Let's bring it out and pour it through the strainer. It's completely liquefied. All that nutrition has been turned inside out. Everything's been completely broken down. And when we pour it, we can see just how glowing it is, beautiful. The real test is always the flavor. Let's give it a try. That, ladies and gentlemen, is what I call a nutriblast. We've taken all of those cells, pulverized them, flipped them inside out, got all of that juice, all the nutrients-- the vitamins, the minerals, the enzymes, the essential fatty acids, the protein-- and now we can actually assimilate and utilize those nutrients. We've turned this into a superfood. Listen, juicers makes juice and blenders make smoothies, but the nutribullet makes nutrient-packed nutriblasts. All I'm asking you to do is have one nutriblast a day and that will transform your life. 

[00:06:12]


>> About five years ago the doctor told me after taking my cholesterol numbers that I was gonna have to be on cholesterol medication and most likely for the rest of my life. We tried to address it with diet, we tried to address it with exercise and neither of them seemed to work. There is a history of heart disease in my family. There's a history of high cholesterol in my family, so I felt this was the natural progression of things and it was out of my control, that there was nothing that i could do, until I went onto this nutribullet system, and that's when things really started to change dramatically. When I make my nutriblasts incorporating the nutribullet, it emulsifies fruits and vegetables so well that I feel them go right into my system, I feel those ingredients immediately, and I started to see results actually within three or four days. Six weeks ago when I started this program, I weighed 182 pounds, and after six weeks on the nutribullet program, I believe I weighed in at 160. So this weight loss over six weeks is just a byproduct. The reason that I involved myself in the nutribullet program was for cholesterol purposes, to reduce my cholesterol, to regain control of my life and to get rid of the acid reflux. My starting cholesterol was 263 and now I'm at 208 and within a normal range. And my triglycerides are almost cut in half. Look at my results over six weeks. If I can enjoy these results, I have to think that everybody can. 
>> When we think of hormone imbalance, we think that's only something that happens to older people... And that's nonsense. This can affect any of us at any age-- in our teens, IN OUR 20s, IN OUR 70s-- And hormone imbalance leads to mood swings, infertility, acne, fatigue, low sex drive, and those things can affect any of us. The emphasis here is on hormones. And both men and women are affected by this. We're not built the same, so the approach has to be a little bit different, so what we've done here is we've created a nutriblast for the guys and a nutriblast for the gals. 

[00:08:16]


>> Great. >> Wonderful. 
>> There are so many amazing hormone-building foods. Foods like beets, grapes, blueberries, pumpkin seeds, broccoli to support the prostate, olive oil, which helps keep good hormones from becoming bad hormones. We need good hormones to keep us young. We've got to put in spring water. Let's put on the extractor blades. We're set. Over here we have a female nutriblast, and this contains some key different ingredients. We've put in arugula, sometimes called rocket, we've added raspberries for their volatile oils, which help to support female reproductive health, we've added avocado and goji berries, one of the best antioxidants on the planet. Are we ready to blast off? 
>> Audience: We're ready. 
>> Look at the power! Look at the bullet-exclusive cyclonic action. The nutribullet is pulverizing these ingredients. All right... Let's see what we got. 
>> Woman: Mmm, love the colors. 
>> Remove the extractor blades. Here it is, coming down the counter. For the ladies, let's give that a try. >> Yeah. 
>> If you have a nutriblast every day, you're gonna look better, you're gonna feel better, you canlive longer and you willlove longer. 
>> My hot flashes started when I was 35 years old, and through the years they have just progressively gotten worse, where there's times in the middle of the night you just feel like you're being microwaved. But after doing some nutriblasts for the first week, I slept better, I felt more rested, I didn't have a hot flash. I am thrilled to death by the change in my health and how I feel. It's the combination of the fruits, the vegetables and all the vitamins that are all being emulsified together... It works. 

[00:10:39]


>> The anti-depressants, the sleeping pills and the blood pressure medication did help in the beginning. But as in long-term, it wasn't helping. Well, within a week of drinking nutriblast I saw incredible changes. Right now I'm sleeping a solid eight hours, I am no longer taking my sleeping pills, and nutribullet has everything to do with that. 
>> I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. It's extremely painful. You're in pain a lot of the time. When I started using the nutribullet, I was pleasantly surprised because the first night that I actually used the nutribullet, I actually slept really well. That was exciting. That was phenomenal. It's almost unbelievable, quite frankly, that just by using the nutribullet and just properly nourishing your body that I got immediate results and a result that I was looking for. If I had to pick one kitchen appliance that I absolutely had to have, it would be the nutribullet. It is the only appliance out there that can give me exactly what my body needs in order to feel good, um, have the health and proper nutrition that is so important in order for us to be able to just live life. 
[Emotionally] if the people were here that made the nutribullet, what I would say to them is thank you for giving me my life back, thank you for allowing me to enjoy my family more... Thanks for taking away the pain. Where have you been all my life? [Laughs] 
>> we all know how important the immune system is. It is the key. Your immune system determines what belongs and what doesn't. When it finds something bad, it releases white blood cells, and white blood cells detoxify our body. They also help us fight illness, pain, even disease. Our ability to create and release white blood cells is affected by a lot of things. It's affected by a lack of sleep, sess, it's especially affected by a lack of nutrition. If we can increase our absorption from our food and nourish our immune system directly, then our bodies can handle practically anything. The nutribullet is designed to help us do just that. 

[00:12:56]


>> For the past two years, I haven't been very healthy. Unfortunately I was diagnosed with cancer. So, for the past two years, I haven't been very healthy and I've been feeling overall pretty crummy. Lost every ounce of my hair-- I lost every hair on my head and then I just covered my head up with wigs, but, you know, at the end of the day when you're taking your wig off and you have to see the result of the chemotherapy, it's really hard, you know, on your psyche. I was amazed at how quickly I saw results from the nutribullet. I was so excited, because to feel it after the second nutriblast was a miracle to me. I was so excited. One of the best things about the nutribullet is that it's not a blender. It's something that pulverizes everything that you put in it and you're extracting the nutrients out of these whole foods, so you're getting the maximum benefit by everything that you're putting in there. And probably about three weeks into the program, my hair just went through this growth spurt, and people were asking me, you know, what happened, because I didn't have a whole lot of hair before I started. I was just telling somebody, I started this year off fighting for my life... I'm ending the year feeling better than I've felt in years. Totally given me hope, you know, and I didn't have that and I just feel wonderful... 
[Emotionally] and I am so grateful for everything you've done-- thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart. You guys are awesome and I hope that this can help other people. 
>> One of the greatest keys to bolstering your immune system is hidden inside the foods that we buy every day. What we have to do is unlock those valuable nutrients so that we can actually absorb them. This can help change your life. In fact, it could actually help save your life. 
>> Announcer: Over the last 30 years, we have become the most overfed yet undernourished nation on the planet, leading to a modern-day epidemic of obesity, high blood pressure, stress, depression and more. We're not getting healthier, we're getting sicker, and it comes down to one simple need: Nutrient absorption. We need to increase the nutritional power of the foods we eat every day to dramatically change the way we look and feel... And the great news is now we can! From the makers of the original magic bullet, introducing the nutribullet, the superfood nutrition extractor. With the nutribullet, you can turn ordinary food into superfood that now absorbs easily into your body's system so you can live a longer, healthier, more active life. All this food is loaded with essential nutrition, and the only way to get all of it is to break down, pulverize and open up the food's hidden nutrition on a cellular level. This process is called nutrition extraction. 

[00:15:40]


Look: Even expensive blenders just mix things around, they don't break things down, and with juicing, most of the valuable nutrition and fiber is just thrown away. But the nutribullet is different-- watch. Start with some spinach for fiber, banana for potassium, add some berries for essential antioxidants, then almonds and flax seeds for omega-3 oils, add a little water, and watch how the power of the nutribullet completely breaks everything down, extracting all the essential nutrition. Look, even the almonds and flax seeds have been broken down to fit through this strainer, unlike traditional blenders that leave everything behind. The secret of the nutribullet is its powerful 600-watt motor, combined with bullet-exclusive cyclonic action that forces everything through the turbo extractor blades turning at an incredible 10,000 r.P.M. To break down and pulverize the stems, seeds, and skins, where most of the essential nutrition lies, taking ordinary fresh foods and turning them into superfoods to give you the strength, energy and vitality for a full active life, whatever your age. Juicers make juice, blenders make smoothies, but the nutribullet makes supercharged, superfood nutriblasts, and by drinking just one nutriblast a day, you can supercharge your body, lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and superboost your energy levels to feel better than you have in years, without taking prescription pills, without any side effects. Just one a day can change your life. We've all bought expensive blenders and juicers and we all know the problem: They're just too much trouble to put together, and clean them once and you'll never want to clean them again, but the nutribullet takes seconds to use and seconds to clean. 
Watch: Just load your ingredients into the cup, twist on the extractor blade, pop it onto the power base, and watch how the nutribullet blasts ordinary foods into superfoods in an instant, then just separate, throw in the dishwasher or give it a quick rinse and you're ready to go again in seconds. How easy is that? And with nearly twice the power of these other machines, the nutribullet is less than half the size. There's no other machine like it. The nutribullet comes with a supersized 24-ounce pitcher, with the same size and capacity of this full-size blender, to make supercharged nutriblasts the whole family can share to kick-start their day. It also comes with two single-serve 18-ounce mugs, so everyone gets to enjoy their own personal favorite nutriblasts. Just twist on the customized handled lip ring and your nutriblast is ready to go when you are. You also get the superfood milling blade that instantly grinds and pulverizes nuts, seeds, grains, raw chocolate and more for super-nutritious, super-delicious energy bars. You also get the superfood recipe book, packed full of delicious recipe combinations the whole family will love. You could spend up to a thousand dollars on these big, bulky industrial machines that still don't have the nutribullet's exclusive cyclonic action. But call now and you won't pay $1,000, 500, 300, or even 150! During this tv-only offer, you can have the complete nutribullet system rushed to your home for just six payments of only $19.99!

[??????...] 
>> inflammation in our joints and in our bodies has become a huge problem. Anyone who suffers from arthritis or joint pain knows exactly what I'm talking about. I bet most of you believe that once that pain starts, it just gets worse and worse, right? 
>> Audience: Right. 
>> Wrong. There are foods that contain hidden nutrients that can give your body the tools it needs to help fight the effects of arthritis and joint pain. lemon and lime-- the anti-inflammatory enzyme bromelain, found in grapefruit and pineapple, apples with their malic acid, which cuts right into arthritis, the anti-inflammatory omega-3 inside the flax seeds, and my personal favorite, turmeric. Turmeric is probably the most powerful anti-inflammatory food you can find in your local grocery store. You ready to try this? 
>> Woman: Yes. 
>> You just make and you drink. So easy. So let's give it a try. 
>> Woman: O.K. 
>> Wow, that's powerful. I don't know if you guys know this, but both my parents are medical doctors. My mom told me that health is our greatest asset. 
>> Woman: Absolutely. 
>> So, let's toast to the best health ever-- cheers. 
>> Bravo. >> Cheers. 
>> I've had migraines most of my life where, um, there's times where just keeping my eyes open is, is very painful. Um, basically, being put in a dark room, laying in a bed with your eyes closed would be the only relief I would get from a migraine. Once a week I would suffer from a migraine. Since incorporating the nutriblast I haven't had one headache, not one migraine. The nutribullet is different because it extracts all the nutrients from the fruits and vegetables and nuts, and I think everybody should do it because you just feel great. I've never felt this good in my life, never. Never. 

[00:23:10]


>> Ladies and gentlemen, we all know that what we eat is important, but how we eat it may even be more important. If you're eating healthy, good-for-you salads, you might only be absorbing a fraction of the available nutrition. By making e amazing nutrition contained at the cellular level of these foods available to you, you'll absorb them, and then you'll feel a huge difference in how you look and you'll feel a huge difference in your day-to-day energy. You can take everyday, ordinary foods and turn them into superfoods in literally seconds with the nutribullet. All I'm asking you to do is have just one nutriblast a day and I promise you it can change your life. Thanks so much for being here. Have the best day ever. Cheers! All right!

=======================================================

Sense of direction, around the time of my 55th birthday. I'd already had two successful careers. The first in broadcast news, including a dozen years as an anchorman and senior correspondent at cnn. Then in my early 40's I reinvented myself, initially as a leadership professor at a top business school, soon after as owner of my own executive education company. By my mid 50's I was living with my wife of 30 years in the town of our dreams, on the coast of northern california. For all intents and purposes I had won the gold medal of american life. I had health, love and a bit of fame and fortune, and yet I felt totally lost, unhappy, and irritable during the day, restless and haunted at night by unexpected new questions. What now? What should I do with the rest of my life? Welcome everybody. Thanks so very much for being here. You know that great philosopher lily tomlin? 
(Audience laughs) I don't know whether you ever heard what she once said, "all my life I wanted to be somebody, but maybe I should have been more specific." Well, that's really the way it was for me about sevenears ago when i was in my mid 50's and as you just saw my life sort of hit a wall. I've learned an enormous amount since then. There's a lot of us here in this room and certainly watching this show who I know now have had the same experiences I have of being sort of uncertain which way to turn in midlife and beyond. I know this in part because I've spend a big chunk of the last seven years studying us. There's a hundred million of us between about our late 40's and our mid 70's and tens of millions more like us all over the world. Something else I've discovered, that if you're sitting here in this room or watching us on television and you're saying to yourself, "what is this guy walton talking about? I haven't had this experience." Well, I'm willing to bet you that you will, maybe sooner, maybe later, maybe even a couple of times. So add it all together and, my friends, this is the bad news. If you're an intelligent, thoughtful, ambitious, 21st century woman or man, sooner or later you're gonna be lost, adrift in midlife and beyond. The great news is I've found a way home. I found a way to create a second half of life that is as exciting, is as rewarding, and is as profitable, financially, emotionally and physically as the first, and that's what this program is all about. It's about you. It's about transforming your brain, unleashing your talents, and realizing your boundless potential in life's new second half.

[Music] 
nuland: The knowledge that we have is essentially, well, it's like a tree. Everything we know is hung on the branches of the tree and as we age there are more branches and therefore more things you can hang. 
Merzenich: We also always have within us the ability to step life up a notch, in whatever we're doing. 
Spina: One of the things that I think inhibits a lot of people to change their course in life is they're afraid they won't be good at it. 
Garcetti: This is the thing that I try and punch when I go and talk to people about career change. You've got to take advantage of what you know but then you have to get out there and do it. 
Webb: I'm totally clear that I can also keep growing and keep improving and developing capacities and that I have, I will have more to give, you know, the longer I'm at this. 
Freedman: The boundless potential ideal is not just an abstract dream. There are already all these people who are living out the future. 
Walton: Nobody can afford, either financially or mentally anymore to just figure that the new track of life is the same as the old track. It's not anymore. Everything has changed. 
[Music] 
walton: Everything has changed. A little while ago I introduced sort of an odd construction of words. I said, "life's new second half." You know, what's new about it? I mean, what possibly could be new? How about absolutely everything? How about the fact that no generation in history has ever lived the second half of life that we are now living, or that the 20, 30's and early 40-somethings behind us will live? It's never happened before. We're living in two simultaneous revolutions. We're living at a longevity revolution and simultaneously an economic revolution. In the last 50, 60 years we have added more years to the average human lifespan through advances in medicine and diet and hygiene, that have been added through all the previous years of western civilized history. This is a completely new life second half. When my dad was born in 1915 the average life expectancy at birth was about 47 years. When my daughter was born in 1980 it was and today it's 78, and it's still climbing. In fact if you make it to 65 today the odds are extremely good that you will make it into your 80's, 90's, even beyond. This is an entirely new second half of life. But while all of this was happening, while our lifespan was expanding, our economy was changing, our workplace, our marketplace, our careers were totally radically changed. See, pretty much all of us today either are or have been knowledge workers. In fact, we're the first generation in human history to be made up primarily of knowledge workers. And the knowledge economy is entirely different than the economies of the past, than the manufacturing economy. For one thing it moves at a completely different pace. It moves at warp speed, hurricane speed, internet speed, and in this environment, and I'm sure you've seen it, there are crosswinds, treacherous crosswinds, that can knock us off our course, our life path. So if you take these two revolutions together, longevity revolution and economic revolution, you put them together, you have essentially a total revolution in human affairs, and this is what one man called it. His name was peter f. Drucker, and peter drucker was arguably one of the most prescient, brilliant, futurists of all times, especially in the area of business. Drucker, when he was in his 90's, still writing and working and thinking in the late 1990's, looked out into the 21st century and said, "if you're a knowledge worker," by the way, a term that he coined, "if you're a knowledge worker in the 21st century one or more of three things is likely to happen to you," and see if you recognize these as we touch on them. First of all he said, 'your career is likely to be derailed. Your job, your industry, your business is likely to disappear or your skills are likely to become outdated or irrelevant and you'll have trouble affording your new longer life." So I see glimmers of recognition here of course and I'm sure at home as well, or wherever you're watching this 'cause this is what's happened to us. I mean, look over the past four or five years since the great recession. We're under water. I mean, our careers are under water, our finances are under water, our futures are under water. This is what peter drucker was predicting and he said, "not only would it happen, it might happen a whole bunch of times." Scenario number two. Again, we're looking at scenarios that are likely to occur to us, to knowledge workers in the 21st century. Let's say you hang in there. Let's say, you know, you make it through your career part of the way. He said, "you're likely to burn out, maybe once or..." See I see recognition here as well. You're likely to burn out, but here's why. Because the brain of a knowledge worker is a continually evolving mechanism. It doesn't like to think and do the same thing over and over again. It wants to think and do something new. Scenario number three. Let's say you hang in there. You get lucky enough one way or another, you get enough money together to kick back, to retire in the traditional sense. Said peter drucker, and remember, he's in his 90's when he said this, he said, "you'll be sorry." He said, "the knowledge worker will be bored, mind numbingly bored, maybe even bored to death. Yea. Why? Because the human brain, and we'll look at this in some depth in this program, is not wired for retirement. It's wired for continual reinvention and success. So where are we? Where does this leave us? It leaves us in a box. I call it the new normal, in which what happens is we live longer, and we face challenges nobody ever faced before. You knowhow do you survive in this? How do you thrive in this? How do you succeed in this new environment? I mean, listen for yourself. After a career of 20, 30, 40 years am I a done deal? Am I washed up? Is that it? Is it necessarily so that success is just a younger person's game? Or is it possible to make money and a difference into our 70's, 80's and 90's...70's, 80's and 90's, in other words to be successful for the rest of our lives? When I started seeking answers to these big questions I found out early on that I had to ask the right people. I mean, what was the point of asking people, you know, my age, 50's and 60's, those of us who were trying new things, I had to find people who had been there and done that, who had walked the walk. I needed to find people in their 70's, 80's and 90's who had reinvented themselves in their 50's and 60's, successfully, who had raised the bar rather than lowered their expectations, who if the map of life had indeed changed, had been willing to reinvent the game. And I did, I found them, and those are the people I want to introduce you to in this program. So we begin our journey and what we're doing here is retracing the steps of my journey. We begin our journey in a leafy suburb two hours north of new york city, a nice kind of quiet place where the lawnmowers mow and the crickets crick, the kind of place where you might go to just kick back and relax and enjoy your so-called golden years. 

[00:11:54]


[Music] 
walton: Had you traveled with me to this rambling house in southern connecticut, climbed the wooden staircase, and leaned into the light filled study on the second floor, you'd likely have found retired surgeon sherwin, b. Nuland sitting in his comfortable chair. A late morning snooze you might conclude, until your perspective is changed. This gentle man whose hand is racing across a white legal pad is in a state of peak performance. Psychologists call it "in the zone," or flow, the kind of condition they study in athletes, stock traders, soldiers and ballet dancers, not the kind of place you'd expect to find an 80-something year old. But in his mid 50's, after three decades in medicine dr. Nuland found a new domain in which to play. He started to write. 
Nuland: And it gives me an extraordinary feeling that I can only call aesthetic. It was the same feeling I had when I operated. I loved the technical aspects of surgery. I loved the tissues in my hands. I loved to hold instruments in my hands. I loved to stitch and tie. That's the way I feel about writing. 
Walton: The extent of shep nuland's reinvention could never have been planned. Concerned about losing his surgical edge shep decided to take a sabbatical and try writing a book about his experiences with an unlikely topic, the process of human death. He fully expected that the vast majority of readers would cover their eyes. 
Nuland: People may be fascinated by death but they're afraid of it. And they hide death behind their fingers, or better yet, they slowly open their fingers a little bit to look but they don't want to be caught looking. 

[00:14:00]


Walton: But look they did. Publishers, reviewers, and book buyers looked and in a big way. They sent shep's book, how we die, to the top of the new york times bestseller list. They turned it into a pulitzer prize finalist and they honored it with the prestigious national book award. 
Nuland: They sent me all over the country, first class hotels, first class suites. 
Walton: I mean, this is still extraordinary. I mean, who could have expected anything? 
Nuland: I was surprised, I was shocked, I was all of the above, I couldn't, absolutely couldn't believe that such a thing could happen. 
Walton: Remarkable as the sudden emergence of this brilliant talent seems it may have been hidden away, unrealized, since shep's childhood. Born and raised among old world jews, italians and irishmen in the bronx borough of new york, shep developed a special fascination with the english language which he saw as the key to american life. 
Nuland: So I read as much as I could. As soon as I could write I became, there's that word, fascinated by the thought of putting this down on a piece of paper. 
Walton: He penciled his first piece of nonfiction onto the blank inside covers of a tiny children's book he still cherishes in his study. It's the story of his visit, at age eight, to a neighborhood carnival. 
Nuland: There was a merry-go-round, a ferris wheel, the whip, that was a fast ride, anyway, at the very end after the rollercoaster I write, "the end." 
Walton: It doesn't look all that different actually from your handwriting today which is quite astonishing. 
Nuland: That's a dreadful thing to say about a fellow, 
you know. Walton: Maybe, maybe not. 
Nuland: Miss riley and miss o'connor would have a fit if they heard that. 
Walton: Some people are fascinated by baseball, some people are fascinated by cooking. Shep nuland is fascinated by writing. How come? 

[00:16:09]


Nuland: It's something that brings to me what educators have called the flow sensation. The flow phenomenon is recognizable to so many of us who have done work they love. You really detach from anything else. You have the sense that something is coming out of you. It is a physical sense. It's an emotional sense. The world, outside world is lost to you. 
Walton: The runaway success of shep's book, how we die, was only the beginning of what I've come to call his re-inventive work. By his 70's shep had grown into a one man literary phenomenon, and on our visit, not long before his 83rd birthday, more than a dozen books, translated into nearly 30 languages, had his name on their covers. And yet when I asked him to tell me the secret of his reinvention, what you and I and others can learn from his unexpected success in life's second half, shep's guidance seemed profoundly, even annoyingly simple. "Discover," he said, "or rediscover what fascinates you. Find out what makes you flow. 
Nuland: It has to be fun. There are lots of things that are fun throughout your life that you put aside. But there are lots of things that you consider fun. It has to be fun. You hear people addressing graduation ceremonies and they say, "look for your passion." Passion's another word I don't really know the meaning of, but I know the meaning of fun and we all do. 
Walton: It sounds almost absurd. It's so... It's so fun. You're saying follow you're fun. 
Nuland: Follow your fun. 
Walton: Follow your fascination. Nuland: Yea, yea. 
Walton: So I can almost hear you think. Because you're thinking the same thing i was thinking. I mean, is it possible that the first step on the road to reinvention is this fascination stuff, flow, or what joseph campbell, the great mythologist said, "follow your bliss." Three steps. Step number one. As shep said, discover, and I'm using his word, discover your fascination. This is the area or maybe a specific thing that actually moves you forward into the future. Now I've spoken to enough folks to know that this is not necessarily an easy thing to get at, so I don't want you to feel as though, oh, I know what it is right now. Maybe you do. Let me give you a few clues, things to begin to chew on as you begin to discover your fascination. As shep suggested, what might you have put aside earlier in life to become the person you became, or to have the career or careers that you have had? What's fun for you? I mean, what really lights you up, makes you smile, even if you don't necessarily understand why? What's impoant to you? What truly matters? Step number two, is about flow. Find your flow. So shep talked a lot in our conversation about flow which is this state of euphoria which we have, almost all of us have experienced this. Flow is actually the genesis of peak performance. It's not just a fun euphoric state. Something happens in there and how shep got at it is he took his childhood fascination with writing and he combined it with his lifetime experience in medicine and the result was peak performance. And a level of achievement that neither he or anybody else could possibly have anticipated. Find your flow. Step number three, envision your structure, and what I mean by this is the structure within which you will do your re-inventive work. Now very important for me to be upfront with you about this. This every single one of the re-inventive people I met became entrepreneurial. They discovered early on, maybe even tripped over one of the central new realities of the new normal, which is that in the 21st century the best job you may ever have going forward from midlife will be the job in the field, niche, business, maybe even market, that you personally create. So the question to begin looking at here is what will I create? What will I invent? Will it be a series of projects, will it be a new role, will it be a business? Maybe it'll be a nonprofit. What will I create? So coming up next we'll go into more depth on fascination, flow and structure, as we begin to examine together the new neuroscience of lifelong success. Please stay with us. [Applause] the wonderful mark walton; author, executive educator, peabody award winning journalist and host of boundless potential, this new pbs special. Mark, thank you so much for being here. 

[00:21:44]


Mark: What a great pleasure babette. Thanks so much for having me. 
Babette: Well, we're so glad to have you. And we're happy to bring you this special program, which explains how we can transform our brains, unleash our talents and reinvent our work in midlife and beyond. How, in the second half of life, it's possible to transition from 'just plain work' to work that can make money and a difference for the rest of our lives! So exciting! And that's why we are here, to show you the immense possibilities of the world around us. But we need your financial support to continue our good, work, and to keep to bringing you programming like this. Programs like boundless potential are made possible only through the support of viewers like you. And now, is the time for you to call in and express your support. And when you do call, we have some great ways to show our appreciation. Here's rudy to tell you more. 
Rudy: Thank you so much babette. Boundless potential is the perfect combination instruction and inspiration! And we've created some great gifts that will help you create a meaningful and successful new chapter in your life! When you show your support at the $90 dollar pledge level, we will thank you with a hardcover book, "boundless potential: Transform your brain, unleash your talents, reinvent your work in midlife and beyond". This 262 page hardcover book is brilliant, provocative and highly practical. In it, mark walton punctures the myths of life's second half to 
reveal our true human potential: How we are hardwired for continual reinvention, personal achievement and contribution to others. When you call with your contribution at the $150 dollar level we will thank you with the book and a copy of boundless potential the dvd with mark walton. The dvd, which also contains an additional 20 minutes of interviews with some of the reinvented men and women that mark introduces us to during the show. When you go all out for your community and this station and contribute at the $200 dollar level, we will thank you with the complete boundless potential package. Which includes, the hardcover book- boundless potential, the dvd with bonus material plus an additional special dvd entitled "blueprint for reinvention," hosted by mark walton. This specially created personal coaching program will help you to plan and launch your own reinvention through the step-by-step process featured in the book and pbs special. It contains additional interview material including invaluable advice plus an action plan from reuters columnist mark miller, whose special area of expertise is financial security and success in life's new, longer second half. The book, the dvd and the blueprint are all combined with carefully designed 'take home' lessons for reflection, self-exploration, and most importantly action! At whatever level you can give, we'll appreciate your support. Please go to the phone and make that call now. And now we go back to babette davidson and mark walton. 

[00:24:45]


Babette: Mark, this is a wonderful package you've put together. It's very comprehensive. And for people, like my husband who's in this exact stage trying to figure out what to do, how would he and others use this program? 
Mark: You know I think, uh as we saw in the first act, the guts of the book and the program is essentially a methodology. It's a real world methodology, that re-inventive people I met and studied have used in their own lives. The discover your fascination, find your flow and then envision your structure. That's a great place to start. When we start to ask ourselves these questions- "what really fascinates me? What really lights me up and turns me on?" Is the beginning of the re-inventive adventure, is the beginning of the road to reinvention. And that's really where to start with the package. 
Babette: Well, I think one of the great things about this is that a lot of people think about it, but these are the tools to 
do it, to do something about it. Mark: This is real world stuff. I mean I didn't, I'm a consultant, but I didn't make it up. I actually went out into the field and studied people who'd been in their 70's, 80's and 90's who had reinvented themselves in their 50's and 60's, and asked them, "how did you do it?" And attempted to determine what their steps were. So these are steps, real world - time tested steps that can be followed by others. 
Babette: Well, and we hope that you're taking these steps right now by going to the phone, because you know no greater challenge faces millions of us right now than how to create a meaningful, successful second half of life. And mark has shown us how to reinvent ourselves with a very practical framework, inspiring examples- and weren't they? 
- And new insights from neuroscience. Boundless potential helps you to discover things that fascinate and inspire you so that you can create a second half that matters. That's what we want. Not only to you, but to the world around you. And that is exactly what we do here at this station. During these fundraising programs, we ask you to do something that matters. We ask that everyone watching in this community come together to be part of something bigger than all of us. So go to your phone right now or contribute online. And when you do make that call or that click, you'll receive thank-you gifts that help you create your own plan to explore your own boundless potential. That's very exciting. 

[00:27:08]


Rudy: When you show your support at the $90 dollar level, you'll receive the hardcover book, boundless potential by mark walton. When you call with your contribution at the $150 dollar level, we will thank you with the book and a copy of boundless potential, the dvd with mark walton; the dvd, which also contains an additional 20 minutes of interviews with some of the re-invented men and women that mark introduces us to during the show. When you go all out for your local pbs station and contribute at the $200 dollar level, we will send you the complete boundless potential package. Included in this set is a dvd of the program you are watching plus bonus material, and a unique dvd entitled "blueprint for reinvention," hosted by mark walton, this specially created personal coaching program will assist you to plan and launch your own reinventions through the step-by-step processes featured in the book and television show. It contains additional interview material, commentary by mark, and carefully designed 'take home' lessons for reflection, self-exploration and action. At whatever level you can give we appreciate your support. Please make that call now. 
Babette: I just love that thank-you gift package. Mark, tell us what's coming up in the next part of the program. 
Mark: It's so exciting to me. What I discovered in my research is that everything we thought about the long-term potential of the human mind is basically untrue. We have extraordinary abilities that can emerge in the second half of life, and that's what we'll look at in the next act. 
Babette: Well, I am very excited about that and also that you're going to meet a wonderful woman named marion rosen. So watch for her, she's inspirational. And if you have done something inspirationable by making that call of support, thank you so much. But right now, we're going back to more boundless potential with mark walton only on your pbs station. Thank you. O much. In my field, executive education, we call something like this an actionable methodology. And what this means is how we get at it is we go out into the field and we study successful people and organizations. And we look for patterns, steps that they took so that we can extrapolate those steps out and then, if you will, reverse engineer them so that we can put them into your hands, into your life, to make you more successful. When I first detected this in the re-inventive people I was studying and I had met, it seemed very familiar at first and I couldn't exactly tell why, until my wife jane said to me, "well, of course this would seem familiar. This is what you did." I did, in my early 40's, and she of course was right, but just, you know, hadn't recognized it again yet. That happens a lot with the two of us. So I want to tell you a little bit of my own story of reinvention as a way of deepening these distinctions for you and also I want to make sure you understand that I don't think my story is unique. In fact I know that there are a lot of elements in my life, in yours and in your life and in mine and i want to tell you this story because I know that what happened to me can also happen to you. By the time I reached my early 40's I had been in the broadcasting business for 25 years. Yea. It boggles my mind, anybody doing math out there, I know, but it's true. I started in radio news as a teenager. I was 15 years old at a small station outside of hartfor connecticut. Fast forward 15 years and I signed on as the first chief white house correspondent and an anchor at cnn. And these were the very first days at cnn and they were for people who like doing what we love to do, they were euphoria. I mean, we were a small team flying literally by the seat of our pants doing that which had never been done before, putting the world's first all news television network on the air, and it was a blast. A dozen years later, hmmm, not so much anymore. I see, you know, a lot of heads nodding. Because if you've been at a startup and it's vibrant and then it becomes a bureaucracy, what happened me was I burned out. I mean, the politics of it. The problem I had is I didn't know where to go or what to do. I mean, and if you look at it in terms of the methodology, I had fascination, I had flow, but the structure wasn't working for me anymore. So I got... We'll call it got lucky. You know, a funny thing happened, as tends to happen on the road to reinvention, or when we're moving forward, people show up, things show up. What happened for me is that in the last couple of year at cnn i used to go out and do speeches. I made presentations to, you know, corporate groups and government agencies but on occasion I would share my observations about leadership communication, when I saw political or business leaders communicate very effectively, so much so that they were able to generate buy-in, and align people and motivate them. And I would talk about this and the more I did this, the more people would come up to me afterwards, sometimes very impressive people, and they would say to me, "gee, can you come to my company and teach us how do this stuff?" So this door opened up to my own reinvention and I left cnn and stepped through this door into the entrepreneurial unknown and i watched a transformation occur. My own transformation. I made three big discoveries over that time period. I learned that I knew things that I didn't know that I knew. I'm gonna repeat it, right? Because it's a brain twister and a tongue twister. I came to see that I knew things that I didn't know that I knew. So I had sales and marketing executives come up to me and say, "you know, this stuff you're telling us about, message development, that's worth big money to us at our company." "Really?" I mean, I'm a journalist. What do I know from sales and marketing? But it turned out I did. I learned also that I could do things that I didn't know that I could do. So I learned that I could start and run and grow a business. I'd never been trained in that before. I didn't know I could do that but apparently I could and I learned that I could relate to people in ways that I didn't know I could. Not only was I able to create educational methodology but i could coach people and teach them to use it to make them more successful in their own lives and businesses. The bottom line is I discovered within myself hidden brain power, talents and skills, and I am increasingly convinced that the potential for all of this exists in each and every one of you, too, but I've had contact now with some of the leading lights in the field of neuroscience. These are people who are engaged, even obsessed with the question, what's the long-term potential of a human mind? And what they have discovered, just in the last dozen years, what they've discovered with brain imagining technology, this is brand new stuff, they now know that our minds, the mature mind, is not inferior to a younger person's mind. It's organized differently. And as such it has strengths and assets within it that are not accessible earlier in life. That's new. They now know that the mature mind is not wired for retirement, it's programmed, it's designed for continual reinvention and success. Now one of the leading, early pioneers in all of this is a man by the name of dr. Michael merzenich. I want to share with you a few moments of my recent conversation with michael merzenich. 

[00:35:37]


[Music] 
walton: The title of my book is boundless potential. I use that word to characterize the potentials of second half of life in general now, but especially with regard to the human mind, to the long-term potential of the human mind. What word or words would you use based on your research to characterize that? 
Merzenich: We're continuously plastic. We have a capacity to change to through the end of our life. We have the capacity to be stronger, better, to have deeper understanding, to improve our capacities, to extend our abilities, at any point in life. The brain in fact is continuously changing. It's continuously changing and revising its wiring, as a consequence of what you do, and each time you acquire a new skill or ability or take on a new set of challenges that requires new learning on a substantial level, the brain is remodeling itself and that's another way of saying that this gift, this ability is with us for the duration of our life. 
Walton: One of the things I consistently saw in the people who I studied were leaps in mental abilities, aka they seemed to develop quickly hidden talents and potentials in areas that you would never expect. Is it your sense that we all have hidden talents and capabilities? 
Merzenich: Of course we do and we also always have within us the ability to step life up a notch, in whatever we're doing, to carry ourselves to a higher level of operations. One of the really interesting things that we commonly see when people do transform themselves later in life, is that they're not just doing a second thing in a more or less mundane level. We commonly see that they've found what they're really meant to do in life, and we find, and they take a great leap forward in the extension of their potential and possibility. Maybe from a relatively limited job or a career they suddenly move into the one they were really constructed for. 

[00:37:43]


Walton: What is the most important thing or what are the most important things that we need to do in order to make these leaps? How do we think or program ourselves or train ourselves or exercise our minds? What do we do? What's your guidance for those of us who want to reinvent ourselves successfully? 
Merzenich: It has to be important to you. It has to matter to you. So one of the ways to think about how you could define where you belong or how you could strengthen or elaborate yourself is you could say, "well, what's important to me? What's exciting to me? What is rewarding to me? What matters to me?" You've always had a talent, you've always had a dream that you could do something and it matters to you, you know that you would be richly rewarded if in fact it turned out that you could. If it matters to you it's worth pursuing, and that's a way to think about it because what that means is that when you get into the activity, if it is in fact continuously rewarding and positive, you will be changing yourself in ways that empower you. 
Walton: What kind of power is this? I mean, what are we talking about here? I'm gonna put a word on it that we've not used before. I'm gonna call it wisdom. You know, this is this unique, almost mysterious set of characteristics and attributes always associated throughout the ages with mature people but never fully defined until now. See, the neuroscientists are not only defining wisdom now they're actually discovering its physiological and chemical underpinnings. Let me give you an example of this. When that flock of geese flew into the engines of that us airways jet being piloted by chesley sullenberger out of la guardia he didn't have any time to think. This 81 ton aircraft with 155 people on board is falling toward manhattan and chesley sullenberger does something that no younger, less experienced pilot probably ever could have. He made a split second judgment call, remember, judgment call, to land that plane in the hudson river, safely. Now the news media calls this miracle on the hudson, but the neuroscientists, if they were observing it, would have looked to the left hemisphere of his cerebral cortex and they would have used two words, crystallized experience, or crystallized intelligence. Let me read to you a quote from sully. "For 42 years I've been making small, regular deposits in this bank of experience. On january 15th, 2009 the balance was sufficient so that i could make a very large withdrawal." [Laughter] 

[00:40:43]


walton: I mean, this says it all... And here's the thing, if you've been around long enough and you've been working your brain hard enough, we all have a bank, and by the way, 
don't let your kids fool you: Experience counts. It counts for a lot which is why the neuroscientists consider it one of the three components of wisdom. Number one is crystallized intelligence, number two is creative intelligence and the third is social and emotional intelligence. Now we saw earlier in the program with the story of dr. Shep nuland beginning to write in midlife and we'll see more examples of this that creative intelligence can emerge it seems suddenly in midlife. And the neuroscientists now think that what happens is that the brain begins to work in a way it never worked before. That the left side and the right side of the brain begin to coordinate. They call it bilateralization. So I want to bring this all together. I want to show you the story of wisdom kicking in during a severe midlife career crisis. This is the story of a remarkable woman by the name of marion rosen. 
[Music] 
rosen: ...Do the things that are essential... 
Walton: When I first met marion rosen she was 91 years old and still very much in charge. She had difficulty moving but no trouble whatsoever telling others how to do so. 
Rosen: Bend the knee when you do that. Bend and back? Bend the knee and backwards, too. And it's very important for us that every movement counts, because we really want to loosen up all the joints in our body. 
Walton: Here was the woman who after seeing her career crash in her mid 50's, gave birth to a pioneering brand of therapy, a method admired by physicians, psychologists and thousands of practitioners worldwide. 

[00:42:45]


Morgan: It was just something about the way she spoke about people, about how she worked with people, about reaching what's deep inside and what's... What's being covered over or hidden? 
Rosen: Now it goes quite a bit down. That's good. I feel here is the holding. 
Walton: It was here especially in private body work sessions like this one that people felt marion's seemingly magical touch. 
Webb: Marion rosen was very adept at body reading and sort of seeing what the attitudes were that the body shows. Is it all right if I take the sheet back? 
Walton: Body reading, that sounds like twilight zone stuff, but you don't mean it that way? 
Webb: I don't really mean it that way, although it has, i mean, marion had it developed I think to such a level that it can feel like that sometimes. 
Rosen: There's something at work that is way beyond me. 
Walton: That she would one day build a global network of rosen method practitioners was the last thing marion expected when her career as a mayo clinic trained physical therapist collapsed. During my visit to marion's home several years before her death at age 97 she told me the story of her midlife reinvention. 
Rosen: I was about 55 and I was a physical therapist and people were not very interested anymore in physical therapy and doctors who had sent us people had retired or died and so I thought I would just wait out 'til I got social security and sit down and wait 'til I die. This is what I had thought would happen. 
Walton: Marion's pessimism about the future was understandable. Earlier in life she'd learned a lot about loss. As a jewish teenager in pre-war germany she was banned from movie theaters, restaurants, and college. Former friends, including a special boy, turned their backs on her. In the dark times ahead, however, there was one silver lining. During her 20's, before marion emigrated to the united states, she worked for two years as an apprentice in the munich office of a body worker named lucy heyer and her husband gustav, a psychoanalyst. So that's where the psychotherapy and the body 

[00:45:19]


therapy came togetherwebb: Yes. And marion was not a psychotherapist but she was trained by, you know, the wife of a colleague of jung's and so she was very much a part of that milieu. 
Walton: Over her three decade career treating patients in the san francisco area, marion frequently applied her unorthodox fascination with the mind, body connection. But only privately and quietly so as not to jeopardize her credentials as a mainstream professional. It was after her pipeline of new clients shut down that 22-year-old sara webb suddenly appeared. 
Webb: I remember my mother sort of feeling sorry for marion rosen. She seemed so meek and shy at that point, so you know, it really is a transformation that she evinced in her development after she was, you know, mid 50's. I mean, 'cause that totally changed. 
Walton: The transformation began when sara asked marion to teach her some of marion's special knowledge. 
Webb: She actually felt originally like she couldn't speak in front of people when she was asked to teach. You know, she didn't have the confidence in her abilities. 
Walton: Ultimately marion reconsidered and during her late 50's and early 60's, while training sara and others, she began to view herself in a different light. Marion began to see that her brain was designed to support her reinvention, that she knew and understood things, was able to create ideas and methods and she could relate to people in ways she never had before. 
Rosen: You can say, no, I can't teach. No, I can't do that. Or you can say, well, I haven't tried. I haven't done that before. And so I'm doing that, all that time. When people want me to give lectures in front hundred or two hundred or three hundred people, wow, I can't speak in front of people. Yes, I can. I just have to open my mouth. 

[00:47:26]


Walton: And what I took away from this is that skills and abilities and knowledge and knowhow that she didn't know that she had, or maybe that she didn't have, suddenly started to manifest. Is that what you saw? 
Sara: That is what I saw, the truth about marion is she kept developing always. She never, she always got better. She was passionate and she felt like, and she had a mission, i would say, which was to, youknow, help people. 
Walton: Coming up next, making a difference in life's second half. How paying it forward to future generations can pay you back in long-term health and happiness. Please stay with us. [Applause and music] studio with mark walton, author, journalist, re-inventor and host of boundless potential. I love the term boundless. Mark, thank you for being with us. And thank you for sharing in these amazingly inspirational stories, like marion rosen. 
Mark: Fabulous story. Just an ah absolutely remarkable woman. And as we shared in the program she just passed away earlier this year, but what she left behind is just astounding, a road map to reinvention and life's second half. Not only reinventing ourselves, but making a difference in other people's lives. 
Babette: Amazing. And mark is here to talk more about his work but we are here to give you the opportunity to help support this station. Please join others in our community by calling the number on your screen. And when you do, you will receive the gifts that will bring mark's research and his wonderful storytelling into your home and into your life forever. And to learn more let's go to our friend rudy casillas. 
Rudy: Thanks, babette. We so often hear about traditional retirement. I have to tell you, I don't know many people who are ready to sit around or play golf everyday. Even those who have the means to do that really want something more. So, when you make that call of support to this station you can support yourself in your reinvention and support our efforts to continue doing good! When you call we will thank you by sending you the gifts that will help you begin your transformation. When you contribute at the $90 dollar level, you will receive a hardcover copy of the book "boundless potential: Transform your brain, unleash your talents, reinvent your work in midlife and beyond." This 262 page hardcover book explores the science of lifelong potential and explains how individuals at any stage of life can create work they love. It is an informative and inspiring read. When you support this station at the $150 dollar level, we will thank you with the book boundless potential, and the dvd of the program you have been watching boundless potential with mark walton." This dvd also contains an additional 20 minutes of extended interviews with best selling author shep nuland. And when you contribute at the $200 dollar amount, you will receive as our thank you, the complete boundless potential package, which includes the hardcover book, the dvd of the program with bonus material and most importantly you will also receive the blueprint for reinvention dvd, hosted by mark walton. This specially created personal coaching program will assist you to plan and launch your own reinvention through the step-by-step processes featured in the book and television show. Including valuable advice plus an action plan from reuters columnist mark miller, whose special area of expertise is financial security and success in life's new, longer second half. At whatever level you choose, we appreciate your support. So, please go to the phone and make that call now. And now, we go back to babette davidson and mark walton. 

[00:51:17]


Babette: Mark,hat is the one thing that you would want viewers to take away from this great program, boundless potential? 
Mark: You know what I learned in the last seven years is that we are capable of much more than we ever, ever thought until much, much later in life. 
Babette: That's exciting. Mark: It's unbelievable. 
Babette: Because a lot of people feel like they are absolutely stuck. 
Mark: We've been programmed to think that. And society has programmed us to think that. 
And it's absolutely untrue. Babette: That is amazing. I love putting a positive spin on all of these things, because you know so many of us have seen careers derailed and investments devastated by economic chaos. Some of us have even grown restless or burned out in our businesses or professions. Others are finding the so-called 'golden years' mind-numbingly boring. But you can use this program and mark's great advice to help you further explore your boundless potential! I love that concept. And for more about how you can create opportunity at this time 
in your life, here's rudy. Rudy: Thanks babette. When you show your support at the $90 dollar level, you'll receive the hardcover book boundless potential, by mark walton. When you call with your contribution at the $150 dollar level we will thank you with the book and a copy of boundless potential- the dvd with mark walton; the dvd, which also contains an additional 20 minutes of interviews with some of the reinvented men and women that mark introduces us to during the show.

[00:53:33]


Please make that call now. Babette: Thanks rudy. You know mark, I know so many people who would be interested in making a change -even in my own home, my husband- um but i think the biggest thing holding them back may be confusion about which way to turn in their work. And I know my husband always says it's the financial security later in life that's really, really critical. Um, you've got a lot of inspiration in the program, but is there something in the dvds that's going to address that? That would be my husband's #1 concern. 
Mark: Yeah. And he's right. I mean this isn't a pollyanna that we're suggesting here. In the bonus dvd is an interview with mark miller. I mean, briefly about mark miller. He's not a broker. He's reuters retirement columnist. But I think now you'd say he's reuters non-retirement 
columnist. Babette: (Laughs) mark: ...And what mark is so great at is he's able to take the specifics; I mean, how do you take social security? When do you take it? What about buying annuities? What about long-term care policies? Put that all in the mix of how we live and finance the new longer second hblf of life. 
Babette: Financial security is so important and you can help this pbs station maintain its financial security by calling the number on your screen right now. Mark, the other fascinating part of the last segment we saw, i love dr. Michael merzenich. We, pbs viewers know him as the 'brain guy' from the brain fitness programs, but you talked to him about the brain in later life, specifically. 
Mark: And as it applies to uh our work and developing ourselves. And one of the things I knew about michael merzenich, eh one of the things I discovered in our conversation is that he and I were working on the same track. And he's doing the science and I'm doing sort of the case studies about it. What he said that mostly blew me away was, you know by working on things that matter to us we power up our brains. And he provided and we provide in the book and in the dvds tips and techniques about how to go about that. Eh in real life go about powering up our brains. 

[00:55:34]


Babette: I love that. We all need a little powering up of our brains. And the boundless potential package is just one of the thank- you gifts you'll receive to show our appreciation when you power up this station with your contribution. And to tell you more, here is rudy casillas. 
Rudy: Thanks babette. When you support this pbs station at the $90 dollar level, we will thank you with a copy of the boundless potential, by mark walton book. This book will help you not only evaluate what you want to do with the second half of your life, but also reveal ways you can discover your own fascinations, talents and potential. When you call with your contribution at the $150 dollar level, we will thank you with the book boundless potential and a dvd of the program you have been watching along with 20 minutes of bonus material. And with a contribution at the $200 dollar level, we will thank you with a complete boundless potential package. Included in this set is a dvd of the program you are watching plus bonus material, the hardcover book and the btueprint for reinvention dvd, hosted by mark walton. This specially created personal coaching program will help those in midlife and beyond, to build on their earlier successes and create a new kind of work that they can truly love. And in doing so, build a rich livelihood and legacy based on their full lifetime potential. It contains carefully designed 'take home' lessons for reflection, self-exploration and action. At whatever level you decide, we so appreciate your support. Please make that call now. 
Babette: We all know that the economy has changed and retirement, well, it's all but lost its meaning. Mark why is it so important that right now we understand how to re-invent ourselves? 
Mark: It, retiremnet is an anachronism at this point. It's a dinosaur. I mean, who can afford mentally or financially to retire? And even if you can, why would you want to anymore? So, that's why it's so important and we have so many opportunities. We find we have so many skills and talents and brain power that we're not aware of. Why not? 

[00:57:43]


Babette: I like that we're looking into the future with a positive attitude, that's important. And programs like this are important for all of us in midlife and beyond who have that uneasy feeling about "hanging it up." How many years do we have ahead of us? How will we spend our time? Playing golf, or tennis, shuffleboard, endlessly going on cruises? Well, I don't have the money for that. Wouldn't it be better to create a second half of life that has a positive impact, makes a genuine lasting difference to ourselves, our families, our communities, our planet? Well, that's exactly what the thank you gifts that we have created with boundless potential can help you do! 
[Music] one of the things I love about pbs is that these shows make a difference in your life. Thank you for bringing us another one just like that with boundless potential. We're going to the grand finale, mark. What's coming up? 
Mark: What's coming up is a look at the reality that paying it forward into future generations, what eric ericson the psychologist called being 'generative,' actually pays us back in long-term health and happiness. 
Babette: Well. You're certainly helping us with happiness when you pay it forward to this station. And if you've already made that call, thank you-thank you. And right now we're going back to boundless potential, with mark walton. 
Walton: Now, most of us in this room are old enough to remember there was a song in the 60's by sam cook. I will not sing it to you, but don't know much about history, don't know much of biology and yea, well, I never cared a whole lot about the ancient greeks of athens, you know plato and socrates and those folks? There were other people in the class around me like laura and nancy and debbie. I cared more about that. And you know, I understood about the greeks, I was forced to understand, that they invented modern mathematics, which is one of the things I held against them the most. 

[00:59:51]


[Audience laughs] and then I was forced to memorize, see if I can remember it, they invested science and logic and art and music and poetry and vaguely I came to understand that they were the inventors of western civilization. But I didn't know really know why I should care that much. I mean, what have they done for me lately? 
[Audience laughs] I mean, what was in it for me now? And then a couple of years ago as I did my research for boundless potential I found out what they had done for me. That in this little village in greece, called athens, 2500 years ago the greeks invented a formula for something I care very much about and I bet you do as well, a long, happy, healthy life. They called it a formula for eugeria which roughly translat into living happily ever after. When I first ran across this I took it and ran it by medical doctors that I know and by a top psychologist in the field of happiness and they never heard of it before. And now you have. Eugeria, e-u-g-e-r-i-a. Now, here's the thing about the greeks they didn't believe in retirement. They thought it was a complete waste of time. They saw no point in kicking back and just resting on our laurels. They believed that the ultimate happiness was lifelong development, continual reinvention of themselves and they believed that that should happen in the three main domains 
of our humanity: Body, mind and soul. Now, if you've noticed that in this program I've used a lot of I took it from the greeks. They called it the trilogy of persuasion or the trilogy of education. It was one of their methodologies. They believed that in order to develop a body that we should play and they played a lot. But wh they came inside and they went to work. They exercised their minds and all of the incredible developments and breakthroughs that I listed awhile ago if you add to that things like democracy, which they invented, and drama, which they invented, and modern medicine, hippocratic oath, which they invented, all of these breakthroughs, all that, all that wonderful list that they passed down to us, came from their continual invention and reinvention processes and thoughts and things they'd worked on previously. They were the world's first knowledge workers. But to what end? I mean, why this continual work, this continual development? To benefit the future, they said. This was the work of the soul which is the third part of the eugeria formula. Aristotle said it's the virtuous work of the soul. The greeks believe that in payingt forward to future generations, not only did future generations benefit, but we benefited as well in long term health and happiness. Is there any evidence that they're right? I mean, is there any record of it? Yea, and it's again something that hardly anybody knows about. The average life expectancy in ancient greece was about 28 years. On record the actual average lifespan of high achievers in athens was 70 plus. Plato lived to 80. Sophocles, the great playwright lived and worked to 90, and there are on record at least three high achievers in athens who lived past 100. We're talking about here in the 5th and 4th century bc. In this country today there are a whole lot of people who never heard of eugeria, but what I've discovered is that there are an increasing number of people who are essentially following this formula. They discovered that in paying it forward to future generations they benefit, they get paid back in long term health and happiness. So let's visit with a few of them. 

[01:04:24]


[Music] 
walton: This was gil garcetti before. This is gil after. Before gil was los angeles district attorney, head honcho of the lawyers who failed to convict oj simpson for murder. Soon after los angeles voters threw gil out of office at age 59. 
Garcetti: The day after my election loss I'm emotionally bruised obviously, wounded, angry, upset. 
Walton: Earlier in her life while raising a family rita spina earned a living as a clinical psychologist. When she finally got tired of that she started rummaging through the forests and junkyards of north carolina. 
Spina: When I left the work that I was doing as a psychologist there was a hole in my whole self. Because I really didn't know what I wanted to do and I'm a person who has to do. 
Walton: What both rita and gil did was travel the road to reinvention that we've followed throughout this program. Both discovered or rediscovered a personal fascination. Both turned this into a new career, unlocking talents they never knew they had, and something more, both gil and rita found a way to use their new work to pay it forward to positively influence the future. 
Garcetti: I still have a long time to live. And i, not just want to be able to contribute to my family, but I want to make a difference in this world. It could be just a small, tiny, tiny, tiny bit. 
Walton: Gil's transformation began six months after losing his high profile position. In downtown los angeles he looked up at the construction site of the new walt disney concert hall and watched as an iron worker crawled across a beam hundreds of feet in the sky. 

[01:06:28]


Garcetti: Almost at the top way over here and I said, "whoa! Look at this guy!" 
Walton: Gill pulled out the camera he'd always carried as district attorney. 
Garcetti: I wasn't thinking that I was going to become a professional photographer at any time. 
Walton: It was a hobby? Garcetti: It was a hobby. It was an intense hobby. But then things began to happen. 
Walton: Amazing things. At the urging of the iron workers, gil's photos were turned into a book. Not long after came solo exhibitions, rave reviews and high dollar offers. 
Garcetti: It was 180 degrees. They loved me as an artist. And that just changed it all. 
Walton: Then yet another shift in direction. While traveling with his wife in west africa gil was mesmerized by the beauty of the people there whose health and economies were impoverished by the lack of clean water to drink, cook or wash with. 
Garcetti: And the consequences of that, i mean, are really horrible consequences. When I saw that I said, wait a minute. There's plenty of safe water for everyone but it's underground. 
Walton: Gil set out to bring this issue and safe water to the surface. Leveraging his photographic talents back in the us he launched a new book, photo exhibitions and a fundraising campaign that generated money, enough of it to drill more than 170 underground wells in some of the world's poorest countries. 
Garcetti: We did this and now I'll be for the rest of my life talking about this issue, about safe water. 
Walton: In her mid 60's quite a different human issue came into view for former psychologist rita spina. It happened along highway 26 between portland and the oregon coast. 
Spina: As we were driving through the mountains I became aware that all of the trees had been taken down and in the most beautiful spaces there was nothing left except the stubs that were there. 

[01:08:35]


Walton: Returning to north carolina the experience stuck with her deeply. For no apparent reason rita started collecting natural debris in the forest behind her home, plus things that were manmade and thrown away. 
Walton: Where did this come from? What is it? 
Do you know? Spina: It's metal. Junk. 
Walton: Where'd you find it? Spina: In a junkyard. Of course. That's where I go all the time. 
Walton: What emerged next was a surprising new form of artwork soon to be purchased by collectors and exhibited throughout the state, yet some 20 years after her reinvention what mattered most to rita was the message within her medium, that wood and metal, nature and technology can peacefully coexist. Why? Why not just, you know, kick back and relax and not bother with anybody else? 
Spina: I think I've always been a person who wanted to give back. I've given something to somebody. It's not money, it's not a piece of something, it's... They're looking for something. They want something to touch them. And that's where I can touch them. 
Walton: Have you found that you've been paid back personally by the kind of work that you've been doing while paying it forward? 
Garcetti: Certainly with what I've been doing, with my photography, the answer is yes. And once I get into it I'm feeling good. You know, it's in my brain. I'm energized, I'm creative. 
Spina: It has brought me nothing but a great deal of pleasure and at this point in my life real success. 
Walton: Increasingly rita and gil are being joined by others who feel the same way. From his home base in san francisco mark freedman has studied hundreds of career reinventions in midlife and beyond. Since 2006 the nonprofit he founded, encore.Org, has presented the annual purpose prize for significant achievement by social entrepreneurs over the age of 60. They in mark's view are america's newest pioneers. 

[01:10:49]


Walton: The inventors of western civilization, the greeks of athens, said that paying it forward later in life actually pays us back. Have you found that when you've studied people in life's second half? 
Freedman: Well, you know, I believe in the short term from all the conversations I've had from the research we've done that there's an immediate payoff which is a reason to get up in the morning, to live a life that still matters, and I think that gets us to something that is more collective. What happens when a whole generation is finding itself through investing in the future? I think that could get america back to our big project which was always the immigrant dream, it was making things better for the future and I think that this group that's the first to really inhabit the boundless potential opportunity could get us back on track in that way. 
Walt: So we've nearly reached the end of our time together and we're left inside a question. What if we all realized our boundless potential in life's new second half? What if we reinvented not only ourselves but our future to make it a better place for us all? What if? What if? You know, that was the goal of this program, to begin leading you in that direction, but the next steps, the rest of the journey, is essentially up to you. Not a whole long time ago I heard a commencement speech by the irish nobel laureate seamus heaney at the university of north carolina at chapel hill. It was interesting because his job of course was to launch the young people into their new lives but as I looked around at the parents and the faculty members I saw how taken they were by his words. So much so that I actually wrote seamus heaney a letter in dublin and I said, "can I share some of wh you said in my program?" And surprisingly he wrote back and said he'd be delighted. Seamus heaney said this, "getting started, keeping going, getting started again. It seems to me this is the essential rhythm not only of achievement but of survival, never resting upon the oars of success or in the doldrums of disappointment but getting renewed and getting revived by some further transformation." He finished by saying, "you have reached a stepping stone in your life but the thing about stepping stones is you always have to find another one out ahead of you. Even if it's panicky in midstream, even if the last move did not succeed, the inner command says, move again, for the world where we make our tarry mark lies before us." So for everybody involved in inventing this program, thank you so very much for joining us. 

[01:14:00]

So please go to the phone and make that call now. Now back to babette davidson and mark walton. 

[01:17:06]


Babette: Thank you, rudy. Mark, as one of these people in this age in the second part of my life looking at making changes and there's so many of us out there, some of us feel a little bit stuck in a rut. How do your materials get us out of that rut and get us on the right road? 
Mark: You know, uh, I think the book itself is a recipe book with great meals inside of it. It's fascinating reading. The stories are inspirational and they give a sense of direction. What we've done with the dvds is go a cut deeper, so the dvds are like actually going to class. Especially, going to class in a re inventive process. So, you'll be able to live with them after you've read the book and go even deeper into your own questioning of yourself about where you should go next through using the dvds. 
Babette: When you've been talking to people, and you've gone all around the country, um and you've seen so many um problems in the economy, is it harder than ever for people to 
make these changes? Mark: No. You know, I think the real answer to that is, we really have very few choices about making these changes. The, uh, great recession has had such a big impact on all of us, that we're right up against making decisions. And the decision to reinvent oneself is almost unnatural now. So, it's not a problem I think as much an opportunity. 
Babette: That's a an incredibly positive message for us to hear. And you know we at this station believe strongly in the ability of television programming, just like boundless potential, not just to educate and, and entertain us, but also to inspire and change us. Well, here's how you can make a change by making that call. 
And here's rudy with more. Rudy: Thanks babette. This station is committed to making your life, and your friends' and families' lives better. It's that simple.

At whatever level you can give, we appreciate your support. Please make that call now. 

[01:20:28]


Babette: Thank you, rudy. Mark, you talk a great deal in the book about paying it forward. Which I think is a very inspirational comment. Uh, why is that so important for us to pay it forward? 
Mark: You know making a difference is what we're talking about here. And what we found is is that in making a difference, making a contribution later in life and by later i mean anytime from 50 on , we not only benefit future generations, but we get paid back in long term health and happiness. There's a science of this, a modern science, and it's fascinating. 
Babette: I have talked to so many people and everybody wants to make a difference in their life. And sometimes people get to the mid level and it's like a mid life crisis. And they say, "i didn't really do what i thought i was going to accomplish. 
Mark: Yeah babette: So, this gives you a second chance. 
Mark: Absolutely. And not only a second chance, there are third, fourth and fifth chances. We're gonna live a long, long time. And the opportunities there are absolutely enormous. As we see in the book and as we see in the program. 
Babette: I like that; a lot of opportunity. And when you call in and pay it forward for everyone in this community we have some great ways of saying thank you. And to give you the details on that, 
we go forward to rudy casillas. Rudy: Thank you babette. We know that television is a very powerful medium. When done properly, it has the capacity to entertain us, educate us, and change our lives for the better. And that is our mission here at pbs. But in order to keep fulfilling our mission, we need your support. If you find this all as interesting as i do, then please go to the phone right now and support this pbs station with your contribution. Mark has worked with us to develop this set of thank you gifts that will help you to take everything you are hearing in this show to a higher level. When you show your support at the $90 dollar level, you will receive a copy of the book boundless potential: Transform your brain, unleash your talents, reinvent your work in midlife and beyond. This entertaining, informative and empowering book delivers overwhelming evidence that we were never meant to downgrade our ambitions or goals, but to continually reinvent them. When you contribute at the $150 dollar level, we will thank you with the book boundless potential and the dvd of the program that you have been watching. It also contains an additional 20 minutes of extended interviews with some of the fabulous re inventors featured in the program, like gil garcetti, shep nuland and more! And finally, here's the big one for you! When you go all out for your community and this station and contribute at the $200 dollar level, we will send you the complete boundless potential package, which includes the hardcover book boundless potential, the dvd with bonus material, plus an additional dvd the blueprint for reinvention, hosted by mark walton.

The book, the dvd and the blueprint are all combined with carefully designed 'take home' lessons for reflection, self exploration and most importantly action. At whatever level you can give, your support is valued and deeply appreciated. 

[01:23:51]


Babette: We know you've enjoyed the program boundless potential. We've so enjoyed having mark walton in the studio with us. So much great information, but we hear that sometimes mark we're inspired but then we don't do anything with that inspiration. How can people use these materials to really move forward in their lives? 
Mark: There's so much more than inspiration in this package what we've designed in the dvds is a tool kit for transformation. How do you take the material here? How do you take the discoveries you've made and put them to work? 
Babette: There are so many people who will say, I really really want to make a change, but they don't know what to do. Don't you think this will kind of light a fire? 
Mark: It's designed that way it's not theory, it's real world. What we want people to be able to do is take this out into their lives, put it to work and change their lives. Reinvent their work. 
Babette: And a lot of people have misconceptions about retirement, and that kind of um end of life opportunity. Reinvention is the way to go. 
Mark: You know there are people who still are in love with the idea of kicking back. But what we found in our research and a lot of other people are finding is that more and more people will retire for a little while, be dissatisfied and then look for what the next thing is. So, you can use this at any stage, any stage, any step along the way. If you decide that you're tired of doing nothing, you're bored with doing nothing, you need to make more of a living, you wanna make a difference. This is the material that will work for you. 
Babette: Oh, mark thank you so much for bringing this wonderful program to pbs. Um, we are so glad that you've been here. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And if you have already called in to support this station, thank you thank you to you too! And if you haven't yet, pay it forward right now. I encourage you to make that call. And from all of us at the station, we could not do this without you. You create the boundless potential for this station with your call. Mark, again thank you for being here and sharing your program with pbs. Thank you for watching. And especially, thank you for calling! Captioning provided by santa fe productions

About yoga pants tomorrow. 
>> Brenda: Forget the fiscal cliff. Is the union clash with businesses a bigge threat to jobs? From protesting wal-mart on the busiest shoppings day of the year and targeting one frt busiest u.S. Airports on one of the busiest travel days of the year. We'll see big labor's travel play, a blow to a chance for anyone's recovery. Hi, everyone, I'm brenda buttner, this is bulls and bears, and here we go the bulls and bears, gary b smith, tobin smith, jonas max ferris along with jim la camp and steve murphy, welcome to everybody. Jim, growing union clashes with job creators, growing concerns about jobs? 
>> Absolutely. Look, every time you make it harder for an employer to hire somebody they're going to hire less people. We're already seeing it in the jobs numbers. Look, obamacare has already cost a tremendous amount of jobs and since the president was reelected and it became apparent that obamacare was coming back in, we've seen the layoffs accelerate and now the unions are trying to kick businesses at a time when businesses are hurting and at a time when they're uncertain about labor costs and this is going to take full-time jobs to part-time jobs, and it's going to mean the closing of plants, and factories and already met one right here, with the hostess twinky factory. 
>> Tobin that was 18,000 jobs, just forget about it, you look at the auto workers, the steel industry, airlines, you go down the list and unions fits for pensions and benefits, not just pay, have really taken down a lot of companies. 
>> Well, they have, but, i guess we're fortune in our overall economy, 150 million workers only now at about a 9 or 10% union total labor force, so, on relative basis we would be much better or worse time since 1980 whi we were opposed to 26, 27, in the states, intriguingly, the states are not right to work states where unions can force a company to, people to pay dues et cetera, those states are falling behind. The empirical evidence, the more these guys get power the less the jobs get created. 

[00:02:17]


>> Looking forward, not just now. We know that unions feel more empowered and their presidential candidate won the white house and union leaders saying they're going to congress and ask for easier ways for companies to become unionized. So, can we expect to see more of these plays against companies? 
>> Absolutely, for the exact reason you noted. Unions were obviously a big supporter of obama and the liberal agenda, and rightly so because they've worked nicely with each other, but as unions become bigger and bigger, bigger and the 9, 10% that toby said, it tends to work the opposite of what we want to see happen to jobs and unemployment. We want to see unemployment go down, but the whole point of unions is to raise wages, raise benefits. In order to do that, you need a smaller supply of something, not a larger supply of something. And unions want to have less jobs so they can have more of that benefits I just said, for each worker, so, it tends to work against full employment, as jim pointed out, you saw it in spades at hostess. Finally they got to the point, it broke the back of the company and now you have 18,000 jobs just gone. 
>> Brenda: Okay, steve, unions clashing with business, good or bad for jobs going forward? 
>> Look, clashing is not a great thing. Put it's the way that unions get their point across and the way they organize and having more of the work force unionized is a good thing for the economy not a bad thing. This is still 70% a consumer economy. People need money in their pockets in order to purchase things and drive the economy forward and right now, that's not happening because wages have gone down per capita dramatically over the last couple of generations, and also, look, a couple of other quick points. The strongest economy in the world have the highest level of unionization in northern europe and we far stronger-- 

[00:04:22]


>> I know that europe is the-- 
>> hold on, let's, I just want to get to jonas quickly. Jonas, do you think that unions are negotiating their way out of jobs? There's certainly room for unions at certain time, but is now that time? 
>> The time was about 35 years ago. Unfortunately, the way the global economy's changing, it's very difficult to negotiate anything as a union and that's why unionization rates in the private sector are shrinking and will continue to shrink. You can't fight the global markets, and difficult to negotiate the benefit packages people use today get 20, 30, 40 years ago, to ease he to move off shore and outsource. And it's a strange one, not the way you see a damage mostly to profits and also the economy. The state with the highest union rate is new york, a lower unemployment rate than north carolina and 2.9 versus 28% because the unions actually stopped in some cases that's not good for the economy and it keeps the unemployment artificially high and removes flexibility to the employer which can hurt the economy in the long run and again, you don't see it in the unemployment rate. 
>> Gary b, respond to that. 
>> Steve made an interesting point and he said, you know, our economy is much stronger and heavily unionized. And unions peaked, 40, 50 years ago and I think that the-- 
>> hold on, the strongest we've seen the economy though is in the mid to late 90's, primarily because the internet bubble, an industry in total technology that was one of the lease unionized industries, so I don't think there's a correlation in our country anyway, between high unionization and what the economy's been doing. 
>> Steve, response? 
>> Absolutely wrong, when workers make more, they buy more, you know what? Maybe some of these-- 
>> how are you defining-- 
>> hold on, hold on, guys. 

[00:06:24]


>> And saying the henry ford axiom, I want my workers to be able to buy the automobiles we're producing. 
>> Well, but the issue here is-- 
>> what if we go back to spartacus here, because, he had good ideas, too. 
>> And simple their wages-- 
>> we're talking about jobs and really, when workers are asking for more money, it may be that in time of uncertainty, in tough times, certainly, hires, employers may say we can't pay it, we've got to get rid of jobs. 
>> They already are, brenda, this is a dumb idea. For the unions to be flexing their muscles when there are so many people working part-time that would love full-time jobs and so many people out there that don't have jobs at all and now they're going to make things tougher for employers? That doesn't make sense at all. And jonas' points, in texas we're attracted businesses from new york and california because of the businesses were moving here because the labor costs are lower and-- 
>> taxes play a role in the unionization rate in my opinion, but-- 
>> but if you're looking at individual companies toby. 
>> I mean, the union jobs, i flew out to arizona on a union plane with union pilots. That's been there for 60, 70 years, those industries have shrunk and less planes, less workers, et cetera. 
>> I drove a rental car that was built by a company that's now two-thirds than it started out 30 years ago, so you can't make the case here in any shape or form that union labor and all the benefits and all the costs and all the inefficiency has anything to do with a stronger economy, factual. 
>> Brenda: That's got to be the last word, thanks, guys. Coming up, the white house putting out new rules for the president's health care law. Why the cavuto gang says it just puts the nanny state in your workplace. And that's at the bottom of the hour, but up here first, federal employees pleading with congress we've suffered the loss so leave our pay and benefits alone in the fiscal cliff costs. They've suffered more than private workers? We do the math, you decide. you? I heard you guys can ship ground for less than the ups store. That's right. I've learned the only way to get a holiday deal is to camp out. You know we've been open all night. Is this a trick to get my spot?

[ Male Announcer ] E PILL EACHMORNING. 24 Hours. Zero heartbur 
>> live from america's news headquarters, I'm heather childers. We're keeping a close eye on the middle east as violent protests erupt in egypt over president mohammed morsi's sweeping powers. Marches planned around the capital today. Accusing morsi of acting like a dictator and demanding he be thrown out of office. Just in week the obama administration praised morsi for his help in brokering a cease-fire between israel and hamas and 18 people injured after a gas fueled explosion ripped through a building in western massachusetts. This is now what's left. New video from right after the fire showing piles and piles of debris we're told the building was a strip club and nearby homes and businesses were damaged. And the witnesses say the explosion felt like a bomb had gone off. I'm heather childress, and now back to bulls and bears, and for the latest headlines, log on to foxnews.Com. 
>> Leave us alone, as the fiscal cliff nears a group representing more than two dozen federal employee unions telling congress not to touch their pay and benefits when it comes to any debt deal they say, quote, no other group has been asked to financially contribute the way they have. Gary b, you say what? 
>> Yeah, I don't understand that, brenda. From two perspectives, one, in life for like jobs, including the benefits and wages, government employees make out a lot better than their counterparts in the private sector, number one, discriminated against. Two, the unemployment rate for government workers is about half of what the unemployment rate is for the general population, it's about 4 1/2%, brenda, they've been doing fabulously on the back of the private sector, which has suffered. So, asking them to contribute a little bit more, I think, is quite fair. 

[00:13:35]


>> Well, steve, we have seen federal workers have a pay freeze and we have seen them contribute more to pensions to retirement plans. Have they done enough already? 
>> Well, they have done enough, but they're going to have to do more. But gary b is wrong. White collar federal workers don't do as well as their counterparts in the private sector, blue collar workers do, and we're talking over a trillion dollars here, we're talking in national crisis, something that can bring the country down, the world economy down, everybody is going to have to do more, it's true. They've had a head start, wages were frozen, but the federal workers as well as just about everybody who's touched by the federal budget is going to have to make big sacrifices. 
>> You have to include benefits when you're talking about pay, see, that's an important thing. But, you know, we talk about they had a pay freeze. There's millions of americans who have lost their pay. They've seen pay cuts, not just a freeze. Have the federal workers contributed that much more than private workers with such an unemployment? 
>> They've seen their pay disappear, they've lost their jobs and we haven't seen as many federal workers lose their jobs. Now, if you want to break down the numbers, it is true that maybe their salaries aren't higher for white collar workers, but their retirement plans are significantly better and they can retire earlier and have a much longer pension. Those pensions are largely absent from the private sector now so they do have a better deal and they have a lot more job security. So, yes, I think being that the hand that feeds them is suffering, then they need to be willing to take some more cuts and if you don't like it, then you can go on to the private sector, and leave that public sector job. 
>> Brenda: Well, jonas, is it fair to burden just taxpayers with tax increases or spending cuts or whatever? 
>> Not only is it not fair, it's not possible because there's so much wrong with the budget and the only way, this is the beauty of the cliff, it's kind of across the board, it needs to be across the board both on tax increases and spending cuts. And carving out groups that aren't going to get a tax increase on some level or the spending cuts that the government needs to do and sort of like the health care plan, the cadillac plans and we're going to get this and the then the unions got involved and then didn't get that thing. You can't do that. We've got too much of a budget gap and yeah, they took pay freezes, but in low inflation times, it's as hard to cut, as it sounds like. And your pay is frozen across the years. No, it's taxes across the boards and spending cuts across the board. 

[00:16:24]


>> Brenda: Toby, leave me alone, is that fair for the federal workers to say. 
>> Leave me alone is that we've been picking on them. To gary's point, if that's being picked on, throw in the briar patch at this point. That sounds like a nonsecter, and the good news is that the cost of the federal workers relative to the, you know, budget deficits and medicare, small enough it's somewhat of a side show. The idea that we're picking on themmen they're not getting the right deal, get out to the real world. 
>> Steve. 
>> Don't blame them, federal workers, this isn't their fault. Yes, they're going to have give more. And in favor of union representation and union representation say hey, leave us alone, it's good for them, but overall, everybody's going to have to give, everybody. 
>> Brenda: Gary b. 
>> Look, if it's the federal workers have it so bad, try to get a job in the federal sector, it's almost impossible these days, that's how bad it is. 
>> Brenda: But, jonas, there have been layoffs from the federal sectors as well. 
>> They haven't had as hard as states. States had to get their budgets going tighter before the federal government. The federal government now is only starting to address the workers so I think that the state workers are taking it harder than the federal workers and now the federal workers have to join the misery of the state workers in tightening budgets. 
>> Brenda: Tough times for everybody, thanks, guys. Most young americans hurling up the graduation caps and throwing in the towel on the american dream. Are they dead wrong? We report you decide.

>> Coming up nearly two-thirds of recent college graduates saying the american cream is dead. Are they right? Plus forget how w 

[00:21:35]


>> is the american dream dead? 63% of recent college graduates are saying just that. Toby you say they need to go back and take a history course, what do you mean? 
>> Not only a history course, but look at the dow jones, we've continually in the united states come through these cycles and part of learning in college is about the cycle that started in the 20's and the 30's and to world war ii and 9/11. And we have come back and we've been stronger because we as a people and the american dream have always been alive and that dream is really more than opportunity, hard work, and the ability to take a risk. And be rewarded for a risk. We have not taken those things out of our economy if you've been in school the last six or seven years, you may not be excited how it works. Let's look at history and history says we're going to be fine. 
>> Brenda: Gary b, a lot of the college graduates say uncertainty shall the fear of getting a job or losing a job and debt. Those are all good reasons to be pessimistic. 
>> Exactly. Brenda, look, I sincerely appreciate toby's optimism, but I'll just put myself in the shoes of my daughter who graduated about 18 months ago from college and what does she face? Can't find a job, I think she'll face persist sently high unemployment, she'll face having to service this huge deficit that we've rung up through higher taxes which we know are coming and she'll face in my opinion higher health care costs not lower health care costs and she probably will be very hard pressed to ever get a loan for a house now that we've clamped down pretty much on the whole mortgage industry. If she got a job that even qualified her for a loan. I see the american dream is not dead, but it is on life support at this moment I hate to tell you. 
>> Lucky she has a good dad. But jonas, is it not dying, but changing and maybe that's for the best? 
>> The american dream that these students are thinking of. The one with the gold watch and security, and own the house with the picket fence, that dream is gone with the pension, that work force is gone, but that's not really the measured american dream and tobin was getting into that. And the house with granite tops and in business, it's the best place, it's getting easier to start a business and raise capital than ever through our history, so, yes, the work force, bore heing money and getting a degree and walking into ibm and getting a pension and that's over and that's, sorry, but for people that started businesses, which is how america started it's the best it's ever been, and you can't be totally sad about it. 

[00:24:22]


>> Tough times, but we think before. Americans come through this, can't they? 
>> It's never been easy, you know? And I don't quite understand this younger generation from one perspective. You know, 40 years ago over 60% of high school students worked in the summer. Today it's 40%. Where is the hardship? You know, look, if you look-- 
>> if you look, that's not the case. 
>> For the summer? 
>> Ten years ago, look, let's get this microeconomically, gary b, I believe your daughter is going to be fine because she's going to work hard and education, and that's what it takes, and make it happen for yourself. 
>> I was going to-- quickly, jim, last word on this? 
>> Well, things are different than they were, even 25 yrs ago, 30 years ago when he graduated from college you could pretty much get a job going out of college and things are difference and the administration hasn't made it easier with the class warfare and one side always being vilified and angry at the other side, but americans will get through this, we made it through the civil war, we made it through two world wars and we're almost halfway-- 
>> 9/11, world war ii. 
>> We're going to-- 
>> and 20-year-old billionaires to get through it, it's great. 
>> And thanks guys and thanks to steve for joining us. 
>> My pleasure.

=======================================================

No job history. You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in. Where am i? Miami. You do whatever work comes your way. You rely on anyone who's still talking to you. A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... Should we shoot them? ...An old friend who's informing on you to the fbi... You know spies -- a bunch of little girls. ...Family, too... Is that your mom again? ...If you're desperate. Someone needs your help. Bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere. Covert operatives have a hard time dating. Even if you find someone who doesn't mind that you won't talk about your past or that you carry a concealed weapon, they usually want more than you're able to give. Fiona: You're late. What's that? I said, "you're late." Watch the step. I made you tuna with tahini -- your favorite. Good memory. Oh, no. No dossier at lunch. You have had your head buried in this thing every waking moment since you got it. Come on, fi, it's not every day fictional account of your whole life. Apparently, I sold secrets in lebanon, code-breaking technology in jordan. Who knew? I got to figure out my next move. I just can't believe it's the only thing on your mind these days. [ Sighs ] fi, I know we haven't talked about what happened the other night. It was -- well, you know what it was. But there's a reason why it didn't work before. [ Sighs ] we were in a war zone. This is miami, michael. 

[00:02:13]


Fi, beach is this way. Actually, I got a little errand to run first. It'll only take a second. What will? Bagging a bail jumper. I thought it'd be fun. You're a bounty hunter now, fi? Girl's got to eat. There's this bondsman. He gives me odd jobs. Fi! How often do I help you? All the time. Here's who we're looking for. thomas McKee. I got a tip about an hour ago he's staying at the victor. Fi, I have a feeling this guy is not gonna survive on the lam. Is it always this easy for you? Oh, hey, sorry. Uh, there's your guy. Whoa, whoa, whoa, who is that? Wayne ray, bounty hunter. I might have snaked a few of his collars. McKEE, Get on the ground! You take wayne, I'll take thomas. That doesn't seem fair. Ugh! Oh, dude! Dude! There you are. Please, please, I didn't do it. I'm innocent, I swear. Get in. Michael: Nice work. Where do we deliver him? We don't. He says he's innocent. He's coming home with us. 

[00:04:14]


Hi, I'm thomas. [ Engine turns over ] hey! I told you this would be fun. Hold it right there! Get back here! 

[00:06:37]


london, mahal? Look at all these. Bounty hunter. The point is to collect the bounty by turning him in. The job is what -- $4,000? He's offering us $8,000 just to clear his name, michael. Hear him out. Hey, you have been, like, everywhere. Yeah, I work a job, buy a snow globe. Some people say I'm sentimental. Michael: Tell us about your situation. Oh, right, yeah. I do liquor promotions for a bunch of the hotels on south beach. Now, I'm friends with a girl who night-managed the victor. A couple months ago, I'm making a delivery, and she shows me this, uh, you know, like, you pin on your, um, you know, what do you call the... A brooch? Right. They were holding it for a guest. 2 million bucks. She showed it to you. Why? Because it's worth 2 million bucks, man! I mean, it had a huge rock! I mean, this thing was just... Anyway, it gets stolen, and my friend gets fired for showing me the brooch, and the cops arrest me. For just looking at it? I'm guessing there's more than that. Yeah, I had an access card for the hotel office for late-night deliveries, and I lost it. And then I find out that somebody used it to rip off the brooch, and now everyone's looking at me like I'm some criminal mastermind or whatever. And you went back to the scene of the crime why? Investigating. [ Chuckles ] I was trying to find out who did it, you know? My trial was supposed to start yesterday, and my lawyer basically tells me, before we go in, that I'm gonna lose. I mean, I just -- I kind of freaked. I mean, I know that you're not supposed to skip court, but, man, I can't go to jail. I want to help him. Do it for me, michael. 

[00:08:39]


Okay. Between the cops and wayne and all the other bounty hunters, we're gonna have to stash him somewhere. Why can't you keep him here? You're okay with that -- another guy staying at my place? Yeah, it's fine by me. Okay, then, it's fine by me, too. [ Dialing ] yeah, sam, I need a favor. Diamonds? Fun. Buying or selling? Neither. Looking for a $2 million brooch. It's like a little spidey thing. Yeah, the one that got lifted from the victor two months ago. That's the one. You think it's on the market yet? Doubt it. A stone that big is easy to i.D. It's like selling a fingerprint. And if you cut it, the value plummets. It takes months to line up a buyer. So, who does that around here? Really only one guy in miami. Don't ask me for an intro, though. The guy shorted me on some hot rocks a few months back. It cost me a client. We had words. Give me a name. Mike will see to it the guy loses a few clients of his own. Name's cristo -- like madonna -- the whole one-name thing. Like charo. Sting. Fergie. Pel??. Spider-man. Liberace. Crap, I can't think of any more. Anyway, cristo's got this place on south beach, but good luck getting a meeting because he's, like, all high-end referrals. Well, you know mike. He's not gonna call to make an appointment. You're out of salsa. You okay? That looked like it hurt. 

[00:10:43]


Who are you? Let's not talk about me. Let's talk about what I want. I'm looking for a piece of jewelry -- 30 carats, platinum setting, spider-looking thing. Sound familiar? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, we got to do this the hard way. [ Whimpers ] selling stolen goods is all about discretion. You've got to be the kind of person who can keep your mouth shut... [ Dialing ] gerald? He sounds nice. Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? Shh! It's ringing. ...The kind of person who never, ever shares the numbers in their little black book. Hey, gerald, man. My name is paco. I'm buddies with your fence, cristo. Man, I'm in some legal trouble. Cristo said you could help me out. Can I stay on your -- that's rude. He hung up. [ Dialing ] maybe vincent will be nicer. No, no. I can do this all night. Stop. [ Beep ] I got a call about the brooch. The guy was an amateur. He thought you could sell a rock like that on the street. He got all pissed off when I said that he better hang onto it for at least six months. I told him I will look for a buyer, but he needed the cash quick. I think he's planning to move it in europe. What's his name? I don't know his real name. I got his phone number. That's all. Okay, good enough. I'll take it. Oh, and, by the way, I should mention, I went through your fridge while you were out. Do you know it's one of the most frequently used hiding places? Found this in the orange sherbet. [ Sighs ] I assume you're holding it for someone. I'll keep it until our job is finished. Until then, you keep your mouth shut about our little chat. Even the most careful spy leaves a trail that could get them burned. A patriot making illicit deals for his government looks a lot like a traitor making black-market sales for his wallet. Somebody upstairs gets the wrong idea, and suddenly you're burned and out of a job. Mike, piece of advice. Ladies like attention. They don't want to be second to a dossier -- not even a big one. 

[00:12:43]


Michael: You've been talkg to fi. If by "talking to fi," you mean "listening to fi," then, yeah. So, look, I got ahold of my contacts at the fbi, about the guy who put your little dossier together. Hah! They were not very helpful at all. They stuck me with the bill. Did you get anything? Everything I know about philip cowan, who works for the national security agency, fits right here on the back of the receipt. I'll read it for you. "He works counterintel for the nsa." That's it. That's all I got. Is there any way to reach him? Mike, you know these nsa guys. They're like ghosts. They got no phone number, no address, no nothing. Sorry I couldn't be more help. [ Sighs ] guess I'll have to find another way to get in touch with him. How's your jewel thing going? I could use some more help, actually. I need you to run down a phone number. It belongs to a jewel thief. Make you a deal. I'll talk to my cop buddies, you cover my little working lunch. [ Ball striking mitt ] you want one? They're awesome. Thomas is a hell of a cook. Playing catch? He's teaching me baseball. It's really nothing like cricket. Sam's checking up on the real thief, so thomas should be out of here soon enough. Oh, no rush. I like having him around. Thanks for suggesting it. I need a favor, fi. I need you to reach out to your black-market contacts -- the scarier, the better. Is this about the dossier? It's about the man who burned me. He's hard to reach. I need to recruit some help. How you gonna do it? I've been accused of being a major security risk. It's time I started acting like one. I know a few iranians who are coming into town. Let's avoid people who use "michael westen" and "jihad" in the same sentence. How about libyans? I hear there's a group here talking to some south american oil companies. See if you can set it up. Hey, mike. Hello. Ahh. 

[00:14:47]


Phone number you gave me belongs to lawrence henderson. Does he work at the hotel? Hah! I wouldn't say "work." He owns it. I mean, for now, at least. He bet big on the victor. Now he's got a cash-flow problem. So, if you do the math, it's a little screwy. He's got 2 million bucks for a brooch, but that's not gonna bail him out of his hole, but it might give him a year or two to turn things around. Cops ever look at him? No, they cleared him. He had an alibi and a fleet of lawyers to sell it. A few years back, he had a club in new orleans. It was hit by, I guess you'd call it, a very convenient fire. Almost killed a busboy. He got the hotel with the insurance money. Got a hell of a security setup. He's a little paranoid. Even paranoids have enemies, sam. You're living proof of that. What are you saying? Well, a little. I mean... We should go. The guy who owns the victor did this to me? I don't even know him. It's not personal. You handled the brooch. You had easy access. You're an easy fall guy. So, what now? I mean, can we go to the cops with that guy cristo? What do we tell them? I broke into his house information from him? Meanwhile, lawrence ditches the brooch, cristoenies everything, and the only guys that go to jail are you and me. It's fine. Hard or easy -- your choice. Take thomas out the back. No, I -- fi. Right. You? Can we talk? No, I'm done talking. [ Grunts ] watch your head. Oh, damn. When you're giving 5 inches and 100 pounds to a well-trained opponent, it helps to know the terrain better than he does. 

[00:16:48]


Oh! Ugh! That step is hard to see. I did the same thing earlier. Where'd they go? I can't tell you if you keep choking me. [ Glass breaks ] ugh! Italy was one of my favorites. Thank you.

With me, fi? My place isn't safe. We just left the world's largest bounty hunter knocked out on my front lawn. Guys, look, I don't want to cause problems. I can go stay at a motel or something. No, don't be silly. Cheap motels are the first place guys like wayne are gonna look for bail jumpers. Michael's fine having you here. Yeah. Well, you guys are the experts, I guess. Seriously, man, thanks. We'll figure this out, thomas. Tell him about the plan, michael. The plan. There's a plan? Oh, yeah, there's a plan. I'm gonna pose aa buyer, set up a sale, get lawrence to bring the brooch out into the open, then the cops will arrest him. And we will be celebrating your freedom by the end of the week. Hey, fi, can i... [ Sighs ] can we talk about the plan? Just... 

[00:21:21]


[ Sighs ] what are you doing? I'm not doing anything. We're working. No, this is different, and you know this is different. I didn't think we were in a relationship, michael. Do you want something to drink, thomas? Maybe a yogurt? Sam: Mixing romance and work is a bad idea. Veronica -- just the other day, she asked me if bullets came in different sizes. Isn't that the cutest thing you've ever heard? [ Sarcastically ] That is so adorable. Sam, you gonna help me on this? Yeah. When have I ever said no? Lawrence needs a buyer. That'll be me. You're the middleman. Cristo is setting up an appointment with you and lawrence. So, what's my cover i.D. -- a shady international business guy? Yeah, something like that. You're gonna take point on this deal. Oh, that means I got to shave and put on a suit. It's 90% humidity, and I got to come on all professional. And paranoid -- extremely security-conscious so he doesn't have to be. Veronica and I were gonna go to the keys, mike. Sam? Okay, okay, but I just got to go on record. I think this whole thing with fiona is unhealthy. You got to go through all this crap just to get some guy she picked up out of your place? Okay, I'll break out the suit. A good cover identity is a team effort. If you want to meet someone, it's a good idea to play a little hard to get. Put people between yourself and the target. Make them come to you. Yes, I'm looking for a mr. Henderson. Ah, thank you. Mr. Henderson? Charles finley. We spoke on the phone. It's good to meet you. Cristo said you were a good man. He -- he vouched for you. Listen, can I get you a drink -- some 20-year-old single malt? Thanks, but no. I -- I'm not a drinker. Look, I'll get right down

to business. I represent a group of clients who deal in merchandise that is bought and sold, let's just say, quietly. I understand that you have something we might be interested in. If I do business with a man, I have to meet with him face-to-face. I'm sorry, but that won't be possible. For obvious reasons, discretion is extremely important to us. It's important to me, too. If he would like to come to my home, that's fine. We could talk. [ Sighs ] otherwise... No guarantees, sir, but I'll try and make the arrangements. Good day. [ Cellphone rings ] hey, sam. How's it going? I got us a meeting for tomorrow. We'll talk later. My libyan just showed up. Fine, but, from now on, no cover I.D.s that involve turning down 20-year-old Scotch. Who are you? Well, hello to you, too. My name is michael westen. I heard you were in town. Just wanted to say hi. You're westen? I thought you would be taller. You can put the gun down. I just want to talk. With you? I've heard, people talk to you, sometimes they don't live so long. Well, that was then. Ask around. My situation has changed. My side isn't talking to me anymore, so that leaves you guys. Don't make up your mind right now. Do your homework. See what you think. I'm around. ...Are in their convertible at the gas station, 

[00:25:22]


[ door closes ] and she had her baby in the back. Am I interrupting something? Thomas made dinner. Yeah, to say thank you. I, uh, I did make some for you, mike, but, um... We ate it because it was so good. [ Both laugh ] how'd it go with sam? Great. The meeting is set with lawrence. If I can get him to bring the brooch out into the open, we can get him caught with it. So I might get to go home soon? Let's hope so. He's locked down pretty tight. He's either expecting an armored assault -- or he has something to protect. Mm-hmm. Unfortunately, we only have a few minutes. We have some importaortant meetings. Well, thank you for coming, mr. Uh... Smith. Smith? Yes. Typically, with this sort of deal, we like to keep things not so personal -- you understand? -- for security purposes. Normally, I do not like to do meetings in person, but for a piece like this, I was willing to make an exception. Well, the way I see it, you can't trust a man if you can't look him in the eye. Am I right? Of course you're right. Mr. Finley, you can wait right here. It's important that I stay -- charles, that's fine. Well, the least I can do is -- I'll take care of it. Something to drink, sir? Yeah, water will be just great. Thank you. [ Sighs ] so [sighs] how did you hear about me? I've worked with cristo before. And the people you've contacted in europe aren't being as discreet as you might like. Is that right? Word is out. None of my business, but I would sell quickly. It might not be long before somebody tries to take it off your hands 

[00:27:22]


without your consent, shall we say. Well, let me worry about that. That brooch isn't going anywhereoon. Oh, don't be pessimistic. Let me see what I can do to pry it loose. Brass tacks, then. The item is worth $2 million. I could give it to you for $1.75 million cash. For something I ve to cut up into little pieces? Hmm, no. 1.2 million is more than generous. Then let's call it $1.6 million and be done. Let me show you something. [ Sighs ] stolen from an armored truck over two years ago. I picked it up this morning for 50 cents on the dollar. Would you like to talk to cristo about it? 1.25 million. I'm being very generous offering $1.2 million. Fine. In cash -- small, used bills. Excellent. Of course, I'll need to see it first. Just because someone believes you are who you say you are doesn't mean he'll do what you want him to do. There it is. Cute. I'm serious. Mr. Smith, this brooch isn't coming out to play till you come back with the money in that little case of yours. Fine. We do the deal tomorrow, but not here. We have to take the diamonds out to an independent lab for authentication. We do it here, where I can control it, or it doesn't happen at all. I'm afraid an independent testing site is a deal breaker for me. Then I'm afraid we don't have a deal. Pity.

He thinks it's too risky to move the brooch now. What do we do? Convince him it's too risky to stay put. I already planted the idea that somebody might be trying to steal it. We need to back that up, push on his paranoia. 

[00:32:53]


I thought you said that his place was impossible to get into. It is -- between the security system, the guards, and the safe, we'd need a small army. We'll just have to make him think we've got a small army. This is turning into a full psych-op campaign. What are we talking about here? Psychological warfare. Give you an example. U.S. Used to broadcast stac to soviet listening posts, trying to get them to think it was some new kind of cipher. So they spent all kinds of rubles, basically trying to decode white noise. We need to convince the enemy we're stronger than we are. Yeah, except it takes forever. Mike, I was supposed to go car shopping with veronica. We're talking cadillacs, you know. You need to do it next week. We got a lot of work to do. You two scout it out. I got to get ready for the meeting. Clandestine meetings are never fun to arrange. It's a big part of the job for a covert operative, but it's never pleasant. Get in. Where's anwar? Whoa. [ Grunts ] [ sighs ] it's not so much the fear of death that bothers you. It's driving to the meet with a bag over your head. Sometimes they wash the bag. Sometimes they don't. [ Sighs ] you're really missing out on the miami beach scene, staying in a place like this. Have you checked out the beach hotels? They're surprisingly affordable in the off-season. Guys? Okay, you wanted to talk. Talk. You checked out my situation, I assume. Your own people turned on you? Yes. So what? Now you're working for us? [ Scoffs ] why should I believe this? Your government would like to know who attacked your gas-supply depot in ghadamis in 2002. I could supply that information. And why would you do this for us? The u.S. And libya have mutual enemies. 

[00:34:54]


This would be a win-win situation for everyone -- well, everyone except for the guys who blew up the gas-supply depot. Why don't I just make you tell me, then kill you? You could do that. The information might or might not check out -- torture is unreliable, as you know -- and then you'd have to deal with fiona, who put me in touch with you. More trouble than it's worth, trust me. All right. What do you want? I'm trying to reach out to the man who burned me -- nsa officer philip cowan. I just need you to mention him as a friend of yours when you know the americans are listening. A friend? And say what? I don't know. Have the head of your secret police send him a fruit basket. Be creative. He'll try to figure out what the hell is going on, and, in no time, he'll figure out it's me. [ Sighs ] we'll think about it. [ Fingers snap ] I love this part. You ready back there? Drive. [ Camera shutter clicks ] the thing about security is that the very things that protect you can be turned against you by someone who knows what he's doing. It's tough to compromise a well-thought-out security system, but making someonethink you can compromise it -- well, that's much easier. Take surveillance cameras, for example. You can disable one by shooting a laser at it and overloading the light-sensitive chip. Cheap, easy... 

[00:36:58]


...And exactly the sort of thing a sophisticated criminal gang with lots of resources would do. Leave around some telltale signs of surveillance, like cigarette butts, a forgotten camera-lens cap. And the more security there is, the more likely they are to think they've got a very serious problem. I've got something here. Even the security team itself can be an opportunity. The more employees you have, the more you have to worry about. Hello. Can I help you? Maybe. You work at the hendersons'. You're ted, right? Yeah, who are you? My name isn't important. We've been watching you. You look like you could use a little help. We'll be in touch. Deliver some vague threats and a few hundred bucks to a security guard. If he's honest, he'll tell his boss, who then wonders whowasn't so honest. For the cost of a nice dinner, you can get a whole security team canned. Here you go, rocky. Thank you. Mike, I got to tell you, this is more fun than I expected. I mean, I haven't done this sort of thing since -- gee, since there was an east germany. Glad you're enjoying yourself. So, how are things at home? A little strange. Fiona likes to test relationships with the emotional equivalent of artillery fire. Does she even want this guy? I don't know. I've never been able to figure her out. Well, I'm not one to tell you how to live your life. [ Cellphone rings ] hang on. Ah. It's our buddy lawrence. [ Clears throat ] charles finley here. Yes? Well, I'm not sure if the offer still stands, but I can talk to him. No guarantees, but I'll do my best. Bye-bye. How'd it go? Good. I think we got him whipped into a pretty good lather. He wants to meet you at the hotel. I'll let him stew for a bit. Call him back when I'm done 

[00:38:59]


with my slushie. Mr. Smith, it's good to see you. We can have our meeting in my office. I was about to leave town when charles called. I'm happy to talk, but my conditions haven't changed. We just have some issues with timing -- details. It's right this way. One of the dangers of any kind of psychological warfare is it can betoo effective and send the target into a paranoid tailspin. I have to thank you for telling me to check my security. We've had some problems at the house. Happens all the time in this business. Better safe than sorry. I agree entirely. That paranoia can be useful... Or deadly. At first, I thought it might be one of the europeans I was talking to about the brooch, trying to rip me off. And then I thought that didn't make sense. So I said, "it might be cristo." [ Door opens ] so I brought him in. [ Sighs ] 

[00:42:12]


l consideration ce" will return after these messages. Listen, whatever he told you, whatever you think -- he has said some very interesting things about you. [ Choking ] 5 pounds of pressure on his carotid artery, he'll bleed out in 20 seconds. Let him go. That's not all you have to worry about. I could crush his windpipe with the tie if I'm not careful. [ Choking ] oops. Back off. Back off. Back off! Next time, lawrence, go limp. It's really hard to drag a human shield. [ Alarm ringing ] Thomas: I mean, he really tried to kill you? It didn't get that far, but it was heading in that direction, yeah. I mean, 

[00:44:12]


w-what are you gonna do? I mean, h-he knows who you are. No, he just knows I'm not who I said I was -- a big difference. He still thinks we're gonna rip him off. He still thinks his security system is compromised. He's still got to move the brooch. And we've still got to get him busted. We just need to figure out where he's taking it. But how are we gonna do that? I've got some friends. There he is. Hey. How'd it go? You work your magic? Magic was made. You have something for me? Mm-hmm. Michael wanted you to know that that was compliments of cristo. Ooh. Tico, hit me. Bloody mary. Well...In that case, lawrence has accounts at five banks in the miami area. Only one with a safe-deposit operation is dade trust, downtown. Yeah, any good? You kidding? Best in miami. Thank you. If he's moving thahat brooch, he'll go there. Nice. What else can you tell me about dade trust? You buying lunch? I know, I know, get in. Can we do it without the head bag? I hate the head bag. So, this information you have, we are interested. And philip cowan? Arrangements are being made. That should give you what you need to find out who the team was that blew up your gas depot. Don't be gentle on them. They hurt a lot of innocent people. The security services in my country are not known for being gentle. Michael, if you ever want a job -- real work -- let us know. I'm flattered, but I've got someplace to be. 

[00:46:19]


The key to good security is good systems -- consistency -- but those very systems make you predictable. Where will you take your valuables? A bank you trust. How are you going to get there? With armed men in a big s.U.V. When will you go? When the bank is least crowded. All good procedure, all 100% predictable. Fi, they're on their way. That's two blocks down, sir. All right, then. Thank you. [ Cellphone rings ] yo? Michael: All set, Sam? I'm here. Good to go. Looks like they're taking the highway. They should be there in 5. I'll call it in. [ Sighs ] yes, hello. Is this the police? Listen, I'd like to report a bank robbery. Yes, it's at dade trust, downtown. I'm inside the building. I can't talk loud. There were men in an S.U.V. with guns. Yes, they're here. Oh, my God. [ Breathing heavily ] I have to go. If you know someone's going to be at a bank at a particular time, it's not hard to make it look like they're robbing the bank. Shoot out a few video-surveillance cameras. [ Tires screech ] block off the street with a stolen car, like they're preparing an escape route. Fire up a spark-gap transmitter to kill the security radios at the bank, and they'll look like they know what they're doing. [ Static ] [ cellphone rings ] [ chuckles ] mr. Smith, you're too late. You sure? Check the top floor of the building behind you. Gun! 

[00:48:20]


[ Tires screeching ] You'll like prison, Lawrence. [ Indistinct shouting ] drop your weapon! They got a lot of cool security systems. Drop that weapon! Drop your weapon! [ Indistinct shouting ] this is a mistake. That's mine, that's mine. What have you got here? T-that's mine. That's mine! Quiet! Turn around! Ow. [ Sighs ] all thiso clear the name of an innocent man. That's noble. You should be proud. You know who I did this for, fi.

=======================================================

And cashin n. Namericans flooded the stores big labor holding big strikes with some of the shipping ports. They will block holiday gifts from making it under your tree and disrupt the important money making shopping season. Nwelcome to cashin in. We have wayne rogers and johnathon honic and joining us this holiday we have that as well welcome to all of you tracey, all of these actions in the port and west coast. You think it is it a threat to retailers. Christmas is it right around the corner. 
>> Retailers use the season to take the numbers from the red to the black. This is their bread and butter. Anything in the way could hurt them as a result hurt them and the jobs and economy. You can see what is happening with our twinkie and hostess and all . People who make them. They are out of the a job because of union workers who are demanding more. Be lucky you have a job right now. 
>> Wayne, if you look at thanksgiving to news years. And this is it super bowl for retailers for profits and unions know that and the timing is rough, don't you think? 
>> I don't see it that way. Timing is off. You have merchandise in the tore right now. You caint sell it for the holiday season. What happens on black friday and going forward into the christmas season. All of that merchandise has to be here. You have to ordered that months ago. These strikes are not hurting it hurts the walmart protest that could hurt shopping. Port authority in oakland not necessarily behaved. They are one of the mot notorous unions. 

[00:02:04]


>> And at the same time certainly labor has a right to have their voice and issues whether it is health care or pay. 
>> They are choosing america's holiday season to get their message across and get their employers on the spot. You think that turns the sentiment against the unions. Nit is not the best pr strategy. If I put my historian hat on here a bit. Work is more hexploited in tough times. It is it the rise of the unions and the port problem as it were. They were violating the california state laws. We are talking about the union and so far. This is it a problem. Njohnathon wayne mentioned the port of oakland and six percent of all u.S. Goods. That is the union's point to cause disruption and hurt the economy. And I tell you, they have every right to strike but the employers have the right to kick the ass to the curve. A job is a mutually agreeable trade. Employers offering a job and if they don't like hit the brickings. 
>> Do you think it is bad for the economy over all. We are in a fiscal cliff and rough waters here and now this to deal with? 
>> I think it could be bad for the economy. They have the merchandise and this is not going to affect thanksgiving shopping season and christmas most likely. But look at history. 1948 we had five million workers on strike and it crippled the economy. The taft hartley act brought back the boom. That is it breaking of the unions and created the boom that eisenhower had. If these union heads go forward. This could hurt the economy. 

[00:04:18]


>> Tracey, you made the point about the retailers, it could hurt the consumer spending as well the economy needs that right now. And economist looking to the holiday shopping season to get big numbers out. 
>> Cheril, I am a last minute shopper and I disagree that they have everything in for the season. Stuff comes in down to the wire in so many small businesses if you don't have what I am looking for when i generally get out there, I am not buying it that hurts the over all economy. And look. At the unions what are you doing? People are dying for jobs and you are basic lie treating it like you throw it away. Nand why the only place they are growing in the municipal. Private sector learned from steel workers and airlines and education and pier point twinkies as well >> I am curious. What do you think. Talk and it is it fine with just the accent. We are seeing a sea ship. 
>> Two sides to every story and there has to be shared sacrifice. And as far as hostess. Management didn't keep up with the times and taking huge bonus when their company was bankrupt and there are two sides to every story and everybody is in it together. 
>> Timing is it the problem. 
>> It is it a shared sacrifice between a employery and employee. It is it a shared trade. Ther pushing wage levels up to unsustainable and leaves in hostess it can lose all jobs and can happen in the port. Too. Ngoods that are shipped through the crucial ports on the west coast. We are talking about the holiday season right now. If we still see the organized labor disruption continue in 2013? 

[00:06:24]


>> It could. That part is true going forward. With all due respect, tracey. Yoining any merchant has not ordered all of his stuff and taken deliver I by that stuff now. If you wait until the last minute to shop you are not getting it not because it was not shipped or in the store. That is it because someone else bought it it is it already there. If you have any since at all and we run some. We ordered all of that stuff and it is it all done you come back to the part about the unions. I am disappointed that we didn't discuss more about the twinkie situation . That mexican firm bimbo is going to buy it. 
>> And we are trying to discourage john than from eating on the show. 
>> He can weigh 130 pounds. Let him eat all he wants. 
>> John, you get the last word on all of this. The next month is crucial for the retailers. Big, big it is it their super bowl. 
>> We want to look at the average union worker who carries his lunch pail. He deserves the benefits. The problem is the unioned has. A reason from 40 percent in the 50s to single digits right now, because they ever inive and contrary to business and i believe they are crooked as the politicians who gave them too many benefits >> shopping for sturgery in the country. More workers telling them to pack up and taking a trip for medical operations. This out of the line? over choices of Green Giant vegetables it's easy to eat like a giant... ?????? ?????? and feel like a Green Giant. ?????? ?????? Ho Ho Ho ?????? Green Giant ?????? Medicare?

[00:11:24]


>> they have the baby. It is delivering babies. And it is hip replacementings. And that is for everybody yeah? 
>> I think it is it a terrific idea. For example the california state employee's union. They went to shop a hip replacement and they got $15000 to $150,000 they put a limit of $30,000 and all of the helps come back in and said yes, we'll do it for that price. That tells you competition in a free market system works bringing down prices and de do dimunition in service. More we medical care in all kinds of ways, better prices we get and better than obama care. 
>> But john, I am curious what you think about they go out and search around. And it is it it is 100 percent. And there is no reason. And thyself guys need to have pencil and ledger system in the computer world. They need to be transparent. It is complications . And let me and you and that is it a version of health care over seas. You think we can fix the problems we have here in this country? 

[00:13:37]


>> It might be. This is the greatest country in the world. You hope you get health care on your door step. It costs every american $8000 a year. That is two can half more than other industrialized nations. Doubles pay double what everybody else pays for drugs. Lower the health care costs. But travel, people don't want to travel away from their family it is it heartbreaking. 
>> At the same time a major american company. Krogre for example. It is cheaper if you go to the state next door. But they are paying for the employees. 
>> And people will drive to the state next door to buy a car or booze but not get a hip replace tomit save 20,000. Of course they would. You shop for sweaters and automobiles and why not hip replacement. We don't have the free market in health care and that's why we can't get it on our door step and obama care pushes us away from the free market. 
>> And shopping can be beneficial for consumers. Their out of pocket costs can be high. And if they are going to save 10 grand they will do it. 
>> It is part process. And people do it for plastic surgery and things that are not covered, people are stingy with their own dollars. And that's what will make it. 
>> It goes down in price. 
>> If I have to dig in my pocket every time I need a procedure, I think twice of how much I pay. If I presume someone else is covering it I don't care. 
>> Now we know how johnathon looks as good as he does. Wayne, what do you make of this? 

[00:15:38]


>> You think we'll see it continue not just with kroger. 
>> It is going on for sometime. People are flying to india tolet caribbean and various place us to get a procedure because it was done well and cheaper. And so it can happen here. We need a free market system with competition to prove that, that's all. 
>> It seems like that is one thing we do differently here than other countris and that is having more competition. Tort reform not so much. But competition. 
>> I come from a count reap where the country is the government who are forcing all of the prices down. You need competition. Fundmentally americans are paying too much and they are suffering. 
>> Go out in new york and shop a knee replacement. You will find the bill all over the charts is no transparency in the hospital. You force them to be transparent. 
>> Still doctors out there to beef up want bill to cover other costs including malpractice insurance. Which is why we need tort reform. 
>> And you are telling me aspirin doesn't cost ever upon you? Buy a home in america you can get automatic citizenship. We debate and you decide. We'll look at the impact morsi's decision is having on ejust a minute. Larry hagman who created one of the supreme vill yannels. Jr ewing of dallas fame died from complications from cancer. Hagman gained fame on I dream of genie and earned the greatest fame as jr so far holiday sales are good and thanksgiving day start was a big success. We'll crunch the numbers and steve forbes rejoins us and the fiscal cliff looms large and country star ricky skags. Stay with us. . 

[00:21:39]


>> Just as we are getting signs that housing is turning around. Another nation showing us how it turns off. Spain offering foreigners permanent citizenship. Will this help america's housing market do you think? 
>> It should be residency and not citizenship. We had seven million immigrants coming to this country and buying homes and shopping in target and we have a hugely beneficial imact on the economy and attract the right kind of immigrants and want to work here and every immigrant has a right to come here. It is free to buy home as well. 
>> Oh, my god. Mexican drug lords with gobs of cash can buy and we give them citizenship. It is crazy. It is totally crazy it takes more than money to be citizen of the united states of america. It is it a privilege and not just something for people with cash. 
>> I didn't see that one coming. 
>> Fox news alert. I agree with johnathon. I am not sure this ever. Trust me, it is really, really hard to be here in the greatest country in the world. But it does put job creators off who could do. London we are kind half of large properties are bought by foreigners and it adds 25 billion to the london economy. And that can be shift tod places in the uk that are not fortunate. It would help the american necessary my view. 
>> I can understand why spain did no one is buying homes and we have high unemployment in the u.S.. 
>> I agree with johnathon and you tend to agree with smart people I am not sure what tracey has against drug lords. 
>> I am an immigrant. 
>> This country was built on immigration. It should not be doubled but multiplied by 100. 

[00:23:45]


>> And that's what I am doing. Tracey, I grateagree with what you are saying. If we are relying on foreigners to tanglewood resort properties incorporation up our housing market, we are in a basket here. We need jobs and an economy that is booming and housing market takes care of itself. Bringing in foreigners that are rich and that is a separate issue. 
>> That would bring monep in the united states and those foreigners would create jobs here? 
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah. But john is right. You can't confuse immigration with housing. I mean that is crazy. You mix tup. Housing has its own problems and ours is cured all of the time. We are better off. And sphain has a differentization england with all due respect. People running aught of france because of the tax policies that are -- buying real estate in england excuse, I thought I was talking, I am sorry. And I think, I think that you can't confuse the twompt john is right. Put housing policy in one thing and there is it a difference between residency and citizenship. And to buy a house and be a resident is a different thing than citizenship those rules are different in every nation. 
>> We'll take a break. We want to thank imogen. 
>> Thank you for having me. 
>> One stock that keeps on climbing even if we fall off the fiscal cliff and go back in recession. That's right. I've learned the only way to get a holiday deal is to camp out. You know we've been open all night. Is this a trick to get my spot?

=======================================================

>>> Evan ston, 13 miles knot of downtown chicago, home to northwestern university and multimillion dollar mansions. An idyllic north shore suburb. 
>> Police, search warrant. Police search warrant. Compromise, compromise, compromise! 
>> Until you look closely. 
>> Got a guy right there, right there. 
>> When I get the [ bleep ] out of here, y'all know what time it is. 
>> It's d-day for sergeant ohlander and the cook county sheriff's police. Together with the evanston pd they're rounding up two dozen mar cot ticks and weapons traffickers. 
>> Here we go, guys. 
>> They've spent the last five months building cases and they're about to net a very big fish. 
>> Go. Downstairs! Downstairs! Downstairs! Downstairs! Go! 
>> You ever work with the police before, or no? 
>> Here we go, guys. 
>> Let's go! Police search warrant! Downstairs! Downstairs! Downstairs! Downstairs! Let's go! 
>> I mean, whatever you fooind in here belongs to me. Whatever you find. 
>> Do you want us to tear the place up? 
>> I don't have anything in here. He said there was a scale with heroin in it. That's mine. If anything else you find in there, everything -- 

[00:02:02]


>> have anything else on you? 
>> Man, you can pat me down, too, man. I don't have anything on me. Nothing. 
>> Okay. We're going to tear the house up. 
>> For what? I just told you ain't nothing in there. 
>> Evanston police have been waiting to nab this target, an alleged heroin dealer for long time, but they couldn't do it by themselves, not in a criminal community this small. They needed an ace up their sleeve. 
>> We don't do much undercover with our own officers in town. It's almost impossible for us to get into the drug dealers because they know us, they know our names, they know our faces. So we have to bring in outside people. 
>> Known me a long time, right? 
>> Yep. 
>> Okay. 
>> So you know I'm not bull 
[ bleep ]. 
>> Okay. 
>> If I say there's not nothing in there. 
>> Know this guy here? 
>> And now their trump card. 
>> Not a good day for you, man. You know what I'msaying? You got a bad case coming towards you. You know what I'm saying? Do you know what I'm saying? That was a question. 
>> Oh, okay. I heard your question. 
>> Cool, cool. 
>> You know who that is? 
>> No. 
>> The look on his face was, I'm screwed. I love seeing the look. Right now he's thinking, at that moment he knew he sold this guy drugs and this guy's a cop because he's standing in front of him with all the gear on. We've got a video of the deal and everything. He knows. 
>> That's not all that olander and his fellow officers have on their target, they've seized enough illegal firepower from his house for a one man army. 
>> We have everything from a .50 cal desert eagle to a .9 millimeter sig. We've got springfield arms. 
>> At this point all he can do is help himself. You know? It's on him. 
>> We're just letting you know. 
>> I'm saying why would I want to talk to someone? 
>> A lot of dealers, they know the games. If they talk, they can lessen it or maybe even walk. We've had brothers give up brothers, their own family. This is the game. 

[00:04:10]


>> But even as police send the target and 35 other arrestees off to jail, they know they're only making a minor dent in a much larger problem. Evanston's gang presence has been growing and so has its murder rate. In 2010, homicides rose by 600%. 
>> Everybody has heard of evanston for northwestern university. Very cultural suburb. Beautiful suburb by the lakefront. Very seldom do you hear, go two or three blocks in, about the drug dealing. Heroin, crack, and all that. 
>> It's literally two blocks. 
>> It's right there. 
>> Evanston's proximity to other affluent northern suburbs makes it a central hub for drug sales north of chicago. Many customers are casual users, experiments with cocaine or heroin. And some pay the ultimate price. Heroin fatalities in outlying areas have more than doubled in two years. 
>> When a new strand of heroin comes into an area and they don't know how to cut it or the potency of it they put it on the street. These kids are naive, human guinea pigs. That's frustrating. They come in from one of he's affluent neighborhoods, goes to evanston to buy heroin, hearing it's something cool to try, and dies the first time. 
>> They begin planning another major operation with the evanston pd, this time they'll move higher up the food chain. 
>> Some of these guys, they don't sell from the houses. They learn that police buy from the house, they come and get a search warrant at their crib. Now they do their sales on the street. They're mobile. They feel a little more secure because they're mobile, they're moving, they're watching. What we'll do is make our buys from there. We adapt to them. 

[00:06:19]


>> Hey, anyone from evanston? Evanston? 71st? There's been a lot of shootings over there, man. 
>> Mayor daley knocks the projects down. Where do you think these guys are going to? Guys are making thousands of dollars, relocate to a different area and move out to evanston. This is my block, no, it's not. I'm going show you whose block it is. 
>> Evanston's not the only community battling an influx of gang activity from the city. It's a wide spread phenomenon fuelled in part by the closing of chicago's public housing projects. Now, gangs are sprawling into 88% of the suburbs throughout cook county. 
>> Chief of police asked me, how do you know you have a gang problem? I tell him, chief, I have this. I understand what this stuff means. I can't be a gang expert if i don't know what this means. 
>> One of the best places to track the chicago area's 70 plus gangs, estimated 100,000 gang members, is at the jail. Most detainees here are being held for trial as they've been charged but not convicted of crimes. Investigators with the criminal intelligence unit, or ciu, are assisting multiple police agencies at once, from the evanston pd to the chicago pd to the sheriff's police and sharing the latest gang intel. Recently investigators adrian sandoval and drake carpenter began hearing about a renewed battle on the streets between two long time rivals trksz lat the kings and maniac latin disciples. 
>> What are you? 
>> Maniac. 
>> It's hot over there. What kind of case do you have? 
>> My backup? A couple of misdemeanors. Resisting. 
>> Fighting with kings. 
>> Kings. 
>> What do they call you? 
>> The maniacs, they've been at war with a lot of other big gangs they've been at washing with the cobras, gangsters, the kings. One of the biggest, bloodiest wars were themselves, killing each other. 

[00:08:22]


>> You're recording so you can see my face. You know what I mean? Shoot me. 
>> The maniac latin disciples, OR MLDs, REPRESENT THE SECOND Largest latino street gang in chicago. FOUNDED IN THE 1960s, THEY GOT Their start in humboldt park on the city's northwest side and branched out from there. They now claim up to 3,000 members who must obey strict codes of conduct. Above all no, one is to cooperate with law enforcement. But sandoval and carpenter have seen gang members break that cardinal rule time and time again. They've personally recruited many informants from the maniac latin disciples, including this man whom we're calling poncho to protect his intity. Poncho's been in and out of jail several times. At one point sandoval helped him work out a plea bargain on a drug procession case. 
>> I was in a bad situation, and the man came and saved me. I owe him. 
>> Now that he's out he will call and let us know of certain murders, who did what, what it was about, was it retaliation. 
>> Poncho takes sandoval by surprise, however, when he brings a fellow member of his gang into the fold. They will be working alongside each other as paid informants 
>> he came to me and was like, hey, man, what's up? I know you're doing this because I see it. And me being the man that I am, I said, yeah, man, that's what I'm doing. And he was like, what, I want to help out, too. 
>> It is very questionable. Right now it's the beginning of helping each other out. We'll see when they have the first disagreement, how it turns out. 
>> Because this is about the decisions that I'm making. What we doing -- kos means kill on sight in latino gang slang. Both of these men are taking extra precautions like wearing disguises on camera for their safety. We're giving poncho's partner the nickname lefty to help conceal his identity. 

[00:10:37]


>> I would have go home, grab my family and leave. Take everything, go, just straight to the border, just disappear. 
>> It's a fine line that you cross, that once you cross you really can't come back. 
>> If I find out that somebody told on me, they wouldn't believe it. Not him. The maniac family is like a family because it's the neighborhood that you grew up in. All these guys know each other for years and years. 
>> But for all the gang's talk about loyalty, paranoia runs deep within their upper rinks, and for good reason. The ship is full of leaks. 
>> There's a lot of people talking, a lot of people working with the police. They know people are working. They don't know who. So they're like leery about everybody, you know? 
>> Poncho and lefty say that it's become a matter of self meer is investigation to play both sides of the fence. They also have another motive, money. Both offer to help sandoval and carpenter set up members of a drug ring on the city's west side. They could earn a percentage of any cash that police seize as a result of the sting operation. 
>> If I can make some money I'm going to do it because it's a job for me. 
>> Where is he at now, jay? 
>> Talking to a guy right now. 
>> Just to be that guy that is setting everybody up and nobody knows who you are is a rush in itself. When they feed off that. 
>> This can go sour real fast. 
>> Police, search warrant! Police, search warrant! Come to the door! Come to the door! I am probably going to the gas station ut once a month. Last time I was at a gas station was about...I would say... Two months ago. I very rarely put gas in my chevy volt. I go to the gas station such a small amount that I forget how to put gas in my car.

>>> we got the knowledge, we got the avenues, and we are going to open those up for these guys because it's going to be a long summer. 
>> Reporter: Summertime is traditionally the bloodiest and between two major gangs is already flaring up again. Ciu investigators adrian sandoval and drake carpenter have a pair of street informants from one of those s ready to go to work for them. 
>> It's good to have one of us guys on here. 
>> Besides acting as eyes and ears for law enforcement, these confidential sources have offered to set up a west side drug ring in return for money. We're calling them poncho and lefty for their protection. 
>> Who can get us to this block? 
>> Me. 
>> You could? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Number one kilo? 
>> Even though black and latino gangs occupy different territories in chicago, sometimes they'll work together if there's a financial opportunity. Poncho and lefty are giving up members of a black street gang they do business with. 
>> As a first ste sheriff's police are sending an undercover officer with poncho to bye heroin from the ring leader. Sandoval rides with one of four marked surveillance units while the deal goes down. 
>> Where is he at now, jay? 
>> He's talking to the guy right now. 
>> It's a good deal. He got 12. They're heading back to the meet spot. 

[00:17:34]


>> It went great. I introduced my friend to him, and he shook his hand. He gave his number, said call me whenever you need anything. You need to have a good friend when you're doing this. If you're nervous, paranoid, that's how things are going to come off. If you're relaxed, you know, you're doing good. 
>> With one successful buy under their belts, investigators blan to do many more with poncho's help in order to build a conspiracy case. But they want to send out his partner lefty next on an undercover buy before he gets any second thoughts. 
>> Right now there's only been one guy working. The other guy can still hold that against him. Obviously you can't always get along with somebody. It's pretty risky. We'll see. 
>> Everything hinges on the relationship between the two informants. And want matter of days, an unforeseen event will put that relationship to the test. 13 miles north of chicago another sheriff's police operation is in full swing in evanston. The north gang unit is helping the local pd put away its own raft of usual suspects. 
>> Did he have anything besides weed in the car? 
>> He just had the weed. That was it. But it was all bagged to sell. 
>> It was bagged up in nickels or dimes or whatever. 
>> All right. Sounds good. 
>> He said, curb. 
>> It will be a felony. 
>> For investior john rigio, fifth time in six years assisting his evanston counterparts. 
>> We know how they work and we know how they work. We can supply surveillance, undercovers. The bad guys haven't seen before. And that's why we're successful. 
>> Rigio himself often goes undercover playing a role to build trust with a variety of unsavory characters. 
>> Hey, t., What up, girl? It's junior. What's up? You going to be around today. 
>> One of his newest targets, an ecstasy dealer who sells pills named after candy. 

[00:19:37]


>> I'm looking at those skittles. Uh-huh. All right. Let me know what the paper is on that, too. All right. Cool. She asked me if I wanted a jar, which is 100. I said no, half a jar. The police buy 15 pills because that's all they have to buy. We buy 100 from her and hopefully get a search warrant. 
>> Hey, I was going to be up in the area a little bit. I was going to see if I could roll through. Kind of want to talk like they do. A lot of times when we debrief people when we arrest, just talking to them you'll know the terminology that they like to use. Call me back. All right. Probably count how many steps he's doing right now. He's probably on his 500th step. Yeah, he paces. Wear out a piece of the grass up there. 
>> Each time that rigio and his fellow officers lainch a new operation in evanston they face a shrewder more calculating adversary. 
>> We basically teach them how to do their job better so we need to adapt to that, as well. 
>> You have to think like them to a point. After doing this so many years I've had people tell me that I'm tarnished. My wife is a pharmaceutical rep. I go to their pears or a dinner, I can't relate to these people. After doing this job so long it's hard to relate to normal people. Then she says, are you sure you're not the police. I say, no I'm not the police. I wish I was, I would have a real job then. All right, cool. She counted it out. Good. Reached inside of her bra and pulled it out and hand it it to me. Oh, the better ones are the lighter ones. They're all good but those are a little bit better, they have the specks in them. 
>> Besides the dealer rigio was pursuing evanston pd are lining up 20 other targets with the help of informants. They'll make multiple drug buys from each of them in order to build the strongest cases. Eventually, they'll arrest them all in a massive sweep. 

[00:21:44]


>> That's why they call them skittles. All the happy flavors, I guess. 37 miles to the south in the suburb of marcum, members of the south gang unit face a more immediate mission at hand. Investigator matt jenna and his fellow officers are getting ready toxecute their fourth search warrant in the past week. There's never a dull moment in their neck of the woods with the greatest proliferation of street gangs anywhere in cook county outside of the inner city. 
>> Our car get. We did three controlled buys out of this residence. All crack cocaine. 
>> This guy is -- pretty much his whole family is locked up, so he will be joining them soon. 
>> Pull it down, pull it down, pull it down! Get on the ground! together, and these come together, one thing you can depend on is that these will come together. Delicious and wholesome. Some combinations were just meant to be. Tomato soup from campbell's. It's amazing what soup can do. 

[00:25:33]


>>> All right, guys. Thanks for everybody coming out. Our target, he is basically an order up guy. You call him up, let him know what you want. Nothing less than a 20. 
>> It's in the middle of a nonstop week for the cook county sheriff's south gang unit based in chicago's south suburbs. Investigator matt jenna is juggling five cases at once and has many more in the pipeline. 
>> We've arrested this guy seven times out of this apartment alone, seven times. Ten arrests in his background. 
>> On average, the sheriff's gang units serve ten search warrants for drugs and guns every month. Jenna and his colleagues are focused on places like robbins, harvey, and mid lothian. In fact, the south suburbs represent the single hottest focal point of gang activity outside of chicago city limits. 
>> There is gunfire, have a position to cover that you can move to. 
>> All right, guys. Let's gear up. Go outside and rehearse. 
>> Going to go and hit it and grab this guy. That guy sells a lot of crack cocaine and really yet to see any jail time. Hopefully this will be the nail in the coffin right here. 
>> All right. 
>> Here we go. 
>> Hands. 
>> Hands up. Hands up. 
>> Get down here. 
>> Pull it down, pull it down, pull it down. Get on the ground! I got him. Get on the ground! 
>> Police run into their target on the stairs by chance. 
>> Come to the door. Police, search warrant! 
>> Then, they hit his apartment. They find what they came looking for right in plain view. 
>> Pretty happy with what we recovered. Nice size amount of crack cocaine there. So I mean, that's a good hit right there. That's a real good hit. 
>> Remember me? 
>> Yeah, man. 
>> Yeah. I guess I caught you, huh? 
>> Based on how much activity they see, the sheriff's gang investigators find it hard to believe claims that crime is down in chicago as the city and some suburban police departments have reported. 

[00:27:37]


>> You know, there's that expression there's lies, around then there's statistics. Different towns have different ones that that t. Last thing they want to acknowledge is that they have a crime problem because it might impact property value. You're left with educated guesses based on activity. Be flabbergasted if they knew how little police departments actually talk to each other. 
>> One thing is for certain, as the city demolished more than 25,000 public housing units, gangs have migrated outward. They became part of an estimated 100,000 residents from cabrini green and other low-income sites forced to relocate during the past two decades. That's made a lasting impact on the communities to the south and to the north, including evanston. 1405, 101. 
>> Evanston is kind of a mini chicago. We have the diversity with the neighborhoods. We have $5 million houses on the lake and we have a lot of section 8 housing and poverty and pockets of bad areas, you know, within the good areas. 
>> Evanston police officers liz glenn and jimmy pilars are part of the joint operation with the sheriff's police. They say they know all the key drug dealers in town and have recruited informants to help bring them down. 
>> We do whatever it takes to get some good charges on these guys. 
>> There is a lot of drug activity right here. This l stop is only -- 
>> a hub. 
>> Yeah, the epicenter of this area. 
>> You'll see guys posted up he as either lookouts or, you know, whistling down the block. 
>> Or handing out business cards. 
>> That, too. 
>> We got this guy handing out business cards. This particular business card at one of the red line stations. And he actually gave it to one of my informants. His card says, 100 bags, call me first, which is bags of rock. Street slang for crack cocaine. According to the informant he had a whole stack of them and was handing them tout to the people at ttation. 

[00:29:52]


>> Today an undercover police officer will be buying product from the enterping young dealer. Six unmarked units roll out to set up surveillance outside the meet spot. 
>> The target's inside the subway sitting down looking at the street. Right underneath a $2.69 daily special sign. 
>> Coming around towards howard from ashland. 
>> There you go. 
>> Going to go down right next to us. 
>> All right. The target's in the backseat. 
>> Our target is still inside the vehicle. 
>> Getting out. The target just got out. He is walking. 
>> All right. Very good. 
>> It's a good deal. Good deal. On our way back to the meet spot. 
>> In an hour or two we're going to send undercover officer back in, saying the stuff was good and we will take six more. This guy is now -- 
>> nice. 
>> And counting his money walking away. On to the next one. 
>>> Next on "the squeeze" -- 
>> he shot the wrong people. 
>> The community is in uproar over it. The police are in an uproar over it. 
>> Maniacs are enemy number one. 
>> It's the turn of the tide. Anybody who is shooting kids, get ready because we're going to hit the whole ga. hard breathe, but with ADVAIR, I'm breathing better. So now I can be in the scene. ADVAIR is clinically proven to help significantly improve lung function. Unlike most COPD medications, ADVAIR contains both an anti-inflammatory and a long-acting bronchodilator working together to help improve your lung function all day. ADVAIR won't replace fast-acting inhalers for sudden symptoms and should not be used more than twice a day. People with COPD taking ADVAIR may have a higher chance of pneumonia.

>>> I'm melissa rehberger. Here's what's happening. Accidental fire broke out at a state department in washington today. Seriously injuring three people. According to the dc fire department it was out by the time they got there. 
>>> Protests continue in cairo after egypt's islamist president gave himself close to absolute power. 
>>> President obama and his two daughters did a little christmas shopping at a virginia book store today as part of small business saturday. We're told he bought 15 children's books. Back to "the squeeze." 
>>> Right there against the wall. 
>> Hey. 
>> I got a partner now. I don't care how many guys you interview, I don't think you're going to see this right here because it takes guts, man. 
>> One informant alone shoulders enough risk by working with authorities. But a team of two enormously ups the stakes as each entrusts his life with the other. Invest gatorade dran sand dl oval and this pair of informants whom we've been calling poncho and lefty just started an operation to nab the drug ring on the left side. Their plan takes a 180 degree turn, however, one week later. It's at this playground that gunfire erupts in avondale park on the northeast side. Bullets strike two little girls, a 7-year-old and 2-year-old, piercing one in the back and grazing the other in the head. Both survived their injuries, and police capture the alleged gunman, a maniac latin disciple who was trying to shoot at a gangland rival and missed.

>> This was an outrageous act. 
>> Chicago's new police superintendent declares war on the maine ak latin disciples. 
>> Their entire organization is going to be held accountable for the actions of one of them. 
>> It's a turn of the tide. Everybody knows we're not going to be playing. We're going to set an example. Anybody who is shooting kids, get ready because we're going to hit the whole gang. 
>> Poncho and lefty who belong to the gang now find themselves caught in the middle. Prior to the shooting they had helped sandoval map out the citywide hierarchy of the entire organization. 
>> So the governor, minister. 
>> Right. 
>> He will fall. 
>> Now, that information takes on a whole new relevance. 
>> How accurate is this? Is he the chief enforcer? 
>> They're well organized, obviously. It helps them and gs also hurts them. Have structure, somebody to answer to and dictate what's going to happen. If one of their main guys who is highly involved decides to help us out, it's so much easier to take everybody else down. 
>> Sandoval and his ciu colleague share the intel with chicago police who launch a mass I crackdown on the gang. Within two weeks of the shooting, the chicago pd arrests 120 maniac latin disciples, many of them on bis misdemeanor charges and outstanding warrants. 
>> When the cops come and sweep up the area, not only did you send a message at maniac latin disciples, you sent a message to all gangs citywide. 
>> Investigators go to meet with one of their informants lefty in the meantime. 
>> Everybody is scared right now. Superintendent of the chicago police, so he come after all maniac t latin disciples. Everybody heard him, so everybody's scared. 
>> Lefty claims the shooter acted alone without authorization from the gang. He had been fight with some latin kings, but now not only his own gang will defend him. 

[00:38:38]


>> Anybody out of their mind, especially shooting in the park. He's got to pay for it. He's popped. 
>> As the maniac latin disciples wait for the dust to settle, their drug sales dry up with all of the heat on their neighborhoods. They also expect their rivals, the latin kings, to reiate since they were the ied targets for the shooting. For both poncho and lefty, the stakes couldn't be higher. 
>> Because it just happened just like that. I was like, oh, my god. What did I get myself into. But then I said -- you could definitely have been caught with the sweep that's going down. You could be sitting behind bars. 
>> Investigators sand dl oval and carpenter decide to strike while the iron's hot. They want to use poncho and left you to take down a so-called nation house where the maniac latin disciples store their firearms. 
>> This is where they mostly all hang out. But this house is in charge of supplying all the guys out on the neighborhood with weapons, ammunition. 
>> They're going to have security probably front and back. So we're going ttestify it inially have to be prepared. 
>> Despite the risk, their informants agree to help. They idea fay one house in particular where the gang not only keeps guns but also sells narcotics. The next step, the sheriff's police will send an undercover officer there to buy drugs to get a search warrant. 
>> We're going to take out people in that beginning, hopefully from that point, you know, some of the violence will slow down. 
>> These guys are out there shooting people, so we can hurry up and get these guns off the street, that will be great. 
>>> Coming up on "the squeeze" -- 
>> I run his name out of texas and illinois, I got nothing. Like he doesn't exist.

>>> Even inside the jail, it's not acceptable. We don't accept guys who shoot or kill little kids. There's a lot of s with a lot of anger, a lot of animosity, who would love to beat up one of these guys who didn't follow the rules. 
>> In the wake of a gang-related shooting that wounded two little girls on chicago's northwest side, authorities are cracking down on the maniac latin disciples. As police saturate their neighborhoods they're sending more and more so-called maniacs to jail. The alleged shooter himself is being held here under tight security. 
>> This kid's in fear for his life. We have to care about him getting killed. His action caused everybody to get locked up. Now what? Now the maniacs from humboldt park might go and retaliate and send a message over there now that they have internal wars because of this kid effected our drug sale, now we have to go and send a message because of his action. 
>> You affiliated? Who do you ride with? 
>> Maniac. 
>> Man, what's going on with your guys, man? 
>> I don't know. 
>> Chicago police number one hit list right now. 
>> Hey, I know if I catch dude that shot the two little girls, I want to beat him up myself. That's crazy. 
>> That's not part of the game, right? 
>> No, you don't shoot into no open park, man. You shoot at the person, not an open park. 
>> When you talk to them you can listen to the truth. Other shootings are happening all over the city, nobody cares. It happened in two little girls in a nicer neighborhood, what happens? 
>> Chicago police, their objective is to catch us and arrest us. Our object I've as gang bankers or criminals is to get the hell away. They're doing their job. I'm doing mine. 24 miles south of chicago sergeant terry tabnd his team are playing the cat and mouse game today in towns full of gang activity. 

[00:46:16]


>> We get people call us directly in our office and say, you know, this person is selling drugs over here, this person was seen with a gun. Just different stuff a lot of times. We try and follow up on it every time we get a complaint. 
>> Several individuals -- 
>> going over to the lovely town of harvey. We got a couple of citizens complaints. Over in an area where a lot of vice lords are at. 
>> As tabb and his fellow officers roll through a hot block they make a traffic stop on a driver who is a little too eager to get away. 
>> In charge of obstruction right now. I'm giving you lawful orders. You want to start playing these games, I'll lock you up right now. 10-4, we got him now. I need to see his id, too. 
>> The house we just passed by that he just picked this guy up, is the house we're looking at. As far as the passenger, name, date of birth and nothing is coming back. I need to be able to identify who you are. 
>> I moved from texas. 
>> You can just look at them and see how nervous they are. You have to pay attention to things like that. You never know. Somebody might be ready to take off, somebody may be ready to pull a a. Gun out, somebody may be ready to do anything. 
>> He's shaking like a leaf. 
>> Huh sgluf see his chest? 
>> I run his name out of texas and illinois. I got absolutely nothing. Like he doesn't exist. All right. What's up with you? You never been arrested before in your life? What's your social? 
>> I don't know it by heart. 
>> You don't know it by heart? 
>> No, I don't know it by heart. 
>> You don't know his social. Nothing coming back. Something ain't right, man. Something ain't right. 
>> While matt jenna focuses on the passenger, isn't tabb makes a curious discovery on the truck's rear burcher. 
>> It's dripping up underneath. 
>> Yeah. Those do look like blood drops right there. 

[00:48:17]


>> Absolutely. 
>> Those right there do. 
>> I think he needs to come out and explain this. 
>> What were you hauling that was all red? 
>> All red? 
>> Yeah. Stuff that looks like blood all over your tailgate. We're going to have to look at his tailgate for sure. We have to make sure that there's no human being in there. Come on. 
>> You're going to detain me? 
>> Step out of the car. 
>> This guy right here, blood spatter, he -- his neck was shaking like yououldn't believe. 
>> You want to take my vehicle, take it. 
>> I don't want to take it. I want to make sure there's nobody in your tailgate. 
>> I'm not trying to be -- really upset right now. 
>> I'm having very simple. 
>> I can't be simple because I'm upset right now. You open my tailgate do whatever you want to do. 
>> Do you want to -- you want to go to jail? 
>> I'm telling you I'm upset. 
>> I'm just making sure there ain't nobody in here, man. 
>> You want to tell me what that red stuff is in the back of your truck? 
>> That's from ruby red mulch from lamar's? 
>> What is it? 
>> Ruby red mulch. 
>> That's mulch? 
>> There's no body in the truck but tabb and jenna discover that the passenger has a warrant for assault in illinois after he confesses his real name. Their records show that he's classified as armed and dangerous. They take him into custody and reluctantly let the driver go. 
>> This guy, he -- he's been around the block quite a few times. You can tell. He's the type person that like say you just want to dig a little bit further because he to dig a little bit further, because he seems like he was hiding something for sure. Maybe he thought we had something on him already. 
>> How many guys will they search? You know what I'm saying, so we have to figure out a way to get the warrant in by thursday. 
>> Time is of the essence for investigator adrian sandoval, whose plan to target the maniac latin disciples is in motion. They have agreed to take down a so-called nation house where the gang stores weapons and sells narcotics. Their access will enable the sheriff's police to make undercover drug buys at the house for the purpose of getting a search warrant. 

[00:50:42]


>> They see the strong hold to that block. 
>> This location is not just a hangout. 
>> Within a few days, investigators wrap up enough buys for a warrant. They want to hit the house fast before the maniac latin disciples, who are already feeling the heat, move their weapons elsewhere. 
>> Police, search warrant! Police search warrant!Ou can stay in and like something... ?????? ??????

>> Can you take a ride back? 
>> Police have declared war on the maniac latin disciples, following the shooting of two little girls who were bystanders, now, they have a chance to serve a warrant where the gang allegedly stashes guns and drugs.

>> Police clear the house within minutes, they find the attempt, an alleged maniac latin disciple and his family inside. They take him into custody and begin to search the premises, while the neighborhood watches. The last thing that investigators expect to happen, however, is to walk away with almost nothing. They find a misdemeanor amount of marijuana and some paraphernalia, but not the weapons that they had counted on. 
>> You got two options. Charge you, you go to court tomorrow. Or you work with the police. I know there was guns in your house at one time, because this was a nation stash house, okay?

But within the next week, you hand me two guns, this is how your case is going to go away. 
>> There was a lot of guys on that block so a lot of people seen him get hit and a lot of people seen him get let go. We'll see what happens. And he knows if he doesn't come through, I mean, it wouldn't be hard to catch him.

>> They have a bond right now, i mean the code of silence between them will be real strong.

=======================================================

An years. Ford heights is such a tight-knit community, they have that type of we're not telling anybody attitude here. 
>> He needs to be off the street and needs to be off the street now. 
>> From a manhunt in chicago's gang-ridden suburbs to a crystal meth lab in the gay community, cook county investigators are pursuing leads in two uniquely closed worlds. 
>> To be prevalent in the gay community, meth. 
>> It's huge, you know, up north, in boys town. We haven't even peaked into it. 
>> You ever work with the police before or no? 
>> When you work in the jail, you come across tons of cases. And for about the last year, anybody in cook county that's been housed here for methamphetamines, there's been a 90% chance that I've interviewed them at one point or another. 
>> But the meth was too strong for me. 
>> Was it really? 
>> It was too strong for me. 
>> Didn't like the high, huh? 
>> No. 
>> In the past decade chicago has witnessed the rise of a new and powerfully addictive drug, crystal methamphetamine. Meth-related arrests cut a i cross race and class lines, landing suspected users and dealers from all parts of the cities and suburbs in cook county jail. It's here that they join thousands of other detainees being held for trial. Most have been charged with crimes but not convicted. 

[00:02:17]


>> You guys got a lot of meth out by you? 
>> Criminal intelligence unit investigator mike davis is looking for the right detainees to help him understand the city's meth trafficking network. 
>> A lot of people that use meth, I would honestly say places like this actually save some of them but a lot of them don't even make it in here. You see the sores on their face, the rotted out teeth. I grew up in the crack era and this is different. This is a whole new ball game from crack. 
>> What's the difference? 
>> To me, it's more money. It's cheaper to make and people stay higher longer. 
>> It will last long. Gang bangers won't let you sell meth because it takes away from the crack dealers. 
>> But there's one market where the meth trade is thriving with no signs of letting up, the gay community. 
>> With meth around, all my boys that are homosexual, they got quick access to meth. 
>> It's huge up north in boys town. We haven't even peaked into it. The community itself is a closed door. 
>> Chicago's boys town neighborhood named for its gay friendly businesses and culture is located four miles north of downtown. It's also known for its bath houses and all-night club scenes where many patrons go to score meth to enhance their sex drive. 
>> They buy it faster than you can come into the city. You just party and use it and you get a group of people and smoke and smoke and smoke. It releases the serotonin levels in your brain which gives you a very euphoric high. It's a very sexual high. 
>> Davis and sheriff's police investigators are gaining a first-hand glimpse into a subculture that they know little about. This inmate, whom we're calling tango for his protection, comes from that world. 
>> He's got more meth busts than anybody I have ever come encounter with and he's looking for help on his case. He's going to be honest. He's got no choice but to be. 

[00:04:26]


>> If you've got a regular 9:00 to 5:00 job and somebody introduces you to it on a friday night, you do a little bit, it's so potent you stay awake the entire weekend. And now you got to go work. 
>> Don't you peak during that high? 
>> The whole thing is an entire peak. 
>> Is it comparable to heroin? 
>> No. If you drink ten cupses of coffee and your head starts to -- 
>> the caffeine rush. 
>> It's a constant like that. The longest I've ever stayed up was 19 days. 
>> Can you die? Can't you die? 19 days. 
>> And this was continuous every day use over and over and over every day? 
>> Yup. 
>> With his lengthy arrest record, tango faces up to 12 years in prison for drug possession and delivery charges if convicted. So he's hoping to strike a plea deal with the state's attorney by giving up his meth connections. It unchartered waters for investigators, who've never worked a case in boys town before. 
>> You notice he and i coordinated our shirts for this interview? Huge. We were planning all day for this interview. 
>> Any of the bars up and down walk in and get served cyst to meth at any time? 
>> If you know somebody. 
>> You just got to know where to look, huh? 
>> Yeah. If you walk into a boy up in boys town, if you ask somebody where can I find some street level -- 
>> is that the logo, trina? 
>> No, tina, female names. 
>> Meth to me is not something I've actually never dealt with before so I was interested in what he had to say. We're not dealing with a gang member. That's what we're focused on. We never turn down intel, whether it's gang related or not. We don't know where this is going to go. 35 miles south of the boys town neighborhood is an entirely different world where police answer shots fired calls on a weekly, sometimes daily basis. 

[00:06:47]


>> Yeah, is everything all right? 
[ Indiscernible ] 
>> there's shooting out there going on. You know they're looking for you guys. Just stay in the house, okay? There's a call now, a man with a gun. He's looking for this girl. 
>> There was a turf war last night over who is going to sell drugs in a certain location in ford heights. We have one of the guys in u. Custody right now. The other people that are looking to kill him now want to go after his girlfriend. 
>>> What happens next will trigger an all-out manhunt for a suspect terrorizing a community. 
>> We want to know where he's at so we can put him in handcuffs. Can you help us do that? 
>> Before somebody else gets SHOT.Woman ] TOO WEAK. Wears off. Been there. Tried that. Ladybug body milk? No thanks.

>>> we're on our way. If you see anything, you got my number. We will be out there all night. 
>> Far from the chicago that most people know is one of the poorest suburbs in the u.S. It's the village of ford heights. The cook county sheriff's police inherited all law enforcement duties here after budget problems shut down the local police force. Today they're searching for one particular gang member. He was last seen waving a gun at women and children on a neighborhood block. 
>> He was on a bicycle and pulled a gun. He got his crew with him. Face to face. I seen him holding a gun. I told him to watch out. The kids are there playing ball. He pointed at them but then when I say something, he pointed at me and took off that way. 
>> Wow. 
>> So happened I was sitting in the chair and the kids were shooting hoops. I was trying to keep them from getting shot and a little baby. I tripped over that brick. 
>> Are you all right? 
>> Yeah, my foot just swelling here, see? When I was trying to push my kids and my neighbor's kids. 
>> You did the right thing. He really can't run that far. The town is not that big. 
>> Somebody's always hiding him. 
>> Jenna and smith know the alleged gunman well. He's had multiple run-ins with police over the years. We'll call him booth to maintain his anonymity. Because he's affiliated with a gang, like so many other men in ford heights, most residents here won't turn him in. 
>> So many people out here are hiding him and won't nobody tell. 
>> Yesterday he was shooting off that gun on diplomats, just popping it off random until it jammed. Thankfully it jammed. 
>> I lost a child five years ago. I ain't got no time for this, no guns. 
>> I'm going to be back around and we'll be around tonight, okay? 

[00:13:22]


>> There's the guy we're looking for. 
>> He ain't haing out, I can tell you that. 
>> He's going to be hiding up somewhere. The craziest thing is all these people know each other. They all grew up together. They've known each other for generations, and they still have these type of beefs with each other. It's just unreal. 
>> LET ME SEE IDs ON EVERYBODY Else. 
>> Together with their fellow officers, jenna and smith begin turning up the heat on the area. They're hoping to catch a fresh lead on their suspect. 
>> Did my partner tell you what's going on? We're looking for [ bleep ]. Spread the word, okay? We're going to be out here until we find him. So spread the word. Thank you. 
>> Persistence pays off in this job. You stay on that guy damn long enough and you're going to get him. We're going to get him. 
>> Did you ever see the gay community getting away from meth? 
>> Absolutely not. 
>> No way, huh? 
>> No, you're just going heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier. 
>> What's the most you've ever seen? 
>> Meth? It looked like a big block of ice, 18, 20 inches long and they were just chipping it away. 
>> Investigator mike davis wants to infiltrate chicago's crystal meth traffic with the help of a cook county jail inmate. This confidential source, whom we're calling tango, is an admitted meth user and dealer. He's giving up his connections in return for consideration from prosecutorses. Boys town, a predominantly gay neighborhood on the north side also happens to be the city's leading hub of meth use. 

[00:15:33]


>> How many dealers would be say boys town has, off the top of your head? 50, 60. 
>> How many people do you think you could identify, like if i were to give you pictures? 
>> A lot. 
>> What about this one? 
>> He's full-time dealer. He does bike messenger. 
>> Who is this guy? 
>> Really nice guy. Does hair. He's a hair stylist. 
>> He's just pretty much supporting his own habit? 
>> Yeah. 
>> This guy. 
>> He's a drag queen. He sells regularly. That's perfect. What about this gentleman? 
>> Small time sales, prostitution. 
>> Do you think he's a good looking guy? 
>> Absolutely not. 
>> He's a cheap prostitute, huh? 
>> Very cheap. 
>> There's your main guy. 
>> This guy's a main guy? This is a triangle. All three of these guys get it from him. Right now he's the one wearing the crown. 
>> Is that what you refer to it as? Take your pick which one you want and we'll try to pick out a certain subject or certain two subjects, and we're going to go from there. 
>> I'll tell you what, you want to find an infestation of triggers and rollers, you go to the bath houses. Meth and sex are synonymous. So meth allows you to have sex with people you normally wouldn't have sex with because it just makes you really horny. 
>> So essentially you're sleeping with all your clients if you're a meth dear. 
>> A lot of times. Not me personally. 
>> No, no, I'm sure not you. 
>> For davis and the sriff's police, the next step is to start making undercover buys from the top dealers in boys town. Because tango's in jail, they'll need the help of his long-time boyfriend on the street to introduce them to the targets. Tango's boyfriend is a meth user as well, but he's less experienced with the drug trade and is getting cold feet so tango twists his arm in a last ditch plea. 

[00:17:34]


>> Listen, listen, they said they can even send in an officer with you that you can introduce and then he can take it from there. The quicker that you do something for them, the quicker they can go to the state's attorney and start working. You see what I'm saying? 
>> His partner's a pretty innocent kid. We asked his partner what was your gateway drug to meth? He's like there really wasn't a gateway. The guy in jail introduced me to the stuff. 
>> Can you try and set something like that up? Can you? Can you? Okay. When? All right. Love you. Bye. So, I mean, he's game. I'm game. And I'm going to push him to do it. 
>> However, as police take the operation to the next level, they worry that tango's partner might be in over his head. 
>> You feeling nervous or what? 
>> I'm just trying to be as natural as possible.

>>> You can go in and get a gram. They'll front the money so whatever's easiest. 
>> With chicago's crystal meth traffic on the rise, investigator mike davis has recruited an informant from the city's number one hub of meth use, the gay community. 
>> You can't just do this. You have to coordinate this through davis because they have to give you the money and know exactly when you're going in and coming out. 
>> But as long as this informant, whom we're calling tango, is in jail, he needs his boyfriend on the outside to set up targets for police. 
>> Yeah, we're on our way. All right. 
>> Four days later tango's partner comes through. He arranges a buy with a major dealer. Now davis and investigator dinas hernandez are headed to boys town to brief him before the deal goes down. Several undercover units will be joining them to conduct surveillance. 
>> You just got to go in there and do what he normally does when he does one of these purchases. There's nothing special he has to do. Just be normal. 
>> He's really nervous. He does not feel comfortable at all and the on reason he's doing it is because he cares about his partner. 
>> We'll have plenty of guys on the street in undercover vehicles. 
>> See him? 
>> Right there. 
>> That's him. 
>> Looking high and low. 
>> Walking up to you, right behind you, right shoulder. 
>> Honk your horn. Tell him to honk his horn. 
>> Hs so green. I'll meet you guys there. 
>> Investigators move to another location where they'll hash out a plan with tango's boyfriend. We're calling him cash to protect his identity. Cash has arranged to meet the target at a downtown hotel but is waiting for them to set a time. 

[00:24:12]


>> His prime target has not called him since lunch, but i know he's got multiple people he can do. It's just his preference is this one guy. 
>> Let's jump in. 
>> Is this something you've done in the past where you called him and then he doesn't get in touch with you until he's ready? 
>> That's how they do it with everybody. 
>> It's going to have to happen today. Do you want to try giving him a call or -- 
>> you a little nervous or what? 
>> I just want to reassure you, just do what you normally do. Nothing out of the ordinary. 
>> Absolutely not. 
>> Is it going to voicemail? 
>> I'll text him. 
>> Do you think he's at lunch, or what? 
>> The person he was having lunch with was his supplier so -- 
>> could he be reupped then? 
>> Could be, yes. 
>> We give him the indication we need something to happen today. We're not going to spend this kind of manpower coming out here multiple times. 
>> Trust me, nobody wants it to happen more than I do. 
>> I know. 
>> Meanwhile, on the far south end of cook county, the clock is ticking for investigators there as well. 35 miles from boys town, the sheriff's police are on the hunt for an armed gang member in ford heights. 
>> It looks like a ghost town. I'm going to head over to where jt is over there. 
>> Investigators conrad edged and zach smith are among those searching for the suspect we're calling booth to maintain his anonymity. He's wanted in connection in at least alleged three incidents in which he either threatened people with a gun or fired shots in a public area. 

[00:26:13]


>> He has a warrant for his arrest right now. Word's going to spread pretty quickly that he's a person of interest. If he's got any brain power left at all, he's going to try to change up his behavior patterns. 
>> He has a tendency to lie low at times and then he springs when you least expect it. 
>> So now every arrestee in ford heights, from traffic violators from drug offenders, is getting squeezed for information about booth. 
>> Do you know who I'm talking about? Do you know who I'm talking about? 
>> I know who you're talking about. 
>> You know what I'm ref to. 
>> You could really help yourself out if I find him today. 
>> But the code of silence here runs deep. Ford heights is a uniquely cl 
>> they have the parole status. Gray has a suspended -- 
>> men like booth are just one symptom of deeper rooted problems that have plagued ford heights for generations. In a community of roughly 3,000 residents, half live below poverty level. Job opportunities are few and far between, so the quickest fix for many here is to sell drugs. 
>> My whole life, 27 years I've been here. It's over, man. Ain't no jobs out here, nothing. It's slum, poverty. 
>> Nobody deals drugs because they like it. They deal because they make money. 
>> I'm 26 years old, I got three kids. I'm enjoying myself every day out here, doing me, just doing me. Every day. Y'all have a beautiful day. 
>> A lot of families have come to depend on it. They may have a 14-year-old son and the mother's got two or three kids and this 14-year-old son is bringing home $500 a week selling drugs. That's the only income that she has. 

[00:28:20]


>> Hey, jay, he's at the liquor store. He got braids and a red leather jacket. That's the guy that's run that spot. 
>> With drugs come gangs and three groups dominate in ford heights. The gangster disciples, the vice lords, and the four corner hustlers. They compete for territory within a two-square-mile area that's divided in half by a highway. The recent closing of 100 public housing units in the southern half has forced many of those residents to relocate north, including gang members. Among them, booth, a four corner hustler who is allegedly trying to move his drug sales into rival turf. 
>> In order to keep the profit up, they took a spot over here. These guys, they don't want to give that spot up. We had gunshots today and we had gunshots yesterday and it's going to continue. 
>> Everything was somewhat fine when the people over here stayed over here and the people over there stayed over there. But now you put them together and it's a recipe for disaster. 
>> Based on past experience, police know that booth enemies have a better chance of finding them first but it's often the law-abiding citizens that get caught in the middle and pay a price. 
>> I just hope that he doesn't hurt anybody else before we get ahold of him. swenson day. So, I'm happy. Sales go up... I'm happy. It went out today... I'm happy. What if she's not home?

>>> I'm melissa rehberger. Three people were seriously hurt after a fire broke out at the state department in washington this morning. Crews were apparently work flg a building at the time as part of regular maintenance. The build was evacuated for a short while and reopened. 
>>> Protesters remain in the streets of cairo after the president gave himself near absolute power. More protests are planned for tuesday. Now back to "the squeeze." 
>>> Do you think you can get out of there within 30 minutes of showing up? With an excuse or reason or he doesn't freak out? 
>> I understand he's a friend or whatnot. You got to try to -- 
>> with the -- 
>> yeah, with the product. 
>> Together with the cook county sheriff's police, investigators mike davis is coaching a first-time informant from chicago's boys town neighborhood. They've enlisted his help to set up a prominent crystal meth dealer in the gay community. The informant, whom we're calling cash, is working on behalf of his boyfriend in jail. 
>> This has to go, this has to happen for me, too, you know? 
>> Cash isn't the only one learning on the fly today. Investigators are just beginning to understand the drug subculture of boys town. It's here that crystal meth addiction is on the rise. According to the chicago department of public health, 10% of local gay men have used meth, which is also linked to higher rates of unprotected sex and t spread of hiv. 
>> Meth in general, you always hear it's coming to your city, it's coming to your city and when it does, it's going to take over. They say it ruins your whole life, it ruins a community. If you can say you're a part of trying to stop it when it's first becoming prevalent in chicago, that's why we're here, that's what we do for a living. 

[00:35:12]


>> But as davis discovers, meth dealers can be just as slippery as any other target in the drug game. 
>> He'll be back at 8 p.M. Tonight. 
>> Cash and his dealer had previously agreed to meet this afternoon, but now that plan will have to change. 
>> All right, I'm going to get off at illinois. The team reconvenes later that night, while cash stays in contact with their target. An hour and a half passes until the target says he's still making deliveries to other customers. He won't make it back to his hotel so police call it quits. 
>> This is the game. 
>> T informant made an effort. He tried. But he has no control over what the target's going to do. 
>> For cash, it was his best chance to try to get his boyfriend out of jail and now it's gone. 
>> He's crying a little bit, he's really upset. This is the first time I've ever had a guy cry when it doesn't work out. It's usually me crying when it doesn't work out. 
>> Police decide to give him one more shot to set up another target in boys town but it's got to happen fast. 
>> Round two. He'll probably be a little more seasoned and crafty in order to make something like this happen. Because he has to be. He's got two days. 
>> While the team on the city's north side face as setback, another unit catches a possible break in the far south suburbs. 

[00:37:19]


>> Liquor city, chicago road. 
>> They've nabbed a suspect on a minor drug offense who says he can help them find the alleged gunman we've been calling booth. Booth's been in hiding in ford heights, and investigators conrad edged and zach smith are eager to find him. 
>> We want to know where he's at so we can put him in handcuffs, okay? Can you help us do that? 
>> Till somebody else gets shot. 
>> But now that they return to the station, they sense their detainee has had a change of heart. 
>> Listen to me, if you tell us where he's at, we'll go get him. You'll sit here. If it's all good, we'll let you go. 
>> We won't bring him back here. We'll bring him somewhere else. 
>> Exactly. 
>> He ain't going to see you. 
>> Don't think you're just going to tell us something and we're going to let you go. It don't work that way. 
>> We asked him on scene, where this person was. We said, okay. We're not going to interview out here on the street where everybody is watching and trying to listen. We'll bring him back to the station. Once we got him here, he says to me, what was that guy's name again? 
>> Edged and smith send their detainee off to jail and it isn't long before booth emerges from hiding again. This time he allegedly does what police always feared he'd do. 
>> He just shot a girl about two hours ago. So -- 
>> 13th AND WASHINGTON, 13th AND Washington. About two different sources now say black mustang. 
>> We're using some of our informants and we're trying to get realtime about where they think he may be. 
>> Police, come to the door! 
>> He said he's not going to go easy, that if he has to shoot the police, he will.Weak. Wears off. Been there. Tried that. Ladybug body milk? No thanks.

>> Meet us at 13th and lexington. 13th and lexington. 
>> All right, sarge, we're rolling. 
>> An all-out manhunt is unfolding in ford heights where a fugitive we've been calling booth allegedly just shot a woman just hours ago. Witnesses say he was aiming at a local man on a neighborhood block but hit the man's girlfriend instead. The bullet went through her leg and booth fled on foot. Now 22 members of the sheriff's gang and fugitive warrant team are descending on the area to find their suspect. 
>> He did make comments that we're getting from people that we talked to that he is not afraid to shoot at the police, he's not afraid to do what he needs to do to get away. If he decides that's the way he wants to go, we'll handle our business on our end. 
>> Police are blanketing ford heights but they're not going in blind this time. They've enlisted paid street informants to chase down leads into booth's whereabouts. Sergeant jason o'malley is helping to lead the search. 
>> We're working four different informants right now. All of them are decent information, it's just that we're getting it in bits and pieces. 

[00:44:23]


>> Their latest tip, booth's still in the area, riding in a black mustang with another gang member. 
>> I have two different sources now say black mustang, no plate, no nothing. 
>> O'malley's team hits the block where booth's friends and associates live. 
>> The only bad thing is forth heights is such a close-knit community, they have that we're not telling anybody type of attitude here. 
>> Believe me, he is not here now. 
>> All right. We believe you. 
>> Without our informants we shall would not have decent information. 
>> Things begin moving quickly when another unit sps a black mustang parked a few blocks away. 
>> Police! Come to the door. Police! Come to the door. 
>> The owner of the mustang emerges, the same man who was with booth earlier. 
>> We got [ bleep ]. He came out of the house. 
>> This is the story. You know why we're out here, right? 
>> Yeah, I heard. 
>> Who we looking for, man. 
>> We're going to try one more time, okay? Let's start over. Where's he at? 
>> Last time I saw him -- 
>> last time you saw him he was in the back of your car but where's he at now? 
>> I dropped him off at the store. 
>> What store? 
>> At the store up the street. He's like, man, I need to get up out of here and I took him to the store. That's it. 
>> Whose house is this? 

[00:46:23]


>> That's my home, that's my mama's house. Ain't nobody in there. I'm over here visiting. 
>> And there's nobody in that house? 
>> Just me. I'm waiting on her to come back, the owner. That's it. I don't know what the 
[ bleep ]'s going on or none of that. 
>> You don't know what's going on? You don't live in ford heights? You know that we've been looking for [ bleep ] for a while. 
>> But I ain't got nothing to do with that, though. 
>> What you mean you got nothing to do with that? You riding around -- he's been riding in your car. 
>> I don't know that. 
>> Police get consent to search. Moving in, bracing for a fight. 
>> I don't know. 
>> Don't be mad that I don't believe you. 
>> They clear the house within minutes. Booth's not there. And his friend, now in custody, is feeling the heat. 
>> Did he tell you what he did? No. He just said, man, I need to go to university park. 
>> But he didn't tell you what he was going there for? 
>> He didn't tell me. 
>> If what his friend's saying is true, then booth is headed ten miles south to a town outside of cook county. 
>> He's saying that he thinks he's hiding somewhere in the u.P. Do what you can. If you can find anything tonight. 
>> Investigators reach out to their informants, and over the next hour they confirm that booth fled to university park. Now it's a matter of pinpointing exactly where he's hiding. With help from the u.S. Marshals, the team uses electron being surveillance to locate the fugitive. They narrow their search to a single location, an apartment complex, and get ready to make an arrest the following morning. 10-4, we have two cars rolling in right now. 
>> This is jenna, we got him in front of us. 

[00:48:25]


>> One of two things. Either he gives up or he's going to be fighting us. running hard, try running four. Fortunately we've got ink. It gives us 5x the rewards on our internet, phone charges and cable, plus at office supply stores. Rewards we put right back into our business. This is the only thing we've ever wanted to do and ink helps us do it. Make your mark with ink from chase. 

[00:51:44]


>>> Two guys are setting up surveillance in the apartment complex. Anything that moves out of the apartment will be enforcement on the street. 
>> Police are waging a manhunt for an armed fugitive we've been calling booth in chicago's south suburbs, 39 miles south of downtown. The cook county sheriff's gang investigators believe their suspect is hiding out at an apartment complex, but don't know which unit yet. They've set up camp a half mile away. While undercover officers are keeping an eye on the building. They've also got confidential sources trying to verify the apartment number. 
>> The information we're getting from informants is saying that he will shoot back. He doesn't care if it's the police or not. Keep that in mind. Not that that's going to happen. I just want to make sure that everyone finds themselves cover. All right? Or if you can see him, take him out. 
>> Until they're ready to go in, police are watching every car that leaves the complex to make sure the fugitive doesn't escape. And they've just spotted one vehicle whose driver could be booth. 
>> Tjenna. We've got it in front of us. He says he's not going to go easy, if he has to shoot the police, he will. Taking it down inpiper. Let me see those hands. Shut your car off, your left hand. Everybody keep your hands up. Hands up. 
>> But it's a false alarm. Booth's not inside. 
>> What's wrong with you people, driving around with weed in your car? All right. We're going to break loose and head back and regroup. Get this information. 
>> By the time he's done, investigator matt jenna and his team hear from one of their informants. They get the apartment number they've been waiting for. Now it's time to grab their suspect. 

[00:53:54]


>> It's going to be that building right there. 
>> Jenna around nine other armed officers including several u.S. Marshalls head up to the apartment. The resident there gives them permission to search. They find booth and another male inside. Both surrender without incident. 
>> We all had that in our mind, knowing that this guy is willing to shoot police. Your alertness is definitely heightened. Are we going to take him, is this going to be the time? Everything is a little more stressful. That's for sure. 
>> Authorities place both men under arrest. They'll charge booth with 15 total felonies, including aggravated discharge of a firearm and attempted murder. He could serve life in prison if convicted. 
>> It's nice when you get someone like this off the street because the violence is going to go down, even if it's just a little bit, it's better than nothing. It's not so much that you don't care about the other gang members who got shot or you i don't care about that, it's the kids. That's what -- I have three kids of my own at home and my concern is all them kids out playing and now it's summer vacation. That's what makes this one that much better. 
>> Now that the manhunt is over, the sheriff's police turn their attention back to other cases. Including the crystal meth traffic in boys town. Investigator mike davis is moving forward with the pair of informants we're calling tango and cash to set up that area's main meth dealers. One taet's already fallen through, so davis and his street informant begin pursuing another. They've just completed their first successful buy. 

[00:55:58]


>> How do you think the transaction went? 
>> I think it was fine. 
>> Were you all comfortable up there? 
>> My heart is racing talking about it right now. 
>> Really? 
>> This informant whom we've named cash agrees to continue working with police in order to help his boyfriend bargain for probation or a reduced prison sentence. 
>> Let's just say that the person I'm doing this for, i care a lot about. I wouldn't do this for myself. I feel like someone's outcome is completely on you. I mean, I've paid thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars for phone calls. I've disagreed with different decisions that he's made, but I'm not going to try to control somebody. If I'm going to stay with them, I have to accept whatever outcome. 
>> We had an informant in there. We also were able to make a buyout of that location, and what we bought tested positive for crystal meth. 
>> Cash scores another transaction for police several days later. It gives them the evidence they need to make their first boys town arrest. 
>> It's a very small apartment, from what our informant is telling us. Entry, mike glees is going to be on the point followed by moose. 
>> Did you ever think about you would be doing this? 
>> The crazy thing is, somehow you justify things you would never do, things you don't really believe in, and I have crossed lines that I thought i would never cross to help him. 
>> Police make a successful hit. They take their target into custody and recover the narcotics and paraphernalia they had hoped for, thanks to cash. 
>> The guy was great. He was probably one of the best informants I've ever worked with on the street. 

[00:58:00]


>> Even so, there's no guarantee that cash's efforts will pay off for his boyfriend tango, who still has to convince the state's attorney that he'll go clean if he's given a second chance. 
>> You know, my thought is, is he going to get back out there and use again. If you look at true addicts that are really resourceful, they usually have set up safety nets and surround themselves with enablers. And it almost appeared as if that's what was going on. We got to see his boyfriend doing anything he can to help a guy that's probably been arrested five or six times. I think he's going to feel used. There's no doubt. 
>> When it comes to drugs and crime, some patterns can seem almost impossible to break. By the end of another summer in ford heights, the sheriff's police has received more than 100 calls about gunfire. Even though they've aggressively reduced crime by more than 33% since they took over policing here, they still face an uphill battle. 
>> There's been a culture of lawlessness out here for many years. The culture of violence that's got to change. And it's only going to change when we get cooperation from the residents. 
>> Our hearts go out to the kids. You know, they didn't ask to be born into this mess. It's sad to say that some of them, their future they entail being out here selling the drugs. They don't understand that life exceeds far beyond the boundaries of ford heights.

=======================================================

>>> Chicago county's cook county jail, home to 10,000 detainees. And all is ready to break lose. The gangster disciples, the biggest criminal organization inside and outside the jail is headed towards civil war. 
>> Stand by. It's insecurity, right? 
>> Investigator drake carpenter and adrian sandoval are about to launch a search with officers. It's one of many tactical measures they take on a regular basis. 
>> It sounds like there are guys in the day room. 
>> To make sure that a jailhouse war never erupts. 
>> You want us to go in first? You guys go straight to 16? 
>> I'm ready. Are you guys ready? 
>> A lot. 
>> You ready? Let's get it. 
>> Get on the bar, right now. Get on the bar. Let's go. 
>> You ever worked with the police before or no? 
>> A lot. 
>> You ready? 
>> Let's get it. 
>> Get on the bars, right now, let's go. 
>> On the bars, on the bars. 
>> Get on these [ bleep ] bars. Get off that [ bleep ] phone and the bars. 

[00:02:04]


>> Face forward. 
>> Right behind you. 
>> This ain't no tough business. You hang up when I tell you to hang up and do what you're told. You follow orders. I'm what you're looking for. Put your hands behind your back. It is what it is. 
>> Carpenter and sandoval part of the criminal intelligence unit, or ciu, have participated in thousands of tier searches to date. 
>> Give me 19. Unlock 19. Step out, hands on your head, my friend. Step over, one time, two times coming out. 
>> You guys got anything on you? You got one chance at amnesty, man. This is it. 
>> Now with seven other investigators, they're searching 38 inmates and their cells for shanks and for clues about what the gangster disciples and other groups are up to. 
>> Pop 1-3, pop 1-3. 
>> We did go to the cells on which we had the information on. We didn't find any metal up here. There was a lot of flushing going on when we hit the tier. So I'm pretty positive there was definitely contraband on the tier. But the time we get through both the gates, secure the day room and get to the cells we're looking for, it gives them a minute, a minute and a half head start. It's safer for them to get rid of it than to get caught with it. They know that's what is coming when they see us. 
>> But carpenter and sandoval have found something equally important, kites. 
>> This is the inmates' way of communication. It's called a kite. It would normally be rolled up in a fashion, maybe this small. On the back it says division 1. Nickname chaos. This is supposed to be the person who gets the kite in the end. But it may go through four or five different inmates until it reaches him. What it is the count for their gang on this tier. Their nicknames, and their court dates. The reason why that is important because if you ever want to plot ahead or if you think you're going to be attacked, you like to know who is going to be in court with you, see who is going to be in the bull pen, see who has the numbers. And then it goes further to actually put that they have one shank, they're calling a banger, within on the tier. You would be surprised how many kites actually go out there. Is thousands going out, I would assume every day honestly through court, through medical movement. I mean every avenue you could possibly think of. 

[00:04:59]


>> Kite traffic is like the information superhighway for inmates. And it's almost impossible to stop. So carpenter and sandoval have turned it to their own advantage. Seizing the right kite can help investigators shut down a gang war before it happens. 
>> It's excellent information for us. These guys keep track of their infantry, their weapons, and they're able to plan attacks. Of anybody trying to take rank, we find out right away. Certain gangs have certain openings. And this one we see we already know who it is. It says greetings, family, i come with a vision. I leave as I come, in the vision of our great leader. THAT'S THE GDs. 
>> That's not about them worrying about us catching it, it's about it getting to the person that they want it. To that's more important than the kite getting caught for them. 
>> As summer begin, carpenter and sandoval discover a major threat developing on the compound. They seize numerous kites pointing to a civil war within the top ranks of the gangster disciples, chicago's largest criminal organization both inside the jail and on the street. 
>> There are two guys who belief they're in charge. They're housed in opposite buildings, but they have followings in each other's buildings. We have identified everybody. We is have a equal number of upper echelon. 
>> Between the two competing factions, investigator have identified 26 senior to mid level gangster disciples of key interest. They're the ones allegedly sending and dispersing the kites. One faction is housed in maximum security division 9. They represent the current leadership in charge of all gangster disciples throughout the jail. The opposing faction is based in maximum security division 1. They held all the power in the past, and now they want it back again. 

[00:07:05]


>> Basically what you have is an internal war going on. It's called a hostile takeover. 
>> Carpenterer and sandoval want to hear more from the inmates themselves, including this man, whom we're calling franklin to hide his identity. He's on the side of the gangster disciples plotting a takeover. He and his cohorts claim that the acting leader has betrayed them. 
>> Not only against us, he misleading the guys against the organization entirely. He preaches his message, the message of gd and his now his credibility is not what it once was. The jail is closing in on him. YOU KNOW, WE OUTNUMBER THE GDs Nine to one. The odds are on our side. 
>> Franklin insists that his loyalty to his crew comes first. But he's also got other motives. He is fighting a drug conspiracy case, and hopes to curry favor with the state's attorney. So he has agreed to keep carpenter and sandoval in the loop about the power struggle. He is one of many informants they have on both sides of the conflict who are helping them to intercept kites. 
>> There has been a lot of kites going back and forth between the two groups. This is one particular kite from division 9. 
>> It's an official memo. This is equivalent to what I say is a third guy in charge. Then he is saying take care of this business. He clearly state the people he wants hit, saying they're being charged with disrupting organization unity. They ought to be blasted on-site, asap. And this is now the game. 
>> With information like this in hand, carpenter and sandoval are alerting jail officials. They're also warning multiple inmates who are under threat based on the kites they're receiving. Among those inmates their own source, franklin. 

[00:09:09]


>> Jail is a very small place. And sooner or later we're going to come face-to-face. We're not initiating the violence, we're not even looking for it. But we're not going to let them hurt us. 
>> All that being said, you know what is coming next. Would you like to check in to protective custody for your safety in regards to violence being carried out against you? 
>> You're [ bleep ] me? 
>> Protective custody means that hurts your feeling, I need protection from somebody else outside of my gang. On top of it, they have to wear this yellow jumpsuit, the big bird suit. You ran to pc, you're a coward. Now you become an enemy of your own gang. 
>> It's what we got to do. 
>> I'm trying to come up with an answer, man. Just give me a minute. Where do I put hell no at? How do I do that? 
>> Whether he wants to enter protective custody or not, he has to go on record with his decision. In this case, franklin is signing a statement of refusal. 
>> Name and number, signature. 
>> All right. 
>> And what do you want me to say here? Where do the comments go? 
>> There is no comment section. You're not reviewing a movie. 
>> What happens is a lot of times we also confront the aggressors, and we let them know we are aware they're calling all these violations out. And if it occurs, they could take a hit for it. 
>> We're not here to choose sides. We're going to hit both sides. We got multiple guys in both buildings feeding us information. They're never going to figure that out, who said what and who did what. They're not going to know. 
>> By squeezing inside sources, authorities are preparing their next move. A sweeping crackdown on the gangster disciples both inside the jail and on the streets. 

[00:11:13]


>> The operation we dubbed it hostile takeover. We're going to disrupt the heads and take them out of play inside the institution. 
>> The message being sent. It's going to affect building on the compound and on the street. Despite their numbers, we're still the biggest group here.Els more expensive? I get to touch these guys? Oooh, ooh la la. I'm feeling their muscles. Yup, yup.

>>> there's a civil war brewing inside chicago's cook county jail. Two opposing factions of the gangster disciples are fighting for control of their organization. Investigators drake carpenter and adrian sandoval want to stop them before the conflict turns violent. They've identified 26 senior members of the gangster disciples either in power or trying to take over. 
>> A lot of times until one person from the street comes in that's heavy enough that says, hey, listen, this is what it is and both sides agree, then there's going to be violence and people here can lose their lives. 

[00:15:31]


>> County is already a pressure cooker of rival gangs from all parts of the city living under one roof. 
>> What time do you have, man? 37, abe, 37, indiana, burn street. 
>> You got the ambrose, you got the i. 
>> Gang members make up more than 70% of the compound's 10,000 inmates at any given time. Most detainees here are being held for trial as they've been charged but not convicted of crimes. It's up to corrections staffs and the criminal intelligence unit, or ciu, to try to keep a lid on potential conflicts. 
>> Controlled chaos. All the way from receiving from receiving to the max buildings. You have 40, 50 guys on one tier that are killing each other out on the streets, and you expect them to get along. You can't just get over stuff like that. 
>> You know somebody tried to pull a fasone, you know what I'm saying, a slick one on me. Try to bust me in the head with a tray. He got me. He got me, but I got him good. Yeah. I stabbed him. He knows what's up, breed killer. 
>> Sandoval and carpenter are bracing themselves for a long, tense summer. Not only are they keeping a close eye on the gangster disciples and their feud but also on other groups that present a high threat of violence. Today they're meeting with one of county's most notorious detainees. He's the leader of a fringe gang and he's made powerful enemies throughout the compound. This inmate, named antoine is facing trial for murder and claims he's innocent. He recently survived an attempt on his life by the gangster disciples. Antoine himself had belonged to the gangster disciples until he broke off to form a renegade group behind bars. 

[00:17:41]


>> They started with the whole tier, 40 guys, we don't answer anybody, we're on our own, we just stick up for each other and that's it. From there they went to other tiers. It was almost like a cancer was spreading. 
>> You just got a group of individuals that don't want to PARTICIPATE IN THE GDs. Our mission was this, to get the people that's in the gang to take them out the gang and get them to realize that gangs is dead. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THE GDs Come and tell us look, this is what you're going to do. Why should I pay dues? That's like paying protection. I don't need protection. Om a big ass man. 
>> He's a big voice. He's a big threat. He's made a name for himself. His reign is coming to an end now, they were pretty strong for a time. 
>> Antoine and his crew who have a reputation for violence became known as atg, or against the grain. They stirred up turmoil inside the jail but ultimately their rivals outnumbered them. 
>> They tried to wipe us out. WHEN THE GDs WERE SAYING WHAT MY Mission is, he disrupting the organization unity. So therefore kill this bitch. I'm like the osama bin laden of cook county, that's what I am, for real. That's what it is. I have so many people saying are we going to kill antoine. If you were going to kill me, i would have been dead. I've been here four years, seven months, and I ain't dead. I ain't had a fight. All I did was get slashed with a razor a couple times and stabbed. That ain't nothing. If I have the knife in my hand, they're in trouble, for real. 
>> He got attacked, eight or ten guys tried to jump on him. They didn't do a lot of damage, so now it's like a badge of honor for him. So he is kind of feeling himself a little bit more right now. 
>> They ain't going to fight me one on one so they going to play with the knives. Move me out of this county, man, because somebody is going to get hurt, man. Somebody's going to end up dead. 

[00:19:48]


>> We're working on it. 
>> Antoine's lobbying to move to another jail outside of cook county where we he won't be a high profile target, and he will have more freedom. Since the latest attempt on his life, he's been confined to a supermax tier. 
>> He is house aid lone. He is out in the day room alone. He showers alone. He goes to court under special escort. Any movement he has is going to be handcuffed, shackles at all times. It's just a threat lead level we need to adhere to for his own protection. 
>> If I could put you on the moon right now, that's where your ass would go. 
>> Anywhere is better than here. 
>> Bottom line it's still our job to make sure he finishes his case, that the sentence is conducted and that he goes to the state or he goes home. So the entire time he is like our baby right now. So if you act up, we still got to look out for you. 
>> But sandoval and carpenter haven't heard the last from antoine or his followers. Before the summer is over, antoine and his crew will prove they're still a force to be reckoned with and they'll add fuel to the fire of a civil war that's dividing the gangster disciples. 
>> People are smelling the blood in the water right now. 
>> It's inevitable there is going to be some kind of retaliation. I'M DONE! [ chuckles ] Sweet

[00:24:18]


>>> They might think that we're scared. If they think that, that's the worst mistake they could ever make. When you don't respect nothing else, you definitely respect violence. 
>> Investigators drake carpenter and adrian sandoval are facing a vil war inside chicago's cook county jail. The top ranks of the county's biggest gang have split into two factions competing for power. This inmate, who we're calling franklin, is tied to the faction that's trying to retake control of the whole organization. 
>> Has it gone just too far to compromise period? 
>> For their to go their way, yeah, because they did a lot of slandering. 
>> With the help of informants >> now they want to take all of those conspirators out of the equation. 
>> Looking at jags, spider, hightower, middleman. 
>> And make them irrelevant. 
>> That's basically the lineup for 9, correct? 
>> Correct. 
>> What about 1? 
>> That's the goal of a coordinated sweep they're naming hostile takeover. 
>> It's going to be all these guys, all within the same day before they know what happens. 
>> Carpenter has a list. He'll go through it briefly to let you know who we're anticipating on moving where. 
>> Their strategy is two-pronged in the jail. First, disrupt the gangster desizes' lines of communication by transferring their top members to different buildings and different tiers. Second, put them under close surveillance as they rebuild their communication channels from the ground up. 
>> The bottom line is they don't have that many avenues to communicate -- kites, the phone, the mail, and visitors. We're going to be up on all those avenues. 

[00:26:24]


>> What we're trying to do is gather the information pro actively. The objective is to stop the violence. 
>> Finally, a third phase will take place on the street. The sheriff's police will saturate the gangster disciples neighborhood, hitting them where it hurts most, their pockets. 
>> You drive away all the business and they're not going to make any money selling drugs. It will push people inside and it will shut down their street markets. We're going to effect a whole group of individuals who are affiliated with the gangster disciples. 
>> They're going to hear about it on the street. As soon as they start getting popped in here, everyone on the street is going to know. 
>> They're going to know. 
>> But there's no guarantee the operation will work. It coulde tensions inside the jail worse and provoke retaliation against police out on the street. Taking on the gangster disciples is dangerous business. There's been no greater menace to more chicago communities for the past 30 years. 
>> I kill that [ bleep ] right there, I kill that old man. You know what I'm saying? Take that, bitch. 
>> At their height during the 1980s AND 1990s, THE GANGSTER Disciples built a highly structured drug campaign. Thanks to the rise of powder and crack cocaine. 
>> My real name. 
>> But as chicago police and the feds clamped down on them, their ranks splintered, and they spread from the inner city to the outlying suburbs. 
>> THE GDs, BECAUSE THEY'RE ONE Of the largest street gangs, we see them more frequently. A lot of times they won't even say that they're affiliated with a gang. It's up to us to try and learn who these guys are. IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS IN THE '80s OR IN THE '90s. It's very loose and very fluid and that's how you have that much internal conflict inside the gang. It was never like that before. 

[00:28:41]


>> WHAT TODAY'S GDs LACK IN Unity they make up for in numbers. Police estimate that 30,000 members live throughout the chicago area. They claim up to 3,000 city blocks as gang turf and they've expanded into more than 30 suburbs. Their most recognizable symbol, a six-pointed star, honors their co-founder king david barksdale and the sheriff's police are seeing it in more and more places. 
>> Why did you run, man? 
>> I just don't like being around police. 
>> You a gd? 
>> No, sir. 
>> You have six-point star earrings in your ear. 
>> I know. 
>> That's the star of david, right? 
>> Tell me why you are wearing those earrings right now. You are a gd. There's no need of lying. We already know that. 
>> Stand up for yourself, man. 
>> I just don't want to get in no trouble. 
>> You're not going to get news trouble for telling us this stuff. What you can get in trouble for is reasoning from the police today. 
>> As long as there is a demand for narcotics, we're never going to break the back of any gang no matter what. So until something is done along those lines, we'll be out here every single day. 
>> The gangster disciples are likely here to stay but authorities hope to hit them as hard as they can with operation hostile takeover. 
>> It's a message sending here, you hit the guys at the top, when the rest of their guys see him leave the tier under direct escort from us, then they know that's when the message is sent. 
>> Everybody's fine in their comfort zone, but when you take them out of it, how do they react. 
>> Let's get it. 
>> That's next on "the squeeze." ?????? ?????? I'd like to thank eating right, whole grain, Multigrain Cheerios! Mom, are those my jeans?

>>> For every threat that they diffuse, investigators know there's many more brewing at any given time at chicago's cook county jail. 
>> You put these guys all together in a confined area with rules they've never had their whole life, there's going to be violence. And that's what you're going to be subjected to every single day. 
>> Right now a civil war within the top ranks of the gangster disciples poses the greatest danger to the entire compound. So authorities are getting ready to shake up the main suspects. 
>> What we're going to do is within the jail we're going to transfer them around, we're going to hit their cells and we're going to do it for the entire gang. 
>> The operation dubbed "hostile takeover," will be an attempt to avert all-out violence between two factions of gangster disciples. Investigators have recruited informants from both sides who will continue playing a key role after the big sweep. 
>> The jail will be buzzing for a week at least. And that's when we'll be able to gain a lot of information. You need the informant information to get the inside details. 
>> But an inmate with a score to settle is about to change their plan. His name is antoine and he's a former gangster disciple who went renegade to start his own gang. Investigators drake carpenter and adrian sandoval met with him a month back after the gangster disciples tried to kill him. 

[00:36:17]


>> They wrestled me to the wall. I was on the ground for about five, ten seconds. I jumped back off the ground, i kept swinging. You see where I got sliced on my throat and my back. You see my back is all [ bleep ] up. They stabbed me and they already know it ain't over with. 
>> Antoine predicted that miss his followers would take matters into their own hands as long as he was locked up on a supermax tier. 
>> My people catch the right people, they're going to strike back. We all know they're going to strike back. Y'all got me on escort anyway. So I can't do [ bleep ]. I can't tell them not to do nothing because they going to do what they want to do. 
>> The camera's on. The camera's on. 
>> Pat him down, check him out. 
>> Now several weeks later, one of antoine's people has made good on that prediction by savagely beating the top security chief for the gangster disciples. It's a symbolic blow to the gang's leadership. 
>> I've never seen somebody in that position getting touched. I've never seen it happened. I don't think it's ever happened since either of us have been here. So it's bad. 
>> It's inevitable. There's going to be some kind of retaliation. 
>> The attack took place on a maximum security deck while nearly half of the inmates were on exercise break. It happened in a matter of seconds. Four alleged assailants jumped the victim and stomped his head into the floor. They had no weapons, only their fists and feet and sent him to the hospital with massive head trauma. 
>> All the guys were separated and then we just started interviewing one by one everybody who was out. We were able to get our main suspects involved. 
>> The lead suspect belongs to THE ATGs WHILE THE OTHERS ARE Vice lords. They also oppose the gangster disciples. 

[00:38:28]


>> Thanks. 
>> Thanks. 
>> That opens up a whole new can of worms for investigators. 
>> It's the vice lords aspect I'm more worried about than the atg aspect. They take in some of you guys for being weak. 
>> If those people knew that we was on one accord, they wouldn't have acted. 
>> Now they've got to find out if it was an isolated incident or the start of an even larger war throughout the jail.

>>> Now that a guy like this gets hit, some retaliation is going to have to happen. 
>> A perfect storm appears to be gathering inside chicago's cook county jail. At the center e gangster disciples, the biggest gang on the compound. Their chief of security has been beaten and nearly killed by rival game members. The alleged assailants belong to TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS, THE ATGs And vice lords. They've exposed the gangster disciples' leaders for being vulnerable, a result of their own internal disarray. The gang's senior ranks are split in two. One faction that's in power and the other that's trying to take over. Now the question is whether the ATTACK BY THE ATGs AND VICE Lords will remain an isolated incident. Or whether it will spark a bigger war on multiple fronts. That's what investigators have to find out quickly. They're leaning on many different sources for intel, including an inmate whom we've been calling franklin. He belongs to the side of gangster disciples plotting a takeover against their current leaders. 

[00:44:11]


>> People are smelling that blood in the water right now, that you guys aren't on the same page. So they're taking some of you guys for being weak. 
>> They're taking them. Let's keep this clear, plain and simple. They're taking that crew for being weak. 
>> It's the vice lords aspect that I'm more worried about than the atg aspect. 
>> I don't condone what they did, but honestly, nothing is changing with the relationship WITH THE VICE LORDS AND THE GDs Right now. There's always been tension, but lately the last couple of years there has been a peace treaty, so everything has been going all right. So dwloong it was a strike TOWARDS THE GDs, IT'S JUST JUST An individual thing. 
>> So basically they just took advantage of the situation. 
>> Yeah. Don't nobody help him. 
>> There was a considerable AMOUNT OF GDs THAT DAY. Everyone was either in the shower, on the phone or watching tv. 
>> Left way out. That should be a message to them, know what I mean? Don't nobody care. The jail is always about numbers. You outnumbered, you outpowered. You don't want to be outpowered. 
>> Go ahead. 
>> Based on what they heard, investigators aren't waiting for the next shoe to drop. They're moving ahead of schedule to shake up both factions of gangster disciples in a coordinated sweep. 
>> Going to meet and sandoval is headed to 9. 
>> It's the next phase of operation "hostile takeover." 
>> Everybody's got radios? 
>> Identify where the subjects are, where they're housed. Show them a picture. 

[00:46:12]


>> It's on a large scale but it's not something that's never been done before. 
>> This is jail 101, searching inmates and looking for contraband. That's what we do. 
>> It will be an effort between us, emergency response uni k-9, front line staff. 
>> More than 80 officers divided into two teams will be hitting a pair of maximum security buildings at once in a show of force. Their goal -- take the 26 highest ranging members of the gangster disciples into custody. Officers will use pepper spray if the inmates fight back. Investigator adrian sandoval is the case agent for one of the buildings, division 9. While investigators drake carpenter is the case agent for the other, division 1. They're about to rush the tiers where their targets are housed. 
>> Everything is element of surprise. So the potential for stuff to go wrong is high. 
>> Let's go, let's go! 
[ Dogs barking ] 
>> got one time in cell seven, joey? Two times. What do you want? 
>> It went really well, as well as it could go. We were able to run in on the tier and secure everybody. The rest of the guys were caught in the hallway, in the corridor. They were all secured. You can see their faces. Guys that aren't normally mad about seeing me aren't real happy right now. Be advised, 8-3, it went smoothly. Three of our five targets were in the day room, no incident. 

[00:48:29]


>> It's your birthday? Happy birthday, man. Happy birthday. This is your party. Just ain't no cake. 
>> The first roundup is over within 15 minutes. Now that one tier's down, authorities have ten more to go. They're already moving the gangster disciples off the tier. They'll transfer them to other tiers or divisions. Meanwhile the team division nine is ready to grab more heavy hitters, including the leader of the whole organization. 
>> I think there's one up there. And one down here. But I don't know who is who. Face the wall right there. Coming at you. This is huge. The fact that we just came in here and took down the guy they've been following for the past three years, just got taken off the tier. Now what do we do? Who is going to take over? Who's the mouthpiece? Who's the brains? There's going to be a lot of confusion for a few minutes. It's perfect. 
>> In a matter of hours authorities take 24 targets into custody. From here, they'll transfer them to their new homes and put them under surveillance. 
>> It's going to open up a ton of different avenues for us. I guarantee you, you'll probably flip three or four more guys, guys that didn't talk to us and now they got moved to a division or a different county, and it's not conducive to what they're used to, now they'll be willing to talk.

>> We've got one city radio in each sergeant's car. Three teams are going to area one,hree teams are going to area two. Zero tolerance. Everybody goes to jail. 
>> Not only are the key players feeling the squeeze inside the jail -- 
>> you're under arrest, big boy. 
>> -- Now their blocks are feeling it, too. The sheriff's gang unit, together with chicago police, are making a massive sweep of the west side. 
>> Our goal is to target the gangster disciples in the communities they live. The more problems you cause for us inside the institution, we're going to cause conflict for you guys on the street. They're going to go to jail for everything, whether it's public intoxication, driving under a suspended license. They're going to go to jail for everything. 

[00:55:25]


>> You've never been in no gang, never in your life? So when I run your name, it's going to come back saying you've never been in a gang? YOU HANG OUT WITH THE GDs? 
>> Police drive it home racking up 62 arrests over two days on gangster disciple turf. 
>> Like I was telling you, it's because of the gangster disciples. 
>> But on some blocks the gangster disciples have a message of their own to send. 
>> Pretty much the letter speaks for itself. You have the cpd, which is chicago police department, and a "k" is just for killers. 
>> Right now the group of guys that are coming up, I attribute it to like a video game. They think they can hit the button and get four more lives. You don't. Once you ruin this one, it's ruined. 
>> While the street operation is in full swing, an alleged gang member shoots and injures two chicago officers. It happens in a neighborhood that's not part of the sweep but the impact is just the same. 
>> The mayor told us today, when you're not in the city, be careful because they're not afraid to shoot the police. Prime example. 
>> Each is lucky to be alive. They both were grazed in the head by gun fire. A citywide man hunt ensues yet the shooter evades capture for now. 
>> You've seen how many police officers are out there. We're not going to lose, and we're not going to fight fair, so we're going to win, period. 

[00:57:27]


>> Man, where you from? 
>> I'm from the south side. 
>> South side where? What are you, a gd? 
>> After three days of jail and street sweeps, investigators sandoval and carpenter face the real test, to find out whether the operation worked. What their sources are telling them is good news. The gangster disciples civil war is now over. The two sides have finally agreed to share power as a result of police pressure. 
>> This had to be the end of it, this operation. That's the whole point of it, was to end the nonsense and right now it's ended. 
>> Sandoval and carpenter welcome the outcome and move on to the next potential threat. For one thing, they still got antoine and his atg followers on the compound. 
>> He said it's not no gang, it's a movement. That's what it is. It's sort of like a bowel movement. 
>> It would be easy just to turn keys and give them their food but then you're not helping law enforcement in general. You got to be willing to go an extra step. 
>> All the time we're running on tiers, these guys have knives. Ask life insurance agencies, there's a reason our policies are always a lot higher. 
>> It's a life-and-death situation, there's that potential every single day. You're going to a place where stuff happens. Whether you want it to or not, something could happen. Sooff got to make the most of it when you leave your house, kiss your kids, tell the people you love you love them because, unfortunately, it could happen to you, you know. You have to take advantage of that. To me I keep that in my mind every day when I come to work. That's why most of the time when you meet people in corrections, it's a small, tight-knit group. They're the only guys that totally understand what happens in here. 

[00:59:31]


>> It's a bond, we're all together. We know we have each other's backs. We're always looking out for each other. That's the most important part.

=======================================================

Business. 
>> David: Ready to go fiscal cliff diving? Apparently a lot of businesses and shoppers are already afraid of the fall. I'm charles payne in for neil cavuto. With the holiday shopping seon underway a lot of consumers are saying no way. And more than half saying the uncertainty around the fiscal cliff will impact their spending and job creators are cutting back on spending and a bad deal for the economy? Well, let's ask. BEN STEIN, dagen McDowell, charlie gasperino and gary k. Want to start with you. Bad deal for all of us? 
>> Of course, look, business investment was already down last quarter over 1%, and the word uncertainty just pervades the air and its business, its consumer, how about philanthropic organizations don't no what kind of write-offs for charity and the worst the outcome is probably going to be more, and taxes are going to go up and of course there will be no spending cuts. 
>> And ben, it does sound ominous, even if you're not someone who reads the wall street journal, the fiscal cliff, fiscal cliff, it could be the-- I don't know intimidation factor, it could actually be worse than going over the cliff. 
>> I think that's a brilliant point, charles. If we went over the cliff for a few months the impact would not be enormous, and uncertainty is a bad word and fear is a really, really bad words and these are the words that govern the economy today and imperative that democrats put their heart and soul into a compromise. Absolutely imperative. 
>> Dagen, what do you think about this? 
>> I think you cannot dismiss this, particularly if you're on the left of something as hocus-pocus and fear mongering, you can look, the list of companies that are bulge back spending and some of the biggest names in the ideas, whether it's a wal-mart, ford, disney, you name it. No company is going to commit new money to new jobs if ne don't know what's going to happen in a matter of weeks. 

[00:02:10]


>> And charlie, this is the kind of spending that has long-term ramifications not building factories, not buying building, long-term ramifications. 
>> We should make a point here, these companies are not cutting back because of the fiscal cliff only, no, they are cutting back because with what they fear from president obama getting his way in terms of higher taxes. In determines of higher dividend taxes and higher taxes on just about every piece of the economy and i tell you, don't believe me, go out there and talk to them. They started cutting back way before this last week. 
>> I want to take this point. 
>> And this is the problem, the fiscal cliff is really bad, but the solution offered by president obama of massive taxes is not that good. 
>> Julian, what do you make of that this this is just a pandora's box, and the beginning. The fiscal cliff, could have a short-term impact, but ultimately the trend of higher taxes that charlie's point, is what businesses are really afraid of? 
>> I totally disagree with that and I think the surveys of businesses have shown that to be wrong and I talked to-- 
>> whoa, whoa, what survey. 
>> Can I finish the point, charlie. 
>> You just said survey. 
>> We'll come back. 
>> I think that businesses are concerned mostly about whether consumers are going to spend or the not. That's the concern and I think as for the fiscal cliff, no, i don't think that's what it is and as for the fiscal cliff, anybody paying close attention, charlie, honestly we can have a much more intelligence conversation if you stop interrupting me. 
>> Go ahead, finish. 
>> I think as for the fiscal cliff, I think that most people watching this closely believe there will be a deal, why? Because on taxes, I think even republicans agree they have to give somewhat right now and spending is, taxes are at 15% of gdp right now, it's the lowest they've been in 50 years, even the most right wing republican says that spending should be brought down only to 20% and-- 
>> wait, wait, and the point-- 
>> point two is that-- 
>> go ahead, finish julian fast I want to get gary in. 
>> Point two, a huge opportunity for conservatives. 

[00:04:12]


>> Democrats want entitlement reform and-- 70% of the budget-- 
>> gary k back, and listen, i don't want this to be a-- you guys are debating the left and right side of it, I think right now we're talking about, everyone in the country, gary k, seems to know about this more and more as each day goes on and it's already having a serious impact on our economy, and a pretty fragile time. So, here is the thing. Is this enough to get lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to do something or do you think we'll go off the cliff? 
>> I think they'll get something done, but the solution worries me. Since when have we ever seen any spending cuts coming from washington d.C.? Charles, spending is going to go up 10 trillion dollars over the next decade and they're telling us they're going to cut a few trillion off of that, so, spending is going to go higher and taxes, my big worry is once they break the top and raise taxes, we're talking marginal rates here, it's not going to stop. That's the worry and I've got to tell you, for me, the biggest irritant of all of this, they waited until the last minute on the debt ceiling and then sold it as the end of the world is coming if we don't get this done now. 
>> Right. 
>> And waited until the last minute and scaring the living cran out of everybody. 
>> Dagen, let's talk about that because a great article in the journal, businesses are cutting back no doubt about it, but consumers are cutting back and it's an indictment on everyone in washington. 
>> One of the reasons if we go over the fiscal cliff and it will hit 90% americans. And lowest income, 30,000 a year a family a tax bill north of $1,000 a year and it hits everybody, to that point people are nervous and they're going to pull back and you can't dismiss this because again, lawmakers time and again, taken us right up to the deadline and paid it. 

[00:06:12]


>> And I think-- I want to thank julian for making my point. Yes, businesses do believe we'll get a deal. They do and then you've got to ask yourself why are they cutting back? Because they know even if they get a deal what president obama has in store in terms of obamacare and down the line, every survey. 
>> And what I think they're-- I think what you're all doing is talking down the economy, one. Two, we're talking about top 2% back to what they were under the clinton rates. And it's wrong to say you haven't seen spending cuts coming from washington. A deal in 1985 on grammar and hollands in 1987. 
>> Julian, julian, I don't want to-- julian. 
>> And I don't want to get too far off the topic, we're not talking 1985 we're talking now. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Ben, the point is that i want to bring up with you. A lot of people don't realize the stock market crashed after the debt ceiling debate was signed after a deal was reached, then the market crashed. So, even coming up with some sort of deal, I don't know that you can fool the public anymore, can you fool the markets and public kicking the can down the road? 
>> Let me make two respectful points, warren buffett is extremely good businessman says that higher taxes will not impact his decisions to expand or not expand his buildings or factories and second thing, we're had very, very high taxes and very, very high corporate profits at the same time maybe a third thing with all due respect then what's the solution? We cannot keep running the big sits. 
>> I will say this with respect to the corporate profits. 1 1/2 trillion dollars is sitting outside of this country. A lot ofhese corporations when you dig through the numbers, every time they report, they're making money outside of this country. Gary k, I think that's the point. Businesses aren't making money in america, and sometimes, sometimes the public gets a little bewildered because the market's high beau that's not in direct correlation to our economy. 

[00:08:16]


>> I use the word potential. I've been saying this for-- it's a few years now, the potential for this economy keeps getting headwinds, what's the headwinds? The uncertainty out of washington and the potential for higher taxes. We don't have a tax problem, we don't have a revenue problem for washington d.C. This year, we'll have-- they'll be close to the highest revenues ever back from 2007. Spending is up over 800 billion dollars this year, than it was in 2007. That's where the deficits are coming from. That's what should be talked about more than taxing people who are working their rear ends off to do better for themselves. 
>> I've got to tell you i don't like when warren buffett is brought into a discussion about people making $250,000. 
>> Two different worlds. 
>> He's a very good business man. 
>> An amazing businessman, he doesn't care about taxes. 
>> He's not the only businessman saying it. 
>> It's not just the fiscal cliff coming on january 1st, more of the president's health care law is starting to kick in. How much more will you be paying? We're going to find out. Cheerios cholesterol as part of a heart healthy diet. That's true. ...But you still have to go to the gym. ?????? The one and only, Cheerios ?????? from Is bigger than we think ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold? There's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies. Prescription TAMIFLU attacks the flu virus at its source. So don't wait. Call your doctor right away. TAMIFLU is prescription medicine for treating the flu in adults and children one year and older whose flu symptoms started within the last two days. Before taking TAMIFLU tell your doctor if you're pregnant, nursing. have serious health conditions, or take other medicines. If you develop an allergic reaction, a severe rash, or signs of unusual behavior, stop taking TAMIFLU and call your doctor immediately. Children and adolescents in particular may be at an increased risk of seizures, confusion or abnormal behavior. The most common side effects are mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. The flu comes on fast, so ask your doctor about TAMIFLU. Prescription for flu.

>> Live from america he's news headquarters, I'm heather childers. America is mourning the loss of dallas star larry hagman. Hagman best known for his role as jr ewing from dallas lost his battle with cancer at a dallas hospital. He was the son of broadway star mary martin and known for his role as tony nelson in "i dream of jeanie". And there are new cardinals, the pope elevated the new principals of the church. And they're tasked with advising the pope and electing the person who succeeds him. They come from across the globe, colombia, lebanon, nigeria, the philippines and the united states. And for your latest headlines log on to foxnews.Com. ???????????? 
>> well, the election is over and the white house is putting out new rules for the health care law, one is telling how to reward workers for living a healthier life. So, ben, you know what? Let's put aside the worry that this is going to drive up cost? Isn't this more of the nancy state nonsense? 
>> Big brother is watching you, big brother is watching you through the obama white house, through the department of health and human services and transmit that to the job and also to your employer. I don't like it. I don't want big brother watching me and telling me how much to eat or when to walk or whether or not to smoke, i like to live my own life, and I'm a grownup. I had my mother telling me what to to eat when I'm a child, I'm done with that, i don't want mr. Obama to be my mother. 
>> And I listen to my mommy and calls me and tells me to eat more veggies I will, but i draw the line there. Julian, I think it's part of that social utopia coming out of washington these days, not only ultimately expensive, but takes away from personal liberties. It's one thing to try to pick winners and losers in the economy, but to decide on personal behavior just seems wrong in america. 

[00:14:33]


>> Well, we incentivize behavior we think is good and disinvent advise. 
>> Who is we? 
>> Who is we? 
>> The government, the government constantly. So, the point here is I think price waterhouse cooper did a study before the health care law and found the single highest health care expenditures preventible disease, everything from diabetes, heart disease, all kinds of disease that were largely preventible. So the idea that we're going to incentivize good behaving, better diet and nutrition, seems to be somhing that's smart and end up saving people in the premiums and saving taxpayers a hell of a lot of money. 
>> Dagen, at some point, let's face it, there's a lot of things that we could all do to live a better life. We could become singapore, north korea, this is america and now what? We want to go out and have a twinkie if they're still AROUND, ON eBAY WE SHOULD BE Punished for that. 
>> We have a choice as a nation and we need to use less health care. The people who have health insurance use too much of it. Instead of putting the burden on them to make decisions for themselves, instead we expand it and have greater government control over health insurance in this nation, so we've made a choice or the president has for us, that the government's going to get more and more involved in what medicines we use, in what medicines are available to us, and frankly nothing in that law that's going to bring down health care costs and right now they're willing to go up. Premiums are going up for employers and individuals and we have to wait and see how much they will go up. 
>> Now, charlie, I don't know if you're following this, you're a health nut. 
>> I did a public service last week, the president should be giving me one of the commendations. 
>> Might be in the mail. 
>> For calling twinkies legalized poison you don't haven't to to listen to this, but listen to me. 
>> Shame on you. 
>> Listen, you bought it you own it, right? We've got this law, you're going to have government sponsored health care, expect the government to tell you what to do and what not to do because listen we're on the hook for this stuff. In the context of the health care law which I hate, this is a pretty good thing, telling people what they should eat, what they shouldn't eat so they-- people eat such garbage, that leads to disease. 

[00:16:48]


>> You know, listen. 
>> Bad stuff. 
>> And people eat garbage and read garbage, what does some panel decide what I do in my own personal life. 
>> But if it costs me money. 
>> Sometimes it won't. 
>> And the health care does now, it's a law. 
>> And gary k jump in there. 
>> Doesn't anybody find it a little comedic and ironic the same people who tell you salt is bad for you, we can't even drink large sodas, but let's speak weed because let's make that legal. 
>> I don't think that's in the health care law. 
>> Is that in the health care law? 
>> My bigger point is government get involved in every decision we make. 
>> It's there. 
>> The daily life and it's not the way this country was-- 
>> they're there, what are we going to do? It's the law. We've got the law and now you've got-- 
>> and I don't want to pay for someone ales twinkie habit, okay? 
>> What about people, why don't you tell people they can't have sex and then you-- 
>> and I don't have to-- 
>> and by the way, if we subsidize the outcome of sex, we might be on the hook for that, too. 
>> All right. Guys. 
>> And there's much more-- 
>> hold on one second. Final from julian. 
>> Much larger point, the government through our tax code incentivizes buying a home and going to school. All we're talking about doing here is creating incentives in the system not to engage in unhealthy behavior that most of the rest of usnd up having to subsidize. 
>> Yet the government encourages you to get it on. I'll leave it this, the government does encourage you to get it on, tax breaks for having kids. 
>> And encouraging to get it on and a major-- 
>> and julian and charlie gasperino on the same page after all. 
>> And hey, guys with the college football season kicking into high gear, there's a new report showing that college football coaches, they're scoring millions in salaries and a penalty flag as their tuition keeps rising, but the gang at forbes saying this is actually a win for those kids and they will have the money at the top of the hour. Up here next, remember this? 

[00:18:57]


>> There will be no more taxpayer funded bailouts period. Well, if that's the case why are we hearing about a potential 93 billion dollar government bailout? We report. Well, you may want to go hide. wait minute. Can I still ship a gift in time r christmas? Yeah, sure you can. Great. Where's your gift? Uh... Whew.

[00:21:37]


>> because of this reform, the american people will never again be asked to foot the bill for wall street's mistakes. There will be no more taxpayer funded bailouts, period. 
>> No more taxpayer funded bailouts, not so fast. Turns out the federal housing administration is running on empty with all the mortgages it's backing, one report saying it could eventually need as much as 93 billion bucks. Gary k? Here we go again. 
>> My friend we'll be bailing out the bailouts and that's the type of nation we've become. Everything off the taxpayers back and it's just going to continue infinitum. The fha was okay, and now we're talking 93 billion. I've got news, 93 billion see it at 150 when all is said and done. 
>> Ben stein, what do you think about this. 

[00:23:37]


>> It has to be bailed out. It's a government guarantee, it's unfortunate it happened and I feel bad about it. A governor gain tee has to be honored. 
>> Charlie. 
>> It has to be bailed out. Let's delineate. It's fha, part of the government. And the difference between fannie mae and freddie mac. And they were public companies, and there was stock and they were covered by the government. These guys don't have stock. Yes, we have to bail them out, accepted and it's government. 
>> People have been getting 3 1/2% down money mortgages. 3 1/2%, it was 20% in the 30's, 10% in the 60's. 5% is how much you have to have down if you refinance through the fha. If anybody's gotten an fha mortgage and you're in trouble then it's their fault. The americans who we are lending money to to buy these homes. 
>> And you know, julian, I've got to tell you, you know, in w they spent the last four years trying to convince the american public that it worked, isn't this a message from all of things we've talked about. The golf doing too many things andccountability with all the individuals out there and costing people who actually work and pay taxes more and more money. At some point we've got to cut off the spigot. 
>> The I think the premise of the question is wron rigged system. 0% interest rates and-- 
>> ch interrupt. 
>> And let me finish. 
>> The taxpayers ended up making money on tarp and we didn't make even on the auto a bailout. If you do have one, you have the structured-- 
>> julian, julian, real fast. 
>> Let me finish the point. 
>> No, I'm going to ask you this fast you're clicking off the how much did we make on fannie mae and freddie mac? 
>> And didn't use a lot of money for a lot of reasons and-- 
>> well, charles. 
>> Not getting it right. 

[00:25:38]


>> Real fast, let meh the point. Charlie if you want to do a simple google check see the business leaders last week that called for hire-- 
>> fair and balanced and if you don't believe us, go check google. Do a google check. 
>> And we've got to thank charlie and dagen. 
>> Don't tell charlie to google anything.

Underwriting by the simons foundation coming up. The charlie rose brain series is about the most exciting scientific journey of our time, understanding the brain. The series is made possible by a grant from the simons foundation, their mission is to advance the frontiers of research in the basic sciences and mathematics. 
>> Funding for charlie rose was provided by the following. Captioning sponsored by Rose communications from our studios in new york city, this is charlie rose. 
>> Tonight we continue to exploring our brain with the conversation about pain. Pain serves a very important function for us to survive, it teaches us what to avoid and lets us know when to seek medical help. At the same time, though it can create tremendous suffering. St. Augustine once said the greatest evil is physical pain, 100 million americans live with it would would no doubt agree, pain knows no boundaries, regardless of age and race, beyond the physical symptoms the experience of chronic pain often leads to feelings of isolation and hopelessness. 

[00:02:15]


>> Laura klein had been living with pain since a knee injury in 2008 and joins me this evening to speak about her experiences and incredible group of scientists are also here to discuss how we perceive and process pain, david bar stiewk of children's hospital and david julius of the university of california, san francisco, allan basbaum, also of the university of california san francisco, robert dworkin of the university of rochester and once again my cohost dr. Eric kandel a nobel laureate, and a howard hughes medical investigator. 
>> Our subject is pain. Hrchl is really one of the great unmet medical needs and enormous problem in society. And the most, in the most general terms, bain is a unpleasant sensation in response to a real or potential threat of body injury, and it has an extremely important defensive damnive role, it is designed to remove the injured part of the body from the source of damage. And usually this is transient in nature, but with some diseases, such as cancer or arthritis, it becomes persistent and becomes not an damnive process but, adaptive process and part of the disease itself and adds to the pain .. As we will hear from laurie klein, chronic pain is a disease in its own right. As these arguments make clear, this is an enormous public health problem. 100 million americans as you pointed out suffer from pain every year, and it is the most common reason people seek medical attention. There are two kinds of chronic pain, inflammatory and neuropathic pain, inflammatory, receptive pain is damage to soft tissue and it shows the adaptive role of pain perfectly, it is designed to move the injured part of the body away from the damaging stimulus, so as to prevent further damage from occurring, and to allow the reparative processes to take place. But sometimes sort of a hypersensitivity develops with 

[00:04:37]


-- as a result of the inflammatory process so that relatively noxious stimulus like just touching the hand feels painful to the person. Inflammatory pain is due to damage of soft tissue, but neuropathic pain involves in addition to soft tissue damage actually damage to the nerve fibers themselves. And this, not only involves hypersensitivity but spontaneous pain and burning pain. More over, it shows an interesting phenomenon that we see with laurie klein, and that is a phenomena of sensitization where the pain spreads from its initial site of injury to other parts of the body, for example, if I damage my fingertip, with sensitization it can spread up the finger to the hand, the forearm, all the way reaching to the shoulder. So this is really a very serious process, that can cause a great deal of pain for the person. 
>> These processes need not be independent, so inflammatory and neuropathic pain can occur together as is laurie's case, the inflammatory and -- can lead to neuropathic pain. One of the remarkable things about pain is that we have made enormous progress in understanding it, in the last two decades. Our understanding of pain until recently was amazingly limited, it is the most mysterious of all sent tall at this and only .. Recently made significant progress and the people around the table are major contributors for this. One of the first people to think about this was a stot until the fourth century before christ, and he thought paiwas do two the fact an evil spirit entered the body at the sight of injury. 

[00:06:37]


>> Rose: Punishment from god. 
>> Punishment from god and it persisted through the middle ages into the renaissance, these are bad people and that's why they were suffering pain. This changed in the 17th century with this great philosopher, mathematician, rene december katrina, descartes, who developed a different view of pain .. He thought of pain as a biological process and drew this wonderful drawing of a young boy being burnt. His toes being injured, and finers were carrying the information about injury directly from the toe into the brain, although the details of this model are not what we view as the pain process the general idea that it is a biological process is the current view. But the question is, what is the nature of the biological process. It is remarkable to realize that until 20 years ago, we did not have a good understanding until 
-- of the nature of the biological process involved. People thought that pain was very different from all of the instrumentalities, for each modality you have different receptors like rods an cones in the rhett na, you have old factory receptors old factory receptors in the nose .. Each one has a private line, receptors specific to it and nerve fibers that lead to it. 
>> Rose: Hear, feel, touch. 
>> Exactly, with pain people thought that it may not have a system of its own, that it hijacks other systems and doesn't have receptors of its own. 
>> For example, many people thought that pain was the touch system, tactile system that were firing inappropriately. 
>> We know this is wrong. Many of these are small caliber fibers, many are these are finers that are specific to mechanical pain, cerebral pain and chemically induced pain. 
>> Rose: And this is a breakthrough is. 
>> This is a major breakthrough and another occurred when we began to identify specific receptors that mediate this, and david julius who is here was one of the people who characterized one of these receptors. These are iron channels called trip channels, they respond to both thermal and chemical stimuli, this is a wonderful advance, and a major scientist in england jeffrey wood discovered tactile pain receptors. He discovered a group of kids that actually began with a pakastani family, then extended it to others, congenitally insensitive to pain this was written up in last sunday's new york's time. These kids are feelers, they can put their hand into boiling water without even being aware they are doing it. They don't feel pain so the whole defensive function of pain is lost for them. They do unbriefably, unbelievably still litigate things and dangerous things because they don't have a fear of pain because they never perceived it. .. So this turned out to be due to a sodium channel and that is also interesting because we have sodium channels all over the body, that's how we generate action potentials but this is a special kind of sodium channel that carries this particular kind of mutation that gives rise to insensitivity to pain and another mutation in that channel gives to hypersensitivity of pain, so for the first time we were getting a profound understanding into the nature of pain, often a, not only in a biological but in a psychological sense. We will see as we discuss laurie's injured which occurred in a gymnastic competition that unlike many of the things in medicine, you cannot measure pain objectively. It is a completely personal experience. So your response to pain will vary depending on the context in which you experience it, whether you are attending it or not, your sex, physicians have to learn how to listen to patients very carefully in order to really appreciate how in particular person is responding to pain and we are going to see as we go around the table with these four people, each of whom have pioneered a different aspect of pain, how not only clinical sensitivity but also important advances in biology have brought us to a new level. 

[00:10:49]


>> Rose: This is "the new york times" article base says blockers, ashland's life would be a lot ease yen we she stuck her hand in a pot of boiling water she could feel it, go ahead. 
>> As eric noted there is no measure, there is no blood test for this disease and for the patients it is a silent disease and so we are dependent on speaking to our patients and trying to extract some concept of what they are going through, and the two issues that come through in terms of trying to understand an individual's pain relate to pain intensity and the emotional background related to pain. And without understanding those two factors, it is very difficult to actually appreciate what patients are going through. And I think in reality, many patients end up not feeling that their clinicians really understand their problem, and for those of white house are in the clinical domain of pain treatment, it is very tough when we don't have a specific diagnosis. 
>> Rose: So let me talk to laurie. First of all, I want to stay how much we appreciate you coming here and sharing your own experiences. Tell me about the pain you experienced and how it evolved. 
>> Sure. Well, I was a gymnast on the club team at the university of texas at austin, and I was competing in gymnastic meets during the spring of 2008, and in march of 2008 is when I had a really bad knee injury when i was vaulting, this is a picture of a tina and I before one of our gymnastic meets. This is the event that I got hurt on. This was the actual picture right before I got hurt, and i was vaulting when I landed, basically blew my knee out and just had extensive damage to my knee. I tore a lot of ligaments. This is just 24 hours after that injury, and I had severe bruising and swelling and severe localized pain in my knee. Basically, I did not have reconstructive surgery until august of 2008, so that was about five months later. And after that surgery, there was a difference in the pain that I felt. It started to spread through my entire left leg, from my knee all the way through my toes, as opposed to just my knee. 

[00:13:33]


>> Rose: What did it feel like? 
>> It was like a burning, a very severe burning pain, and then also kind of like an electrical jolt, where you kind of felt like you could feel things firing off in your leg. And then I also had sensitivity to touch. 
>> Rose: Right. 
>> To where I couldn't handle feeling the bed sheets touch my leg at night. 
>> Rose: And when they did, what would you feel? 
>> Extreme burning pain and just 
-- it felt like my leg was kind of on fire, it was just really uncomfortable. 
>> I think this shows in a very interesting fashion two characteristics features, one is that innocuous stimuli now becomes painful and, two, the sensation, from the initial site of injury to involve the whole leg. 
>> Rose: Right. 
>> And then some ofhe other things that happened was there was a color change in my left leg and foot and it was kind of red and sometimes it would be purple and then I also had extreme teach change just in my left limb to where it felt colder, and other things were i had abnormal hair growth where the hair on my leg would grow a lot faster than on my other leg, and then my leg would feel pretty sweaty and kind of clammy, and then my -- the skin on my shin and my leg was very shiny, so these were all different things I had not had at the original injury. 
>> Rose: And what psychological changes were going on? 
>> Well, I definitely developed extreme anxiety. I had a very hard time sleeping and not only because of the pain but then constantly worrying about, oh I am not getting any sleep and I can't stand things touching my leg. And I also had -- you know, i was very afraid of people kind of running into me or hitting my leg, bumping into me or even just reinjuring my leg itself. 

[00:15:47]


>> Rose: And what were your doctors telling you at this time? 
>> Well, immediately after my surgery in august, they were just telling me that this was normal postoperative pain and symptoms, but it wasn't until about two months after, in october, of 2008, that we finally -- well my doctor fenylly accepted that something else was going on, so that's when he recommended me to a pain management doctor, who then gave me the diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome. 
>> Rose: And how long was this after the injury when you got that analysis? 
>> Six to seven months after. 
>> Rose:. 
>> Before you realized this was an example of stream pain of which they needed special response? 
>> Right. Right. So where I actually was referred to another doctor to see what was going on. And it was very nice to get a diagnosis, just because I knew something was going on but then again, it was also not great because I never had heard of complex regional pain syndrome and I had never met anyone who had it before so it was all very new to me. 
>> Rose: David julius, tell us, you know, where do we take this now? 
>> Well, our records, as we alluded to earlier, the study of pain was in its infancy and blossomed quite a bit in understanding the mechanisms and pathways that are involved in acute sort of pain that laurie experienced and then subsequent to that how changes in the system lead to these chronic pain syndromes. I think the big breakthrough intellectually as eric said was the realization that pain is really not that different than other sensory modalities that it shares some overall characteristics an namely that neurons, neurons are specialized, there are specialized lanes or groups of cells in the first slide, we can see that if you take a cross-section, for example, we would look through a cross-section through a nerve bundles such sciatic nerve that runs through your leg you can see right away there are different kind of nerve fibers and some that are large diameter and wrapped with a thick insulating myelin sheet and others that are thin diameter and lack any insulation, and the form of these, the large cells are really the ones that the a betas are devoted to the detection of things that eric discussed, light touch, vibration, innocuous stimuli, we regard as not important, what we call c fibers receptors are the ones that really carry out the majority of signaling in with regard to how we detect painful stimuli and are the ones that noxious heat, noxious cold, noxious pressure and send this information to the spinal cord so we can see this general outlay is the, is of the system, so these are carried out by the c fibers on injury, and go to the dorsal horn and these messages are transduced through a number of synapses to the brain, where we cognitively understand this as a pain response, and so for example, these c fibers would be the sorts of neurons that were initially activated when laurie did this vault and hurt her knee and felt this acute pain. And the other big breakthrough in this field, as eric alluded to was really to understand the molecular devices that make the c fiber receptor know what it is, in other words theroteins that endow these cells with the pass to detect noxious stimuli and transmit this information to the spinal cord. And I just wanted to, I think there are basically two interesting discoveries in this area that are worth highlighting, and one is the discovery of a family of molecules of ion channels we call trip channels, these are found on a variety of different c fiber receptors shown here and the way these were discovered actually was as targets for a number of irritants that we experience, natural product irritants in our environment, the most familiar is cap say sin the pungent ingredient in chili peppers that give them the hot burning zinc and it turns out it rely sits that response .. By binding to the receptor, called trip d 1 and when it does so it activates a nerve fiber, initiates an electrical potential, change and we sense this as a burning sensation. This is why we sort of conflate the experience of a hot chilly pepper with a burning experience .. 

[00:20:30]


>> T are all in the last ten, 15 years? 
>> Ten, 15 years and trip eight which is a receptor for a natural product from menthol which we all experienced the cooling phenomenon and it turns out this channel is also activated by cold which is again why psycho physically we experience a mentally cold sensation and other such molecules and all of these play defined roles in allowing sub sets of these c5 receptors to detect noxious heat, cold, et cetera. And then the other -- another big discovery that eric alluded to were these -- this family of sodium channels, he said sodium channels are present in every neuron in the body, but c fibers actually are a subset of c fibers reflect a certain subset of channels and this has really come to the fore because of people who, such as the one described in "the new york times", individuals who have mutation ms. These channels, and these .. Mutations have very, have very profound effect os ten pain transduction experience and these are responsible for taking the initial activation of the nerve fiber by capsasin or heat and conducting this to the spinal cord. They allow the electrocurrent to continue flowing and mutation ms. This particular channel have very profound and fascinating effects on pain sensation, in individuals in whom this channel mutations render it nonfunctional, they cannot experience pain, interestingly they can experience innocuous stimuli such as light touch but incapable of experiencing pain and as eric alluded to you can easily identify such children because they have -- they lack the protective function that t pain system normally affords us and do not know when they have burnt themselves or may be running around on an ankle that has broken bones, et cetera and th grievous consequences 0 for these kids because they have to be watched very carefully. 
>> To illustrate how dramatically the field is moving this is only six years old we discovered this. 

[00:22:35]


>> And then there is a flip side of such mutations in which people have mutations in the same channel that render the channel hypersensitive so it is sending signals ordinarily in the absence of any peripheral stimulus like heat, cold, et cetera and in these individuals they have ongoing chronic pain that is unlinked to any peripheral stimulus and these patients will come into their -- see their physicians sometimes with their hands or feet in buckets of ice water because they feel such extreme burning pain at their extremities and so these studies really show that these nerve fibers are functionally and molecular specified to carry out this process of pain 7ation, and we are beginning to identify some of the .. Molecules that endow them with these properties. 
>> Tell us how the pain goes from the receptors to the brain. 
>> The key thing is that the information travels from the spin cord up to the brain and really accesses at least two major areas, because on the one hand you have the experience where is the stimulus, how intense is the stimulus? You have a century component to it you can detect, sensory component and there is an emotional stimulus it, and there are emotional areas of the brain that are activated and there are sensory disjimive areas so there is .. No one pain area of the brain. There is a matrix of activity turned on in the brain and that causes the pain experience. But what is special in the setting of injury and chronic injury, the nervous system changes, the brain and spinal cord, of somebody who has experienced a devastating injury that laurie had is really an altered nerve vows system, in that sense there is a disease of pain and we can illustrate the kinds of changes that occur, the sensation, sensitization process, wherein noxious stimuli hurts, that's the problem, they say my arm hurts but what they are saying is when I move it i hurt, it hurts or when I put on clothes it hurts and there is really two major mechanisms to which that comes about. On the other hand, it is a rather simple one, out in the periphery, to the receptor itself it can be affected by the injury process, such that chemicals that are released on the onset of inflammation it lowers its threshold and you have changes that take place in the central nervous system and in the spinal cord about the inadequacy of paper education in america, so for example, in a survey of 100 medical schools, quite a few were pound to have only devote add couple of hours in their entire medical school curriculum of four years to pain, so there is this enormous problems in terms of social burden, personal burden and physicians in training are getting a couple of hours of teaching about it. Which is -- 

[00:30:36]


>> Rose: That is one thing i am surprised by. 
>> And finally the last thing the report says is the public needs to be educated, patients need better education about the pain they are suffering from and its treatments and the treatment n an anti-epileptic drug called pregavlin or known as lirica and have been on that still to this day I have been on it since the day I was diagnosed until currently. 
>> And how is that work something. 
>> It is not that I can tell it is working. It is not like I take it and i say oh this helps, I feel better. It is more if wrote take it i notice a difference in the pain in my leg and kind of how my leg feels and kind of the nerve firing in it. 
>> Rose: Right. 
>> So then what we did because nothing obviously was helping with my pain, I had a number of injections in my back called lumbar sympathetic nerve block, and basically this would essentially block out the pain and it worked great, except that what was explained to me is that they were supposed to build on each other so that the time inbetween each injection would get longer inbetween each one so eventually I wouldn't need them anymore, unfortunately, that didn't work for me, and about every four to sticks weeks, it would wear off and all of a sudden I was in extreme pain again. So then finally, in july of 2009, we decided to go ahead and I got a spinal cord stimulator implanted in my back and that was, to me, at that point, it was the miracle device that i wasn't having to be put under, you know, and having medical treatments anymore, this is just kind of there, and I wasn't taking any medicine or -- 

[00:33:32]


>> Rose: No more pain? 
>> Well, at that moment, i thought I wasn't in pain. It worked really well, but at that time, I also was very inactive. I was staying in bed a lot. I wasn't really doing much. I had finished school, but i couldn't get a job because of everything that was going on with my condition. So it was when I started nursing school and -- in august of last year that I realized, okay, maybe this isn't working as well as I thought it was. Because all of a sudden I had, you know, the typical student anxiety and stress of being in school and having to be up on my feet and in nursing school having to work clinicals, and the I realized that, okay, my pain is actually a lot worse than I thought it was. So this past july I went and had an experimental treatment done where I had a continuous iv infusion of camene over a period of four days, four hours each day, and that was the one treatment that I can say that the others helped manage the pain, but this one actually i felt like was a cure, and after that, I am -- my anxiety has mostly gone away, except for the typical student anxiety, and then -- but I would say on my worst day, and maybe -- I maybe feel five percent of the pain that I felt before I had the treatment. 
>> Rose: So what do you say about these treatments? 
>> Well, she has had many of them, that is for sure. And if we can sort of go through the different approaches. Now it is interesting that you got some effect of the opiates very early and then eventually they stopped working and that's one of the characters, opiates are the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of pain other than aspirin like drugs, they are very effective and obviously have problems associated with them so if you look at one of the slides that illustrates the top down control system, that not only does information go from the spinal cord to the brain, but the brain actually has the pass to regulate, capacity to regulate the output of the spinal cord and that involves the endorphins, so when you -- you can naturally control your own pain if you are able to, you might be using the endorphins but what it does is substitute for the endorphins and turns on the control system and the brain gets less of a pain message, that tends not to be very effective for the neuropathic pain that laurie has experienced, the nerve injury associated pain, and that is because there is a very different process that occurs, and we look, if we look at a big blowup of the spinal cord, in the next slide, what we notice is that there is a neuron that is labeled an interon, that is a inhibit toir neuron that outputs the spinal cord, when you have nerve damage as laurie had, those cells can be lost or their function deteriorated, so there is no local control, one of the ways to treat that is as if you are trying to treat an epileptic type condition because when you have a seizure you lose those controls, but in that case in the cortex, and it turns out for neuropathic pain the first line drug are the anti-convulsants, and they can before very effective, unfortunately they only reduce the pain somewhat and in only a certain percentage of patients. The brain stimulation or actually laurie had spinal cord stimulation is an interesting process on the one hand it may be electrically stimulating some of the areas that are descending from the brain, the other likely case is if you burn your hand one of the first things you do is you shake your hand and what you are trying to do is you are bringing in certain types of fibers that have the capacity to regulate the output of the cord by putting a stimulator in the spinal cord you can stimulate many of those fibers in a kind of backwards crazy way, and regulate the output of the cord. And when it works it can be pretty spectacular as obviously is the case with laurie. 

[00:37:56]


>> How does cadamine work. 
>> It is a very complex drug. Some people use it, you know, it is a psycho stimulant. It had the capacity to block a major nerve transmitter that is throughout the ba brain. In part we believe it is working on what I refer to as the central sensitization process and toning it down, but when you get effects that are so dramatic that laurie described, it is almost certainly working at all levels of the brain. And I would be lying if I said i really could tell you how it is working in the brain. Robert dworkin what strategies are used other than those we are talking about? 
>> I think laurie's story is really unusual in the sense that now he is talking about having pain at five percent of what it was. That is really not what commonly occurs. We have all different sorts of medications we have discussed a little bit up to now, and medications that are effective for neuropathic pain aren't the same as those that are effective for musculoskeletal, low back pain, osteoarthritis and for other conditions like fibromyalgia for all of these pain conditions, what typically, unfortunately is the case that no more than maybe 50 percent of patients get some benefit and can tolerate the side effects, and, unfortunately, those 50 percent of patients who get a benefit don't have pain that goes from, say, eight out of ten to one or two, but what laurie is describing, what is much more common, if their pain goes from 8:00 to 5:00, and if they are really lucky it goes there eight to four there is a 50 percent reduction, so when that partial effectiveness of treat treatment is that often medication. 
>> Medications are used in combination so a patient might take an anti-epileptic drug along with one of the antidepressants that also have analgesic effects so medications are used in combination and what we think by using medications in combination you get some what of a boost in the effectiveness you might get pain going from eight to four or three, rather than 8:00 to 5:00. Then of course the other thing is that medications are used in combination with nonmedication treatment. Laurie already described spinal cord stimulation and sympathetic nerve blocks but there are lots of other nonmedication treatments, so for example, obviously, physical therapy, times of psycho therapy like cognitive behavior therapy and all kinds of complementary medicine like acupuncture or tai chi oreo ga or, oreo ga, or, yoga, and although .. You had these experimental dreams, typically the treatment of pain is a combination of different medications and other treatments like yoga or tai chi or physical therapy. 

[00:40:54]


>> How does cadamine work in. 
>> It is a very complex drug, some people use it, you know, it is a psycho stimulant. It had the capacity to block a major excite toir nerve transmitter in the brain, in part we believe it is working on what we call the central sense at this station process and toning it down, but when you get affects that are so dramatic that laurie described, it is almost certainly working at all levels of the brain. And I would be -- I would be lying if I said I really could tell you how it is working in the brain. But in part it is affecting the process of sense at this station 
-- 
>> you wanted to add. 
>> One of the problems I think that occurs as a result is that patients are very frustrated, if there is to immediate benefit, and secondly, we are taking time out, as it were in terms of their condition, so it can still progress overtime. And I think these are issues that hopefully in the coming years studies will actually provide real data where clinic his accounts treat patients with a dated, driven process, data driven process and hopefully with a personalized medicine approach. 
>> Rose: What are the experiments that are underway, i mean in the laboratory? 
>> Well, obviously there are clinical studies, where new drugs are developed and they have to be tested. 
>> Rose: On different models of pain. In the preclinical world we are trying to understanding understand the fundamental basis of pain transmission and processes where you can monitor mostly the hypersensitivity, just as it is difficult to tell if a patient has pain, I can't tell if an animal has pain, i can sort of infer, but the fact is, I can demonstrate hypersensitivity so if an animal has an inflammatory condition they will pull their brain away, their brain may not be activated and I can study the mechanisms so we have moppeds and they are only as good as they are predictive of the utility of a drug and amongst I think one perfect, wonderful example is, i said that opiates worked by turning on the brain, well many years ago it was demonstrated that opiates can also work in the spinal cord, actually inselect the drug at the level of the spinal cord and turn it off, because the target of opiates are there and they work in animals and when that was demonstrated it was taken to the humans so rapidly and now i would say it is one of the most common procedures for post operative pain, post se searchian pain and, post cesarean pain, so basically .. You are trying to model the systems that the patient experiences. 

[00:43:40]


>> I think there is another issue that really emerges when you listen to this discussion, one of the reasons that pain is such an extraordinarily complex sensation and why it is so difficult to treatment is essentially it is a moving target. It changes the brain and it changes the brain all the time. So you are dealing with something which is recruiting more and more different processes in the brain, and all of these affect the perception of pain. 
>> And you can't see it. 
>> Rose: But the brain is always changing, I mean everything is changing. 
>> It is changing with learning but in a more restricted way, this involves large areas. I think that is one of the potential advantages of imaging, I think it is still a relatively new approach, but it is in search of trying to provide at least a clinical assistant to patients, assistance to patients but at best a specific marker that can actually define a disease and its continuation and/or its benefit to medication. 
>> Rose: Back to you, david, in this whole notion of what is in the pipeline? 
>> Well, I think one of the, from my perspective one of the 
-- an em competent us the for understanding how these sensory and nerve fibers work is to try to intervene early on, when a pain message is first initiated, because as alan said, the barrage of incoming information changes the spinal cord in the brain and so one of the attractive approaches would be to turn down those messages as they first come into the spinal cord. After there is an injury and activation of the merv fine they are is a sort of cycle of activation of the nerve fiber, enhanced inflammation and things that we see for example in arthritis, and so we know that some of the molecules that we discussed earlier,or example, are targets for some of these inflammatory mediators that change the game of the sensory nerve fiber so the goal really would be to change the gain of the, you don't disturb pain sensation but you change heightened sensitivity in the context of injury, and, therefore, change long-term changes -- decrease long-term changes in the spinal cord. 

[00:45:58]


>> You referred to the specific sodium channel that is abnormal or not functioning in the children, kids who don't feel pain at all. If you turn it around and say if you coddle develop a drug to target that and then control the level of output, this is a huge objective of the pharmaceutical industry, that is probably their number one target. 
>> It is a target that anti-inflammatory agents we talked about so we would like to interfere with those. I think this approach is so critical, because in every area of medicine, the earlier you can interfere with the disease, the better the outcome. 
>> There is true for cancer and everything, and it is just as you indicated, in the last decade and a half, that we even know the molecular nature of these receptors. 
>> Rose: There is you're to the brain here, does you're to the brain tell us anything about how pain works in the brain? Well, yes. It has told us a number of things and it told us first of all that there is a top down process that can regulate pain, and insofar as we can recruit it and there are a number of ways it can be recruited by placebo, for example that is a very testify way of recruiting it, we can eliminate or reduce or ameliorate some aspects of the pain so the whole discovery of the system within the brain that actually counter acts the painful stimuli is a very important discovery. 
>> Rose: Let me ask each of you two questions before we go. Where do you think we are going in the next five years? 
>> In all of the areas we have been discussing here, and what is necessary/mess to do to get there? 
>> Well, I think two extremes. Eric mention plaid se doe bow and we haven't talked about every physician has a placebo element, the physician believes it works and the patient must believe it works, some would think a placebo works and therefore the there is no real pain. 
>> We understand that the placebos stimulate the endorphin release and there are other molecules that have been identified, so perhaps you can develop drugs that would enhance the placebo component of your treatment on a totally different perspective, there is an approach, the notion can you treat the disease of pain? Now, emphasize that there are actually molecular and structural and cellular changes that occur in the seing of pain, can you actually treat that problem? And one of the approaches that is being used is stem cells. 

[00:48:22]


>> Stem cells? 
>> Stem cells, that's right or progenitor cells, the gab ba inhad been toir cells are lost or diminished in the spinal cord, it is now possible to replace those and actually ameliorate the condition. These are animal studies but no reason to believe that couldn't be taken forward. 
>> Rose: Go ahead. 
>> To address your question i think there are a couple of really big areas. One is, definding what the patient has, in other words, the pheno type, the second is to have proper trials that define the utility of medication, or whatever treatments are provided and the third is to have a metric, whatever it turns out to be, whether it is imaging or a blood test, it would seem without this, we don't really know how to mess our treatments. I agree that one of the important things in the next few years will be to have more objective measures of pain, so, particularly I think imaging would be promising there so when somebody comes in, they don't have a physical manifestation of that, you can -- there will be sort of a more objective diagnosis, but for my own perspective as someone who studied these molecules we have just identified some of these molecules, and I mean the minute in the last ten years of so and there is tremendous potential for drug development to hit new targets and in terms of what we were talking about before one of the other advantages of hitting targets not just valley but peripherally is to sort of further the closer you are the more proximate you are to the damage the more effective the medications can be. So you avoid some of these problems -- 
>> I think ideally what we are looking for is the equivalent of an antibiotic, where you have specificity and efficacy without a side effect profile, because many of these drugs actually work very well in terms of efficacy, but they are killed in trials because of side effects, and bob dworkin can speak to this issue. 

[00:50:29]


>> David alluded to this, figuring out ways based on the patient's signs, like laurie, burning and stock like pain tells us what tells us about the physio abnormalities and if we can use this as a window to the underlying abnormality, maybe we can target treatments to those specific path though physiologic mechanisms and ultimately develop a .. More personalized pain medicine that is more effective. That is number one. Number 2 is preinvention and prevention, prevention, prevention. I think that there are all sorts of models of how we can prevent pain, preventing chronic pain in people with shingles and chronic low back p in patient whose have acute back pain, and preventing pain in patients following rgery about 20 percent depending on the surgery of patients following surgery have pain six months later so I think we need to start spending a lot more time figuring out what kind of interventions given immediately when the injury is occurring might prevent the long-term chronic pain, which is not doing that, unfortunately. 
>> Rose: Tell me where you are, you have talked about this dramatic reduction in pain, and what do you most want now? 
>> I think for me, what is important now, being in nursing school and eventually going to be a nurse is, really the education component of it. I can say from my specific experience that at least in my nursing school curriculum, we are talking about pain, more and more, but I was very you can can I to have a doctor, even though it seems like it kind of took a little while to diagnose my pain syndrome, in reality mine happened a lot faster than other people, especially now that I am starting to meet other people with the same condition, and, you know, I was lucky that I had a doctor who kind of knew something about it and was able to specifically refer me to someone who treated the condition. A lot of people, I have talked to a lot of people who their doctors don't believe them, they are telling them they are making it up and they have been dealing with these major -- this major pain condition for years, and even though I have had it for almost as long, I can say that my, I guess the course of my symptoms and treatment was probably a lot easier than some other people, just because we were able to specifically kind of do certain things or I didn't have to fight to convince anyone that I had this condition, more than like two months, so i really think it is important that the public is better educated like we said earlier, and that more doctors in the medical profession. 

[00:53:24]


>> Rose: And spend more time on it. 
>> Right. 
>> I want to make one point. One reason we selected this program to come, talking about atherosclerosis it shows the extremes. You have a single cell type that is damaged, and here we involve the whole brain, so this is really an extremely, probably as complex disorder as you can come across in brain science, and we have to remind each other that even though you and I enjoy brain science enormously we are at the beginning of a great mountain range, there is much of brain science we don't understand and I think pain brings out how much more we need to learn, so I think the fact that the methodologies are moving along, imaging is now being used in a more routine way to study pain, molecular pain receptors there is only a decade and a half old and we are realizing that there are connections between this and depression and we see the same neurocircuits are being recruited, this will help us get better understanding and better treatment. 
>> Rose: Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you very much. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Rose: Where to we go next? 
>> We discuss another pain condition, post-traumatic stress disorder this is not only important in military personnel who have a high percentage, but also civilian populations after a brutal beating, people experience this and we begin to get an understanding of it and also getting therapeutic approaches to it. 
>> Rose: I look forward it to. 
>> So do i. 
>> Rose: Thank you for joining us, we will see you on episode 12 next time. Captioning sponsored by Rose communications Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org a stunning visual portrait

=======================================================

>> On this episode of "chat room." Insanely jealous or just plain abusive? Also, what happens when you are driven to distraction? 
>> You aoing to know the absolute day that you died. If you knew, would you want to be told? 
>> Join ryan, rihanna, mark, carol, as they hash it all out in the chat room. 
>> Terrifying story in the new cannot make stuff like that up. 
>> Talk about a good partnership. What do you think makes a good partnership? 
>> Honesty, trust. 
>> Amanda? 
>> Loyalty, caring about somebody else. 
>> Communication. 
>> Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty. Definitely what I look for. 
>> Sometimes you have that great partnership and things could take a different turn. Sometimes maybe even a romantic turn. Let us watch this and take a look. 
>> Where were you last night? 
>> I was with friends. 
>> I told you I did not want you to have met with them. 
>> Stop being ridiculous. 
>> You are playing games. 
>> You are being ridiculous. 
>> I am being serious. 

[00:02:03]


>> You jump at that, ryan. 
>> It-shocked me. I wasn't expecting it. I was brought up in a household with women, so I was taught to treat them with the utmost respect. To watch that, -- I have seen this before. When you're in something like that, it seems like the person that is being abused is really losing their self-esteem. 
>> Did anyone else expected to react that way? 
>> I jumped a little. Scary. 
>> It was shocking, yes. Do you think he felt like he was not in control? 
>> Looks like it. 
>> Some people have aggressive personalities, too. 
>> That is a good point. He is not like that, but yet, he is like that. 
>> I would definitely be skeptical. If he is willing to do that in public, what does he do when the doors are closed? 
>> Definitely had a strong opinion about abusive boyfriends. When I started dating, my mom told me if any boy would ever physically abused me, he have to be done with it because it will lead to worse things. Maybe people can better, but if you do not talk about it, it will get worse. 
>> Have you known and one that went through that? 
>> I went through that with one guy in high school. He seemed so nice, and then when I would hang out with my friend, he would freak out or call me all the time it starts out small. Who are you texting, who are you calling? And it gets to the point of, you are not going out. He would push me around. Thankfully, I have to end it. My mother helped me to do that. 

[00:04:08]


>> Do you think he feels the need to be in control? 
>> Or are intimidated by another person. Of course, you are going to show yourself in a certain light to show that you are serious. If the guy was not cool and suggest that he get some kind of help or that he needs to cool it down. 
>> Everyone of us has felt jealous at some point about someone, but that is an extreme. 
>> In a relationship, you have to have trust to know that she will not be doing anything with the other boys besides talking. If he cannot trust her, that is not a healthy relationship. 
>> Maybe he does not know how to communicate appropriately to the situation and all he knows how to do is be a violent or assertive or show that he is macho. Maybe it is a fear tactic. 
>> In that situation, her best bet is to go to a guidance counselor, maybe her parents, and talk. 
>> In this situation, if it is you, are you walking away, amanda? 
>> Definitely. I would not let anyone push me, shoved me, verbal abuse me, anything. 
>> If it is ongoing, of course, you have to move forward. But if it is something that is new, I would try to see what i could do to make it better, if i really cared. Try to work on that trust again. If I cared, give it my all before walking away. 
>> At the end of the day, you can really use -- lose self- confidence after taking it on and on. Then it is either up to yourself or the people that love you to help pull you out of that. 

[00:06:08]


>> I can say I am a stronger person, stronger woman now. I would never deal with that, not even for a minute. 
>> Excellent. Coming up, you can only take one person. 
>> Hi have one for you you can only take one of the following. There is one answer. You are driving down the road on a cold, rainy night. Had there is a bus stop. There are three people at the bus stop. There is a very elderly woman who is sick and in dire need of medical attention. There is your best friend, from the time that you were basically this big, who at one point in your life, save your life. Lastly,there is one there is that gorgeous crash, that person you want to be with forever. You can only takene person. Who, harold, do you take with you? 

[00:08:47]


>> Well, I would take my best friend. He saved my life. 
>> My bestie. 
>> Because they are your best friend? 
>> Yes, they saved my life. Mainly because they are my best friend. Loyalty. 
>> Are they all in dire need? 
>> Only the old lady. She is in dire need of medica attention. 
>> I am sorry -- the hottie can stay. I love my best friends, but if someone is in dire need of medical attention, it has to be the first party, I'm sorry. 
>> We are taking the halo from here to hear. 
>> Amanda, I have been waiting for this. 
>> I would develop superpowers and save them all. 
>> That is crazy. I did not see that one coming. 
>> That is my option. 
>> You have to choose. I like that option, by the way. 
>> If only it were possible. 
>> I would go with my bestie. 
>> Congratulations, you all would not have been hired at a recent fortune 500 company that asked this very question of 200 applicants. Only one answer the question in a way that they had hired this individual. His answer was within the box and very unique. He would pull over, get out of his car, have his best friend take the sick woman to the hospital, and he would sit there and wait with the hottie in the cold winter night until the bus came. 
>> That is a brilliant answer. 
>> I was thinking that. 
>> Coming up, and driven to distraction. 

[00:10:52]


>> And true or false? 50% of the people in the world have never made a phone call. 
>> Would you want to be kept in the dark or would you want to find out? 
>> Find out. Then i 

[00:13:15]


>> she is like a ninja. 
>> I do not think you have a leg to stand on. 
>> Tell me about the first time 
-- I want to hear, ryan -- the first experience of driving. 
>> My first experience was really my driving test. I had not practiced. I got two minutes into it, hit both cones and was immediately out of the car. That was my first experience. 
>> Brianna? 
>> I first time driving with a license -- I will go with that. I had a radio on, I was so cool, driving. I was at a red light and I got hit from the back. Totalled my car, my back, I have to go to the hospital, and i have not driven since. 
>> You touched on something that I want to bring to your attention, and that is being distracted. For you, it was your music. Take a peek at this and let's see what you think. 
>> It starts in 20 minutes. We have to get there. Are you excited? 
>> Excited. Thank you for taking me. 
>> Are you serious? 
>> You are my boyfriend. 
>> You were grabbing his hair? 
>> Concentrate on the road. 
>> Can I use your phone for a second? 
[Tires screech] 
>> everybody in the car had a cell phone. 
>> Everyone was text messaging. 
>> Ever have friends and the car and that plays out? 
>> Yes. 
>> I have definitely seen people texting while driving. You are on the highway and someone is either off the lane for they are swerving. Someone in my high school passed away from texting and driving. There was a car outside of our school telling us not to text and drive. 

[00:15:34]


>> I am guilty of it. I know I do it. I did it on the way here today. The problem is, most people think that something like that cannot happen to them. 
>> I was texting, looking down, and I looked back up and all the sudden, no lie, there were five raccoons in the middle of the street. I looked up and saw them and slammed on my brakes. A guy going very fast behind me who was on the way to the hospital to see his pregnant wife, slammed into the back of me, send me over to the other side of the street. If I did not have four snow tires and my golf clubs in the back of my car -- 
>> I have been in this situation like that. I was driving, I got a text message, I could not wait, even though I was around the corner from my house. I was driving, I looked up, and then, bam, it the back of a pickup truck. 
>> Text messaging, as you all say, is probably any no.1 for this truck driver. There are a lot of things that these guys were doing, talking rapidly back and forth. Would you agree? 5 conversation going on at once? 
>> I am guilty of changing the music in the car. I think that is just as distracting as text meaging. The matter what, you are not looking at the rhode. 
>> I do not have sympathy for people that do that stuff. You have to be responsible, especially if there are people in the car. You need to tell them, shot up. I am driving. If you want to get there safely, you have to be quiet. You have to be focused. 
>> They are bringing this up more and more now. All of us are guilty of it, in so way shape or form. We can say that we have not, but we all have. Harold, would you say grooming is distracted driving? 

[00:17:39]


>> Yes, it is. 
>> Have any of you done it was getting to an emblem or school? Late for work? 
>> I have put on the lip gloss while at a stop sign, one time, I'm sorry. 
>> The best thing you can say to someone in that situation is -- other than stop, jump in. 
>> I am worried about my safety and others. I really have no sympathy for the person doing it because they should know, but you have to share the road with everybody. That's be respectful. 
>> Sending a text message back and forth to someone having a 0.8 intoxication level, the legal all for being impaired p.M. There is no text message that is that important that you have to do it right then. If it is, you can pull over. If it is really important, pullover. 
>> It is not even just necessarily texting. Picking up a phone, that is why they have made it illegal in most cities. 
>> We get in our cars tonight, we go to see our boyfriends and girlfriends, are you still going to tax? Amanda? 
>> Honestly, no. There is nothing smart about it. 
>> At the end of the day, who knows who could of been in that other car. Could have been a mom and her kids coming home from soccer. 
>> Harold? 
>> Not me. 
>> In the passenger seat maybe. But if anybody tries to do it while I'm driving, no. 
>> Coming up. Dropped food does not pick up bacteria if it is on the 

[00:21:19]


>> team a, team z, I like it. I'm going to ask you a question. You have to tap in when you have the answer. And you have to confer with each other. You cannot just jump in. Has to be a team effort. First question. This is a true or false question. True or false? More than 50% of the people in the world have never made a phone call. 
>> Team a. I let a team mark. Your answer? 
>> Rayn, your answer -- ryan, or answer? 
>> We are going to say true. 
>> You are correct. 
>> We knew that. 
>> We were giving you that one. 
>> Now they start to get a little more difficult. When people sneeze and people say "god bless you" they do so because your heart starts for a millisecond. Team z. 
>> True. 
>> People do do that. I think it is false, but people do that. I think that statement -- I do not think your heart release stops.

I am so excited to sit down and really talk to you about meaningful beauty. 
>> Thank you for being here too. 
>> People are talking about it everywhere. Women's wear daily even recently talked about it as one of the top ten fastest growing skin care brands in the u.S. This is huge. Why is it catching on like this? 
>> It's delivering results. I mean, women are getting great results and they're telling their friends or they're tweeting about it or blogging about it.

Or "what's the secret?" And really, the trick is meaningful beauty. 
>> Tell me about the man you work with to create this incredible line. Everybody in the beauty industry knows jean-louis sebagh. He's been called by vanity fair "the world expert in medical anti-aging." He's got a long list of celebrities, models, socialites, politicians who wait for months to come to him. What makes him so extraordinary? 
>> Well, jean-louis sebagh is light years ahead of everybody, and just how he's thinking about the way that skin ages. And I have been working with him since I was 28 years old. A makeup artist actually suggested that I see him. So, I went. I made an appointment. And his office is in this apartment building in paris. It's not marked, you know. It's like you have to knock three times and know the secret code and all that. And after the very first time I saw him, I saw like immediate results. My skin just felt radiant looking. It was just like a new me. And I was like, "okay, he's the real deal." And I was sold right away. You know, he's been my guy ever since. 

[00:08:38]


>> Right. 
>> With meaningful beauty you don't have to go to paris to see him. You can still have access to doctor sebagh through meaningful beauty. 
>> The secret to meaningful beauty advanced is doctor sebagh's ground-breaking serums featuring a rare melon enzyme discovered by scientists in the south of france. 
>> This melon produces a large quantity of an antioxidant enzyme called s.O.D. The enzyme keeps this unique melon from decaying and in the skin, helps prevent cells from aging as fast as they normally would. 
>> What's unique with meaningful beauty is we use this very powerful super antioxidants and we are one of the first in america to use it in a skin care. 
>> I talk to a lot of people about a lot of different skin care and when I see meaningful beauty, people say "what is it about that secret melon, that antioxidant?" I think of it as the magic melon at the core of this story. 
>> Meaningful beauty is based around this special melon that is grown only in the south of france. It has this very special and very potent antioxidant. In the beginning if you put it next to a regular melon, you wouldn't see that much difference. But over time this melon doesn't decay as fast. It stays fresher and firmer longer. 
>> That's amazing. 
>> And I always joke. I'm like, "i want to be fresher and firmer." And doctor sebagh and his chemists figured out a way to extract this very special and very potent antioxidant that's been called the youth molecule. 
>> That melon extract clearly works. I've been using doctor sebagh and cindy's formulas for three years and it is amazing how great my skin looks. 
>> I actually went to my dermatologist and she said "your skin looks fantastic. What are you doing?" And I thought that it might be like candid camera. I looked around because I thought, "you're kidding me, right?" And she's like, "no, your skin tone looks better. Your pores look smaller. Everything's better." And I was like, "it's meaningful beauty." 
>> I've had the opportunity to review before and after photographs, which were taken of subjects using meaningful beauty. And what we see here is the appearance of the crow's feet are visibly diminished. We see the dramatic improvement in the redness of the cheeks, in addition to a reduction in the size of the visible pores. And finally a remarkable improvement in the appearance of these deep forehead wrinkles. ?????? 

[00:10:59]


>> think about it. You've got this amazing skin doctor from france and he has this secret weapon. And you've got the world's most beautiful super model. And they've developed this beauty system. Now, wouldn't you want to try it?

>> Let's talk about the new meaningful beauty system. At the core of this there's this amazing creme de serum product. 
>> Yes, doctor sebagh, really he talks about it, it is creme de la creme. 
>> Right. 
>> This is as good as it gets. And serums are the hot thing in skin care. I know you know that from all the work that you do. But then you normally have to use a moisturizer on top of that. So, this takes out that step. And what's really unique is we combined really three different products in one bottle. And when you pump it out onto your hand, right then they're blended together and right away you put it onto your face. And this is the new night cream. We loved our old night cream. This rocks. And it has such a silky glide on your skin. And then in the morning you wake up and it's like your skin just drank it in.

>> This has a really unique look. It kind of is futuristic, but it's a combination of a cream and a serum. 
>> Exactly, inside here we have the melon colored, which is of course our super antioxidant, the melon complex. The clear is hyaluronic. And what that does, it kind of acts like a sponge on your skin and it helps your skin grab moisture and hold moisture. So, it gives it that dewy, lush, hydrated, moisturized look. Then the white is anti-aging peptides. And those help with the deep lines, the fine lines. Help the volume in your skin. Normally you would use a serum alone and they're usually very expensive. 
>> Right. 
>> I mean, even this serum, doctor sebagh said, you know, we asked, "well, what price could it be?" And he said, "$200, $300." 
>> That amazing. 
>> And it's fun for me to try new things. And when I notice a difference then I'm really excited to share that with everybody else. 
>> That creme de serum is so good. It feels so silky. It feels like you're doing 500 great things for your skin.

In the morning, the one step I would never skip is the day cream. During the day you have to protect your skin and you can do that in a couple different ways. You can do that with antioxidants, which we have our special melon in here, but also we have spf. It goes on super light, it's not greasy, it's great under makeup. So, next I use the eye cream, and I have found, now that I'm getting on in my 40s, I have this whole new beauty concern of puffiness. So, we reformulated the eye cream and this eye cream really is action packed. And it addresses under-eye circles, puffiness, and the appearance of fine lines. Since the beginning of meaningful beauty we've been talking to you about taking care of your neck and chest. So many women forget about this area, and it really shows your age. Everyone sees it, especially if you want to wear something low cut. So, our new decollete treatment has spf in it and we put in some brightening ingredients. It just gives your skin that dewy lushness that has vibrancy to it. Okay, now let's talk about our new product thecreme de serums. This is jean-louis' latest baby and it's totally innovative. It's three different products swirled into one. You're getting hydration, you're getting protection, you're getting anti-aging peptides. It's all in this one great product. When you put it on it's so silky. And when you wake up you have that great fresh glow. With meaningful beauty I know my skin is getting everything it needs to fight the good fight. Fight that aging process. And it really feels like nutrition for my skin and that's what I want.

>>> Hello. I'm martin savidge in for don lemon. The stories you are talking about in just a moment. But first, let's get you caught up on the day's headlis. You are looking at live pictures from cairo where anti-government protesters are spending the night in tahrir square.

New york governor andrew cuomo says he will ask the federal government for $30 billion to help with his state's recovery. 
>>> We've got a lot more planned for you on this saturday night. Here's what else we are working on. It's the search for a missing millionaire and it's one of the most bizarre stories I've ever covered in quite a long time. INTERNET VISIONARY john McAfee is a person of interest in his neighbor's murder. Now he's on the run from police in belize and blogging all the way. 

[00:02:06]


>>> And you drove cliff to attempt suicide? 
>> How was I know he was going to do a dumb thing like that. 
>> Tv's original bad boy, hollywood and fans morning the death of star larry hagman. 
>>> Also, new insight into what happened in the minutes and hours following the death of osama bin laden. 
>>> Plus -- a violent crime gone viral. A teenage girl attacked, knocked out on the street. You won't believe why the suspect says he did it. 
>>> His name is synonymous with safety and security in our modern electronic world. BUT john McAfee, the man who trust to stay secure online, had a security problem of his own. He's wrapped up in a bizarre and mysterious murder investigation. Ever since his neighbor was found dead with a gunshot wound TO THE HEAD, McAFEE HAS REFUSED To cooperate with police. He's en dropped out of sight. And this murder is taking place in the central american paradise OF BELIZE, WHERE john McAfee settled with his millions of cashing out of the company that WOULD become McAfee associates. I went to belize to try to find john McAfee myself to find out where he is, why he's not talking to police. And what I found raised even more questions than answers. TO LOOK FOR john McAfee, you must travel a narrow, rutted and muddy road. He lives in the remote northern part of an island 36 miles from the mainland and six miles from town. By n wondering why would a person with so much money live so far out of town over such a difficult drive, i think I can give you a reason. The unspoiled beauty of belize's barrier reef region. The farer north you go, the higher price of the real estate. I'M SITTING IN john McAfee's front yard. I can sit here because the beach here in belize is considered public property for all. The house back there, the lights are on, but I can assure you, nobody's home. In this same spot yesterday, i had a very interesting conversation with a young woman who claims to be one of the SEVEN of McAfee's lovers. Tiffany as she called herself didn't want to be seen. like McAfee, she fears the police. 

[00:04:41]


>> Reporter: When was the last time you saw him? 
>> Sunday around 11:15. 
>> Reporter: Do you know where he is now? 
>> No. 
>> Reporter: Now, a day later, tiffany's gone, too. The only residents left at McAFEE'S HOME ARE DOGS. And dogs may play a central role in this murder mystery. Officials say their barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between McAfee and his neighbor who lived here. LAST FRIDAY, McAFEE TOLD POLICE Someone poisoned four of his dog and to put them out of their misery, he shot them. Two days later, somebody shot greg fall, once in the head. and McAfee vanished. Police say they only want to talk to him but the longer he remains in hiding, the more suspicious they grow. 
>> I would dare to say that it does not seem rational no me wanting somebody for questioning and then you're hiding. 
>> Reporter: It was suspicion THAT LED POLICE to McAfee's back yard several days later to dig up his dogs. We went looking for the graves and it was obvious we found them. There are a couple of reasons why. One, the way they're worked. Two, the smell. And then something over here, a pile of rubber gloves which could indicate police activity. Witnesses say instead of taking the dogs' bodies, police simply took their heads and reburied the remains. A source close to the investigation says that may be to see if the bullets in the dogs match the one in greg fall. A murdered neighbor, headless dogs and a millionaire on the run, all set against a backdrop of spectacular tropic beauty. It's possible someone could write this intriguing of a story, but it wouldn't be easy. And the mystery does not end there. john McAfee may beright out of sight but he is very much in contact with the outside world. In fact, he's been talking to reporters by phone, in fact, and telling anyone who will listen that police in belize are corrupt and out to get him. Here is a part of his conversation with wire.Com. 

[00:06:53]


>> What's the end game at this point? 
>> Well, you know, I don't have a clue, sir. I am, you know, I am unable to move. That's clear. My face is plastered, all the police, all the bdf have my photo. I'm -- it's a small country. I am a white man with unique features. If I leave this house, I would be identified instantly and nabbed. So for the foreseeable future, this is my home. The end game is obviously given enough time, they will track me down. I have to eat, I have to have supplies. I'm using a telephone. They will eventually figure out which phone and triangulate it. It's just a matter of time. In the meantime, I'd like to get out as much information as I can about the wrongs in this country. 
>> john McAfee is also posting his thoughts on a blog, his own blog, and sharing an awful lot of details for how a man -- for a man, rather, who is hiding from the police. Zain verjee has more now from london. 
>> Reporter: John mcafee is spending his time on the run, dressing up. And he's also finding the time to blog abit. He says he's been using different disguises. Let me give you a flavor of what he's saying. "One day selling tamales and burritos that I purchased wholesale from a real vendor. On another pretending to be a drunk german tourist with a partially bandaged face and wearing speedo swimming trunks and distasteful oversized hawaiian shirt and yelling loudly at anyone who would listen. He goes on to say some dirty words in german. He sounds like he's having a pretty good time, too good, maybe. He also adds in his blog this -- the first day I colored my full beard and my hair light gray, almost white. I darkened the skin of my face, neck and hands carefully with shoe polish and put on an l.A. Saints baseball cap with the brim facing backwards and tufts of the front of my sir sticking out, unkempt through the band. IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, McAFEE Says, I stuffed my chee with chewed bubble gum stuck to the outside of my upper and lower molars, making my face appear much fatter. I darkened and browned my front teeth. And then he gets even more creative and kind of gross with his disguises saying this -- i stuffed a shaved down tampon deep into my right nostril and died the tip dark brown, giving my nose an awkward, lopsided disgusting appearance. I put on a pair of ragged brown pants with holes patched and darned. Well, he's sharing his movements, his opinions and his various looks and a lot of detail. But the question is this, does he want to be caught? 

[00:09:54]


>> Zain verjee. I told you this is one of the most bizarre stories I've ever covered. 
>>> Next, we will be talking with a newspaper reporter who KNOWS both McAfee and the police and knows how they're searching for him. He'll give us the very latest information on the investigation AND MAYBE EVEN where McAfee may be. You know how to dance... With a deadline. And you...Rent from national. Because only national lets you choose any car in the aisle... And go. You can even take a full-size or above, and still pay the mid-size price. This is awesome.

(Blowing sound) ask your doctor about spiriva. 
>>> We've been telling you about the murder investigation going on in belize, the country known best for its beautiful beaches and tropical scenery. It's an incredible story and it involve is is man. Internet security pioneer john McAFEE. His belize neighbor, a florida contractor named greg fall was found dead inside of his oceanfront home. POLICE WANT TO TALK to McAfee but he has disappeared. He's been talking to reporters, though, by telephone insisting that he is an innocent man and that police in belize are out to get him. So with all that said, let's bring in jorge aldana, the senior reporter with the "san padros" newspaper. Thank you for joining us. 
>> Good night. Always a pleasure. I'm glad to hear from you again. 
>> Thank you. Let me ask you this -- what is new in this investigation? 
>> Well, not much has changed, martin. Police are saying that the only piece of information that have changed is that they have EXHUMED THE REMAINS of McAfee's dogs. And what they are trying to do, according to the police officer, mr. Rafael martinez, who spoke to me about the case on wednesday afternoon, he's saying that the reason they exhumed the remains of the dogs was because they wanted to see if the bullets that, according to McAFEE, HE SHOT HIS DOGS. So they wanted to see if the slugs on the dogs' head matches that of the one found at gregory fall aes home. 

[00:14:37]


>> Right. 
>> That is what has changed. 
>> Any idea how long that will take, jorge, for them to do the ballistics? 
>> Well, the ballistics and testing are done in belize. Even after those test results with completed, it will not be made public because of the investigation. 
>> Something will have to change. In other words, if they matched, I would think that this would TAKE john McAfee from being a man who's wanted for questioning for just a man who's just plain wanted. You would see that change. 
>> I would want to leave that to the police. But several things could have happened. Remember that we don't know what type of guns was used on the dogs. We know that it was a 9 millimeter shell that found at the property of mr. Greg fall. But that will certainly change the police investigation. 
>> YOU'VE TALKED to McAfee several times. I'm wondering, what's he like? What's he like to talk to? What do you think of him? 
>> Well, to me, I spoke to him on several occasions and one of the last times I spoke to him was back in -- I think it was may when he gave a detailed explanation as to his home property. But he appeared to be a normal person. He came across as one who was genuine about experiences. He did not come across as someone, as some may say -- have been said in some media outlets, they are concerned about his mental instability. To me, he came across as a very normal person that was genuinely concerned for his safety. 
>> Right. One of the things that's INTERESTING about McAfee is the amount of money he's donated to the police government. He gave a $1 million boat to the coast guard of belize. And the thursday before all of this happened, he made a significant donation of equipment to the police department, which is rather ironic, because then three days later, that same police department is probably now using some of that equipment to try to track him down. He had been a very good representative for belize, good neighbor, so to speak. 

[00:17:11]


>> He has been certainly a generous person in the community, in terms of tryin to -- he had been generous in the past, not only to the san pedro police department, but when he first came to belize in 2008, I remember interviewing him when he donated a vessel to the belize coast guard, the newly formed belize coast guard. And he donated a state-of-the-art vessel. Thereafter, he made different donation. And you rightly pointed the last donation was a thursday before the entire incident where fall was found dead. He also gave a donation to the local police. It's ironic, like you rightly pointed. 
>> One more bizarre twist. Real quick, I want to ask, do you think he is still out there still in belize? 
>> It is difficult to see. In this modern time -- police believe he is in the country. But considering how porous our borders are, there is absolely no way that police and other law enforcement agencies can patrol every square inch of our border. So it can happen that he is here. It can happen that he may be hiding somewhere. It can happen that he may be hiding with some friends or it can even happen that he went somewhere else. Police do believe, however, that he is in belize. They continue to search for him. 
>> Let's hope he does the right thing and comes in and answers the questions of authorities. That will put the whole matter to rest. Jorge, great to talk with you. Thank you very much. We'll stay in touch. 
>> Well, we hope that you come and visit belize, martin. I'LL TELL YOU, john McAfee will only give himself in if you turn to belize.

>>> Who's there? 
>> Oh, if you were old enough to remember that when that happened, that was just one of america's great, great cliffhangers. In fact, that probably was the invention almost of the cliffhanger. Who shot j.R.? It kept american television audiences ging for month back in the heyday of "dallas." I want to show you what the south fork ranch looks like today. This is outside dallas where they shot the original television show and where the return to tv screen this is year. Today it's a tribute to larry hagman who passed away yesterday in a hospital not that far from the ranch in, of course, dallas. His infamous portrayal of the oil man was 100% texas, big talk, big money and always that very big hat. We have a look back at his long showbiz career. 
>> Reporter: Larry hagman wore many hats in his career. But he's best known for the stetson that he wore on "dallas." Despite roles on film and on stage, hagman will always be remembered as the villainous j.R. Ewing. When j.R. Was shot by an unknown assailant, it became one of the most famous cliffhangers in tv history, watched by 300 million people from all around the world. Hagman never expected the show to endure. 
>> I just started the show doing six shows. I never thought it would do 300. 
>> Reporter: In fact, the "dallas" franchise was so successful, the series was recently reprised. The u.S. Network tnt brought it back with a new generation of ewings and hagman came back, too, returning as j.R. Once again. Critics say he was the best thing about "dallas." But explaining the character's appeal, hagman once said, the time is ripe for a real bad guy and I'm it. 

[00:25:06]


>> Have a good day, master? 
>> I'm going to have a wonderful day, genie. 
>> Reporter: It was a good guy who larry hagman blasted into people's living rooms playing astronaut tony nelson on "i dream of genie." The show is still popular in syndication. Even as a kid, hagman orbited in showbiz as the son of peter pan star mary martin, his movie roles included "up the cellar" and "harry and tonto". 
>> I don't need an office anymore. 
>> Reporter: It was only after milking a huge contract from the producers of "dallas" that hagman became immensely wealthy. He had houses, he had cars, he had vices. Two of them included drinking and smoking. He smoked for 24 years, gave it up and became an anti-smoking activist and spokesman for the american cancer society. 
>> I met at least 30, 40 people that said they quit because of my personal involvement, which makes me feel really good. 
>> Reporter: He stopped drinking in 1995 when he was diagnosed with liver cancer and underwent a life-saving transplant.! In recent years, hagman appeared on the big screen in films like "nixon" and "primary colors." But it was his role as the charming and conniving oil man that audiences will never forget. 
>> Larry hagman's friends and fellow cast members have been sharing their memories and feelings about his death. This is from linda gray who writes, so sad to lose such a wonderful, dear, bigger-than-life friend. Larry hagman was one of a kind and will be with us all forever.

>>> There are signs of the truce between israel and hamas is holding this weekend. Palestinian sources say israel has eased restrictions on gazan fishermen, allowing them to go up to six miles from shore. The fishermen had been restricted from going more than about three miles into the mediterranean. Also palestinian farmers have resumed tending their land along the israeli border. A hamas official says that egyptian and israeli officials are expected to meet monday to discuss details of that cease-fire. 
>>> To egypt, what's happening there now makes it look like the arab spring never ended. This is the scene tonight in cairo. Demonstrators back spending the night in tahrir square. President mohamed morsi has announced sweeping new powers for himself ordering egyptian courts not to overturn any decree or law issued since he took office. This dramatic video is from the city of damanur where members of the muslim brotherhood exchanged gunfire with anti-morsi protesters. Reza sayah is tracking the story for us in cairo. 
>> Reporter: Demonstrations continue against egyptian president mohamed morsi. Not the big number that is we saw on friday, but certainly still a lot of people out here, lots of food stands. About 30 tents, which is an indication that many of these protesters want to be here for a while. It's not clear how long they're going to stay here. But when you talk to them, they seem determined to speak out against mr. Morsi's controversial decrees. 
>> The beginning of a new era for a tyrant. 
>> He's saying nobody can revise what I say. He's actually throwing the system out of the scene totally. 
>> Reporter: Big developments in meeting rooms and news conferences on saturday where factions opposed to mr. Morsi made moves to put pressure on the president. Of course, a number of his decrees seemed to weaken the judiciary. The judiciary answered back on saturday by calling for a nationwide judges strike. Also the supreme judicial council on saturday made a statement declaring his decrees an attack on the independence of the judiciary. Opposing factions also called for a 1 million-man protest and sit-in on tuesday. What does mr. Morsi's muslim brotherhood group do? They call for a 1 million-man protest, too, on tuesday. Critical days ahead for this country. Reza sayah, cnn, cairo.

>> Let's give you a look at tahrir square live coming in via satellite. It's just after 5:30 in the morning. Egypt's state-run news service reports that 261 people have been injured in the clashes around the country. 43 people remain hospitalized. 
>>> British police have made an arrest in a brutal daytime assault that went viral online. The victim was a 16-year-old girl who was knocked unconscious and lost three teeth when her face hit the sidewalk. Police released the video of the attack in the hopes of capturing the suspect. British tap loidz report the man said he didn't like the look on the victim's face. And that he was drinking and smoking marijuana before the attack. 
>>> Next, internal u.S. Military e-mails offer new details surrounding the death of osama bin laden. They were classified and kept away from the public until now. We'll have them for you. 

[00:36:48]


>>> We're learning new information about the super secret burial of osama bin laden and what happened in the hours AFTER U.S. NAVY S.E.A.L.s Stormed his compound inside a pakistan residence. 
>> Reporter: Tents and secretive transmissions as the aircraft carrier "carl vinson" waits for the body of osama bin laden. IT'S MAY 2nd, 2011. The al qaeda leader's just been KILLED BY NAVY S.E.A.L.s. In e-mails, two u.S. Navy admirals used code words to describe bin laden. The commander of the carrier strike group says, fedex delivered the package, both trucks are safely en route, home base. The e-mails were just released in response to a lawsuit by the group judicial watch. A few days earlier, the question was asked, do I need any spiritual ceremonial preparations? "Traditional procedures for islamic burial was followed. The deceased's body was washed and then placed in a white sheet. A military officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into arabic by a native speaker, after the words were complete, the body was placed on a prepared flat board, tipped up, whereupon the deceased's body slid into the sea. According to the e-mails, there aren't many witnesses. In ponce response to this question, the heading of one e-mail says, burial, no sailors watched. Another says, only a small group of the leadership was informed, less than a dozen total. And another indication of the secrecy of that part of the mission, an e-mail from a top admiral to joint chiefs chairman michael mullen, the paucity of documentary evidence in our possession is a reflection of the emphasis placed upon operational security. LATER ON MAY 2nd, A NOTE OF Gratitude. The deputy commander of the fleet tells the commander of the carrier group, thank you and your magnificent strike group for whatou did for your country today.

[ Male Announcer ] FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN, And made a monthly trip to the clinic to get his blood tested. But not anymore. Bob's doctor recommended a different option: Once-a-day xarelto????. Xarelto???? is the first and only once-a-day prescription blood thinner for patients with afib not caused by a heart valve problem, that doesn't require routine blood moniting. Like warfarin, xarelto???? is proven effective to reduce the risk of an afib-related stroke. There is limited data on how these drugs compare when warfarin is well managed. No routine blood monitoring means bob can spend his extra time however he likes. New zealand! Xarelto???? is just one pill a day, taken with the evening meal. And with no dietary restrictions, bob can eat the healthy foods he likes. Do not stop taking xarelto???? rivaroxaban without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping may increase your risk of having a stroke. Get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of bleeding, like unusual bruising or tingling. You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take xarelto???? with aspirin products, nsaids or blood thinners. Talk to your doctor before taking xarelto???? if you currently have abnormal bleeding. Xarelto???? can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. You are likely to bruise more easily on xarelto????, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop. Tell your doctors you are taking xarelto???? before any planned medical or dental procedures. Before starting xarelto????, tell your doctor about any conditions, such as kidney, liver or bleeding problems. Ready to change your routine? Ask your doctor about once-a-day xarelto????.

>>> Today is small business saturday. That's when shoppers across the nation are encouraged to support locally-owned stores, mom-and-pop operations that help communities thrive. It is sandwiched between black friday and cyber monday. American express founded small business saturday three years ago to help small businesses on one of the busiest shopping weekends of the year. 
>>> President obama participated in small business saturday. The president and his daughters, sasha and malia, shopped at an independent bookstore in arlington, virginia. The white house says the president bought 15 children's books to be given to family and friends. 
>>> And of course in the wake of superstorm sandy, many small businesses that were damaged or desperate -- they are desperate for help. Our poppy harlow takes a look at how sandy almost wiped out a family-run business in brooklyn. Now the owners are struggling to keep the business alive. 
>> Reporter: Right before superstorm sandy, the streets were quiet outside liberty industrial gas and welding. That's in less than ten minutes. This is nightfall as the waters begin to rise. At this point, I think it's gone. An industrial park in red hook, brooklyn, sandwiched between two bodies of water. So this is the canal coming into the harbor, which is going to meet up with the river. And liberty is right here. We really had quite a surge because of the canal and the river essentially meeting in this area and flooding these streets. 
>> Reporter: Ashley murray's family business, devastated. This is very hard for you personally. 
>> Yeah. It's just, we're devastated. It's been a devastating process and there needs to be a little bit more help. 
>> Reporter: Do you feel forgotten? 
>> A little bit, yeah, yeah. So this was once a really nice showroom. 
>> Reporter:80% of her inventory gone. 
>> Essentially we have moved everything into our stock room so that we can work from the sidewalk. So now this is where we are functioning our store from. We have one functioning computer, one printer and we have people coming in from the roll-down door. 

[00:44:05]


>> Reporter: Before sandy, you didn't have any debt. 
>> Right. 
>> Reporter: Now? 
>> Now, we're probably looking at $700,000 to $800,000 of debt. 
>> Reporter: What kind of help have you gotten from the government? 
>> Nothing from the government. 
>> Reporter: Ashley found government loans with 6% interest. Her bank did better with a line of credit at just over 3%. 
>> We had chop saws and boxed items that -- 
>> Reporter: There go the lights again. The challenge of doing business these days, even the generators fail. These are so bad here in red hook that this business right next door to ashley's is literally drying invoices like this with a hair dryer. What does this business mean to you? 
>> Everything. It's my life. 
>> Reporter: Ashley's employees watched her grow up working along side her father. If this business went under? 
>> I would go under, too. 
>> Reporter: Now it's up to her to save their jobs. 
>> There's so much history here. The community, our customers, we really do have -- we have a great business here. I think we can make it great again.

>>> Black friday, drew bigger crowds this year than last. So if you thought it was busier, you were right. But shoppers were less willing to part with their hard-earned dollars. Black friday foot traffic jumped 3.5% with more than 370 million store visits, according to the research firm shopper track. But sales fell nearly 2% to $11.2 billion. For some shoppers, it is more apt to call yesterday black and blue friday, clever. The pushing, the shoving, the tussling, the yelling became as much a part of the consumer event as the sg. And here now, a glimpse at some of the black friday free-for-all. ???????????? 
>> [ bleep ]! I will stab one of you 
[ bleep ]! ???????????? 
>> I literally got squished. Half of my body was in that door. That was insane. 
>> Yeah! ????????????

>> I can't believe how many people love underwear. 
>> And another christmas classic just like that is born. That brings a whole new meaning to the term bargain hunter. Let's bring in our cultural observer and comedian bill santiago. Black friday now starts on thursday. I know that because my own family participated. Right after the pumpkin pie is served, shoppers are rushing through their meals to get in line at the store. It's like, hurry up, honey, eat fast, we need to get up there to the mall. 
>> A lot of people skipping the pumpkin pie so they can get out there and -- 
>> isn't that sort of desecrating a holiday to get in line? What are your thoughts? 
>> It's turning into its own new holiday. It really is cutting into thanksgiving. It's amazing that people get out there and get into that kind of trouble if they have that much energy left after gorging themselves on turkey which is supposed to make you drowsy. Imagine if they weren't sedated with that how much trouble they could be causing. All this to celebrate the season of the birth of the prince of peace and goodwill towards the jerk trying to cut in line in front of you. I don't know where it's leading to, but it's spinning off definitely into its own holiday, for sure. 
>> Right. You're absolutely right. It tends to, of course, overshadow the whole meaning of the season. But it also seems -- and as someone alluded to in that youtube video -- people seem to enjoy it, that it is a spectator kind of event now, that more and more people are coming out not just for the bargains but apparently to see what the heck happens. 
>> Yeah, I think the bargains is the least of it. I think people -- the discounts are nice. But people are really going out for the thrill. They're thrill seeking. It's becoming like an american version of the ruing of the bulls meets the price is right. It's got commercialism. But it's not about the 25% off but the 50% chance of survival. If people get home alive, that's the bonus. 

[00:52:19]


>> I like your imagery of the running of the b pamplona. Certainly fits. 
>> Somebody gets trampled for a laptop. People are willing to risk their lives for it? 
>> But could it be that all of this of which we jest could be threatened by people just doing the sacrilegious thing of shopping online, not going to the stores? 
>> Absolutely not. Outbidding somebody on ebay does not give you that same in-person thrill of grabbing the toy out of somebody's hands. Until they can come up with some sort of digital avatars that will allow you to battle out for it online, cyber monday is going to be a far second to black friday. 
>> I felt very bad for that gentleman who was wearing the hat and had the colorful expletive. 
>> Man, that's the least of it. People are packing guns, running people over. They're stealing shopping bags out of teenagers walking out of bed, bath & beyond. No lack of mayhem out there. 
>> No, there isn't. I'm wondering, in some way, we build this up. And I don't mean just the media. Of course, the department stores, everybody makes a big deal about these are the lowest prices and they go on sale at this time. It's almost like we've set the scenes for this kind of -- 
>> yeah, there's a patriotic component as well. Like if you don't get out there and shop on this day, risk your life on this day, the whole economy could go into the tubes. It will be very black for the country if these stores do not get in the black on black friday. It's very twisted, but it's quintessentially american. 
>> You've wrapped it up very well. Bill santiago, thanks very much. A pleasure to talk to you. 
>> Until next time. 
>>> Well, a world war ii coded message found in a very strange place, and could you crack the code because nobody else seems to be able to?

>>> British spies are stumped. The skeleton of this pigeon dates back to world war ii. It was carrying a coded message in a little canister that was attached to its leg. The british intelligence agency is hoping to trace the original of this. Now, here's the part where you can help because they have so far been unable to read the message. And they say that's really a tribute to the code-maker's skills. But about 250,000 carrier pigeons were used during world war ii delivering messages from mainland europe back to great britain. And everyone wants to know, could it have changed the outcome of the war in some way? We don't know. We'll find out. 
>>> Another interesting piece of video. Talk about caught in traffic. The owners of this home in, where else, china, refuse to take the government's offer saying that it was too low. So what did the government do? They built a highway around the couple's five-floor building. The owners, who are in their 60s, HAVE BEEN REPORTEDLY Holding out for a better offer for the last four years. Good luck with that. And all of you parents will certainly have an opinion about this. A mom and dad in florida have had it up to here with their teenage daughter. She won't listen, won't follow the family rules. So her punishment was for a few hours of public humiliation. Take a look at this report from clair mets.

>> Reporter: For about two hours, jasmine was alternately defiant and devastated over what her parents call tough love. 
>> That's not love. How the -- that's not love.

>> The courts say, why didn't you do some preventative stuff first? This is our prevent tif stuff. This is the beginning of what she's doing to eventually wind up in prison. 
>> Reporter: The sheriff's department stopped out here briefly but did not take any action. They say those are the girls' parents, they have a right to free speech, as long as they're not impeding traffic or doing anything else to violate the law, there's no problem here.

>> Reporter: When j.R. Was shot by an unknown assailant, it became one of the most famous cliffhangers in tv history, watched by 300 million people from all around the world. Hagman never expected the show to endure.

>> Reporter: In fact, the dallas franchise was so successful, the series was recently reprised. The u.S. Network tnt brought it back with a new generation of ewings, and hagman came back, too, returning as j.R. Once again. Critics say he was the best thing about "dallas."

>>> Sad news in the sports world today as well. Former world champion boxer hector camacho has died. I want to bring in nick valencia to talk more about this. From what I understand, he was taken off life support in puerto rico, right? 
>> He was. I just got off the phone with a spokesperson with the hospital there in puerto rico. She said hector camacho suffered a second heart attack this morning at about 1:45. Shortly afterwards, his heart stopped working. He was taken off life support and officially pronounced dead. If you remember, he was clinically pronounced brain dead on thursday, but today he was taken off life support. Known for just as much for his flamboyance. But later in his life, he really gained notoriety for his battles with drug addiction and the law. Now he is pronounced dead today at the age of 50. 
>> For those of us who haven't been following us, just get us up to speed on exactly how this happened, why he was on life support to begin with and where the suspects are. 
>> Early this week, he was with a friend outside of a bar in the early morning hours, at which point there was a passing gunman that opened fire on the car that he was in. It killed his childhood friend. He was shot in the jaw, right in the face. And he was severely injured. Initially, doctors said he was expected to survive, but he took a turn for the worst, suffered a heart attack and then suffered a secondary heart attack earlier this morning at about 1:45 and was taken off life support. 

[00:08:24]


>> And the gunmen -- and there's another suspect that are still on the run? 
>> Our local affiliate in puerto rico reported there was a shootout nearby, and those gunmen managed to escape after that shootout. I spoke to the puerto rico police department earlier this morning. They didn't have an update for me on the status of where the supports, are but we're working that part of the investigation. 
>> All right, nick. You'll keep us up to date on that. Thank you for that.

In egypt, anti-government protests are much smaller than they have been the last couple of days. These are live pictures out of tahrir sqcairo. The country supreme judicial council is calling morsi's move an unprecedented attack on the independence of the judicial branch. We've been focusing this morning on the cease-fire in the middle east and the prospects of long-term peace between israel and hamas. Joining me as they do here every week. Cnn contributor maria cardona and amy holmes. Good morning to both of you. On the world's political stage, maria, who was the big winner here? 

[00:14:30]


>> I think because there was a cease-fire, the winners for now are the israelis and the palestinians who actually were suffering through this. Politically, I think that president obama is a winner here. Tanyahu is a winner here. Hillary clinton is a winner here. I think hamas is a winner here because they now have shown that they are legitimate, that they have to be taken seriously politically in order to get any real permanent solution done, which at the end of the day, i think is what everybody is really looking for. 
>> Amy, what do you think? 
>> Well, up until 24 hours ago, I would have said president mohamed morsi. Clearly he felt that his position was greatly strengthened by brokering this peace deal between israel and hamas in gaza. But I think he's overplayed his hand. You just showed that video of the protests there in cairo. We'll have toee where this goes. The great fear is that the muslim brotherhood, like other fascist organizations, will be one man, one vote, one time. And we've seen the mu brotherhood move very swift tloi consolidate their power. 
>> The u.S. Stood squarely behind israel throughout this conflict. Does that quiet any critics who thought president obama was soft on israeli security? 
>> I think it absolutely should. What we saw even before the election here in the united states is that netanyahu has said time and again even in the face of critics that there has been no stronger ally to israel than the united states. The criticism coming, though. After this incident, I really do think the critics will be quieted. There's a lot of talk about how successful the iron dome program was. It deflected over 80% of the rockets that were fired into israel. President obama has committed more funding to iron dome. And I think that it really does cement the fact that this president and this administration has been a tremendous frien and ally to israel and that is not going to change. 

[00:16:37]


>> Looking to the future, amy, with egypt's mohamed morsi stepping in to broker the peace, does it show that the region no longer needs the.S. To take the lead role? Certainly secretary of state hillary clinton was there, but maybe not a lead role anymore in this type of negotiation. 
>> No, and in fact, the united states was very crucial to president morsi negotiating that peace deal because he gets a lot of money in aid, $3 billion a year from the united states and he has a very fragile economy. But I'd like to go back to president obama. And he is getting praise from critics even on the right who saw that his first administration, he himself said that in order to be able to influence israel, that the united states needed to create daylight with israel. Well, now it appears that he has reversed that position and his position now is that the united states needs to back israel, and as he said over and over and over, israel has a right to defend itself. 
>> So israel has elections coming up in january. Maria, how do you think this is all going to play out in that election? 
>> I think that this incident, again, like I said in my first answer to you, netanyahu comes out looking very, very strong. And in fact, his opponent, who was as I understand going to announce a run against netanyahu before all of this started, has now backed down, and now it might be too late for him to announce anything, for anyone to announce rung against netanyahu, and he certainly has been strengthened. He showed that he was -- he had the ability to go up against hamas, to defend israel against anything without, frankly, starting a ground war or any sort of ground invasion. So I think that in order to -- or in his ability to really walk that balance, walk that tight rope, he has been strengthened. Now, the cease fire right now is very fragile. So we'll see. As we know in politics, anything can happen. So we'll see. But for right now, if things stand the way they are, I think netanyahu is very strong for his re-election.

>>> Welcome back, everyone. I'm randi kaye. Here are five storiethat we are watching this morning. Sad news from the world of intertinment. Actor larry hagman has died. His family says it was complications from cancer. Hagman is best known for his iconic performance as j.R. Ewing on the tv show "dallas." He was the ultimate villain. But today, people are remembering him as much more. Peter fonda said goodbye to his friend on twitter, saying hagman brought so much fun to everyone's life.

>>> The sounds of protests in egypt's capital, cairo. Demonstrators are furious at what they say is the president's new power grab. Mohamed morsi has issued a decree disabling the courts and giving himself unchecked powers. Egypt's muslim brotherhood is coming to morsi's support. It's called for nationwide demonstrations tomorrow and a million man march starting tuesday in cairo. 
>>> The body of yasser arafat will be exhumed on tuesday. Forensic experts from france, switzerland and russia will take samples to test for possible poisoning. Mr. Arafat's body will then be reburied in the west bank. Palestinian officials hope the test will clear up questions over whether arafat's death in 2004 was the result of poi zonk by a radioactive substance. 

[00:31:27]


>>> Let's get back to the middle east now. There is a cease-fire in place. That is good for now. But the violence could easily spark up again without a long-term solution. Joining me now, a former palestinian negotiator and adviser for palestinian president mahmoud abbas. Now she is at the institute for middle east understanding. Good morning to you what. Do you see is the most important issue for palestinians? 
>> Good morning. Well, I think if we're going to be honest and move forward, then we're going to have to begin to address israel's 45-year military occupation, and in particular, it's ongoing siege and blockade of the gaza strip. That's with respect to gaza. But in terms of the bigger picture, it's not just a question of gaza, but also a question of israel finally ending its military rule over palestinians living in the west bank and in east jerusalem as well. This is the only way that we're going to begin to move forward in this region. Without addressing this underlying problem, which is israel's denial of freedom to millions of palestinians, then we're just going to continue to see violence in the middle east. 
>> Many folks in gaza, of course, want this blockade lifted so they can go in and out at their free will. But if israel were to abandon the blockade, especially on the egyptian border, what is to stop the flow of weapons from iran into gaza? 
>> Well, it's important to look back in history and to see how the border was actually operated in the past in. The past, from 2005 onward, there were european monitors at that border making sure precisely what was coming in and what was going out. It ended up being that in 2006, these monitors ended up being ousted by israel, not being allowed in, and this is why we now have these tunnels that are in place. If we want to move forward, it's a question not only of ending the blockade of gaza in terms of the egyptian gaza border, but also allowing palestinians who live in the gaza strip to see their families in the west bank as well. There are arrangements that can be made, particularly with european monitors and other monitors in place.Life, including down to the very caloric intake that they've determined will prevent an't the same really be said then for hamas, that they need to recognize israel's right to exist? 

[00:34:18]


>> Well, in the past, this is precisely what hamas has done. The spiritual leader of hamas came out and said that if israel ended its occupation over the west bank in the gaza strip, that it would enter into a long-term cease-fire, or truce with israel. He was then assassinated. His successor made similar remarks, was also assassinated. His successor also made similar remarks, was also assassinated. And even the current leader of hamas has also made similar remarks regarding israel. So I think if we're going to move forward, it's not just a question of recognizing hamas, which needs to be done, but also beginning to put into place this idea that we simply can't get rid of hamas. Hamas is not going to go away and that israel has -- and the united states has to now deal with them. 
>> Can there really, though, be peace as long as the palestinians are split into these two factions? You have the palestinian authority in the west bank and hamas in charge in gaza. 
>> Well, the fact that there is a split between the west bank and the gaza strip has certainly hurt palestinian interests, but it shouldn't be used as an excuse to continue to allow israel to deny millions of palestinians their freedom. This is what is precisely been done. Israel comes forward and says we refused to talk to hamas. We don't want to talk to mahmoud abbas. So the settlements continue. The land confiscation continues, the blockade continues. So rather than the world looking for excuses as to why not to pressure israel, they should be looking for reasons so as to pressure israel to finally end its military rule over the palestinians and let them live in freedom.

>>> A very good morning to washington, d.C. Congress is going get back to work this week. Very busy, of course. Top of the agenda, the fiscal cliff. 38 days and counting. In fact, that's how long we have until the country hits the so called fiscal cliff when automatic spending cuts go into effect. It is main focus in washington. Maria cardona and amy holmes are back with me now to talk about this. Saxby chambliss lashed out at grover nordqvist. Nordqvist and his group are the ones that pushed that no new taxes pledge signed bay majority of republicans in congress. Here's what chambliss says. I care more about my country than I do a 20-year-old pledge. He's willing to let the political consequences take care of themselves. Raising taxes has been at the center of the fiscal cliff dispute. Democrats demanding it. Republicans saying no way. So amy, is this a sizable crack in the republican armor? 
>> We are seeing that the two sides are going to need to negotiate if we don't go over the fiscal cliff. I would point out that patty murray, a democratic senator from washington state says we should go over it, certainly in contrast to the rest of her party. So I think that we're seeing negotiations on both sides. But I want to point out what the fiscal cliff really means. It means the tax rates go up for everyone across the board. If you earn a paycheck, your taxes are going up. That's not just your federal income tax. That's your social security tax as well. We've been on a social security tax holiday, people are unaware of this, only as employees paying in 2.4%. After december, everyone will be paying 2% more. So this really is taxmaggedon. 
>> You heard it there, maria. House speaker john boehner says that he wants obama care on the table in this fiscal cliff negotiation. The president has said he's willing to thereon any good ideas. I'm not sure if he's going to think this is a good idea. You think he might listen to this one? 

[00:41:35]


>> I think he'll listen, but i think at the end of the day, it's going to be what are in the details. I think what we need to remember, what came out of this election, the clear mandate of this election was two things. Number one, for our leaders to come together in a bipartisan manner to put everything on the table, to find real solutions. Mber two, that the majority of americans agreed with president obama's vision of one of the ways to fix the fiscal cliff had to be to put new revenues and to raise the tax rates of the wealthiest americans. President obama won eight out of the ten wealthiest counties in this country in this election, randi, which means even the wealthiest understand they have to put some skin in the game. So I think that going into this, I applaud senator chambliss, because that tax pledge I think should go the way of the dodo bird, because once you box yourself in, you are not leaving yourself open to some real solutions. Americans want real solutions. 
>> Well, I'm not trying to dump coal in your holiday stocking, but when you look at situation, should we really expect a lame duck congress to fix a problem that we have been staring at for years? 
>> The whole reason why we have this fiscal cliff looming is because they couldn't fix the problem the first time around with the debt ceiling, so they built in what was supposed to be these disciplinary measures that would force both sides to come to the table. Now, what saxby chambliss is talking about, the grover nordqvist tax pledge, he could very well be talking about the social security tax, which i think both sides actually will agree raise back to that 6.2 level because it was supposed to be a payroll tax holiday. As for having skin in the game, the top 5% of earnings in this country, they earn a little over 30% of all income in this country and they pay nearly 60% of federal personal incomes tax. So this whole idea of fair share to me has been a complete distortion of who pays taxes in this country. Now, moving forward, what is the best tax plan that will get this country moving? Remember, it was president obama himself who said raising taxes in a weak economy, everyone agrees, is a bad idea. 

[00:43:53]


>> So, do you think we'll get anything done, maria? 
>> Yeah, I think we do. Because again, the man date that came out of this election was for everybody to come together, and what republicans need to understand, and I think that they do, which is why you're seeing senators like chambliss bakically say that he's turning his back on this pledge, is that the gop has a massive problem with their brand right now. They are seen by a jimmer fredette -- majority of the american people as obstructionist. It's the reason they gave president obama four more years to finish what he started. When you have people on the right from ben stein to bill crystal basically saying that raising taxes on the rich should actually be on the table and they should give president obama what they want, I think they understand the brand problem that the gop has going into this. 
>> Maria cardona, amy holmes, great to have you on this morning, as all. Thank you both. 
>> Thank you, randi.

At the end of the today, I think there are multiple theories out there on how the universe was created and I think this is a country where people should have the opportunity to teach them ink parents should be able to teach their kids what their faith says, what science says, whether the earth was created in seven days or seven actual eras, I'm not sure we'll ever be able to answer that. Bill nye joins me now from los angeles. Good morning. So you, like other say that we know how old the earth is and that the topic is not even up for debate. But every so often a politician makes headlines either denying science or casting some doubt here. So tell us, as far as do you know it? 

[00:55:19]


>> The earth is four and a half, 4.5, 4 billion years old. So there are certain elements and especially the big bang, and we rely on those elements for our everyday life in order to have the quality of life that we have. But the idea is certain elements change from one element to another. The verb is they transmute, and the classic is our good friend rubidium becomes stronthium. The reaction of that is 48 billion years. Sometimes the laboratories will observe something for 15 years to get just it just exactly right. So then you work back ward to the age of the rocks. The thing -- let me just say about mr. Rubio's comment, you talked about opposing theories. But he went on to claim that there's no connection between our scientific understanding of the age of the earth and the economy and I very strongly disagree with that. 
>> Let me interrupt you there and read that quote because this was another part of his answer to "gq," saying that's another dispute and I think it has nothing to do with the economic growth of the united states. I think the age of the universe has zero to do with how our economy is going to grow. So what do you make of this? You obviously don't agree that science has nothing to do with the economy and growth. 
>> So the reason we have smart phones, the reason we have television, we'reo talk on opposite sides of the continent, the classic example for me is smoke detectors. The reason we have these things is because we understand the reactions, thereactions that take place in elements and protons and neutrons. Without that deep understanding, we wouldn't have everything you can touch and see in our environment. The built environment. So this claim is just as far as I'm concerned is just wrong. Now, I'm not going after anybody's religion. That's not it. Just the earth is not 6,000 or 10,000 years theseiscoveries for our everyday life, especially here in the developed world. 

[00:57:54]


>> And what's the danger -- 
>> so my claim -- 
>> let me ask you about the danger in terms of what this teaches children. Do you still believe that teaching children -- that the earth is anything but 4.5 billion years old, the same as teaching them that it's flat? 
>> Well, the word same -- it's a pretty good analogy. In that you can show -- you very easily demonstrate that the earth is not flat. With a little more understanding, you can show that the earth cannot possibly be 10,000 years old. It's just wrong. So what you're asking a kid to do, you're asking that kid not to use his or her critical thinking skills, not to use the ingenuity that made the united states what it is today. made these remarkable discoveries through diligence and careful scientific understanding. And it is in every way connected to the economy. Sotalking earlier about the branding problem that this political party has. This is something theytechnology. 
>> Do you think the age of the earth and creationism should be a political issue, or no? 
>> Well, here's my -- this is what I think started that you're taking time with me. The -- what makes it political is when you want to use tax dollars intended for science education to teach this obviously wrong idea. Nonscientific idea. So that's where everybody gets -- that's where it becomes political. If you recall, the judge in dover, pennsylvania, called it breathtaking inanity. But it means roughly silly. The idea is so preposterous that the y inhaled strongly. 

[00:59:58]


>> It does have a lot of people -- 
>> it's a deep concern for a country that wants to be a world leader, wants to grow, wants to ve jobs and mi class jobs. 
>> No question ab it. Thank you very much for weighing in. Appreciate that, bill nye. We have much more ahead in the next hour of "cnn saturday morning." It starts right now. 
>>> This is "cnn saturday morning." IT IS SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 24th. Good morning, everyone. I'm randi kaye. Hollywood is mourning the loss of tv icon larry hagman. We'll look back at the actor's life and unforgettable career and hear how his famous co-stars are reacting to news of his death. 
>>> In massachusetts, a massive gas explosion as a strip club caught on video. worse. And if you missed black friday, get ready for cyber monday. But before you buy anything online, there are things that you need to know to avoid getting ripped off. 
>>> He was the bad guy that america loved to hate, and today family, friends, and fans all over the world are celebrating the life of larry hagman. The 81-year-old actor played many roles over his decades long career, but it was his masterful portrayal of j.R. Ewing, the good-looking greedy oilycoon in "dallas" that made him a superstar. 
>> You drove cliff to try to commit suicide? 
>> How did like that? 
>> He reprised his role earlier this year. Behind the scenes, hagman suffered several health scares over the years, some related to his battles wialcoholism and smoking. It was complications from smoking that took his life yesterday at a hospital in dallas. Fans and ll long to his passing. Karine winter is live at his star on the walk of fame. 

[01:02:16]


>> Reporter: A lot of people will be coming out here paying their respects on hagman's famous star on the hollywood walk of fame here. Right in the heart of hollywood. As you mentioned, an outpouring of support from hollywood. So many people who have championed larry's career over the years, who worked with him, who have known him personally, friends, family members. I want to read a handful to you. First one from joan collins. She wrote "oh no, just heard about larry, he was magnificent inspired me to play alexis, that famous role on "dynasty"." Barbara eden, who hagman co-starred with in "i dream of jeannie," the little show that went on to become such a huge hit, especially iyndication. She wrote larry was always simply larry. It was just who he was. I'm so thankful that this past year I was able to spend time with him and experience yet again larry in all his big texas bravado. Linda gray wrote so sad to lose such a wonderful, dear bigger than life friend. Larry hagman was one of a kind-and-will be with us forever. And finally, patrick duffy, another dallas co-star wrote, and this one so touching, my friend is taking a break. Pardon my silence. Love, patrick. Those are just a few responses we've been seeing on twitter, on facebook. As you can imagine, there will be more that people will be writing about as the morning progresses. Larry hagman, he really became a house hole name back in the late 1970s. That villainous role on "dallas." A man that we love to hate. Such a huge show for him back then.T believe it or not, he still acted throughout the years. Most recently, "desperate housewives." He was involved in big films, blockbuster films from "nixon" to "primary colors." You mentioned off the top, tnt's reboot of "dallas." He had to have been a part of that, so such a storied, storied career. The big question is although this is secondary, what that show are going to be doing right now, we know that hagman was filming scenes for second season, which kicks off in january, and deadline.Com is also reporting that hagman had completed a number of those scenes, a number of those episodes, six out of the 15, so writers will perhaps have to go back to the drawing board to recreate that storyline with his passing right now. Production is going to change a little bit. But that's all secondary. Right now, everyone, especially folks here in hollywood, they're pausing to remember the life of this iconic actor. 

[01:04:57]


>> And he will certainly be remembered very, very fondly. Kareen winter, thank you for that. 
>>> Hector camacho, the former boxing champion, is dead. He was taken off life support today by his family. Last night, his mother, maria, told reporters in puerto rico, "for me, he's not alive." The former boxing champ was shot in the face outside a bar near san juan news night. He was at first expected to survive, but his condition worsened and had been declared clinically brain dead this week. 
>>> One of the fbi's most wanted fugitives is in jose luis saenz was captured and faces prosecution in los angeles for the murder of two gang members and his girlfriend in 1998 and ten years later. He was added to the most wanted list three years ago. The fbi offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. 
>>> A frightening scene in springfield, massachusetts. A gas explosion ripped through a strip club, leveling the building. You saw it right there. Caught on camera. Fortunately, about an hour earlier, emergency crews had evacuated the area after someone complained about a strong gas odor. 18 people were hurt. Most of them were firefighters and gas company workers. The explosion was so strong it damaged two dozen other buildings and could be felt ten miles away. 
>> I jumped. I could feel the garbage cans move next to me. I could hear the window shaking. It could tell that it came from this part of the city. 
>> Officials are investiing what caused that blast. 
>>> Alabama is dead, another critically injured, after they were shot during a domestic disputd call. Police say the officers were called to the home to settle an argument, and that's when the suspect michael jansen allegedly opened fire. Police say jansen was also shot and killed. 
>>> We all know of the enormous that arose after 9/11. Similar issues are emerging in the aftermath of hurricane sandy. We'll investigate in hard-hit long beach. A 

[01:10:14]


>>> gas rationing ended this morning in new york city, more than three weeks after superstorm sandy. The city had been rationing gasoline by odd and even days SINCE NOVEMBER 9th. If you can believe it, 30,000 people are still without power in new york and new jersey. Governor chris christie says the storm caused an estimated $29.4 billion in damage to new jersey alone, far higher than early estimates. Adding to the concerns, medical issues that are beginning to emerge in sandy's wake. Cnn's mary snow reports from new york's long beach. 
>> Reporter: Lurking in the devastation from sandy is yet another worry for homeowners. Exposure to toxins, mold, and dust, and in some places, sewage. Long beach homeowner fred morello will only enter his house wearing a protective suit and mask as he clears out areas that were submerged in several feet of water. 
>> I am concerned about mold, sure. But at this particular point, i don't have the time for it. I have things to get done and they've got to get done, so i protect myself as best I can. 
>> Reporter: While he says he has no time to get checked for the cough he now has, others have been showing up to tents set up by federal medical assistance teams. COMMANDER kevin McGillicutty says besides people seeking psychological treatment, they mostly come in complaining of coughs, bronchitis and asthma since the base was set up. 
>> We've been treating 70 patients a day. Since we've started this base, we've treated over a thousand patients. 
>> Majority of them with pulmonary problems? 
>> That would probably be the best guess. 
>> Reporter: The commander stresses it's unclear how many cases are linked to people with chronic conditions being worsened, combined with the fact that access to their regular medication has been tough. Some of those questions are in the hands of the long beach medical center, which is taking over now that it's been able to set up a makeshift emergency room in its parking lot. The hospital is still closed cause of the storm. Dr. Robert cantor heads the e.R. Unit and says it's the unknowns that concern him. 

[01:12:29]

>>> High-tech toys are big this holiday season, but actually finding them can be quite difficult. Karen reports on ways to track down the most popular presents without wasting a whole lot of time. 
>> Reporter: Just like their parents, many kids want tech toys this holiday season. Whether it's a tablet designed just for them or something that sbrarkts with a device that they already have. 
>> You download the furby app and you can open up different things in it. 
>> Reporter: But with the same things topping lots of wish lists, they can be tough to snag. 
>> Both the tablets and furby will be difficult to find. The purple and the teal are particularly difficult colors to get your hands on. 
>> Reporter: Luckily, tech makes the chase easier. Toy expert lori shack says the search no longer entails going store to store. 
>> I'm a big fan of sticking in the name of the toy, googling it and I find it amazon, google, toys 'r' us, walmart, everyone is going to come up, and I can choose by price or knowing they have inventory on it. 
>> Reporter: Similarly, the rez laser app lets you see what stores have something in stock. Toys 'r' us revamped its apps for the holidays and users can search for a toy at nearby stores and arrange pickup directly from their smart phone. And if mom or dad spots that store in target shelves, they can keep the surprise under wraps by scanning a qr code on the box and ordering online. 
>>> Black friday may be over, but the hunt for bargains has just begun. 147 million shoppers are expected to hit the stores this weekend. And then there is cyber monday. Online shopping is expected to climb and projected at $96 billion. How do you stay safe when you're browsing for bargains? I SPOKE EARLIER with McAfee's online security expert and asked him about social media scams. 

[01:18:23]


>> So bad guys are creating fake social media pages with too good to be true offers and then luringsuspecting victims. Once you click on those links, it can infect your page and your pc. Just delete those links, don't go to those status updates and be careful out there. 
>> All right. That's good advice. What about malicious mobile apps? I mean, we're downloading apps all the time on our phones and things. 
>> Yeah. Recent studies show that as much as 33% of mobile apps are actually sharing information that you'd rather not, like location. They are actually -- when you download these apps, they can even infect your mobile device with spyware. So only download mobile applications from say google play or apple itunes, whereas if you go to third party sites, your device can be infected. Also be aware of what information you're communicating on certain apps. Always update your mobile device with -virus as well. 
>> And a lot of people during the holiday season, they love to get those gift cards, but you say some of them are bogus. 
>> Yeah. Bad guys are creating fake e-tailer websites. They are designed to get you to enter your credit card information. Often these fake sites revolve around gift cards. So if you're searching out a gift card, you don't know if that site is going to be there the next day. Basically you should buy your gift cards at the kiosk at the mall, or at the brick-and-mortar store, places that you know, like, and trust and always tell the people who receive your gifts to spend them immediately. 
>> We've heard the term "fishing" before in our e-mails. Now there's this holiday term called smishing. 
>> That is to text message what fishing is to e-mails. Basically bad guys send you text messages designed to get you to visit a website. Once you click on these links, a couple things can happen. You can download a virus right to your device, to your mobile device, essentially infecting it with spyware that spies on your activity, or it will bring you to a device that will ultimately give away your credit card data. Any time you receive a text message for an offer, just hit delete. Always be careful out there. And update your device with anti-virus as well.

>>> He was a perfect blend of boxer and entertainer. Now hector camacho, the champion who defeated fighters like sugar ray leonard and roberto duran is dead. Joining me now is nick valencia to talk a little bit more about this. It's not really a surprise, right? Because he had been declared officially brain dead this week, but now the question was whether or not he would be taken off life support? 
>> Right. On thursday he was declared clinically brain dead. Today he suffered another heart attack. Shortly after the shooting, he had had an initial heart attack. That's when his condition went from expecting to survive to being put on life support. 
>> We know certainly he was an incredible boxer. He brushed gloves some of the greatest. But he also had some clashes with the law. 
>> Some people chim the last of the great middleweights. In 2007, he robbed a computer store. He served about two weeks. In 2005, dating back to his drug problems, he was arrested on a robbery charge. Police found ecstasy on him. 
>> We know that cocaine was found where he was shot. Any leads or suspects? 
>> Spoke to the puerto rico police department earlier today and their investigation is still ongoing. We know that there was a shootout, according to our local affiliate, a shootout locally. The suspects got away. They fled on foot. They have not been arrested. This is his hometown just outside of a bar. A passerby came and shot at the car, but no drugs were taken. Nine bags of cocaine found, a tenth bag open, no drugs taken at the scene. His friend died, he was in the driver's seat. Hector camacho took a bullet to the jaw and severely injured. Today he is dead at 50 years old. 
>> He had done so much trying to help crime in the area and clean himself up. 
>> He was trying to clean up his image. He was on "dancing with the stars" on univision as well as had his own quest for love on a youtube channel. He was trying to rebrand a more cleaned up image of himself. But evidently, too little too late. 

[01:26:59]


>> All right, nick, appreciate the update. 
>>> Celebrations in gaza as hamas declares it's the winner in its standoff in israel. We'll tell you why the group indeed may have emerged from the conflict even stronger. If we want to improve our schools... ... what should we invest in? Maybe new buildings? What about updated equipment? They can help, but recent research shows... ... nothing transforms schools like investing in advanced teacher education. Let's build a strong foundation. Let's invest in our teachers so they can inspire our students. Let's solve this. 

[01:31:07]


>>> Egyptian president mohamed morsi triggered massive protests when he announced thursday that courts cannot overturn any law he's issued since taking office in june. Critics call it an anti-democratic power grab. Today, egypt's highest judicial body called on morsi to stay out of all judicial matters. 
>>> Life is slowly returning to normal in gaza three days after hamas militants and israel agreed to stop fighting. Children returned to school today and despite a shooting near the border yesterday that reportedly left one palestinian dead, the cease-fire is holding. The next phase of the truce talks of potentially easing israel's economic blockade in gaza and opening border crossings. The death toll in gaza was much higher than in israel, but hamas is calling the conflict and the truce a political victory. Brian todd has that story. 
>> Reporter: In gaza, celebrations and declaration of victory. This is the side which had scores of its facilities destroyed, more than a hundred of its people killed. Yet for the leaders of hamas, it signifies a strategy that works. 
>> I think people fear now that the only way to push for different positions is resistance. 
>> Reporter: Many observers agree hamas emerges from this conflict stronger than it was before. 
>> In ways, it's con sal dated, it's supporting gaza. 
>> Reporter: It was hamas's rockets that put the palestinian cause back on the world stage, not the diplomatic tack taken by mahmoud abbas. Hamas also has the support of regional powers turkey, egypt and qatar, making the group much less isolated than it was before. Many say that hamas's street cred among palestinians have grown stronger. Abbas remained almost invisible. 

[01:33:15]


>> Mahmoud abbas never looks good when he's standing by while palestinians are dying. Of course, israelis are dying, too, but for palestinians who are naturally going to feel a very strong sense of empathy and solidarity with their brethren in gaza doesn't look mahmoud -- good. 
>> Reporter: What does the strengthening of hamas, which the u.S. And israel consider a terrorist group, mean for security in the region? 
>> I don't think that hamas will become moderate, but I think it's much more pragmatic than many people actually attribute to it. They saw that the alternative to a cease-fire will be a ground invasion by the israelis, which they knew would hit them even further. 
>> Reporter: And it's not as if israel never negotiates with hamas. The israelis had to have spoken indirectly with them to achieve this cease-fire. After they captured and held the soldier, israel negotiated to get him released. Brian todd, cnn, washington. 
>>> Earlier this morning, i talked with the spokesman for the israeli government. I asked him if israel believes the cease-fire with hamas will be something permanent. 
>> We hope that this will be long-standing. We have no illusions about hamas's agenda. They haven't suddenly moderated their positions. But in the framework of the understandings, the hamas movement has promised egypt to abide by this cease-fire and that gives us a certain amount of confidence. One way or the other, we hope this quiet for the people of southern israel will last. After all, they deserve a period of quiet. They've been on the receiving ends of those rockets from gaza day in and day out for too long now, and if they get peace and quiet, if they no longer have to live in fear of that incoming rocket from gaza, if they don't have to run to bomb shelters, that's a good thing and we're thaful for it. 

[01:35:18]


>> Some israelis have been subjected to those rocket attacks, have said that they were disappointed that israel did not take a stronger action. A poll in israel showed that 49% of israelis surveyed wanted the government to continue the military operation. Why did israel decide to go with a truce at this point? 
>> I think we thought that the opportunity that egypt put on the table, that this halt of hostilities was worth exploring. It was an opportunity that we should explore. Ultimately, if hamas breaks its commitments to the egyptians, if hamas does reignite violence and start shooting at our people again, we always have the option to act to defend ourselves, as any country would if it was attacked. We hope we don't go there, but once again, if hamas breaks its violation, israel will respond. We hope they don't. We hope the cease-fire lasts. 
>> The israeli prime minister, benjamin netanyahu, has said that israel will not hesitate to take strong action in the future if it's necessary. Could that involve a ground invasion? Is that still on the table? 
>> If hamas breaks its commitments to the egyptians, if hamas does escalate the situation again, in fairness, I'd have to say that all options would be on the table, because then we will say that we've given diplomacy a try and diplomacy didn't work. And no government would sit idly by and see its civilian population targeted by terrorists shooting rockets into our cities. No one would stand for that and we won't either. The biggest challge, I think, to this quiet is, of course, iran. Because hamas's arsenal of missiles, those weapons that were fired at israeli cities, has been substantially depleted, because of our surgical strikes against their arsenals, against their military machine, and they have very few left. And so I don't think they have a lot of motivation to start another round now. Of course, the government in iran will do what it can to replenish those supplies and try to rearm hamas as quickly as possible and therefore it's very important for us, for the united states and hopefully for egypt to act in a precise way and prevent iran from rearming hamas. 

[01:37:36]


>> Hamas is claiming victory here in getting this truce. How do you see it? Did hamas score a victory? Even after the truce was announced, there were several rockets that fell on israel. 
>> I think in fairness, hamas will always claim victory, but the truth is, in the eight days of fighting, we hit them hard. We hit their commanding control. We hit their missile stocks. We hit their communications. We hit their organization. We hit their military machine. And I think there's a certain amount of bravado in hamas's behavior. We didn't want this conflict in the first place. We wish we didn't have to defend our people, and we hope now the quiet will prevail and that there will be no need for israel to act to protect our civilians. 
>> Once again, that was the spokesman for the israeli government. 
>>> This story is particularly close to my heart. It's about a 9-year-old who refused to be a victim of bullying, and when she took matters into her own hands, her school and her entire community noticed. We'll introduce you to her. About once a month. Last time I was at a gas station was about...I would say... Two months ago. I very rarely put gas in my chevy volt. I go to the gas station such a small amount that I forget how to put gas in my car.

[01:41:53]


>>> welcome back. A 9-year-old girl is taking a stand against bullying. She even came up with an idea to stop it, an idea even her school hadn't thought of. Our affiliate in denver has her story. 
>> Reporter: Not too long ago, john's daughter told him about bullying. 
>> They were picking on my clothes. I thought that that was really mean, so I wanted to help him. 
>> Reporter: And then she told him this. 
>> I stood up for myself and i would like to stand up for everyone. I pledge to be a buddy, not a bully. 
>> Reporter: Standing up for others by standing in front of the school board. 
>> You are making a commitment to yourself, your fellow students. 
>> Reporter: Isabella came up with be a buddy, not a bully. They are given a bracelet to wear around school to show their support. 
>> It basically entitles the kids to step in. 
>> Reporter: The idea was so successful, the school district implemented it through all of its k through 5 schools. 
>> If not for the likes of our students along the lines of isabella griffin, we'd have our hands full. 
>> Reporter: As you can imagine, doing all of this at thege of 9 hasn't been a piece of cake. Quite frankly, what she's accomplished so far has been pretty sweet. 
>> Thank you. 
>> So sweet. And joining us now via skype from colorado is 9-year-old isab griffin and her father john. Good morning to both of you. Isabella, congratulations on this great work that you have done. Certainly comes in handy for so many kids, I'm sure. How many people have now signed your pledge? 
>> Well, we are actually waiting for our symbol, which is the bracelets, to come, and then we will go from there? 

[01:43:55]


>> And are you surprised by the fact that the school picked it up as their official program? How does that make you feel? 
>> Well, it makes me feel really good that now that I've presented it to my school, they are going to make it happen. 
>> Yeah. We have some of what you'd call your confidence points listed here. These are things that a buddy would say to help a friend who is being bullied. One of them that stands out is "don't listen to them, you know you are better." These are really important points to think about when you're in the midst of being bullied. How did you come up with these? 
>> Well, I have done a lot of research, and I have come up with these because, well, i remembered what I did for myself and I know what I could do for others, so I thought about what I could say to them to make them feel better. Like don't listen to them, they're wrong. Or be who you are, you're fine the way you are. And something like that. 
>> John, you must be so proud of your daughter. Did you expect this to come out of the work that she was doing? 
>> Absolutely not. Basically, isabella sat me down and presented 20 pages worth of information on why she wanted to create a club in school, and when I really sat down and i looked at everything she was dored to me that we needed to take this to the principal. Because this plan can be implemented not only in the alamosa school district, but i think it can be a model for schools nationwide. 

[01:46:00]

[01:48:06]


>>> Online shopping versus going out to the store. Used to be the big advantage for shoppers who bought at the store was getting the merchandise that they wanted immediately, right there. But as dan simon tells us, even that gap is narrowing. 
>> Reporter: Online versus brick-and-mortar. The battle has never been so intense. For years, internet merchants like amazon had a key advantage in states like california. No sales tax. Local bookstores already under pressure by the rapid rise of ebooks and large bookstore chains felt particularly squeezed. Michael tucker owns a chain of bookstores in san francisco. 
>> If you can save 10%, why wouldn't you? 
>> Reporter: But amazon's tax advantage recently disappeared in california, adding 7% to nearly 10% to the cost of each order. It also began taxing in other states like pennsylvania and texas. Online retailers collect tax only for states where they have a physical presence. Now here in california, amazon is building two giant warehouses. Including this one near los angeles. It's a million square feet, and for old fashioned retailers, it's another reason to worry. Why? Because amazon's goal is to get items to customers faster and to be able to offer same day delivery. That's right. You can avoid stores if you want and have a package delivered to your house in a matter of hours. A win for consumers, but tough for local retailers. 
>> If amazon creates distribution centers and facilities on their turf locally, that takes away the one advantage that we see retailers have left to compete against amazon. So it is a big deal. 
>> Reporter: Internet analyst colin their game. 
>> Retailers need to take a lesson from amazon. They need to focus on the consumer experience. They need to become more sophisticated both off line and online. 
>> Reporter: Those who want a lesson on how to thrive can learn from books inc in san francisco. 

[01:50:12]


>> We had almost everything that comes down the pike that could flatten the industry. 
>> In a tidal wave of industry, a dozen stores are thriving. 
>> Everybody can get the books. But the staff that's we have and the readers that we have that are working with the public, that's the difference. That's the different factor. We have tremendous staff that are engaged with those communities. 
>> Reporter: A basic reminder to all retailers, internet and otherwise, that good customer service can mean the decisive factor in winning over business. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Reporter: Dan simon, cnn, san francisco. 
>>> The united states relationship with egypt put to its first test after mohamed morsi issued a controversial legal decree. 
>>> When traveling to other cities and countries, the best way to get a taste for the place is through the local food, of course. We have a global list of 100 places to eat like a local. And your recommendations will play a big part. David mattingly takes us to puritan back room in manchester, new hampshire. 
>> Reporter: I'm david mattingly in manchester, new hampshire. When I want to eat like a local, I go to puritan. The menu is good for a little light reading. There is something here for just about everybody. But when people talk about this place, more often than not, tail thank you about the boneless brst of chicken with the special sauce. That's supposed to be what makes it really different. Also, the fried chicken tenders. This is co-owner. Tell me what is so special about these? What makes them world famous? 
>> Supposedly the chicken tenders were invented here way BACK WHEN IN THE EARLY '70s. One of the previous owners was dealing with a poultry company. They had these -- he called them one day. He said he had scraps left over. Do you want to do anything with them? So the chicken tenders, believe it or not, were actually invented right here at the puritan back room. We had perfected the marinading, the frying, the batter, the oil, everything we've done is -- people will come worldwide for our famous chicken tenders. 

[01:52:33]


>> When you say chicken tenders, you're talking about different kinds of chicken tenders here. 
>> We're talking about our original chicken tenders. We now have spicy chicken tenders. We have coconut tenders and buffalo tenders. As if anybody would still have an appetite after they ate all this, what makes the mudslide special? 
>> There is no ice cream in it. Even though we make our own ice cream, it is strictly alcohol. 
>> And how many different types do you have? 
>> We have probably 15 different types of mudslides. 
>> So there it is, to eat like a local in manchester, new hampshire go, to puritan back room.

One of the aspirations of the revolution was to insthur power would not be overly concentrated in the hands of any one person or institution. While president obama was on his southeast asia trip this week, he spoke by phone with president morsi in an attempt to seal a israeli-gaza cease-fire. It is a relationship of trust. It's too early to tell if this latest move will change that.

=======================================================

Out west. Thanks for starting your day with us. Starting with some sad news from the entertainment world. As we've been following this morning, the death of larry hagman. His family says at 81 years old he died of complications from cancer. 
>> You have dishonored my daddy's name and everything he stood for. Maybe you and bobby can live with this, but I can't. 
>> That's the character he's best known for. The j.R. Ewing character from "dallas," one of the best known tv characters of the last 30 years really. "Dallas" was a long running hit IN THE '70s AND '80s AND YOU MAY Remember him as major nelson from "i dream of jean any." Barbara eden said I had the pleasure of watching the texas tornado that was larry hagman. Can I honestly say that we've lot not just a great actor, not just a television icon, but an element of pure americana. Much more on larry hagman later in the hour. 
>>> Black friday has come and gone, but the nation's retailers hope the effects will be long lasting. Shoppers sprinted into the stores in search of holiday bargains. Retailers can rack up 40% of the sales during the november and december shopping period and if you didn't find what you wanted, check out some of your local area stores during small business saturday. The initiative founded two years ago by american express aims to steer some of those big bucks to the smaller stores. 
>>> And while walmart says it was the best block friday in store history, the day wasn't without controversy. From california to kentucky, protesters rallied against what they say is walmart's retaliation against workers who speak out about issues like pay and health care. Walmart has denied those claims and says it only knew of, quote, a few dozen demonstrations. 
>> Moving overseas now, actually we'll get to that in a movement stay here for a gas leak blamed for an explosion at a split club. This is in springfield, massachusetts. Look at it here. This blast leveled the club and damaged 25 other buildings in that neighborhood. 18 people hurt and no one killed, fortunately. Our affiliate wggb says people felt the explosion four miles away. A city official says some of those damaged buildings will be demolished today. 

[00:02:15]


>>> And now to egypt. Demonstrators there have taken to the streets in cairo to protest against president mohamed morsi. Morsi expanded his powers this week, and that means no one can challenge his decisions. They can't be overturned. That's led to anger among the people and some of the judges. Cnn's reza sayah is in cairo this morning. 
>> Reporter: Thanks have calmed down considerably in cairo's tahrir square. Still demonstrators out in tahrir, especially those who pitched tents overnight but the numbers not as what we saw on friday, friday one of the most intense and violent days of demonstrations that we've seen since mr. Morsi, the egyptian president took office back in june. More than 140 people injured throughout egypt, according to the health ministry, in clashes between protesters and police. A little under 40 people injured in kay row. Several with gunshot wounds. Also, more than 200 people arrested and many on charges of thuggery and destroying public property. Those arrested seem to be younger men who are out looking for trouble, but certainly thousands owed up to express what they call as legitimate and serious concern about mr. Morsi's decrees that at least for the time being give him sweeping powers without any oversight for the next several months. He says these moves are an effort to move forward the democratic process and to draft a constitution. His opponents describe it as an undemocratic power grab, and now this face-off is taking shape. One of mr. Morsi's advisers quitting today, the supreme court judicial council, the body that represents the top judges, held an emergency meeting today with a statement describing the decrees as an unprecedented attack on the independence of the judiciary. Also a call for a million man protest on tuesday. Critical days ahead for egypt. Reza sayah, cnn, cairo. 
>>> Now a real life mystery that could spike tensions in the middle east. Was palestinian leader yasser arafat poisoned to death? That's what a trio of international teams is looking to find out. Arafat's body will be exhumed this week on tuesday eight years after he suddenly died. Cnn's frederik pleitgen is following the investigation in ramallah in the west bank. 

[00:04:34]


>> The main investigator for the palestinian authority announced the way that this investigation is going to be happening. So what's going to happen is that this coming tuesday the investigators from france, russia, as well as switzerland, are going to open yasser arafat's grave. They are going to take samples from yasser arafat ebody, and then they are going to shut the grave as well. All of this will have big ceremonial cracter. There will be a religious ceremony when the grave is opened. There will be a military ceremony, and the same is going to be happening when yasser arafat is laid to rest again. The whole thing, they say, is all going to happen in one day, so it won't take very long, but what the palestinian authority has left open is how long the actual investigation of the samples is going to take. All of the samples are separately going to be taken to russia, france and switzerland, be analyzed, and it's unclear how long this analysis is going to take. However, if it does come to light that yasser arafat was indeed poisoned with the radioactive substance polonium that will, of course, cause massive emotional reactions here. And already the investigation is a very emotional one for the investigators and for the palestinians as november will be one of the most difficult days of my life because of many personal, national and symbolic considerations, but I consider ful necessity. 
>> Reporter: Polonium is a radioactive substance that was already used in assassination attempts in the past. If you think back several years to a former kgb spy who was poisoned with polonium in london that many believe the russian secret service is behind that. Something that is certainly out there. A separate investigation has already shown on items that belong to yasser arafat that there were increased levels of polonium there. Now the palestinian authority says it is absolutely convinced that israel is behind the death of yasser arafat. Israel denies this, and in most cases says it won't even comment on these allegations. However, if if does come to light that yasser arafat was indeed poisoned, that will lead to a gigantic investigation to then found out who did it. Fred pleitken, cnn, ramallah. 

[00:06:52]


>> Much more ahead this hour. 
>> Here's a look at what's coming up. 
>>> So far so good. That cease-fire between israel and hamas is holding for now, but there are real fears even the slightest flare-up could kick off chaos. Plus, there was black friday, gray thursday. Up next cyber monday. The holidays are here, and the retailers are ready. 
>> And you drove cliff to attempt suicide? 
>> How was I to know he was going to do a dumb thing like that?

[00:10:47]


>>> A fragile cease-fire between israel and hamas is entering its third full day. Both israelis and palestinians are expressing hope that this time the peace will actually last, but the truce has already been tested by the fatal shooting of a palestinian man by israeli troops near the gaza border yesterday. Let's bring in the spokesman for the israeli prime minister. Thank you for joining us and good morning to you. Does the israeli government -- 
>> my pleasure. 
>> -- Envision this cease-fire with hamas being permanent? We 
>> we hope that this will be long-standing. We have no illusions about hamas' agenda. They haven't suddenly moderated their positions, but in the framework of the understandings the hamas movement has promised egypt to abide by the cease-fire, and that gives us a certain amount of confidence. One way or the other, we hope this quiet for the people of southern israel will last. After all, they deserve a period of quiet. They have been on the receiving ends of those rockets from gaza day in and day out for too long now, and if they get peace and quiet, if they no longer have to live in fear the incoming rocket coming into gaza, if they don't have to run to bomb shelters every time they hear a siren that's a good thing, and we're thankful for it. 
>> Some israelis, certainly those who live closer to the gas ad border and are subject to those attacks say they are disappointed the israeli government didn't decide to continue the military operation. Why did the governmen decide to go with the truce at this point? We thought that the opportunity that egypt put on the table, that this halt of hostilities was worth exploring. It was an opportunity that we should explore. Ultimately if hamas breaks its commitments to the egyptians, if hamas does reignite violence and start shooting at our people again, we always have the action to act to defend ourselves as any country would if it attacks. If hamas breaks its promise, we will respond. We hope the cease-fire happens. 

[00:13:06]


>> Benjamin netanyahu says israel will not hesitate to take strong action in the future, if necessary could. That involve a ground invasion? Is that still on the table? 
>> If -- if hamas breaks its commitments to the egyptians, if hamas does escalate the situation again, I think in fairness I'd have to say that all options would be on the table because then we could -- we will say that we've given did I ploem say try, and diplomacy didn't work. No government would sit by and see its civilian population by terrorists shooting rockets into our cities. No one will stand for that, and we won't either. The biggest challenge I think to this quiet is, of course, iran. Because hamas' arsenal of missiles, the weapons that were fired at israeli cities, has been substantially depleted because of our surgical strikes against their arsenals, against their -- against their military machine, and they have very few left, so I don't think they have a lot of motivation to start another round now. Nfc, the government in iran will do when it did k to replenish those supplies and try to rearm hamas as quickly as possible, and, therefore, it's very important for us, for the united states, and hopefully for egypt to act in a precise way and prevent, prevent iran from rearming hamas. 
>> Hamas is claiming victory here in getting this truce. How do you see it? Did hamas score a victory? I mean, even after the truce was announced there were several rockets that fell on israel. 
>> I think in fairness hamas will always claim victory, but the truth is in the eight days of fighting, we hit them hard. We hit thr command and control. We hit their missile stocks. We hit their communications and their organization. We hit their military machine, and I think there's a certain amount of bravado in hamas' behavior. We didn't want this conflict in the first place. We wish we didn't have to defend our people, and we hope now that the quiet will prevail and that there will be no need for israel to act to protect our civilians. 

[00:15:11]


>> But hamas has always refused to recognize israel. Israel has always called hamas an energy of peace. Wish we knew the answer to the next question. But can israel and hamas co-exist peacefully? 
>> If hamas was to moderate its positions, if hamas was to accept israel's right to live in peace, if hamas was to renounce terrorism, if hamas was to support the peace process, those are the three u.N. Conditions, then, of course, the door would be open for dialogue. 
>> How likely is that? 
>> Up until now hamas has been stuck in a very, very extremist position. You saw they shot rockets at jerusalem, at tel aviv. When there was the terrible bombing on the bus in tel aviv a few days ago they praised that and said it's justified. Not information to suggest that hamas is any way moderating its position so i think we'll have for the time being, will have quiet based on israeli deterrence and based on egypt's involvement and the promises hamas made to egypt to keep the kwai 
>> mark regev, thank you so much for talking with us this morning. 
>>> So did the palestinians get what they wanted? In our 10:00 hour we'll talk with a former palestinian negotiator about the deal and about existing roadblocks to lasting peace. 
>>> Remembering one of tv's most iconic stars. Longtime actor larry hagman has passed away. We'll look back at his life and career.Ight. So it's like I won. Sure. Oh my gosh I won!!! I won!!!

>>> A new stove captures heat from burning wood and turns it into electricity. What started as an alternative to a camping stove has turned into a powerful solution for developing countries. Gary tuchman has more in this week's "start small, think big." 
>> Reporter: If you need a reminder about the importance of fire, just go camping. These inventors decided their old camp stoves weren't cutting it. 
>> The problem with liquid fuel, and I've had this experience, is that they are very finicky.

>> I we connect the two wires, huge ball of clean flame comes out of the stoves, and that was really the genesis, right? We had clean combustion driven by its own electrical generation

They also say he was happy to end his career by resurrecting his favorite character, j.R. Ewing. CNN'S colleen McEdwards has more now on hagman's career and the role that made him a household name. 
>> Reporter: Larry hagman wore many hats in his career, but is best known for the stetson he wore on "dallas." Despite roles on film and on stage, hagman will always be remembered as the villainous j.R. Ewing. 
>> And you drove cliff to attempt suicide? 
>> How was I to know he was going to do a dumb thing like that. 
>> Reporter: When j.R. Was shot by an enknown assailant it became one of the most famous cliffhangers in tv history, watched by 300 million from all around the world. Hagman never expected the show to endure. 
>> I just started the show doing six shows. I never thought I'd do 300. 
>> Reporter: In fact, the "dallas" franchise was so successful the series was recently repriced. The u.S. Network tnt brought it back with a new generation ewings, and hagman came once again. Critics say he was the best thing about "dallas," but explaining the character's appeal hagman once said the time is ripe for a real bad guy, and I'm it.Ie. 
>> Reporter: It was a good guy who larry hagman blasted into people's living rooms, playing astronaut tony nelson on "i dream of jeannie." THE SHOW WAS A HIT IN 1960s AND Is still popular in syndication. Even as a kid, hagman orbited in showbiz as the son of "peter pan" martin, his movie roles included "up the cellar" and "harry and tonto." 

[00:24:13]


>> I don't need an any anymore, pop. I'm leaving off the cream now. Milking a huge crot from the producers of "dallas" that hagman became immensely wealthy. He had houses. He had cars. He had vices, two of them included drinking and smoking. He smoked for 24 years, gave it up and became an anti-smoking activist and spokesman for the american cancer society. 30 or 40 people said that they quit because of my personal involvement which makes me feel really good. 
>> Reporter: He stopped drinking cancer and underwent a life saving transplant. 
>> If we won in vietnam, we wouldn't be having this conversation. 
>> Reporter: In recent years hagman appeared on the big screen in films like "primary colors," but it is his role as the charming and conniving oil man that audiences will never forget.

>> No way, no way. Five stories we're watching this morning. 
>> Protests have largely died down in cairo's tahrir square. Protesters were callinfor the resignation of president mohamed morsi. This week morsi declared his word is final. He removed power from any judges to overturn any decrees he makes. Judges are considering a strike in response to panded powers. 
>>> Number two, just 38 days left until we cross over that so-called fiscal cliff. A move that would trigger massive spending cuts to government programs and could even send the u.S. Into a recession. Earlier this morning I asked morgan stanley smith barney director ron hart if there were any benefits of actually going over. 
>> Getting our fiscal house in order, either now or later, right? We can't spend money at this trajectory, 16 trillion in debt. 99 trillion nun funded liabilities with medicare and social curity, so at some point you've either got to do it now or do it later. 
>> Congress is back in session on monday and expectsed to work on a solution. 
>>> And in europe, union leadeend two dye days of divisive budget talks without a deal. Increase the budget and another to cut t.Eu leaders should be able to reach a dl early next year. 
>>> Number four, take a look at this. Not sure what all the letters and numbers mean. Neither do top british spy agencies. It's apparently some sort of world war ii code that was found on the skeleton of a carrier pigeon found in a man's chimney england. This is pretty fascinating stuff. According to the uk intelligence agency, 250,000 pigeons were used during world war ii by all branches of the military list. Gray thursday. I didn't come up with it, but now we have it. That's the new phrase to describe retailers opening their doors on thanksgiving day to lure in the holiday shoppers a let's bring in the co-host of blockberg tv's "market makers." We've got black friday and gray thursday and taupe wednesday and periwinkle tuesday. 

[00:31:40]


>> And cyber monday. 
>> And cyber monday. Is all of this working to get people in, any indication of how many people are going to spend? 
>> Well, they are expected to spend over $52 billion this weekend here in the u.S., But it's more than just how much they are spending. This entire holiday shopping weekend bonanza really has become a cultural phenomenon, to heavily discount, but at the same time they are bringing in record numbers of people, and they are also creating a mad enthusiasm, so even if you weren't rushing through the stores, I can tell y I'm glad I wasn't elbowing my way through walmart. It does create a frenzy, and you are thinking about shopping. Last night when you came home you may have been tempted to even go online and see what wednesday looking at the deals, but, you know -- 
>> you can't resist it. 
>> And there are some great deals. The socks I bought, actually got 50% off on friday. So when we look at the people going into these stores, we also see in these shots all the workers who have to work on thanksgiving, earlier and earlier. One store I saw opened at 4:00 p.M. How big of a problem is that? 
>> It's actually not because for many of these workers they are seasonal workers so they are happy to have these jobs. Many get paid time and a half, and in some, again, it's part of this cultural phenomenon that they actually like the experience. Now, many of the stores, "wall street journal" reported yesterday, and we were doing our number crunching at bloomberg, some of these deals that you're seeing out there were actually offered at other points in the year by these retailers who are testing some of their items, so it's not like this is a one-time only super deal, but it's really this experience, so if you think about other times a year like back-to-school, the retailers haven't been able to harness a single event, a weekend, when everyone rushes to the stores, but they have done that with the christmas shopping season, and it really seems to be working. 

[00:33:47]


>> We're talking about shopping for christmas, but right after that, a few days towards the end of the year we're going to hit the fiscal cliff. The question is will we go over it? We're having the conversation this morning about people spending money pore black friday and maybe their taxes will go up at the same time is this fiscal cliff threat playing any role in what we're seeing as it relates to holiday shopping? 
>> It is and it isn't. 64% of the people that were polled by the national retail federation said they were going to be affected by the political uncertainty and how they would be shopping this year, but last year people spend about $740 during the holiday season. That's expected to go up by-10 year to 750 so even though they are saying they are concerned about the fiscal cliff, definitely worried about their finances, the taxes, the economic climate, people do seem to have holiday fever, and they are out there shopping. When you think about what are they shopping for this year? It's a lot of big-ticket items. They are calling it the year of the toy which typical. You've got barbies and legos and furbies, and guess what else is also at the top of the list, apple products, iphones, ipads, mini ipads. Those are very expensive items, and they are not being discounted because companies like apple don't have to, so even though people are definitely concerned about the cliff, they have the christmas fever. 
>> Well, we know the best thing about shopping from home on cyber monday, no concerns about parking. Stephanie -- 
>> no concerns about tv. 
>> Thanks for speaking with us. 
>> Thank you.

>>> 41 minutes past the hour now. He's the charismatic former congressman from chicago who voters had just re-elected to a tenth term despite being absent most of the year and facing legal and health troubles. Jesse jackson jr., Son of civil rights leader reverend jesse jackson, announced his resignation this week citing, quote, several serious health issues, but jackson is also the subject of fbi and house ethics investigations. So let's bring in cnn legal contributor paul callan to talk a little bit more about this. Paul, good morning. 

[00:41:36]


>> Good morning, randi. 
>> The fbi is investigating jackson for allegedly misusing campaign funds for personal use, but he hasn't been charged with any crimes. What's he facing, and when are the consequences here? 
>> Well, you know, there are two aspects to this investigation, and we don't know a lot about it, because there haven't been public announcements made by the justice department or the fbi, but one is personal use of campaign funds. There's a claim that he -- his funds were used to transport a mistress apparently back and forth from washington, d.C. To chicago at some point in time. There's a second aspect of the case though that I was looking at, and I think it might be more important. It's a link to governor blagojevich. Remember blagojevich was sent to prison for trying essentially to buy senator obama's senate seat when he was elected president, and jackson is sort of tied into some of the claims in this case. I don't know whether there's any merit to it or not, but there's a fund-raiser who is linked to jesse jackson jr., And that may be under investigation as well. 
>> In addition to the fbi though, jackson's also facing this house ethics investigate on allegations that he or one of his associates had offered that money, to raise the money for the blagojevich case. Do you see that going anywhere? I mean, look what happened to blagojevich in that. 
>> Well, you know, blagojevich, of course, they tried him twice. They convicted him the second time. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison, so it's a very, very serious offense, and the claim that the house ethics committee is investigating and maybe the fbi is involved with is one of blagojevich's fund-raisers was linked to the jackson family and basically said we'll raise a lot of money for you, and if we do, we want the senate seat. We want jackson appointed to the senate seat. If that happens, that's an ethics violation and quite possibly a violation of criminal law as well. 
>> Want to turn to another case potentially affecting a whole lot of people in the workplace. The supreme court on monday is expected to determine workplace harassment rules, and it seems to hinge really on the definition of just this one word, supervisor. What is this all about? 

[00:43:44]


>> You know, this is surprisingly important. It sounds like some boring lawyer thing, you know, what's a supervisor, but here's how it plays out. If you are discriminated against or sexually harassed by a supervisor, the employer is automatically responsible. You've got a case, and you have a big pocket because it's going to be the company that you can sue. If the harassment though comes from a fellow worker, not a supervisor, you have a much harder lawsuit. You have to prove the employer knew about it and he was negligent in not curing the condition. Now, how that plays out for ordinary people is, for instance, let's say at the office christmas party, which is coming up, somebody gets drunk and sexually harasses you at the office christmas party. If that person is a supervisor can you sue the company. If he's a fellow worker, no lawsuit, so it makes a big difference for liabilities for companies, and the federal courts have differing definitions of this, who is a supervisor. Some of the circuits make it very hard. It's got to be somebody who can fire you. Other circuits say, no, if it's just somebody who kind of has a little bit of supervisory responsibility, he fits that definition so the supreme court is going to straighten it out. 
>> Could we see some changes though in the workplace? 
>> Well, I don't know if you'll see changes in the workplace because there's a lot of paranoia in the workplace now because of the title vii law. You wouldn't believe the number of lawsuits out there, huge numbers. I think if the court finds that a supervisor can in fact be a fellow worker, you're going to see an increase in lawsuits, and you'll also see employers being a lot more careful about supervising and having programs to make sure nobody gets harassed or discriminated against in the work mace. 
>> No question about that. Paul callan, noise to see you. 
>> Nice seeing you, randi. Be careful at the office christmas party. 
>> I don't think I have to worry about that one here. 
>> Take care. 
>> Wow. That stuff doesn't go on here. Anyway, moving on. Moving on. That callan, you never know what he's going to say.

[ cheers and applause ] 43 million americans are on the road this holiday weekend, and for parents trying to keep the kids entertained while they travel, that could be a huge challenge, so what do you do WHEN DVDs ARE NOT ENOUGH YOU? Turn to the apps, of course. 9-year-old jane and her father mark, they host a podcast called boing-boing and told me how they came up with this idea. 
>> Jane and I have been playing iphone apps ever since the iphone came out and have really had fun playing different games and our friend and neighbors asked us about game recommendations and they did it so much that we thought we might have it for a larger audience and put together this podcast called apps for kids we run on our website boing-boing. 
>> We also realized a lot of good apps weren't being recognized so that was another reason. 
>> You get to play to with the apps and determine how long you would be interested. How do you come up with the recommendations, and where do you get the suggestions? 
>> Well, we come up with the recommendations. My dad sort of just gets a lot of apps and then we check them all out and find the best one, or also a lot of people watch apps for kids, they are like game designers, they send us games and they say can you review our games on apps for kids and stuff like that. 

[00:50:34]


>> Very popular this time of year when a lot of young drives to grandmother's house. Tell me, what are the favorites. Can you show us a few that you really like. 
>> Yeah, sure. We were playing one in the green room earlier today. I don't know if you can see this very well, but it's called robot wants kitty, and it -- it's a game where you have this robot who is kind of walking around this maze, and he's got to get through and find a little kitty and has to go through all sorts of different traps and secret doors and use different kinds of special skills to do it. The cool thing about it though is that kids can -- can program their own mazes and create game levels for it, and so jane is really good at creating levels, and then she challenges me to try to solve them. 
>> I know there are a lot of people watching this and remember singing in the car for hours and doing word games. We're past that now. Gone with the games of a world without electronics, are we now alon the ipad with our families? 
>> Well, no, not really. I think that's good to have a balance, and even, you know, when kids have an ipad in the car they will eventually burn out, and it is fun to just sing in the car or talk about things that you see out the window or talk about things that have happened at school so we definitely as a family try to limit the amount of screen time gets kid, at home and in the car. I think that's really an important thing to keep in mind. 
>> Yeah. Usually get one or two hours each day. 
>> One or two hours each day. On long road trips I usually get -- 
>> do you think that might be too much? 
>> I think that it's just about a balanced amount. Like on weekdays I get one hour, and on weekends I get two. 
>> I'm sure you've helped a lot of parents who are looking for something to give the kids something to do on that long drive. Mark and jane, thank you.

>>> But first, when traveling to other cities and countries, the best way to get a real taste of the place is through the local food. Cnn i-report has teamed up with "travel & leashur" magazine to create a global list of how to eat like a local. Here's david mattingly. 
>> Reporter: I'm david mattingly in manchester, new hampshire. When I want to eat like a local I go to puritian. The menu is good for a little light reading, something here for just about everybody, but when people talk about this place, more often than not they will talk about the boneless breast of chicken with the special sauce. That's supposed to be what makes it really different. Also, the fried chicken tenders. This is co-owner chuck sturridgio. Tell me what's so special about these. What makes them world famous. 
>> Supposedly the chicken tenders were invented at the puritian back room back in the LATE '70s, ONE OF THE PREVIOUS Owners, my partner's father, was dealing with a poultry conditions and they had these -- he called them one day and had scraps left over, wanted to know if he wanted to do anything with them. The chicken tenders, believe it or not, were invented right here at the puritian back room back IN THE 1970s. We've perfected the marinating, the frying, the batter and oil. Everything we've done is people come worldwide for our famous chicken tenders. 
>> When you say chicken tenders, you're talking about different kinds of chicken tenders here. 
>> We're talking about our original chicken tenders. We now have spicy chicken tenders. We have coconut tenders, and we have buffalo tenders. 
>> As if anybody would still have an appetite after thee ate all this, what makes the mud slide special? 
>> No ice cream in it. Even though we make ice cream here it's just pure alcohol.

>> You know, it's interesting. They celebrated thanksgiving a little differently at the white house this year. What they did is president obama went out to a farm, picked out the turkey he wanted and then they sent in s.E.A.L. Team six to take it out. Hey, did you see john boehner, how they killed their turkey? They pushed him off the fiscal cliff.

>> When I was a kid, my mom used to give me the twinkies, and i would get them for lunch. She would put them in my lunch pail, and they were so delicious because back then they used actual organic ingredients.

>>> And sad news we're just learning, that the former world boxing champion -- 
>> this is cnn breaking news. 
>> More on that breaking news that the former world boxing champion hector "macho" can a macho has now died. He was taken off life support at a hospital in san several of his sons arrived in puerto rico early today to be by his side. The 50-year-oldas declared clinically brain dead after being shot in the face. That was last tuesday. The gunman and another suspect are sill at large. 
>>> Now let's get back to egypt. Besides street protests, we are now seeing the first fallout over president mohamed morsi's power grab. Cnn's reza sayah is live in cairo for us. Reza, what exactly has happened now with the government? 
>> Reporter: Well, this face-off between mr. Morsi, the egyptian president and his opponents is starting to take shape with a number of important developments today. One of his presidential advisers resigned in protest, the supreme court judicial council. The body that represents the top judges in egypt held an emergency meeting and released a statement describing mr. Morsi's decrees that he announced on thursday to be an attack, an unprecedented attack on the independence of the judiciary. We spoke to a judge, and this is important, who is telling us that all the judges in the city of alexandria, this is egypt's second largest city, have gone on strike, suspended their work indefinitely, and we have an announcement by a number of political factions that on tuesday here in cairo there's going to be a million man protest and sit-in with a number of demands. Among those demands, the political factions are making, is a demand for mr. Morsi to reverse his decree, so this face-off between the president and his opponents taking shape behind us here in tahrir square, and I'm going to carefully step out of the way. You can see that demonstrators are still there, but the numbers are nowhere near what we saw yesterday. You see the tents. Protesters pitching them to spend the night. Some people trickling in, but certainly, randi, nowhere ne the numbers that we saw yesterday. 

[01:04:04]


>> Does it surprise you, reza? I mean, you've been covering this area for some time. Saw the arab spring and the end of hosni mubarak and now does it surprise you they are calling mohamed morsi a dictator and calling for him to step down there? 
>> Reporter: Well, look, I think one of the outcomes of the egyptians in general lost their fear and inhibition to speak up and protest. They value their revolution. Many of these political movements will tell you, they value the democratic principles that they fought for, and they believe these recent moves by egyptian president emmorsy is undermining the democratic process, so if you talk to many of these people out here. They say it's no surprise that they have come out and protested again. They say they are going to be out here for the duration of this until their call is heeded, and I think one of the factors is looking ahead. How much staying power these protesters have and what mr. Morsi is going to do to defuse this conflict. 
>> How much do you think this power grab has to do? How much do you think it's feeding off of mohamed morsi's role in gaza? 
>> Yeah, interesting timing, isn't it? His announcement of these decrees came 24 hours after he got a lot of international credit for his role in establishing the cease-fire. It's impossible to say that that was a factor, but certainly these announcements are actually calculated by heads of state. Some say that he wanted to do it to ride the momentum of the international credit, but the credit, he's getting, internationally is nothing to do with his population domestically. We should point out that he has a lot of supporters. The muslim brotherhood. He has a lot backing with islamist factions, but as we've seen over the past 24 hours, he has a lot of critics and opponents as well. 
>> Yeah, certainly, a tricky situation to maneuver there. Reza sayah, thank you so much.

>> I thought it was mean and i wanted to help him. 
>> Reporter: And then she told him this. 
>> I stood up for myself and i would like to stand up for everyone. 
>> I pledge to be a buddy and not a bully. 
>> Standing up for others by standing in front of the school board. 
>> You are making a commitment to yourself, your fellow students. 
>> Reporter: Isabella came up with a plan cad be a buddy and not a bully and asked students to sign a pledge to not be a bully. 
>> It basically entitles the kids to basically step in. 
>> Reporter: The idea was so successful that the school district implement it had through all of its k-5 schools. 
>> If not for the likes of our students, along the lines of isabella griffin, we'd have our hands full. 
>> Reporter: As you can imagine doing all of this at the age of 9 hasn't been a piece of cake. Quite frankly what isabella griffin has accomplished so far has been pretty sweet. 
>> Thank you. 
>> So sweet. Joining us now via skype from alamosa, california, is isabella griffin and her father john. Good morning to both of you. Isabella, congratulations on this great work that you have done, certainly comes in handy for so many kids, I'm sure. How many people have now signed your pledge? 
>> Well, we are actually waiting for our symbol which is for the bracelets to come and then we will go from there. 

[01:12:09]


>> And are you surprised, isabella, by the fact that this school picked it up as their official program? I mean, how does that make you feel? 
>> Well, it makes me feel really good that now that I've presented it -- presented it to you, my school, they are going to make it happen. 
>> Yeah. We have some of what we call your confidence points listed here. These are things that a bud woe say to help a friend who is being bullied. One of them that stands out is don't listen to them. You know you are better. These are really important points to think about when you're in the midst of being bullied. How did you come up with these. 
>> Well, I have done a lot of research, and I have come up with these because, well, i remembered what I did for myself, and I know what I can do for others, so I thought about what I could say to them to make them feel better, like don't listen to them, they are wrong, or be who you are. You're fine the way you are, and something of that. 
>> John, you must be so proud of your daughter. Did you expect this to -- to come out of the work that she was doing? 
>> Absolutely not. 
>> Basically isabella sat me down and presented me 20 pages worth of information on why she wanted to create a club in school, and when I really sat down and I looked at everything that she was doing, you know, it kind of made me think we need to take this to the principal this. Plan and this model, I think, can be instituted in the only in the alamosa school district, but I think it can be a model for schools nationwide, so once i saw what she had, I wanted to take it further, and at least show her that she has our support, and if it only goes to alamosa, that's great and to be on cnn is actually kind of shocking. 

[01:14:27]


>> Well, I think the program being there is wonderful as well, but I wand to read the be a buddy motto, isabella. It says I will respect myself and others and be a friend to those who are being bullied. I will be a buddy, not a bully. What's your advice to others? If they do see someone being bullied, how do you become a buddy and how do you cnn? What's the right way to go about it? 
>> Well, if you see somebody being bullied you can tell the bully to stop, and if that doesn't work, you can walk the person that's being picked on away from the situation and tell them some of those -- some of those confidence points, and you can just make them feel better by letting them know that you're there for them and that it's okay and they shouldn't have got picked on. 
>> I think that's great because they do need to know that they are not alone, like you said. Isabella, great job. Fantastic work in what you're doing, and john griffin, appreciate you both coming on this morning. 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> Thank you. 
>> And if you would like to sound off on stories about bullying, can you tweet me now or any time use the hashtag bullyingstopshere. Find me on cnn. Randi kaye. Love to hear what you think. 
>>> Hundreds protesting outside walmart stores on black friday, and the movement is raising questions about whether we're seeing a new normal in part-time work. We'll talk to an expert.Rage, often for less. That's one smart board. What else does it do, reverse gravity?

[ Grunting ] 

[01:19:23]


>>> welcome back, everyone. If you went to walmart for black friday sales, the lines to get in weren't the only ones you had to wade through. Across the u.S. Hundreds protested outside of walmart fighting for better wages, more hours and affordable health care. 
>> Are the low-paying part-time jobs without benefits the new normal when it comes to retail workers? Joining us to discuss is john logan, professor at san francisco state university. 
>> Good morning. 
>> The government says 8.3 million workers in the u.S. Are underemployed, not getting enough hours, even though they want them, really, but those are the kinds of jobs that companies are offering. Are we seeing this? Is this the new normal now? 
>> Right. Well, this is certainly one of the main demands of the protesting walmart workers. In addition to an increase in pay, many of them make an average of below $9 an hour, and they are asking for a minimum of $13 an hour. They also want more full-time jobs because at the moment there's a huge number of workers working at walmart, but especially at walmart works want to work full time but the scheduling at walmart provides them only with part-time work which as you say often doesn't provide adequate access to benefits. 
>> John, if the unions get the part-time positions to become full-time positions, that means it will cost the companies more and maybe increase costs to the consumer. Really, how will the companies handle these increased expenses. 
>> Right, for a company like walmart. Walmart could certainly afford to pay its employees a little bit more and could afford to create more full-time work instead of part-time work. The company made $16 billion from profits last year and walmart is particularly significant because it has an impact on what happens in the rest of the retail sector, too, so if wamart were to create a positive example and create more full-time positions and provide better wages and benefits, you may actually see a ripple effect throughout the retail sector, but simar if walmart cates below standard for the industry, other companies have to compete with the low standards and they have to drive down wages and benefits and have to create more part-time instead of full-time positions in order to compete with walmart. 

[01:21:59]


>> So in terms of impact, is a strike against walmart more likely to hurt walmart itself or hurt the employees? 
>> Well, I think that the protests at walmart will be an ongoing thing. I mean, it's really quite remarkable that we had strikes in 100 cities and 46 stays yesterday and this has been the culmination of two months of actions of walmart throughout the country. Walmart is known for its fairly uthoritarian corporate culture so if anyone predicted a year ago or even six months ago that we would have seen these protests yesterday, I think you would just say, you know, it's not going to happen, but it did happen, and, you know, I think it will continue to happen because the workers do have a great deal of community support as well. Th have attracted a lot of support from civil rights organizations, from religious organizations, from women's organizations, et cetera, so -- so that's not just going to disappear overnight. I think this will be an ongoing thing until they are able to get some of the goals that they are protesting for. 
>> And, of course, we'll see what the outcome will be going on to the next weeks or months or maybe years as this continues. John logan, professor and director of labor and employment studies at san francisco university, thank you. 
>> Thank you very much.

Thomas puts oregon up 17-7. Then deanthony thomas showing the speed, breaking up tackles, hitting the sidelines. Big win for oregon, 48-24. 
>> Huge win. And the reason why, stanford knows, and now they all know this. They have to beat ucla to play in the pac-12 championship. That said, what's key for them? 
>> What's key is doing exactly what they did last week against oregon. They're going to face a similar offense in ucla than they did against oregon. Johnthan franklin throwing the football, hundley throwing the football. It's going to be an explosive offense. If they play like they did last week, playing in space, tackling in space, it's going to be a great ball game. 
>> They have to do that for the second straight week against top players. Key leaders on this young, young ucla team. They need to rely on those guys, hnthan franklin and joseph fauria. 
>> I say ucla. 
>> We'll see you at halftime. Let's get it out to gus johnson, charles davis, and julie alexandria. There you go. 
>> Gus: Thank you very much, erin. The rose bowl on a spectacular day. We're ready for two of the top teams in the country as stanford battles ucla. Let's take a look at the pac-12 championship game scenario. 
>> Charles: We now know with oregon winning big today that ucla cannot host. Stanford, if they win, they host ucla in palo alto. If ucla wins the game, they head north to take on oregon. Those two teams did not meet this season in the regular portion. 
>> Gus: I'm gus johnson, along with my partner charles davis. Welcome to pasadena. For the stanford cardinal, what a year it's been for them. Last week they go to eugene and beat the ducks. 

[00:02:04]


>> Charles: That was 14 points in overtime. They're led by the hybrid linebackers, guys that can do everything. All-american outside linebacker chase thomas. How about trent murphy, maybe the most underrated linebacker in the country. But the offense is starting to perk because of the insertion of the youngster, kevin hogan at quarterback. His ability to run the football stretches the field. 
>> Gus: What a year for jim mora. One year, nine wins, a pac-12 south championship. When you look at what he has on offense, specifically, a one-two punch in brett hundley and johnthan franklin. 
>> Charles: It's a special relationship. The runner johnathan franklin opens it up for brett hundley. It's a dynamic duo. And don't overlook the ucla defense. They are physical. They are tough. Aaron barr, eric kendricks at linebacker, they'll hit you in a hurry. 
>> Gus: Coming up, ucla and stanford. These two teams with terrific wins last week. We'll see if they're headed for a home and home. Who knows? 
>> First play of the game. Jump ball! Touchdown. 
>> Johnathan franklin looks end zone. Touchdown! Another big play.

>> Gus: Welcome back to pasadena. This is fox college football, presented by reese's peanut butter cup. And we've got a hot one for you. Stanford, ranked number eight in the nation. Take on the young ucla bruins. Gus johnson along with charles davis, julie alexandria on the sideline. Stanford won the toss, and they've elected to receive the football. Redshirt freshman brett hundley ready. Jackson cummings and wright back deep for stanford. And we're under way. And this one out of end zone. Jeff locke leading the pac-12 with 30 punts down inside the 20 and 60 touchbacks this year. Meanwhile, let's take a look at the taco bell impact players. 

[00:06:19]


>> Charles: How about stepfan taylor, the running back for stanford? He's an all-time player for them. Zach ertz, the game-winning touchdown at oregon last week. And trent murphy, underrated at linebacker, one of the best players in the country. For ucla, joseph fauria at tight end is a matchup nightmare. Eric kendricks, the linebacker, leads the pac-12 in tackles. And anthony barr, 12 tackles. 
>> Gus: Here's the handoff. Stepfan taylor runs into a wall. So this stanford team, led by KEVIN HOGAN from McLean, virginia, last week against oregon in his first career road start, 25 for 36, 211, and a touchdown to zach ertz to tie the score in the fourth quarter. Pep hamilton, the offensive coordinator, chose this kid from d.C. He was a jewel. Not a lot of people recruiting him nationally. Taylor running over to the left side. Gained about a yard. Thing about this game -- anthony barr, first man to him. When you look at these two teams, charles, we have the potential to watch a very violent, violent football game, and we can't wait to see it. 
>> Charles: We're talking about old school, aren't we? 
>> Gus: Yes. 
>> Charles: Not something you would have said about ucla in recent years, but they can't wait to match up with the challenge of the run game, the heavy, physical run game that stanford brings each and every week. Third down conversions, neither one of them giving a whole lot in the month of november. 
>> Gus: On the opening drive for stanford, third down and nine at the 26. Taylor in the backfield. They give it to him on the delayed handoff. Breaks through. Taylor picking his way forward. Still churning, and stepfan picks up 19 on third down and nine. First down cardinal. Eric kendricks with the tackle. 
>> Charles: And that's what makes things very difficult for a defense when you're preparing for stanford. There almost is no such thing as a passing down for stanford. That was third and nine. You bring your nickel defense out, go a little lighter up front, and they go heavy anyway and run the football and pick up a first down. For stanford, every down you're in danger of them handing it off and the big fella coming up with it. 

[00:08:38]


>> Gus: Stepfan taylor now over 4,000 yards rushing in his career. Now he throws. And incomplete. That's cassius marsh and damien holmes getting into the backfield. 
>> Charles: Feel like on this play -- watch as the pass rush comes. Hogan on the left side of your screen. Marsh, normally a defensive end, moved to defensive tackle, moved down inside. He ends up beating khalil wilkes, number 65, to hogan. It felt like ucla guessed correctly. Lou spanos, the defensive coordinator, said stanford wanted to throw the ball early in the down and distance count. 
>> Gus: Second down and ten at the 45. Here's the handoff. This time it's a flag on the play. Picks up the first down. Running left. Let's see. Aaron hester with the tackle. 
>> Referee: Personal foul, hands to the face on the defense. That's a 15-yard penalty. First down. Player number 54's helmet came off because of the foul. He does not have to stay out for one play. 
>> Charles: Like the explanation there to tell you. People are saying, hey, his helmet was off. Why isn't he coming out of the game? That's why. Hands to the face penalty knocks the helmet off. He's able to stay on the field. Look in the middle of the scrum. Yankey, 64, blocking. He's actually got a handful of cloth there, gets away with it, as the hands to the face took precedence against cassius marsh, number 99. 
>> Gus: As a result, a 27-yard play, first down and ten on their opening drive at the ucla 28. And they'll throw it. Incomplete. The receiver hadn't swung his head around quickly enough. 
>> Charles: Notice what we're seeing early in the game. Such a cat and mouse. Pep hamilton, offensive coordinator, lou spanos, defensive coordior for ucla. A couple of first down throws. Lou spanos, the defensive coordinator, set his defense accordingly. He guessed correctly that stanford wanted to throw the ball. Heavy pressure in the hands of the young quarterback. Normally on first down throws, he should be cleaning the pocket. 

[00:11:06]


>> Gus: First down and ten at the 28 yard line. Out of the 
>> Charles: Taylor in the backfield. Hogan on the move. Hogan pulls it down. Now dumps it off to his fullback in ryan hewitt, the redshirt junior from denver, makes the catch. They're so pleased to have a healthy ryan hewitt in the lineup. 
>> Charles: Early in the season, gus, he missed the first two games. We saw him against usc. That was his first game back from an injured ankle. And his dimensions and his versatility add so much to the offense, as you noted. He can play fullback. He can play tight end, h-back. Catch the ball out of the backfield, he can run it. 
>> Gus: He's a big boy, 6'4", 248. Third down and short. Cardinal need a yard. Two tight ends out of the "i." Taylor straight ahead. He'll get the forward lead and pick up the first down. With that first down, time now for game break in studio "a." Here's erin andrews. 
>> Number 10 florida against florida state. Mike gillislee, 23 carries. E.J. Manuel knocked out of this game. 
>> Charles: Got to feel good about what you're seeing from your florida gators. Still in national championship contention, erin. 
>> Gus: Hogan to terrell. Terrell spinning, and he'll go down at the line of scrimmage, maybe a half yard on the play. 
>> Charles: Epenesa with pursuit for the bruins. You're talking about a 6'1", 310-pound nose tackle, number 98, seali'i epenesa, making the ursuit. Starting to rush the passers, then peeling off and making the tackle in the open field. 
>> Gus: Tenth play of the drive to start it at the 28 yard line. Cardinal, second down and ten at the 17. Hogan to taylor. Taylor, look out. Squares the shoulders. Drive to the 10. Picks up a hard six for stanford. 

[00:13:29]


>> Charles: Stanford showing that heavy formation again. They brought in dylan bonnell, who was in the game. Motioned out to the tight end position. David shaw is a former wide receiver, but he likes to see the guys mash up front before they spread it out and throw it. 
>> Gus: Third down and four at the 11. Zach ertz is in the slot at the top of your screen. He's terrific down here. Hogan pulls it down. Looking. He's got a receiver! Terrell, touchdown! Hogan improvises, buying time, and he puts that one on the money. 
>> Charles: And that's why pep hamilton made the move to leave it with his quarterback. His ability to use his legs, look downfield, and find an open receiver for a touchdown. That's something stanford did not have early in the season. Thatted aed dimension has really sparked the offense in recent weeks. 
>> Gus: Extra point up and good. The stanford coaching staff feel that this kid, hogan, has the potential to be just as good as the kid at oregon and just as good as the kid at texas a&m. Is he as good as this one? We'll see. 
-- smaller? Bigger! Bigger! Bigger! Bigger! So, which would you rather have -- a big treehouse or a small treehouse? If it's big enough, you can have a disco. Oh, yeah! Why do you not want a smaller treehouse? Because it wouldn't be able to fit a flat-screen tv, and then the tv would be about this big, and you would have to hold the wire, and the position you would hold the wire, you wouldn't be able to see the tv. That's a pain in the buns. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:15:41]


[ Male Announcer ] IT'S NOT COMPLICATED. Bigger is better. And at&t has the nation's largest 4g network. ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? 
>> Gus: Welcome back to downtown los angeles. Stanford with the 7-0 lead. YOUNG KEVIN HOGAN from McLean, virginia, leading them on their opening drive. Seven plays, 75 yards. Finds his main man in the end zone for a touchdown. Cardinal lead 7-0. Walker, jerry rice jr. Back deep. This is kenneth walker. And walker up-ended at the 12 yard line. Great looking play on special teams, and I believe that's drew madhu with the tackle. 

[00:17:52]


>> Charles:21 on 21. Getting downfield, breaks down. Not textbook, but effective. Up-ending walker and making ucla start deep in their own territory. 
>> Gus: First down and ten at the 13 for the ucla bruins. Brett hundley, the quarterback. Pump fake. He'll take a shot early on. Incomplete. Jerry johnson, the intended receiver, but jordan richards back defensively. Brett hundley last week against usc, 234 and a touchdown. He was sacked five times but also rushed 16 times for two short touchdowns. 
>> Charles: Still learning about getting rid of the football in the pocket. Jim mora likes his ability to extend plays and holds onto it a little longer in the hopes of making a big play. 
>> Gus: He'll rush the football. Gets to the 20. Gains five yards on the play. What a season it's been for the finalist of the doak walker award along with kenyon varner and montee ball of wisconsin. 
>> Charles: He can do it all, run it. Now he's splitting out wide as a receiver. You name it, he can do it. 
>> Gus: Empty backfield, hundley in trouble. Out of the pocket. Hundley up top. Caught! Down the sideline. Shaq evans dragged down inside the 10! 71 yards. Wright with the saving tackle! 
>> Charles: Look at hundley creating the play in the pocket. Right there he should have gone down. He doesn't. Now what he does is he throws his receiver open. In other words, watch where he throws the football. He tells shaq evans go get it. He throws it to the middle of the field and lets evans run underneath it. Well done by brett hundley, great poise in the pocket, and great field awareness about where the football needed to go. 

[00:19:55]


>> Gus: First down and goal at the 10 yard line for ucla. They'll run it, and johnthan franklin met immediately in the backfield. Tarpley with the tackle. A.J. Tarpley, plymouth, minnesota. 
>> Charles: Began the year as a starter. The next three games, he was not. Regained the starting position. And derrick mason, who's done an outstanding jobs athe defensive coordinator, says he's playing as well as any linebacker they have, which is high praise because all four of them should be at least all-conference. 
>> Gus: Last week stanford's defense held the ducks to only 41 points under their season average. This was deflected at the line of scrimmage. And they man handled oregon. Trent murphy got a hand on that football. 
>> Charles: What did you say to me in our meeting? When did it become the time that the smartest guys in the room were the meanest guys in the room? 
>> Gus: That's right. 
>> Charles: And that's what stanford is. That play by trent murphy, use him like a joker. If you play a card game where the joker's wild, he can rush the passer, bump back into coverage. On that one, he tipped the ball away and prevented a completion. 
>> Gus: Third down and goal at the 14. Ucla on their opening drive. Johnathan franklin behind hundley. Here's brett hundley. Over to joseph fauria. Touchdown! Joseph fauria posting up! This young man has been spectacular this year. His 11th receiving touchdown of the season. 
>> Charles: This is an example that ucla likes to say throw it up there to the top shelf, put it where the kids can't get it. Look at that. See the extension of fauria. At 6'7", he goes up over the top, and hundley knows that, places it in the proper spot. The kids can't get it. Ucla scores. 

[00:22:09]


>> Gus: Not at all. I don't know. We're going to have to call sid. He's going to need a guy to bang on the box. It might be joseph fauria. is combo of our favorites in one epic box. It's the perfect thing for game time with the guys. I just want this moment to last forever, you know. Just all of us and the big dinner box, hanging out like...

[00:24:36]


>> Gus: Welcome back. For the spanish portion of our game, please tune into fox. Remember j.J. Stokes for ucla? 
>> Charles: Another tall, angular receiver. Not as tall as fauria, 6'7". I love what he had to say. Any time you throw it up to me, I've got the advantage because they're not making defensive backs at 6'6", 6'7" yet. I don't see that. 
>> Gus: Bruins send it away. Kelsey young back deep. And they'll return it up to the 27 yard line. Meanwhile, let's join erin andrews for a game break. 
>> Let's send you to norman, check in on oklahoma state at oklahoma. Fourth quarter here, and it's j.W. Walsh with the two-yard run. It was tied up then, but now it's 45-38 oklahoma state, guys. 
>> Gus: A lot of talented young quarterbacks in college football this season. 
>> Charles: Just think oklahoma state, j.W. Walsh and wes lunt both freshmen. Big time moments during the season. We thought walsh was lost for the year with a knee injury. He's been playing awfully well. 
>> Gus: Kevin hogan will hand it off to stepfan taylor. He is taken down in the backfield. Owamagbe odighizuwa with the tackle. 
>> Charles: Owamagbe stopping the first down carry. You know stanford won't be daunted. They're going to press the run game for all four quarters, but if odighizuwa and his linemates keep making tackles like that, that gives them a chance against the fine running ne of stanford. 
>> Gus: Taylor in the backfield. Here's taylor spun around. He won't go anywhere. Terrific job by andrew abbott, the senior from long beach, california. 

[00:26:40]


>> Charles: Datone jones, number 56, jumped up excited tot? A safety getting up close to the line of skrinl, sees the play, jumps past the block and in the hole and makes the initial contact. Andrew abbott, a former walk-on, now captain of the team. 
>> Gus: Jim mora coming on before the game that our goal is to go to oregon and beat the ducks, period. We'll see if they can accomplish that. Third down and 14 at the 22. Taylor. Taylor running hard. kevin McDonald stands him up. Waits for his teammate. Damien holmes. Anthony barr there as well. 
>> Charles: On the first drive, stanford went 3 for 3 on third down. This time ucla limits them, gets off the field, and forces a punt. 
>> Gus: Daniel zychlinski named the pac-12 player of the week after averaging 46 yards per punt. This is a 54-yard punt. Brent hundley and the ucla bruins back on the field. The young quarterback ready to lead. handsome. Hola, guapo. Let's go back to my place. Vamos a ir a mi casa.

[ Dennis ] MAYHEM IS EVERYWHERE. SO GET AN Allstate AGENT. Are you in good hands? 
>> Gus: It's a measure of a team's offense, defense, and miscues to define the advantage. Check out this week's ratings to see that kansas state is at the top of the u.P.S. Team performance index. First down and ten at the 18 yard line, the young brett hundley, from arizona. Johnathan franklin in the backfield with him. 
>> Referee: Prior to the snap, false start on the offense, number 60. That's a five-yard penalty. First down. 
>> Gus: So brett hundley, already thrown for 3,000 yards, 26 touchdowns, only 9 interceptions. For the season over his last five games, he's completed 75% of his passes. 

[00:31:21]


>> Charles: And they need him to be sharp now. That first down penalty put them behind the chains, as they say, first and 15 instead of first and 10. 
>> He's in trouble. He's sacked for the first time this afternoon. Chase thomas getting to the quarterback. 
>> Charles: An all-american last year. Watch chase thomas now. Coming from the right side of your screen. Comes inside and gets brett hundley on the sun. Thomas came into the game, very unselfish player. Used in a different role this year. 
>> Gus: Here's hundley back to pass. In major trouble. Hundley finally stopped at the 5 yard line. Josh mauro grabbed his ankle and brought him down. 
>> Charles: Ucla is the worst in the nation in terms of penalties, give up too many. Look at the play here. Coverage downfield, nowhere to go with the football. That's why brett hundley had to continue to scramble. This penalty they took on first down sent them behind the chains in running their offense. Jim mora doesn't care about penalties? Those are the penalties that hurt you. 
>> Gus: Third down and 42, as they elect to run the football and short of the first down, a nine-yard gain. 
>> Charles: Think about it the first and ten, they jump offsides. Now you're first and 15. Changes your play call. Stanford gets a sack on first down. Takes you way behind what you're trying to do on down and distance. Ends up leading to punting the football away. 
>> Gus: Locke sends it away. Terrell at the 35. Flag on the play. And he's wrapped up. That's a 44 yard line, a 50-yard punt and an 8-yard return. 

[00:33:26]


>> Referee: Interference with the opportunity to catch the kick on the kicking team, number 31. 15-yard penalty. First down. 
>> Gus: They'll tack on additional yardage, kevin hogan. He has got stanford off to a good start. favorite for just ten bucks when you carry out: Any size, any toppings on our Hand-Tossed, Thin 'N Crispy or world-famous Pan Crust, freshly prepared every day for legendary taste.

[00:36:13]


>> Gus: Welcome back. The stanford cardinal coming off that overtime win in eugene. Kevin hogan hitting with the game tying touchdown. And they'll run the football right here. Anthony. 
>> Charles: I think stanford gained extra field position with the call. Look at tom carter pushing mauro in the back. He got help from amanam. Coach mora is not happy because he thinks they pushed ucla into the penalty and gave stanford good field position. 
>> Gus: Here's the play fake. Hogan over the middle l. The intended receiver, rashad patterson. Mike pereira, your opinion on jim mora's point. 
>> I think you all have a valid point. It's not interference because he wasn't directly in front of him for a yard. And there was a slight push. He just reached out with the right arm and made contact on the leg after the ball was caught. I really can't place that in the category that that's interference, period. 
>> Gus: All right, mike. Thank you. Third down and two at the 42. Out of the shotgun. Low snap handled by hogan. Steps into his throw. And incomplete. Guess who? Anthony farr. 
>> Charles: Not much he has not done this year. We saw ucla early in the season against nebraska. Remember what anthony barr was playing with. Remember he had that big cast, that big club on his hand. Look what happens when you have two hands available. Coverage on zach ertz, maybe the hottest tight end in the country now, reaching around, knocks the ball away. 

[00:38:19]


>> Gus: Zychlinski standing at the 45. Kick is end over end, and it takes a bounce, and it is downed inside the 5. So with 3:48 to go, our score tied at 7. Nfl on fox bringing you an action packed doubleheader starting with the vikings taking on the bears in a key nfc north matchup. And then an american game of the WEEK, NFC WEST LEADING 49ers Square off against the saints. Coverage begins tomorrow with the fox nfl sunday pregame show at noon eastern/9:00 a.M. Pacific. 
>> Charles: How about the game of the week with the transformer collin kaepernick taking over at quarterback with a scintillating performance monday night against the bears. 
>> Gus: This time it's johnathan franklin. How about shayne last week. What a wonderful player? 
>> Charles: After the knee injury. What a wonderful sas on. Remember shayne skov. We saw him at his peak orange bowl a few years ago. He's a tackling machine. Gets hurt early last season. Everything is back mentally, physically, except as you noted, the explosion. It's the last thing to come back, but he's getting there now. 
>> Gus: Shaq evans first down. Quietly, shaq evans has really been racking up numbers. He catches 114 yards. He's the team's leading receiver with 47 catches coming into this game, close to 700 yards and two touchdowns. 
>> Charles: Not only has he been the leader of a very young receiving corps at ucla, he's doing exactly what you just noted. He's leading by example now. He's playing to peak efficiency. 
>> Gus: Here's the run by james and a first down. Brett murphy had to bring him down from behind. Are you surprised how this ucla team has been able to run the ball on stanford? 

[00:40:26]


>> Charles: Not to this extent because of this reason. They said they were going to be committed to running the ball a little bit more than maybe people thought, and this is a young offensive line, but it's grown up throughout the year and is playing more physically than we've seen in recent years at ucla. 
>> Gus: First down and ten at the 48. James, maybe a yard. 
>> Charles: What they're doing with stanford -- a not every play is going to be a great play, as you can see, because stanford's front is so good. If you can move them laterally and put your foot on the ground and strike right up inside the hole and really go with some force, that's where you get them lined up with three, four, five, six-yard run to especially koo the chains moving. 
>> Gus: Second down and ten at the 28. Hundley brings it out. And james is taken down. Jordon richards, the sophomore, with a very nice open field tackle. 
>> Charles: Look at the third down conversion, that was a lateral. That was not a forward pass. Look at the third down conversion. Last three games, stanford only gave up two first downs. This week they've given up three already. 
>> Gus: Empty backfield for hundley. 
>> Charles: Diamond set down with four receivers. Watch them all flush and go to the spot now trying to confuse the secondary. 
>> Gus: Hundley will fire up the sideline. He went away, found jerry johnson. 31 yards. 
>> Charles: They moved the core receivers to one side and ran a one-on-one route with johnson up top against terrence brown, the most experienced cornerback on stanford's roster. Well thrown football, nice route by jerry johnson getting on top of terrence brown. 
>> Gus: Now they'll go back to the ground attack. Franklin. Here's jerry johnson, 31-yard grab. Second down and seveat the 42. And johnathan franklin gets stood up. What's stanford's weakness on defense? 

[00:42:50]


>> Charles: It was originally the secondary. Terrence brown was the only returning starter at corner. But it got better throughout the year. Alex reynolds, five interceptions and three returns for touchdowns. All in all, I don't think they have a glaring weakness. 
>> Gus: Shaq evans will have nightmares about that one, wide open over the middle. 
>> Charles: People point to the pass defense of stanford and look at the numbers and say, that's their weakness. Part of it is you have to throw the ball because they're only giving up 71 yards a game running the football. Shaq evans should have been more consistent. That's one he has to catch and move it downfield against a tough defensive front. 
>> Gus: So on fourth down and three at the stanford 38, ucla electing to go for it. Here's hundley. Oh, he'll punt it. And that is a new wrinkle. All the way down to the 1. 
>> Charles: That's old l school. That's playing field position and making sure you have your quarterback as a triple threat. A guy who can run it, a guy who can throw it, and a guy who can kick it. That's like an old single wing tailback, and brett hundley shows another dimension of an already expansive game. Jim mora is a defensive guy. Okay, let's play field position here. Put it down there for me, brett. And now he's got his defense on the field against a good offense, starting on their own 2 yard line. Well done by the ucla quarterback and the head coach going with the quick kick. 
>> Gus: First career punt for hundley. Now stanford comes back on. Closing moments of the first quarter. We've got a good one. Tie ball game at 7. They'll mark it at the 2. Hewitt, trying to give him some room, and they do. The score stanford 7-ucla 7. 

[00:47:39]


>> Gus: Start of the second quarter. Our game is tied at 7 apiece. Each team scored on the opening drive. Stanford going 11 plays, 75 yards, eating up close to five minutes. Hogan hits terrell for a touchdown. Against fauria with the touchdown for ucla. Six play, 87-yard drive. Second down and seven at the 5 yard line. Here's the handoff. Taylor. Stepfan taylor gets to the 9. 
>> Charles: And the goal here for stanford, let's be honest, the goal is always the score, we know that. When you start on your own 2 yard line, the true goal of your offense is try to get two first downs. To get two first downs, then you have to punt the football, you play field position. You helped your defense out. You punted here, field position favors ucla heavily. Key third down for stanford on this drive. 
>> Gus: Third down and two at the 10. Hogan in the shotgun. He'll throw it. That was right in the hands of patterson. 
>> Charles: That was the second one he should have caught today. The inside slant earlier. Good pickup by stepfan taylor, one of the better pass protecting running backs in the country. That was one that patterson should have hauled in. 
>> Gus: So shaq evans is back deep. Zychlinski out of his own end zone. This will go out of bounds at the -- make it the 47 yard line. The stanford 47. So coming up, brett hundley with excellent field position. terrible. I can't see. Ooh, turn up the brightness. It's already up. Oh, oh, ooh! Sorrry buddy, you know, some of us destroy zombies and some of us feed em. How am I suppose to win? Your screen is like as big as my phone. Not everything's about winning. I like to win. You like to whine. You do.

>> Gus: Senior day at ucla. As you take a look at johnathan franklin's mom. Sheldon price playing here for the final time. Joseph fauria in the feature told us that he gave the flowers to his mom, a man of his word. 
>> Charles: Smart young man. You see jerry johnson go through. Many thought he wouldn't finish his career here at ucla. Jim mora gave him a clean sheet. David perry is playing at nose today because terrence stephens, the normal starter, is not here. Missing a game due to a personal issue back at palo alto. 
>> Referee: Illegal snap on the offense, number 54. Five-yard penalty. Second down. 
>> Gus: Our julie alexandria had a chance to talk to coach mora about his seniors. 

[00:52:50]


>> Julie: That's right, guys. I talked to coach mora before the game, and he said that emotions were running high with these guys. He said, I'm really going to miss this group of seniors. Got a chance to talk with joseph fauria as he was warming up. He said, I can't believe this is our last game. Emotions running high. Big day for the seniors. 
>> Gus: Second down and eight at the 45. 
>> Charles: Coach mora talked about how much fun he has with this group and how much fun this group has together. A really tight knit team. 
>> Gus: Hundley th missile. Zach evans with the catch at the 40. Six-yard gain. 
>> Charles: The field position was set up well for ucla after holding stanford on downs. And the punt going out of bounds at the 46, 47 yard line. Key third down now. Can stanford stop them here and put ucla in a bind because they don't have a long range field goal kicker unless they decide to go with the punter, jeff locke. 
>> Gus: Third down and two at the 39. Quick throw. Shaq evans, first down. And reynolds with the tackle, but not after shaq evans got enough for the first. He got five on third and two. 
>> Charles: Love the way he caught the ball and just went straight upfield, understanding where the chains were for the first down. Excellent intelligence and good toughness to pick up the first down. 
>> Gus: First down and ten at the 34. 
>> Referee: Stanford is challenging the ruling on the field with the complete pass. 
>> Charles: That's going to be the throw to shaq evans. What stanford is saying is they thought the ball skipped to shaq evans. It wasn't a completed pass. They would be correct. Ball hit ground. That's not going to count as a catch, in my book, I don't believe. And I don't believe that's going to count for them either. That skipped to shaq evans. He looked like a shortstop fielding a ground ball and getting upfield and getting the first down. Good eye by the stanford staff upstairs and getting in the challenge. That ball should come back. 

[00:55:20]


>> Gus: How about coach david shaw, 40 years old? Is this his team now? 
>> Charles: Without a doubt. Without a doubt. A lot of people didn't want to say it was his team last year. They wanted to say it was jim harbaugh's team because andrew luck was there. It was his team last year. The perception is andrew luck, jim harbaugh, the whole thing. David shaw coached andrew luck and was the offensive coordinator of those teams, and ascended to the role as head coach. It's been his team since he took over. There shouldn't be any question at this point about whether this is david shaw's team. 
>> Gus:11-2 last year. Seventh in the final polls after the 41-38 loss to oklahoma state in the fiesta bowl. Just a talented, talented group of coaches in stanford. Their coordinators. It's going to be awfully hard during a season of change -- 
>> Referee: After review, it's ruled the bl did hit the ground, an incomplete pass. It will be fourth down and two from the 40 yard line. Reset the game clock to 13:03. 
>> Gus: So ucla will punt it away. Going to be awfully hard to keep these coordinators here. 
>> Charles: Many jobs open. There's one across the bay at cal now. Offensive coordinator pep hamilton likely to be a strong candidate for that job. Derek mason getting plenty of attention around the country for his work as a defensive coordinator. After the oregon game, his cell phone blew up. Who is that running that defense? Derek mason of stanford. 
>> Gus: If your phone blows up, that means something. The bruins send it away. Terrell lets it go over his head, and it's downed at about the 12 yard line. So the physical group of bruins, the ucla defense back on the field after this. ] tank, the distances aren't getting shorter. ?????? ?????? the trucks are going farther.

[00:59:13]


[ Male Announcer ] AT&T MOBILE SHARE. Add an ipad for just $10 a month. One plan. Up to 10 devices. At&t. Rethink possible. 
>> Gus:7 apiece. 12:54 to play in the second quarter. It's going down in l.A.S the cardinal take over. Stanford, nine plays, 17 yards since the opening drive. As we take a look at the game summary. Here's the handoff. Taylor. Taylor finally going down. Eric kendricks. How about eric kendricks? He's been having a monster all-american season. 
>> Charles: And you mentioned monster. He's a film monster. Likes to spend a lot of time in the film room, understanding defenses as a whole, and figuring out how to get to the ball. When he does, he does quite well. He leads the pac-12 in tackles. How about these numbers last week? Ten tackles, a tackle for a loss, a forced fumble, an interception, and blocked a punt. He was all over the field against ucla. 
>> Gus: Second down and seven to the sidelines and caught. This time patterson holds on and gets out of bounds after picking up the first down. They've been waiting for this kid to come along for quite some time. 
>> Charles: Track speed. Ran on the track team for two years. He's a guy that can stretch the defense. You have to catch it at the end of the play. There's been two already this evening he probably should have caught. Nice for him, nice for the offense that he gets the catch. Very nice throw from kevin hogan to the pocket to the right side of the field. Stuck it right between the 2 and the 1 of patterson. 

[01:01:20]


>> Gus: Ricky seale comes in to run for the cardinal. He will go nowhere. Datone jones. 
>> Charles: Ucla is doing a nice job of controlling the line of scrimmage for the most part against the run game of stanford. Everyone knows where they're supposed to be. You hear about people being gapped down. What gapped down means is each guy has an assignment in their defense against running players. Be in that proper position, be in that gap, and trust your teammate to be there also and not allow them through. 
>> Gus: Second down and 11 at the 43. Hogan in the shotgun. They let it fly. Under pressure. Broken away at the last moment by barr. A flag. Toilolo, the tight end. 
>> Referee: Pass interference on the defense, number 11. 15-yard penalty. First down. 
>> Charles: See, I would not say that he didn't play the ball because he turned and actually played the football. 
>> Gus: I think that's just a bad call. 
>> Charles: I think, if you're going to say you give the call any credence, he put his arm on him before the ball got there. That would be the proper call, not that he didn't play the football because he did turn and play the football. 
>> Gus: Ucla five penalties, 55 yards. Stanford, a clean sheet thus far. First down and ten. At the 38. And nothing. Great tackling by ucla. Andrew abbott. Hester as well. 
>> Charles: You see how he walled everything off. Watch the defensive front of ucla. Running play occurs. There's no place to go. Look at him right there, stop. Where do you go with it? One, two, three, four, five ucla bruins. Stepfan taylor, nowhere to go with the football. Everyone holding the point of attack, staying in their proper gaps and filling. 

[01:03:34]


>> Gus: Second down and 11 at the 37. We haven't seen barr rush the passer yet. He had 12 sacks on the season, fourth in the nation. Hogan steps up. Goes to run. With wheels. Hogan first down. Fluid running stance for kevin hogan, taking no time to tuck it and run. 
>> Charles: How about the defense he got from his star runner stepfan taylor. Watch hogan. Looks downfield, nothing there. Watch to the right side of your screen. Watch the flash in white. That's 33, stepfan taylor, coming from pass protection, getting downfield to assist his quarterback for extra yardage. 
>> Gus: First down at the 47. Play fake. Hogan steps up deep in the pocket. Caught. Down at the 20. One of the great tight ends in all of college football, one of three finalists for the john mackie award. 
>> Charles: It's a two-person route. Toilolo here, ertz here. Clears down the middle across field, and that's where he ends up going with the football. Watch kevin hogan. Takes a look for the deep shot downfield. It's not there. Throws to the open space. Crossing the field. Two-man route, maximum protection, picks him up. 
>> Gus: Last week 106 yards and the game-tying touchdown. Here's the handoff, taylor. Running right. Picks up a couple. 
>> Charles: How many linemen numbers didn't see in the game for stanford right now? Kyle murphy is an extra offensive lineman coming in to go with the traditional heavy set to run the football. They love to bring the extra guys in. There's yankey, versatile offensive line. Hybrid players that can do so many things. Yankey is a versatile offensive lineman. Starts at tackle. Plays heavily at guard. Tight end in their set. Not anything he can't do. One of the most physical offensive linemen in the country. 

[01:05:52]


>> Gus: Second down and eight at the 28 yard line. Hogan up the middle. First and ten. First down cardinal as he gets to the 10 yard line. I like the decision making from kevin hogan. He has really been spreading the football around and been patient with it. He's waited to get ertz involved. 
>> Charles: How many redshirt freshmen do you and I know that can stay in the pocket like that when your first start of the season goes against a ranked team like oregon state. So his start to this year have all been ranked teams. Oregon state, oregon, and stanford. And his presence in the pocket terrific. 
>> Gus: Now he lines up as a wide receiver. Here's the wildcat. Touchdown, stanford. Anthony wilkerson, the junior from foothill ranch, california. Gives stanford a 13-7 lead. 
>> Charles: Wildcat goes left. He ends up fouling. Kevin danser, the offensive guard, who's been dominant at times in the offensive line. 
>> Gus: Last week gets the game winning field goal in overtime. The extra point is good. Smashmouth football, west coast style.

>>> Coming up on pizza hut halftime, the florida gators against florida state. 
>> Gus:14-7 stanford. This is the third straight week stanford has faced a ranked team -- oregon state, oregon, and now ucla. The first time in five years the cardinal has had a stretch like this. Stanford has never beaten three ranked teams in three weeks in school history. 
>> Charles: Just think, already the teams may beat number one in the country and number two in the country in terms of the ap poll. This team is really putting together sustained excellence. 

[01:10:17]


>> Gus: Kenneth walker. And walker gets to the 20 yard line before being taken down. Let's take a look at the aflac trivia question. David shaw has won ten seasons. Jim mora has nine. Who holds the record for wins in their first season? This is a tough one. 
>> Charles: I don't know the answer. Okay if I guess? 
>> Gus: No because you do have the answer. 
>> Charles: I don't know the answer. I do va suspicious. 
>> Gus: And you're probably right. First down and ten. Johnathan franklin. 
>> Charles: Both of these teams' defensive fronts make it difficult to run the ball continuously. First four possessions, ucla started out with a bang with a touchdown. The last three having to punt the football. 
>> Gus: Now out of the backfield, franklin, breaking tackles. Yac. 
>> Charles: You saw something you don't see very often. Trent murphy, number 93, out in open field with a position to make the tackle. Franklin slipped it and gained additional yardage to make it third and five. Should have been a third and ten play. Franklin made something out of nothing. 
>> Gus: Third down and five at the 26. Here's hundley over the middle. Shaq evans, his intended receiver, nothing doing. Terrence brown breaks it up, and the bruins have to punt it away with 7:36 to play in the second quarter. 
>> Charles: That young man's come a long way, had a real tough fiesta bowl, trying to guard justin blackmon, oklahoma state. To put it mildly, difficult evening. 
>> Gus: Great experience, though. 
>> Charles: Great experience, though, and really bounced back, accepted the challenge in the spring, and has been playing very well this season. 
>> Gus: Terrell to the 25. Terrell with some running room. And he is finally tripped up at the 45. A 49-yard punt, a 19-yard return. Stanford in good shape with the ball. Great field position and the lead.

- for an idea. A grand idea called america. The idea that if you work hard, if you have a dream, if you work with your neighbors... You can do most anything. This led to other ideas like liberty and rock 'n' roll. To free markets, free enterprise, and free refills. It put a man on the moon and a phone in your pocket. Our country's gone through a lot over the centuries and a half. But this idea isn't fragile. When times get tough, it rallies us as one. Every day, more people believe in the american idea and when they do, the dream comes true. We're grateful to be part of it. Wah-wah-wah. Wah-wah-wah-wah.

[01:14:53]


>> Gus:14-7 cardinal. Stanford first down and ten at their own 44 yard line. Kevin hogan looking for his tight end, especially zach ertz. Here's the play underneath, and patterson. Patterson will get inside bruin territory. Let's answer the aflac trivia question. As a college, jim mora has nine. Who holds the record for wins in their first season? It's peterson of boise state. 11 wins in '06. 
>> Charles: That was the year they won in the bowl game. 
>> Gus: Down the sideline! Taylor, touchdown, cardinal. And stanford takes a 20-7 lead. 
>> Charles: Look at this. Stanford always says we don't care what the box count is, we'll run the ball. When you have a box count like that, everyone's close. What's back here? No one. So you popped into the crease, and it's just a foot race. Stepfan taylor won that. 
>> Gus: For the extra point. 49-yard run for stepfan taylor and a flag on the play. Taylor goes 49 yards. Let's see the flag first before we go to break. 
>> Referee: Lined up in the neutral zone. That penalty is declined. The play is good. 
>> Gus:21-7 stanford. that cereal? Cmon, hurry up. Eat y'all food so you can go to school. Let me have some. That's good. Uh huh. Bronie, what you doing over there? Nothing. Let me get that.

(Laughter) Exclusively at at&t. Buy any Samsung Galaxy Smartphone and save up to $200 off an eligible Samsung Tablet. 
>> Gus: Stepfan taylor, 32 carries. That last run, we just went back and watched it while we were in the break. They ran that against a nine-man box. All 11 were within ten yards of the line of scrimmage. Once they're in the crease, he popped it. 
>> Referee: Kickoff out of bounds by the kicking team. Ball will sit at the 35 yard line. First down. 
>> Gus: Stepfan taylor in his career, he just put up fantastic numbers. 
>> Charles: He does it all because it's not just the running ability. It's the toughness he exhibits running the football. Last week at oregon. That win carried 39 times. He passes with the best in the country. Can catch it out of the backfield. 
>> Gus: Johnathan franklin backed by shayne skov. Franklin trying to find running room. Tough sledding so far as he gains three there. Two terrific pac-12 running backs in action this evening in pasadena. Second and seven at the 38. It's franklin again. 
>> Charles: Interesting call for noel mazzone. 'S third and short. They pride themselves on being a physical run team. But that is a stout defense for stanford. Do you take the shot running it or a pass for brett hundley? 

[01:19:23]


>> Gus: Third down and two at the 43. Here's hundley. The wheel route. He's got his receiver. Incomplete. Flag on the play. Jordon james, if he could have held on to that football. 
>> Charles: They had the play set, didn't they? Excellent call by noel mazzone. They were unable to execute it. 
>> Referee: Illegal shift on the offense. Two men moving at the same time without setting. That penalty is declined. Fourth down. 
>> Charles: Ball just slightly behind but catchable. Jim mora said there's no correlation between penalties and winning, did a 20-year study. When you take a look at tonight, those are the penalties that stop drives. That first down penalty, this penalty here killed a drive. 
>> Gus: All the way into the end zone for a touchback, a 57-yard punt by jeff locke. Let's take a look at this afternoon's kay jewellers headlines. How about ohio state? 
>> Charles: Undefeated on the season. Their season is over due to probation, but they posted a number. They're going to have the ap voters take a look and see where they want to post the ohio state buckeyes. Mike gillislee, erin andrews, your florida gators went to tallahassee and won a game most said they couldn't win. And kenjon barner bounced back against stanford last week. Oregon hoping to get into the championship title game if stanford loses. 
>> Gus: Four-yard gain. 

[01:21:33]


>> Charles: Number 35 comes off the field. That helmet off. New rule this week. He's been an outstanding player. Benefit to both of them on the defense. 
>> Gus: Second down and 23. Hogan on the move. Fires on the run. At the 40. And the tight end for stanford over the years. Currently six in the nfl. 
>> Charles: And this is why. These are divides who can block in the point of attack and also they're move guys who can go in open field and catch it. That last throw made by kevin hogan, to me, that's a confidence throw, partner. He had the short pass wide open to ryan hewitt. He took the longer version because he feels good about his ability to fit the ball in. 
>> Gus: First d and ten at the 40. Here's the wildcat. Wilkerson runs. And wilkerson gained a couple. I remember a few years back, my former colleague brett jones, who I worked with doing nfl games. He took me to dinner. He said, I want you to come over to my buddy's house and have dinner. I'm going to introduce you to my tight end, a kid I'm working with. We go over there. Who's the kid? Zach ertz. 
>> Charles: And if he's learning from brett jones, you're learning at an all pro level. Zach ertz is having that kind of year. A finalist for the mackie award, which is the top tight end in the country. 
>> Gus: Second down and eight. The ball is knocked away! And luckily, stanford right there. Datone jones punched it out. 
>> Charles: Stanford fortunate. Datone jones with the pass rush. Jones working inside. Right there getting to the arm. He comes around on kevin danser, number 76. Very alertly, hogan jumped on the loose football. 
>> Gus: Third down and a long 15 for the cardinal. At the 35. Low snap handled by hogan. Trying to set up a screen. Here's taylor running outside, and he'll go out of bounds. Not enough for the first, though. Stanford will be forced to punt it away. 

[01:23:49]


>> Charles: That tells you how big of a play that was by datone jones. When he knocks the ball away, stanford doesn't get it downfield at all with a pass attempt. Puts him behind in down and distance and sets things up for a long third down. Now the ball has to be punted. Nice stand by ucla on defense. 
>> Gus: Fourth punt of the evening for stanford. 3:13 to go. Ucla with three time-outs left. Ucla has it! Loose ball at the 20 yard line! Barr with the recovery on the bad snap, and the bruins are in business. What ucla has just done is stolen a possession because they've stolen field position. They were getting the ball back, but with the low snap, anthony barr, who last week came off the field injured, and eric kendricks came in and blocked the punt in his stead, stays on the field here and knocks it free, and cassius marsh picks it up. Take a look at that. Jeff ulbrich, linebackers/special teams coach, happy about what he saw. 
>> Gus: I believe it's zychlinski down, the punter. He was tackled pretty hard by anthony barr. 
>> Charles: Remember anthony barr knocked matt barkley, the usc quarterback, out of the game. He won't play tonight. Two blocked kicks in the previous two games by ucla special teams. Now add this tonight with a huge change of field position, knocking the ball free is anthony barr. Cassius marsh picks it up. Now ucla in scoring territory just outside the red zone. 

[01:26:00]


>> Gus: Zychlinski walking off the field. Ball on the sideline. 
>> Charles: That's a big momentum play. You want to attack right away on first down with brett hundley's arm. 
>> Gus: First down and ten at the stanford 22. Franklin. Ucla determined to run the ball and turned away that time. Ben gardner. 
>> Charles: You did say determined. That's a great word for it. That's exactly what they are. They do not want to just concede the run game and turn into a passing deal. You see zychlinski go to the locker room for medical attention. 
>> Gus: Second down and ten at the 42. Hundley steps up. Stays on his feet. Hundley lofts it as ben gardner finally gets into the backfield. Third sack of the day for stanford. 
>> Charles: I like your description because that's the next part of the evolution of brett hundley, getting rid of the football in the pocket under duress where no one's going to get it, no one's going to intercept it. Ucla started the night 4 of 5 on third down. They're 0-4 since then as we start third and 18. 
>> Gus: Here's hundley. Shaq evans! Incomplete. 
>> Charles: Good roar, but i felt the coverage was excellent. The quarterback had him on, and it was tipped. Watch number 25 ride shaq evans to the sideline. Really no place to come down with it. He didn't leave him room by positioning. A well thrown football, but that would have been very difficult to come down inbounds, and ed reynolds was there to ensure he doesn't come down inbounds. 

[01:28:03]


>> Gus: Now a decision being made by ucla. 
>> Charles: You know ka'imi fairbairn, their kicker. 
>> Gus: His long on the season, 35 yards. 
>> Charles: When you're thinking about what you do with ucla, you're not thinking about long field goals with him. 
>> Gus: Time-out called by ucla. SFX- "sounds of african drum and flute" Look who's back. Again? It's embarrassing It's embarrassing! We can see you Carl. We can totally see you. Come on you're better than this...all that prowling around. Yeah, you're the king of the jungle. Have you thought about going vegan Carl? Hahaha!! You know folks who save hundreds of dollars by switching to GEICO sure are happy. How happy are they Jimmy? Happier than antelope with night-vision goggles. Nice! Get happy. Get GEICO. Fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more. 
>> Gus: Ka'imi fairbairn will attempt a 38-yarder. His season long 35. Coach mora looking for a breakthrough from this kid. And he may have it. Wow. 
>> Charles: I think you nailed it, partner. 
>> Gus: You gave it to me, partner. 
>> Charles: When you say looking for a brkthrough, you're exactly right. Down 21-7. They know they're going to play again next week. Now mora has been pushing fairbairn all year long. Let's try him out there. If this goes through the post, we may have something to work with next week in the pac-12 championship game. If it doesn't, he knows how to has to call the game. 
>> Gus: Remember at the beginning of the season, the game at wright, extra point. 

[01:30:06]


>> Charles: Couldn't kick one. 
>> Gus: Couldn't kick one. 
>> Charles: It was unbelievable. Now how about that? Fairbairn will now walk on that sideline like he's paul bunyan. Walk like he's 6'11", walk proud. His first field goal made over 35 yards this year. Congratulations to him. 
>> Gus: In high school, he had a long of 55 yards. 
>> Charles: The coach stuck with him the whole way and kept showing confidence in him. 
>> Gus: Locke will send it out of the end zone as usual. Stanford will have it at the 25. Don't forget, coming up at the half is the pizza hut halftime show with erin andrews, eddie george, and joey harrington. They'll cover all of today's action, including the gators, the sooners, eddie, I'm sure, is very confident and very loud with his ohio state buckeyes this afternoon. Unfortunately, I had to listen to him. 
>> Charles: All three colleagues in the studio all celebrating wins. E.A. With the florida gators, eddie george with ohio state, and harrington. All breaking out the colors today. 
>> Gus: Stepfan taylor. Anthony barr with the mma slam. 
>> Charles: They're not far away from breaking them big, are they? 
>> Gus: Not at all. 
>> Charles: Ucla playing a lot of people close to the line of scrimmage, trying to mug the line of scrimmage, and get into that running lane. They're finding him anyway. 
>> Gus: Finds taylor. Stepfan taylor gets to midfield with 1:13 to . Stanford with three time-outs left. Hogan handing it to taylor. Stepfan taylor with the three-yard gain. Eric kendricks with the tackle. Stanford uses a time-out in this situation. The ufc returns to fox this fall. 52 seconds to go in this first half. Your impression of this first half so far? 

[01:33:03]


>> Charles: When we were talking about how it would be played, started being played as a defensive position. Both offenses scored on the initial drive, and stanford has taken charge now, able to run the football a little more effectively. Kevin hogan throwing the ball, has been extremely accurate in the first half. 
>> Gus: Second and seven at the 46. Hogan drops it off to taylor. Taylor will lose a couple of yards on the play. They try to set up the screen pass. Andrew abbott making the tackle with 36 seconds to go. 
>> Charles: After the punt, mechanics were messed up. Ucla had first and ten on the 21, 22 yard line. Gets another field goal. Defense is imposing their will at times in this game. 
>> Gus: Third down and eight at the 47. Hogan sacked. Beautiful job by damien holmes. Ucla pinning their ears back and dropping the young quarterback. 
>> Charles: How about ucla holding stanford without points on their last drive heading to the half? 
>> Gus: It's halftime here at the rose bowpasadena. Stanford 21, ucla 10. Here's e.A. At the halftime show. 
>> We have a ton to talk about on the pizza hut halftime. Florida gators and what they did in tallahassee. Overtime in new orleans between the sooners and cowboys. Johnny maziel got a little dinged up.Rlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrld needs more impossible, more unreasonable,

>> Gus: Stanford trying to make the championship game. Stepfan taylor is doing his part, taking this 49 yards to the house. Cardinal lead the bruins 21-10 at the half. With that said, we welcome you inside "pizza hut halftime." Eddie orge, joey harrington, this has already been a great day. Can't wait to see what unfolds tonight. Let's talk about this game in particular. Stanford, what's keeping them in the first half? 
>> It's been the play of quarterback kevin hogan. Ever since last week against oregon, you can see his confidence just brewing right now. Charles davis talked about that during the course of this game is that his game is going to another level. His play has taken stanford's team to a new level. They could compete for a national championship caliber team. 
>> Stepfan taylor has been fantastic. But johnathan franklin on the other side isn't the player he's been the last few weeks. He's been slowed up by a fantastic stanford run defense. They shut down kenyon barner last weekend. But they need to get explosive plays out of brett hundley. 
>> So many scenarios we're trying to figure out today and so many teams cheering for others, like the oregon ducks. Who are they cheering for today? That's the ucla bruins. They've got to take care of business in the civil war. 
>> Traveling to old corvallis to play the 116th civil war, and that's deanthony thomas, who really ran for 114 of them. He takes that one up the sideline for a touchdown. Big win for the ducks. 
>> Iron bowl. Auburn visiting alabama. Mismatch time. 
>> A win and alabama clinches the s.E.C. West. All alabama here. 38-yard touchdown. Down goes auburn. Alabama going to the s.E.C. Championship game. 
>> And a tune-up game for georgia as they face georgia tech today before the s.E.C. Championship. 

[01:40:02]


>> This is who 'bama is playing. Aaron murray to jay rome for a 24-yard touchdown. Georgia big 42-10 over georgia tech. 
>> This one not so easy. Number 2 florida facing number 10 florida state. 
>> E.J. Manuel takes it in for a one-yard touchdown, getting florida state on top after being down early. Later on, e.J. Manuel takes a big hit, fumbles the football. Gators would recover. Manuel would leave the game for a series but would return. The ensuing possession, takes it in from 37 yards out. This would put florida up for good. Florida 37-26 over the seminoles. 
>> Wedon't know what's going to happen as the notre dame-usc game is about to start with number one. Two through five took care of business today. As we mentioned before we went to the highlights. Will muschamp had the best in his presser. He said, fight on. I'm a big lane kiffin fan. Everyone cheering for usc now. 
>> Everyone in the country cheering for them. Oregon is cheering for them. Everyone wants usc to knock off notre dame because that creates chaos. That allows everyone to get into this crazy computer bcs formula. So many scenarios. We don't have time to talk about all of them. 
>> I love yours. It's interesting. 
>> All it starts with is notre dame losing. That creates havoc. If they win, it's a very simple formula. 
>> They go in that slot at that point in time. Florida at three. And a big win against florida state, take care of business down there. The s.E.C. Championship game. Could be an all-s.E.C. National championship game this year. 
>> And with alabama and georgia facing off in the s.E.C. Championship next week, whoever -- they're going to get an invite, obviously, to the national championship. The winner of that game. Let's do more highlights because we've confused everybody. Bedlam. That's what I feel we have right now. 
>> Oklahoma trailing oklahoma state 48-45 in overtime. This is brennan clay going in from 18 yards out. Oklahoma with a big win in overtime. Bedlam 51-48, oklahoma. 

[01:42:12]


>> To the big ten. Wisconsin at penn state. Penn state, final game of the year. 
>> Montee ball takes it and runs itfrom seven yards out. He becomes the all time career rusher. Fourth qter of the ball game. 21-14. Then tied up at 21 kyle french's 44-yard effort just wide. Ends their season with a 24-21 win does penn state. 
>> Who is this guy? Anyone heard of him? Johnny manziel. A big scare for aggie fans as johnny manziel goes down with a knee injury. He would leave the game, head back to the locker room for an examination, but he would come back later on in the quarter. The very next play, though, hands off to christian michael, who takes it in from 30 yards out. 
>> Johnny manziel would come back. He did go to the locker room, have that knee checked out. He came back, and guess what he did? 
>> Let's see. Touchdown? 
>> He didn't even miss a beat. A&m 28-0. This one got a little nasty this week. The gamecocks versus clemson. 
>> Talk about a guy going for the heisman, tajh boyd, heck of a year. Pass to hopkins and the 43-yard press down. He ties a school record for 34 touchdowns in a season. 
>> Wow. 
>> Before we get to talking about johnny manziel, I want to say congratulations to bill o'brien and all the players at penn state, all the guys that decided to stay, and particularly those seniors. They didn't ask for everything that happened, and to just gut it ou the way they did, I think he did a tremendous job. A lot of people talking about bill o'brien for coach of the year, guys. Johnny manziel. 
>> Where do we start? I mean, he's the hot topic. He's the flavor of the month. 

[01:44:15]


>> It's like the tim tebow conversation. 
>> It really is. I'm not buying this right now. Here's why. The heisman trophy is won in big games, in big moments. Alabama game for johnny was grate. The other two games, he had combined under 100 yards rushing. He deserves to win. It's a phenomenal sas on. But manti te'o laiding hids defense. Marqise lee making every play imaginable. 
>> You're both getting called out on twitter. Haters. 
>> We're not haters. Just speak the truth. 
>> Let's fire up the pizza hut man cave and check out pizza hut's greatest play of the day. Joey, is it the johnny manziel highlight? No, I'm kidding. 
>> If it was, I would be all over it. This one comes from bedlam. Kenny stills from landry jones. I don't want it the first time. I'm going to spin the camera around and find the football and do a flip for good measure. Kenny stills with the diving, flipping, bouncing catch in bedlam. Oklahoma with the win today. 
>> He has good hair too. Eddie, how about you? 
>> This is not a play of the day. But a great team. In between quarters, ohio state on it. Buckeyes playing in front of head coach jim tressel. Players want to show him some love. He goes up on their shoulders. Ohio state with the big win. 
>> Hey, you can tell us how to make a great pla at foxsports.Com/pizzahut. Make it great. After the break, some of you will get a news update from your local fox affiliate while the rest of you will rejoin us back here to break down a second half of stanford-ucla when the pizza hut halftime returns. 

[01:46:37]


-- smaller? Bigger! Bigger! Bigger! Bigger! So, which would you rather have -- a big treehouse or a small treehouse? If it's big enough, you can have a disco. Oh, yeah! Why do you not want a smaller treehouse? Because it wouldn't be able to fit a flat-screen tv, and then the tv would be about this big, and you would have to hold the wire, and the position you would hold the wire, you wouldn't be able to see the tv.

>> good evening everybody. We hope you're enjoying the game I'm joyce evans with your "fox 29" half time report t night the search is on for the person who shot a man in the face. It happened at 51 the and well low in southwest philadelphia. It happened overnight. The victim told police the gunman first tried to rob him then he pulled out his gun and shot him in the face. That victim was still able to run to a nearby fire station for help. Luckily he's expected to be okay but so far no arrests a no suspects. Investigators are working to determine the cause of this fire in philadelphia's fairmount neighborhood. Firefighters were called out to this home at 15th and mount vernon streets just after 11:30 last night. Took about 15 minutes to get the flames under control here. Nobody was hurt. 
>> And here's "fox 29" meteorologist caitlin roth with your forecast. Hey, caitlin. 
>> Hey, joyce. Much much colder today as we said goodbye to the warm weather from friday. Temperatures only reached 44 earlier this afternoon. The normal highs for this time of year is 53. Even a few flurries spotings across the area earlier this afternoon. Stayed very cold into tonight. The clouds will clear out. To tone 15 miles an hour winds, 25 is all for the bush. 30 the overnight low in the city tomorrow, very similar to today. We start off with some sunshine. The winds start to crank. It's very windy and cold. 44 for the high and those clouds return quickly by mid morning. All about how it feels outside due to the wind chills. For tomorrow, 32 is the morning temperature but it will feel like 23. Low to mid 40s in the afternoon will feel closer to 30 degrees. It might not be as windy but we'll still get gusts over 25 miles an hour at times. How long will this chill last? The answer is in your seven day forecast coming up after the game. Joyce. 
>> We're afraid to ask. That's your "fox 29" half time report. Join me tonight for full wrap up of the day's news, weather and sports. Enjoy the rest of the game. 

[01:54:40]


>> Gus: Stanford on top of u.S. As we prepare to start the second half. Gus johnson along with charles davis. Your thoughts on the first half. 
>> Charles: Thought both offenses dominated when they both went down the field and scored the first drive. Defenses started to dictate. Ucla did a nice job in run defense, not many places for stanford to go. But when you're running eight, nine guys in the box, stanford doesn't mind the box count. Then you have stepfan taylor with no safety back taking it to the house and giving stanford the advantage. A big play for ucla. Anthony barr tackles daniel zychlinski and creates a turnover. But guess what? It only resulted in three points for ucla after first and ten at the 22 yard line. 
>> Gus: So ucla will receive to start the second half. Down 21-10. This one out of the end zone. Now let's go downstairs to julie alexandria. 
>> I just spoke to coach moira as he was coming back. Right now we have to play with urgency and efficiency. At this moment, we're just not. I just heard from a trainer that zychlinski's return is highly unlikely in this game. Guys? 
>> Gus: Thank you very much, julie. 
>> Charles: If zychlinski can't punt, they have to turn to the backup, ben rhyne. 
>> Gus: Let's take a look at the ford statistical comparison. 
>> Charles: You look at the rush yards, stanford after a slow start, ucla doing a nice job in run defense, found a way to create yardage with stepfan taylor with that big sprint to the end zone against the box. Created that yardage for them. 
>> Gus: From the 25. Hundley underneath. And jerry johnson close to the first down. He'll gain nine. Ucla quickly to the line of scrimmage. Hundley, 7 of 15, 140 yards, and the touchdown. They'll run the ball. Johnathan franklin breaks through and picks up the first down. He almost popped that one. 

[01:57:03]


>> Charles: That was similar to the one for stepfan taylor. Defensive coordinator brought a run blitz on that play. He was one step away from going for big yardage. 
>> Gus: Henry anderson, david perry stops him. First down for the bruins. And it's johnathan franklin. Franklin outside, first down and even more. And a flag, though, back at the 39. This may come back. 
>> Referee: Holding, offense, number 72. Ten-yard penalty. First down. 
>> Charles: That's alberto cid, a backup offensive lineman. That run negated. Let's take a look. Right there. Cid working on trent murphy working on number 93. Got his hands outside the frame of the body of the defensive player. The referee caught him. 
>> Gus: So it negates an 18-yard pickup. First down and 19 at the 27. Hundley out of the backfield. Looking for jordon james. Second ball jordon james has dropped this evening. 
>> Charles: What stanford does on defense, they make you score all the time. Scoring plays on stanford defense nak you get there. When you're in that many plays, errors tend to happen. 
>> Gus: Second down and 19. Picked up close to a first down in heavy traffic as hundley has time to throw the football. And that was caught by devin fuller, the freshman from new jersey. 

[01:59:04]


>> Charles: Pass protection excellent for brett hundley to have a chance to find a target downfield. 
>> Gus: And johnathan franklin, first down. We had a chance to catch up with devin fuller's mom yesterday at a restaurant here in pasadena. She's a backup singer for bruce springsteen. She's traveled all over the world. First down and ten at the 47. Two-yard gain. Also, she's got a 14-year-old kid has already been offered a scholarship to play football at rutgers. 
>> Charles: So with that being said, everybody else breaking in there. 
>> Gus: Second and nine at the 48. 
>> Charles: He came to ucla thinking he was the next michael vick, but they needed him to play receiver right now. 
>> Gus: Hundley out of the backfield. Frank lip, violent hitting, nicely done by terrence brown. He wrapped up, delivered a blow. A two-yard gain. 
>> Charles: That was part of his game the defensive staff at stanford told him he needed to work on. He needed to become a better tackler. Took him to heart, and he's been a consistent tackler all season long. 
>> Gus: They need seven yards at midfield. Brett hundley. Sideline. Incomplete, shaq evans. Ball thrown behind him. And evans unable to grab it. Forced to punt. 
>> Charles: That didn't look like where brett hundley was throwing it, that shaq evans thought that's where it was coming. Shaq evans had something else in mind than the throw that brett hundley made. Weren't quite connected on that play. 
>> Gus: Jeff locke from the 35. Hangs this one high in the air, great job. Fair caught at the 21. 29-yard punt. Great hang time. One of the things locke has been working on. 12:10 to play in the third quarter. Stanford cardinal back on offense. play. But what about the strategy... The teamwork... The execution... That is logistics. And that... Is what we do. ?????? ??????

>> Gus: Welcome back to the rose bowl here in pasadena. Kevin hogan, 116 yards. He was sacked twice. Stepfan taylor, the 21st 100-yard game for taylor. A school record, passing gerhart. First down. Hogan, bootleg, dropped it off. Hewitt. With the first down. Will go out of bounds close to the 40 yard line. Sheldon price there to usher him out of bounds. They'll mark it at the 36. 

[02:04:24]


>> Charles: How about how they manufacture plays? Lk, this is everyone. Uptight. What do they do? They run into a three-level sideline route. First was the next level. Then deeper than that. Everything off of a heavy run. 
Gus: Hand it off. A one-yard pickup as he's ridden down hard. Barr in on it again. So much balance on this david shaw coached stanford cardinal team. 
>> Charles: And what he wants to do is establish that physicality first and foremost with his team. A lot of guys who are former players, you would think that that's what they adopt as a persona. David shaw ask a wide receiver. You think we'd see more wide open, spread out passing plays. He calls the game as if he were a former offensive lineman. 
>> Gus: Second down and nine at the 38. Hogan delivers. Wrestled down by eric kendricks. The ucla jerseys are hard to see them. 
>> Charles: The only thing i would add -- this union corn is a tribute to the kenny washington team back in the day. Cold letters. That's all owe ask. Gold letters. We're good. 
>> Gus: Third down and six at the 41. Low snap, hogan in trouble. Good decision by the quarterback. 
>> Charles: He's up 21-10, and his defense is playing the game very well. Don't make a mistake. Field position to ucla's defense. Nice poise for the redshirt freshman from gonzaga prep near washington, d.C. 

[02:06:26]


>> Gus: Here's something to pay attention to. Now ben rhyne comes in to punt for daniel zychlinski. He's never punted in a college game. But was all-state in north carolina his senior year.

[02:09:05]


>> Gus: Welcome back to the rose bowl. Just a beautiful night, beautiful day as well. Here's pasadena. 10:11 to play third quarter. Ucla taking over. Take a look at their offensive leaders. Hundley's numbers. Franklin. Franklin looks close to being able to break one. 
>> Charles: One good one was called back on a holding penalty. Shaq evans in there at receiver. I want to see if ucla wants to try to push the ball downfield a little bit more. 
>> Gus: Hundley looking. Incomplete. Jerry johnson, the intended receiver. Almost a one-handed grab from jerry. Here the question, charles, if you take another look. 
>> Charles: That would have been a spectacular catch because he sees the defensive back, devin carrington coming at it. Think his concentration went a little bit there. 
>> Gus: Second and ten. Nothing for james. Here's a question. If you're ucla and there's a chance that you have to play stanford next week at stanford in the pac-12 championship, do you show everything? Do you -- 
>> Charles: You know, I like where you're going with that because I think it's an interesting dilemma for jim mora. I think the way he preached in his first year to his team that you never take a play off or a down off or a series off that he'll play to play this game to win all the way through. 
>> Gus: Every 0 the middle. Almost intercepted -- and intercepted by the cardinal. Out of nowhere, jordan richards, the 22nd straight game in which stanford has forced a turnover. Fourth longest active streak in the nation. 
>> Charles: Hundley down the middle. Throws it behind his intended receiver, and richards, look at that catch. Look at that shade right there. Tell me that's not david tyree in the super bowl against rodney harrison. Ball, can, helmet. 

[02:11:07]


>> Gus: Stanford takes over at the 42. Stepfan taylor with running room. Gets outside. Taylor turns on the juice. And the ball is inside the 5. 
>> Charles: Listen, they don't care about box count, do they? Look at that. And guess what? They're going to run it anyway. They don't worry about tha they've pressed the run. Look at yankey, 54 out in front. And taylor with nice moves, good vision, and gets outside. Ten people in the box. Stanford undaunted. 
>> Gus: First down and goal at the ucla 2. After the 40-yard rush. Hewitt, the upback. Here's stepfan. And he will not get in. Stepfan taylor. Stopped short of the goal line. 
>> Charles: You remember at notre dame, they had a goal to goal situation, and they ran it four straight times and didn't get in. Disputed call at the end. Did he or didn't he? I thought maybe got in on second down, and they didn't count it. Fourth down, his momentum was stopped. Didn't get in. Will stanford do it if they have to go four downs and do that again? 
>> Gus: Fourth down and one. Taylor again. Taylor will not get in. Looked like barr was there. 
>> Charles: Ucla.Ing up a stance. I don't think stanford is thinking field goal here. I think they're in four down territory unless they get a lost yardage play on this one. As you called it, barr stands him up and pulls him short of the goal line. If you throw the ball, this is the down for stanford. I do believe they're thinking four downs, though, to try and get six. 
>> Gus: Third down and goal at the 1. Hewitt and taylor. Two tight ends. Taylor again. This time, touchdown cardinal. His second of the day. 

[02:13:24]


>> Charles: They went heavy, heavy, heavy up front. You saw 96 in motion. Dillon bonnell, normally a guard, wearing a tight end's number to seize eligible to come into the game and lead the charge. That massive offensive line, they pound it in for another score. 
>> Gus:7:41 to play in the third quarter. Stanford takes a 28-10 lead. The touchdown, though, made possible by the interception. Jordan richards doing a nice job holding on. And davis pays it off. ????????? How advanced is the new Ford Fusion? Well...it has outstanding performance and handling... ...and it offers a plug-in hybrid that gets a projected 100 MPGe.

Especially when you consider that david shaw beat chip kelly, and with a win today, has a chance to go and play in the pac-12 championship at home. Jim mora also winning the south. Beat the number one and number two teams in the nation, 4-2 against usc and notre dame. Interesting. 
>> Gus: Dropped it. Stanford has the football. Running. Stanford. Touchdown! Amanam. Usua amanam picks up the fumble. A ten-yard return for a touchdown. Alex with the tackle. 

[02:18:03]


>> Charles: Just the way you're taught. Usua amanam carries it into the end zone for stanford.

>> Gus:35-10 stanford, extending the lead. In the fourth quarter, jackie brown ran 24 yards. 12 seconds to go. Garcia kicks a 31-yard field goal to give stanford a 13-12 upset win. That was stanford's last rose victory in 1972. 
>> Charles: They won the previous year with jim plunkett as the quarterback. The next year was a surprise when they won again. 
>> Gus: Devin fuller. And fuller out of bounds. He gets close to the 40. A 34-yard return. A lot at stake. The pac-12 championship game will be played next week. 
>> Charles: Stanford can close out this game. They host ucla next week. Ucla knows they're playing. They can come back and win this game. Then they head to oregon to win the ducks. They'll host the ucla rally. 
>> Referee: Holding, offense, number 54. 
>> Gus: Let's go to erin andrews for a game break. 
>> Notre dame already up 3-0. Theo riddick adds on to that with this nine-yard touchdown run. Irish leading usc 10-0. 
>> Charles: They've got a national championship game in their sights right now, finishing at usc. We all thought that game was one that usc would be playing for the national title berth. 
>> Gus: Johnathan franklin, not much over the right side. Maybe a yard. Henry anderson with the tackle. 
>> Charles: You have those kinds of penalties on first down and put yourself so far behind and make changes in your play calling, in your approach, and the run defense of stanford, the overall defense of stanford really starts to take hold in long yardage situations. 

[02:23:02]


>> Gus: Hundley needs to get rid of it. But he'll eat the sack. Fourth time he's been sacked tonight. A.J. Hartley getting through. 
>> Charles: Why does the pressure work? Take a look at the three boxes. Boxes to your upper left and upper right. Where does he go with the football? Which allows the pass rush in the middle to get to him and envelope him. 
>> Gus: Stanford ranked second in the nation in sacks. They have four in this game. Hundley again. Devin fuller with the catch. Tell you what, charles. It's what stanford has been able to do. Thif shut it down on ucla. These kids, you know they're tough. You know they're physical. Pretty surprised. 
>> Charles: They're also athletic. But the stanford defense, they do everything you just described very well, and they make plays. They're terrific athletes. 
>> Gus: A 56-yard punt with a five-yard return. Tomorrow start your nfl sunday with the fox nfl sunday pregame show with terry bradshaw, quarterback drew brees to discuss the saints unique season. Plus get a behind the scenes look at vikings star jared allen on and off the field. All at noon on the "fox nfl sunday pregame show" tomorrow at noon eastern/9:00 a.M. Pacific. 
>> Charles: How about our teammate erin andrews doing all that extra duty all year long with different features for the pregame show? Thursday she was in dallas launching the cowboys-redskins game for fox. She does it all. 
>> Gus: Here's the handoff. Young in the corner. Young. A flag thrown at the far side at the 23. teven McDonald eventually with the tackle. 

[02:25:17]


>> Referee: Holding, offense, number 21. Ten-yard penalty. First down. 
>> Gus: And that's patterson, first penalty of the evening for stanford. 
>> Charles: That's the first thing he's done in a while. Had two nice catches. That's great for the young man and his confidence. They need him to continue to stretch the field to help his running game, which is something the stanford receivers do a very nice job of. 
>> Gus: First down and a long 16 at the 14. Anthony wilkerson in the backfield with hewitt lined up as an h-back. Fake the pitch, run left, wilkerson, going down torts zunwalt, bottom of the pile for ucla. Anyway, getting back to what we were talking about a little earlier. If you're jim mora, do you show your full hand knowing, especially at this point, the score 35-10, do you show your full hand knowing that next week you could play this team again? 
>> Charles: I think you do in terms of this, gus. He's preached to this team that we're taking nothing off, nothing for granted. We never give up on anything. If he tucks his horns in now and says, okay, let's go vanilla, he's sending his team a different message than he's been preaching since he got to ucla. I don't think jim mora is going to do that. 
>> Gus: Second and 12 at the 18. Hogan elects to run it, and hogan picks up a nice chunk gain of nine. As eric kendricks comes up with the tackle. Third down and three at the 27. Datone jones comes out. Over the middle, incomplete. Ball intended for ty montgomery. First time we've mentioned his name, and he takes his eyes off the football. Stanford will punt. 

[02:27:51]


>> Charles: Good defensive series for ucla, getting off the field on third down. 
>> Gus: For now, ben rhyne, who comes back in for daniel zychlinski, second punt of his career. 42 yards on the burst. Angles this one towards the sideline. the bcs top ten and how they fare today. 
>> Charles: Notre dame up in the early going at usc. Alabama up 42-0 at auburn. Really called him off and went 49-0. Georgia really starting to look good. That alabama game and the s.E.C. Game will be terrific. They pounded georgia tech. Florida, a game many people didn't think florida would go and win and put up those kinds of numbers on offense. 
>> Gus: First down and ten at the 35. Hundley. Hundley, nobody open. He'll run. Hundley up the sideline. Hundley with room. And goes out of bounds. A 38-yard run for brett hundley. Would like to see a few that could win more. 
>> Charles: Jim mora's been encouraging him. What's interesting is, if brett hundley began the season doing what? First play of his college career. 
>> Gus: Touchdown at rice. 
>> Charles:72 yards on a run. That's more what they want to see. 
>> Charles: The continued growth is what's on the checklist for noel mazzone. First what does he do in the face of pressure and not take many sacks? They want him to use his legs, but the next step is not losing yardage or taking the sack. 

[02:29:55]


>> Gus: He puts that in the keyhole over the fauria. We haven't heard from him since the frst half. 
>> Charles: Look to the left of your screen. Fauria working inside, and a really nice throw. You talk about the keyhole. That's between three stanford cardinal defenders as he throws it into the gap for fauria for the completion. 
>> Gus: First down at the 12. Franklin. Franklin gets a half yard on the play. Nice pursuit by henry anderson. There has been some confusion in the backfield of the bruins. 
>> Charles: You don't get much easy against stanford, do you? 
>> Gus: Nothing. 
>> Charles: Nine plays on average for touchdown drives per team. They don't give up very much cheap. Only one game this year where they've given up a drive of three plays or less, and that was against oregon last week. They make you earn it. Look at this formatin. 
>> Gus: Second and nine. Johnathan franklin stays on his feet. Touchdown, bruins. A flag on the play. 
>> Charles: And another flag just came down. Now we've got an additional one. That run was made on effort by johnathan franklin. Now we'll see ifit stands. 
>> Referee: Touchdown was good. 
>> Gus: As the officials try to sort it out. 1:53 to play in the third. 
>> Charles: Jeff fuller he didn't want barry to leave. Wanted to make sure the uchdown stands. 
>> Referee: After the touchdown, personal foul on the offense, number 60. Also, unsportsmanlike conduct on the offense, number 60. 

[02:31:59]


>> Charles: Jeff baca. He had three penalties last week against usc. Watch the end of the play. This is baca, 60, coming into the play. Touchdown is made. There's the late block on david parry, number 58. That's the first flag. The second flag happened as he was going to the sideline, and i thought -- I don't know if he of baca. Maybe he said something on the way off the field to get the unsportsmanlike conduct. 
>> Referee: Two fouls. Unsportsman like conduct on the defense for the assess on the try. Personal foul on the defense will be assessed on the kickoff. 
>> Charles: And I think he meant offense. He said defense there. Those penalties were both against ucla, who was on offense at the time. They're marching it off against ucla. 
>> Gus: Ka'imi fairbairn will kick this one. Ball spotted at the 26. So a 36-yard extra point. And it's good. One great sign for ucla. 1:53 to play. Third quarter. 35-17. OK, look...if you've got the kind of job where you shower after work, then the phrase "good enough" ain't in your lexicon. 'Cuz just getting' the job done doesn't get ing, landscaping, forestry... you name it, this is the truck that the guys who do the hardest work depend on. Own it, baby. This is the 2013 Ford Super Duty. 

[02:34:15]


>> Gus:1935 is the first time these teams played. 
>> Charles: There's kenny easley. Turner. I remember coach donahue telling me a while ago, kenny easley, he scored a lot of touchdowns. He may be the best player coach donahue ever coached. I'm not going to put words in the coach's mouth, but kenny easley, oh, my go come off the field at the 15 and fumbled out of bounds by wright. 1:50 to go in the third. Here's erin andrews with the game break. 
>> Is let's check in on the irish and the trojans. Notre dame up 10-0. Seconds into the second quarter. Max witek finds robert woods. Usc is on the board, guys. This is a 10-7 game at the coliseum. 
>> Charles: Sometimes when a youngster has to made a while to get his opportunity, and he does that, and he's settled in. Max witek, maybe the ice is broken with that throw. 
>> Gus: Next year's start today. 
>> Charles: It starts with max witek. The bowl game and then spring practice. 
>> Gus: First down at the 19 yard line. A lot of time left in this football game. 1:43 to go in the third. Damien holmes with the stop. 
>> Charles: Just think of how many people out there have so many hopes about if notre dame loses, other teams now have a chance to get back in it. If you're not an s.E.C. Fan, you don't want notre dame to lose. If they lose, alabama-georgia game, florida could move up, and have another all-s.E.C. Championship game. 
>> Gus: Play fake. Hogan rolling out across his body. Nice throw. Toilolo, the redshirt junior with the grab. 

[02:36:23]


>> Charles: Partner, would you call me wrong if I say kevin hogan isn't throwing the ball right now. He's slinging. 
>> Gus: He's slinging it. 
>> Charles: He is throwing with confidence. That's rolling away from his natural side, throwing back inside as a right-handed thrower on the money. 
>> Gus: Talking to pep hamilton, it was almost like he was below the radar. 
>> Charles: His recruiting was regional. Virginia, duke, back in the washington, d.C. Area for him. 
>> Gus: Hamilton played his football at howard university in washington, d.C., Coached with the redskins briefly. So a lot of ties in that area. East coast, north carolina. 
>> Charles: You know what else they said? When they watched his game film, they felt like every game they popped on him, it was raining and muddy, and the kid never slipped and slid. He handled the football well. If you were in horse racing and you had a mudder like that, then you're in business. 
>> Gus: Second and five at the 38. Wilkerson. Flag. Wilkerson will not get the first down on the run. Let's see what the flag is. Eric kendricks defensively for the bruins. 
>> Referee: Illegal motion on the offense, number 96 in motion for the line of scrimmage. That's a five-yard penalty. 
>> Charles: That's dillon bonnell, an offensive guard, but they keep putting him in the backfield and using him in motion. Watch him go laterally in motion. Then he takes the jump up. He's not set for the full second. He never gets formally set. Yet he's set for a full second to re-establish yourself at the line of scrimmage. 
>> Gus: That takes us to the end of the third quarter with the score stanford 35, ucla 17. Back to the rose bowl after this. 

[02:41:21]


>> Gus: The cardinal with pleasure. 
>> Charles: Remember the titans moment right there. 
>> Gus: Ucla saying we want some more. Let's see if the cardinal can give it to them. Here's wilkerson, and wilkerson, eric kendricks first man too. Taylor been out of the lineup for the last two series for stanford. 
>> Charles: And barring energy, which we haven't got a report on, I think they're just resting. You look at the scoreboard, fourth quarter up 35-17. High volume of carries for the season. Taylor right there in our foreground. 142 yards on the night. Guess what? They win this game, they have to do this again next week. As long as the score stays in their favor and they're at a disadvantage, I won't be surprised if they rested him some more. 
>> Gus: Championship game on friday. Third and nine at the 34. Hogan. Intercepted and a flag! At the 40. Picked off by ucla. 
>> Charles: That came from deep in the secondary. That came from the back judge. That might wipe something out. 
>> Referee: Holding on the defense, number 35. That's a ten-yard penalty and an automatic first down. 
>> Charles: And that's against zunwalt, who made the play on the football on the interception. The first mistake we've seen from hogan tonight. Right here is zunwalt. He had toilolo's jersey right here. Freeze. Look at that. Excellent view by the back judge on the play, john jenkins, who caught the cloth being grabbed by jordan zunwalt, negating the interception. 
>> Gus: First down for stanford at the 44. Kendricks plugging up the hole. 

[02:43:41]


>> Charles: Kendricks losing a helmet. Will have to stay off the field for one play. What I'm concerned with is he's not jogging off the field. If I'm the medical staff, I get right there on kendricks to check on him. He walked all the way off the field, and that's not normal for a guy of eric kendricks' stature and hustle. 
>> Gus: Second down and eight for kevin hogan. Wilkerson breaks the initial tackle and gets to midfield. Four-yard gain will bring up third and four. Cassius marsh offensively. 
>> Charles: Let's see if we can determine what happened to eric kendricks. Wilkerson's tackle. He gets it from his own teammate, seali'i epenesa, to the forearm of eric kendricks, knocking his helmet off and knocking him to the turf. 
>> Gus: Third and four. Hogan lines up. Out to the 35, a 16-yard gain for zach ertz. Sheldon price knocked him out of bounds. 
>> Charles: How about the pass protection? Watch these guys here and what they do for kevin hogan. What it does is allow him to do what? Pump, pad it and then deliver it out wide to zach ertz. Nice looking throw. Compliment those big fellows up front. They call themselves a total workers union. Offensive line of stanford. Pep hamilton calls them the tons of fun. Whatever you call them, call them skilled. 

[02:45:56]


>> Gfive catches, 71 yards for ertz. Wilkerson. Remember earlier in the season we saw stanford take on usc in palo alto, and we went into pep hamilton's office and coach shaw's office, and they kept talking about body shots. Go to the body. And then the head will fall. When you look at stanford on both sides of the ball, they really wear you down, grind you down, out physical you to the point where, to use an mma term, they can make you tap out if you're not careful. They make you question whether you want to keep doing this? 
>> Do you really want to keep playing? 
>> Charles: You talk about investing the body in the hopes that in the end they've got the advantage. Tonight they're holding it so far. 
>> Gus: And a fumble. Wilkerson lost it. And ucla you can tell by the emotion, they didn't jump on the football. Great opportunity there. 
>> Charles: Second opportunity for ucla now. Right there, play made by wallace, number 12, backup linebacker. Look who comes up with it, offensive lineman for stanford. Was that andrus peat, number 70? Is 
>> Gus: Yes. 
>> Charles: It wasn't just wallace. It was kendricks, number 6, with a big paw going in and ripping it free. That's twice now they've knocked it free, once by datone jones, but unable to come up with the football. 
>> Gus: Third down and five at the 29. Wright this time. And he doesn't get back to the line of scrimmage. That brings up a fourth down. 
>> Charles: I think david shaw's going to think about whether they want to kick the field goal or go for it on fourth down. 
>> Gus: Looks like they'll attempt a field goal with jordan williamson. Jordan williamson last week against oregon, he hit the game-winning 37-yard field goal in overtime, allowing him some measure of redemption. This one from 46 yards away. Off the front rim. 

[02:48:18]


>> Charles: And he kicked the ground first, partner. It's like he dipped his golf shot. Foot hit the ground before it hit the football. 
>> Gus: And you could hear it all the way up here, and it left a mark. 9:46 to play in the fourth. 35-17. ?????? ??????

Well, my selection is truly unique including over 10,000 loose diamonds. The tolkowsky ideal cut and exclusive leo artisan. My expert staff guided dan to the perfect ring... Which he then delivered... With all of his heart. Yes. 
[ Store ] AND THAT'S WHY HE WENT TO JARED. 

[02:51:02]


>> Gus: Ucla takes over at their own 29, trailing 35-17. Williamson. See the turf? 
>> Charles: For golfers who play to a 2 or 3, you don't understand that. But most of us who play to a 15 or 16 and behind, that chili dip, hitting the ground before you hit the ball, took the momentum off the kick for williamson, and he still barely missed it. 
>> Gus: Jordan coming off such a high with the game winner last week against oregon. Hundley steps up, throws on the run. Shaq evans with the catch. Remember williamson missed two field goals in the fiesta bowl last january. The players in the stanford locker room chanting his name after the game. Second down and six at the 33. Johnathan franklin. 
>> Charles: He handled that failure the way we all should, shouldn't we? Wore the fiesta bowl hat out in public. Met it head on. I'm going to go out and conquer this thing and got, as you mentioned, a measured redemption last week against oregon. 
>> Gus: Hundley drops it off. Franklin. Franklin goes down. I'll tell you what, terrence brown has been wonderful this year. He's played to that level tonight. 
>> Charles: We talk about what's going through the weakest link of the stanford defense, supposed to be the secondary. Terrence brown outs carter on the corner. Has helped shore things up. He's played well this evening. 
>> Gus: Ucla going for it on fourth down and two. 8:33 to play in the fourth. Hundley. And the ball caught by jerry johnson. That's a first down for the bruins. 
>> Charles: Get things off to a nice start last week, jerry johnson did. Four catches in the first quarter. Helping him establish things against usc. 

[02:53:13]


>> Gus: From the 42. Hundley again elects not to run it. And shayne skov all over the receiver, jordon james. 
>> Charles: Coverage was excellent downfield. He had to check that one down. He wanted to push it deep. Nothing there. Look the second time. Nothing there. As you mentioned, chose not to run the ball, checked it down for a short gain. 
>> Gus: Hundley again. Flag on the play. A.J. Tarpley with the tackle. What, charles, has this stanford defense taken away? 
>> Referee: Personal foul on the defense. 
>> Gus: What have they taken away? 
>> Charles: The big runs, the explosive runs for ucla. 
>> Referee: First down. 
>> Charles: Johnathan franklin unableget there. Made it tough on them. He's got 65 yards in the game. Only three yards a carry. 21 carries. Good volume but not the same production. If you can't get that, that makes it a lot tougher on you. Now you've put yourself into second and third and long, which allows the excellent pass rush of stanford to take hard. 
>> Gus: Did the samf thing to kenjon barner last week. Hundley up the sidelines, incomplete. Intended for jordan payton. 
>> Charles: That's the thing about stanford. When they do miss a tackle, they actually do it the right way. I remember someone said one time, I know I was doing the wrong thing by trying to do it the right way. When you're going to miss a tackle, miss it outside in where you know your help's going to be. Stanford does that very well. 
>> Gus: Incomplete pass. Joseph fauria, the intended receiver. That will bring up a third down and ten yards to go. 

[02:55:18]


>> Charles: Look at what they've done limiting ucla in terms of total offense so far in this game. Came in leading the pac-12. That's the average for the pac-12 right there. 288 for the night. 
>> Gus: Third down and ten at the 38. Hundley. It will be stopped once again. Fifth time tonight. Chase thomas again. 
>> Charles: When you just look in total the linebackers of stanford, chase thomas, 44. Trent murphy, 93 outside. Inside, shayne skov 11. A.J. Tarpley 17. Lancaster 35. Hybrid guys who can do everything you want on the field, and they do it well. 
>> Gus: Fourth down and 17 at the 45. Hundley delivers and incomplete. Jerry johnson, the intended receiver for the bruins. Turn it over on downs. 6:40 to play fourth quarter. STANFORD 35, UCLA 17. [ Male Announcer ] Wouldn't it be cool if we took the already great sentra apart and completely reimagined it with best-in-class combined mpg, not to mention more interior room than corolla and civic, and a technology suite with bluetooth, navigation, and other handy stuff? ?????? ?????? yeah. That would be cool. ?????? ?????? introducing the all-new nissan sentra. It's our most innovative sentra ever. Nissan. Innovation that excites. ?????? ?????? Wooohooo....Hahaahahaha! Oh...there you go. Wooohooo....Hahaahahaha! I'm gonna stand up to her! No you're not. I know. You know Ronny folks who save hundreds of dollars switching to GEICO sure are happy. How happy are they Jimmy? Happier than a witch in a broom factory. Get happy. Get GEICO. Fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more. 

[02:59:11]


>> Gus:35-17. The stanford cardinal leading the bruins of ucla with 6:40 to play here in the fourth quarter. Cross town, pretty good one going on as well. In the nation, playing there. 
>> Charles: A lot of implications in that game. A lot of people want to know how that one turns out. 
>> Gus: Stay with us, folks, please. 
>> Charles: And these two, a chance to do this again next week. 
>> Gus: There is a possibility. First dn and and wright running on the right side. Eric kendricks with the tackle. This may be the toughest question in college football right now, as we take a look at the nissan heisman watch. The only undefeated team, the guy in the middle. 
>> Charles: Manti te'o will be the defensive guy invited to new york this year. Collin klein, one bad game, and everybody wiped him out for the heisman. I said, are you kidding me? Have you watched him all year long? And johnny football has cap tu toured the fancy. But the other two, johnathan franklin and stepfan taylor.Ball. That was ups. And who called ups? You did, bob. I just asked a question. It takes a long time to pack a bowling ball. The last guy pitched more ball packers. But you... You consulted ups. You found a better way. That's logistics. That's margin. Find out what else ups knows. I'll do that. You're on a roll. That's funny. I wasn't being funny, bob. I know. latest products. You can do anything with those gifts. Where does Santa Claus live?

>> Gus: Stanford trying to secure home field advantage for the pac-12 championship for the first time. Second down and six at the 49. Wright with an opening. Wright. 10 yard line and finally down at the 5. A flag on the play. Eric kendricks tracked him down. 

[03:03:19]


>> Referee: Holding, offense. Ten-yard penalty. Second down. 
>> Gus: Remound wright will see this one go all the way back. 
>> Charles: Kyle murphy, who played so well as a true freshman for stanford, kyle murphy, andrus peat, all have played so well. Murphy right behind, right in there. With the takedown of zunwalt. That's what was called by the referee. 
>> Gus: Second and 16 at the 39. 
>> Charles: As well as has played tonight, they're going to control this game. They're going to do this again next week. Pretty much guarantee ucla will be ready to play. They came into this game on a five-game win streak. Remember they had that game at cal, they were bad. Cal jumped on them. At that point, they picked things up and really came along. No way jim mora lets his team continue to stay down for the week. They'll be back ready to play in the pac-12 championship game. They lost to cal. Beat arizona state. In ashe state, 44-36. Don't be fooled by that score. They were up 40-14 at one point in that game. And they controlled and handled usc last week to get to this point. 
>> Gus: Third down and 14 at the 41. Wright runs it over to the right side. He pushed the pile forward as he crosses the 45, up to about the 47. But stanford will punt it away. When you look at stanford and what's happened to them, only two losses on the season, they lost at washington 17-13, and then there was the loss to notre dame. 20-13, controversial end to that game. 

[03:05:50]


>> Charles: A lot of people talking about did he score or did he not? It will be their third straight season beating usc, ucla, and cal, which would make them state champs in california. But part of the problem they had, and a big part, was offense. In the games at washington and notre dame, they didn't get an offensive touchdown. They scored on defense in both of those games, touchdowns, which helped prompt the move from josh nunes at quarterback to kevin hogan full-time after the colorado game. 
>> Gus: Shaq evans from the 15. Evans up to the 35 and out of bounds. They'll have it at the 37. With 5:45 to play in the fourth. Back after this. 
-- smaller? Bigger! Bigger! Bigger! Bigger! So, which would you rather have -- a big treehouse or a small treehouse? If it's big enough, you can have a disco. Oh, yeah! Why do you not want a smaller treehouse? Because it wouldn't be able to fit a flat-screen tv, and then the tv would be about this big, and you would have to hold the wire, and the position you would hold the wire, you wouldn't be able to see the tv. That's a pain in the buns. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

>> Gus: Ucla now with the ball at their own 38. Hundley. This time it's david parry. 
>> Charles: That's the nose guard getting the penetration. Normally a backup starting tonight with terrence stephens, their normal starter at home in palo alto tending to personal matters. Parry has played a very nice game tonight looking at stanford on defense. Limiting ucla throughout the evening. 
>> Gus: On second and 15. Here's a screen. James over the 40, up to about the 43. Hundley going down the field. Flag. Shaq evans, the intended receiver. Wayne lyons may have got caught. 
>> Charles: Watch lyons too. He's got the play. He sees the ball. He sees the receiver. And he just trips. When he stumbles -- 
>> Referee: Pass interference, number 2. 15-yard penalty. First down. 
>> Charles: When he stumbled, he went into the receiver shaq evans and created the personal foul -- excuse my. Created the pass interference. 
>> Gus: Evans off the field. A first down now at the stanford 42 for ucla. Steven manfro in the game at running back. Manfro with a knee injury. Stanford keeping everything in front of them. Very difficult for ucla to get behind the stanford defense. 

[03:11:21]


>> Charles: While they do that, what else has happened? Tick, tick, tick. Exactly what stanford wants. Let the clock bleed down. 
>> Gus: Hundley stopped. Seven sacks. This time it's kevin anderson. 
>> Charles: You know, stanford came into this game aggregate. 101 tackles for a loss. Plays behind the line of scrimmage with so many people contributing. 
>> Gus: Third down and nine at the 41. And hundley finds manfro. Manfro knocked backwards, a flag on the play. 
>> Charles: That was some tackle. I thought manfro was easily going to have the first down. 
>> Referee: Offense, number 10. Ten-yard penalty. Third down. 
>> Charles: There's jordan payton with the penalty called against him, the freshman wide receiver. Look at the end of the play. There's the block by payton. But the tackle was being made as he made the block. 
>> Gus: So it brings up a third down and 11 at the 43. Here come the bruins. Over the middle! Nice catch, fauria. He put it on the top shelf again. This time it's a gain of 24. 
>> Charles: And he wouldn't let the kid get it. They were trying. 
>> Gus: Yes, they were. 
>> Charles: They looked like they concocted an elaborate scheme, put a couple chairs up there, trying to get those cookies that mama said you can't have before dinner, and fauria wouldn't let them have 'em. Went up and took the ball. 

[03:13:30]


>> Gus: Hundley drops it off. Isn't much on it for steven manfro. 
>> Charles: Watch how fauria competes for the football. Because amanam, 15, is right there fighting him for it. But fauria decided it was his. And went up and took it. 
>> Gus: Fauria, three catches, 51 yards, including a touchdown on their opening drive. Second and ten. Hundley underneath to shaq evans. And evans with the grab and a flag on the play with the far side. Lyons offensively. 
>> Charles: On the other side, sam schwartzstein is a texan playing center for stanford. Tough, gritty guys. Smart, handling the line calls. That time jake brendel gets caught with the holding penalty. 
>> Gus: Ten penalties against the bruins. Over the middle. Hundley once again finding fauria. Joseph fauria has to be helped up. Under three minutes to play here in the fourth. 
>> Charles: Characteristic of the jim mora team is they're fighting it. They're going to play it all the way out. 
>> Gus: Hundley under pressure. This time he'll get it away. Josh mauro in the backfield along with harold bernard. 

[03:15:45]


>> Charles: Whether they make it or not, look at the number of players making plays for stanford. 
>> Gus: Third down and five at the 14. Hundley underneath incomplete. Brought down. Gary fell, the intended receiver. Stanford leading 35-17 with 2:14 left to play. 
>> Charles: Gets some counseling from eric yarber, one of the top wide receivers coaches in the country. Bell's missed time with broken ribs, separated shoulder. Actually overslept one day and ssed practice. They held him out for another game after he was healthy, and he had an ankle injury. It's been tough for him to get as much practice time and focus as he's needed. Hopefully, he'll get a good week in this week. 
>> Gus: So hogan back on the field, first down. Looks like he is prepared to try to run this one out. Hands it off. Wright. Over the right side. With 2:19 to go. 
>> Charles: All in all, this was pretty close at the beginning. Each team scoring on their opening drive. In the end, stanford pounding it on the ground defensively. Tackling extremely well, and putting major pressure on the quarterback, playing good special teams to boot. 
>> Charles: You talked about them investing in body blows. Offense, defense, turned out to be special teams too, and that investment has paid off with the victory tonight. They'll have to do it again next week from their home field in palo alto against this same ucla team who had its pride stung a bit tonight and we know will bounce back and fight. 

[03:17:47]


>> Gus: And now let's take a look at this evening's reese's perfect play. Stepfan taylor. 
>> Charles: And they got away with being able to not play stepfan taylor a lot in the second half. Partly because he gave them such great play early in the game. Nine-man box, maybe even a ten-man box. Stanford runs the football. Taylor takes it to the house. Now they're able to rest it. 
>> Gus: An update on stepfan taylor. 
>> Julie: Running back stepfan taylor, they made the decision to keep him on the sidelines. They decided conserve his energy. I think they felt they had a comfortable lead. 
>> Charles: Julie, he gave them what they needed early. Off they went. Now a chance to have a little more rest for the championship game. 
>> Gus: We know what's going to take place, speaking of the championship. College football's biggest championship game. Return to fox friday. It's the pac-12 championship live in primetime with the rematch of this game as the eighth ranked stanford cardinal take on the 17th ranked ucla bruins in palo alto. Next saturday it's the big ten championship as 14th ranked nebraska battles wisconsin. The pac-12 and big ten championships only on fox. David shaw, whose record now 21-4. Fourth win in a row for stanford over ucla. Their sixth consecutive win. And jim mora will go back into the laboratory and try to figure out a way to beat this stanford cardinal team on their home field. 35-17 the final. Stanford with the win. Let's take it to erin andrews in studio "a." 
>> Guys, thanks so much. Coming up on the at&t post-game show, the number one fighting irish trying to close out their season undefeated against usc at the coliseum.

>>> College football's biggest game returns. Pac-12 championship live in primetime as the ucla bruins take on the stanford cardinal for the second week in a row. And on saturday is the big ten championship game at nebraska battles wisconsin. Coverage begins at 7:30 p.M. Eastern only on fox. What a job by the stanford cardinal beating ucla 35-17, and how about this? Will see them next weekend in the pac-12 championship. Just moments ago, our julie alexandria caught up with cardinal head coach, david shaw. 
>> Julie: Coach, congratulations on clinching the pac-12 north. What impressed you about your team? 
>> Those guys work hard and play hard. We're not perfect. We didn't play a perfect game, but we keep fighting. You can't keep turning the ball over. Great job by defense. We put them in tough spots, and th responded. 
>> Julie: Next week you guys are going to see ucla once again. What do you have to do to beat them? 
>> We have to approach it like a completely different game. I've got a lot of different nfl guys on my staff, as coach mora does. We know how to play a team twice in a season. We're going to play a great game and make sure we come back strong. 
>> We welcome you into the at&t post-game show. Erin, eddie, joey. That was really interesting. Approach it like an nfl game. What does he mean? 

[03:25:22]


>> It means he faces the same team twice. He has the experience on his coaching staff, so it's nothing new to them. That's what he means by playing a team twice in one year. They have the experience. They know how to change it up for next week. 
>> It's not two different teams. He says approach it like a different game. How do you do that? 
>> He means go back and study. That's why these coaches are so good. That's why stanford is playing the way they are. They have fantastic game plans and executed by smart players. This is a stanford team that's very prepared. Look at baltimore and pittsburgh. They play each other twice in three weeks. That's what happens in the nfl when you play interdivisional team. 
>> Let's check out big scores and highlights. We'll start in our backyard in the coliseum, number one notre dame taking on the trojans. 
>> Manti te'o getting his troops ready. Matt barkley on senior night, a nice show for him. But max witek making his first career start. Witek finding robert woods in the back of the end zone for a touchdown. That gets usc on the board, 10-7 notre dame. Wittek has been chucking it around all night. He's intercepted by russell. Notre dame up at the half. 
>> Right now heisman time. This has you guys talking. Missouri and a&m, all eyes and conversation on johnny manziel. 
>> Johnny manziel buying time, scrambling around, finding mike evans for the touchdown. That's the third touchdown pass for manziel tonight. 
>> That's third quarter. Ey're up by a ton, and he's still in there. Guys, what are your thoughts? 
>> It's obvious tey're trying to push the heisman. I think he's had a phenomenal year, one of the best years we've seen out of a freshman quarterback in quite some time. And this is his final game. We're going to see if this is going to be the one where he can lock up the heisman trophy. I still think there's games out there to be played. Collin klein next week and manti te'o. We'll have to wait and see. 

[03:27:25]


>> And kevilin is going to let him speak this week. He doesn't normally do that with his freshmen. Coming up next is your late local news, except on the west coast. And tomorrow on the fox nfl sunday pregame show, as the saints keep marching on, terry bradshaw sits down with drew brees to talk about their turnaround. And we'll find out what it's like being jared allen. Plus colin kaepernick with the great start. The niners have a quarterback controversy. Next week will be fun. A rematch of ucla at stanford for the pac-12 championship from friday in palo alto with not only a conference title on the line but a berth in the rose bowl as well. Our coverage begins at 7:30 p.M. Eastern only on fox. For eddie george, joey harrington, I'm erin andrews. We'll see you next week for round two. Good night, everybody.

>> Justin: Thank you, erin. Here in arlington, texas, getting set for this big 12 matchup as baylor takes on texas tech. Both fans have fade the trip to just outside of dallas as we get set for an d-fashioned shootout here in texas. Captions paid fory the fox broadcasting company welcome inside cowboy stadium here on this saturday of thanksgiving weekend as we get set for baylor taking on texas tech. And hello, everybody. I am justin kutcher. Happy thanksgiving. Baylor coming off their biggest win in school history knock off number one k-state last week. Together with standard they turned the college football landscape upside down. We welcome in our heisman trophy winner eric crouch. When you look at last week's win for baylor, it wasn't the fact that they beat number one k-state that was the biggest deal for them. 
>> Eric: Because they got win number five, and today it's one nim six to become bowl eligible. How do they do that? It's on offensive depth. They have the players to mix it around and throw the ball all over the field so the defenses have to really play well today to make that happen. 
>> Justin: You look at numbers they put up last week against kansas state. The rushing numbers one believable. Three picks against colin klein so baylor is playing to become bowl eligible. Texas got off to a great start. They are bowl eligible already and what are they playing? 
>> Spoke to the quarterback doege and he said redemption. They were embarrassed last week against oklahoma state so he has to take it upon himself on his shoulders to take this offense and win this football game to gain momentum going into bowl season. 

[00:02:02]


>> You see the numbers. 35 touchdowns on the season doege. With these two teams you know it's going to be all about offense. We are in texas.

>> Justin: Chaos reigned across the nation as the two teams atop the bcs standings fell from the ranks of undefeated. Seven days ago the baylor bears made history. Today they are in for a loep star state shootout against the texas tech red raiders. It's fox college football live from cowboy stadium, and we are inside of cowboys stadium getting set for this one. Justin kutcher alongside eric crouch and darius walker on a beautiful day in arlington texas. The head coach for the baylor bears is art briles. People have seen him a lot over the past week after the big victory last week over kansas state and for the texas tech red raiders it's tommy tuberville at the hem for the red raiders. Will become the third coach to take three different teams to a bowl. Texas tech won the toss and will defer and kickoff. Stonum will take it from the one. Stonum up the middle and gets up to the 22 yard line. That was darius jones on the return, a 21-yard return for jones. Starting quarterback for the baylor bears is nick florence replacing robert griffin iii, and he's done an unbelievable job taking over for rg 3. 
>> Eric: You're right. Rg3, really all he had to say. He's done a spectacular job coming in and taking over the reins for the baylor bears and really picking up where they left off. Throwing the football and spreading around the field. A great athlete and has a strong arm as well. 
>> Justin: Joined in the backfield by seastruck, and seastruck with the second effort will pick up three yards. We know about florence and rg3. How about somebody else we should know about on this baylor team. 

[00:06:41]


>> Eric: If there's another special player on this team, it's wide seer taylor williams, receiving the country with 155 receiving yards per game. 145 yards of setting a single season record. He compares him to a name we all know and that's justin bloc blackman, number 2 from baylor. 
>> Justin: A finalist for the biletnikoff award. Florence will pass again going deep and guess who it is, terrence williams on cue. 
>> Eric: Terrence williams, that big receiver, and they have to respect the run. He just beats the defender over the top and if texas tech is going to stop that today, they can't let him get by. 
>> Justin: Next handoff seastrunk. You cannot look away. Second down and six. 
>> Justin: Again seas seastrunk trying to cut it back and gets a yard tackled by kerry haider. 
>> Eric: They will try to mix it up. A very balanced football team. As like you already saw, this will get you deep in the passing game so be ready for everything from baylor's offense. 
>> Justin: Third down and five and glasco now in at tailback. The quarterback gets pressured, and he gets sacked. Delvon simmons. 

[00:08:46]


>> Eric: Using his speed and strength, held the ball too long. 
>> Justin: And now the 42-yard field goal attempt. And the field goal is wide right. We talked about that quite strike offense for baylor. They cannot do what they did last week against kansas state and get on the board early. Did you happen to see the hole, the kick, be able to be wide right and baylor needs to put the points on. Not a good start for baylor. It is now texas tech ball starting at their own 25 yard line. Doege over the middle, and that ball is hauled in by grant. A pickup of five. The numbers on seth doege, those are his career numbers. He's been an offense that likes to throw the bam. 
>> Eric:65 touchdowns, that real stands out right there. 
>> Justin: Doege again throws to to aaron moore, and moore with that second effort picks up the first down. Williams, the raining big ten defensingive football player of the week. 
>> They motioned out. What was the defense going it give them so down the road they know what plays they are looking for. 
>> First and town. Doege play action. Takes a shot towards the sideline and goes up top and it's hauled in by eric ward. A 17-yard completion to ward. He's the go-to receiver for the red raiders. 

[00:10:53]


>> Eric: We talked to seth doege. He told us he's not afraid to go vertical. You can see eric ward on the oath side. Jumps for that ball. The at first an ten from baylor. Both it near side to jordan davis. Ball marked out of bounds at the 40. Picked up nine. 
>> Eric: You'll see two high-powered offenses that like to move fast. That deek and dunk offense. Got to respect the football. 
>> Passing for the fifth time on the run, throws low, and that is incomplete. Was looking again for davis. Bryce hager applied the pressure. Eric, you talked about these three teams. 
>> So exciting to. 
>> Third and one. Play ax. Takes a shot down the field and just overthrows moore, but a flag is thrown. Chance casey and sam hall on the coverage. 
>> Referee: Pass interference defense, number 25. 15-yard penalty. Automatic first down. 
>> Eric: I thought this was a great fake by seth doege but what better coverage than chase casey and small hall had on this play. What kind of length two see. To me that wasn't pats interference. Maybe he got that other arm that did not allow him to reach for the ball. 

[00:12:56]


>> First and 25 for baylor. The quick draft to moore, and more gets to the 19 yard line and picks up six. Darren moore such a bigport of the offense. Let me on the outi'd and buffalo the rigrt. 
>> Doege with some sometime. Will run for the first down. To the end zone. Touchdown! A 19-yard touchdown run by seth doege. 
>> Eric: Doege is not your running quarterback. Will throw it 50, 60 times a day but when you have that much grown in front of you, you take it. 
>> Justin:7-0 texas tech. Doege with the touchdown. He wears numberlooks like eric crouch.

[00:16:57]


>> Justin: Back here at cowboy stadium in arington, texas. 7-0, texas tech leading baylor d.Not take long. 2:05 to go 75 yards. Seven plays and six of them pass plays, the last one a 19-yard run by seth doege for his first rushing touchdown of the year. Fyfe to kick off with jones and goodly back deep. Jones drifting back for the goal line. Jones has some room up the middle and gets tripped up as he gets to the 30. A flag comes in. Our referee today is tom walker. 
>> Referee: During the return, holding, receiving team, number 81. Ten-yard penalty. First down. 
>> Justin: Time now for the taco bell impact players. 
>> Eric: When you see nick lawrence, he'll have a great day today. Got to to get to that win. Got a rival for an arm. A class act. Terrence williams, 145 yards to break this single season record. Plays without fear. Watch how he sheds blocks today. Keep your eye on number 44. 
>> Justin: With that penalty the ball moved all the way back to the 12 yar line for the bears. Seasturnk in theback field. A one-yard run tackled by sam. The texas defense has to stop the run. That's one thing that they are going to have to do to be successful today. 

[00:19:05]


>> Justin: Especially when you think what bay already did last week against kansas state. 325 rush yards, five touchdowns in the game. 
>> Lawrence pressured up the middle. He'll try to run for it, and he gets tackled by delvon simmons, a loss of one. 
>> Eric: Texas tech is being physical up front. Trying to get to the quarterback, and they do. Got to nick florence. Already have him a little rattled right now, so it's baylor kind of looming from the emotional eyes. Third an ten, texas tech fans making some noise in a big third down for baylor. PLqY CLOCK TON TO FIVE. Florence completes the pass to sampson, and sampson is very close to the marker, and he does make a wirs down. That's an easy we'd. A big third down conversion for the bears. Handed off to seastrunk. Breaks a couple of tackles and has the blockles down the sideline and seastrunk is in texas tech territory. Davis finally pushed I'm out of the gym. Build off that. See the moves that he has. See the agility that he's displaying right there and follows his league blockers, enough to pick up the first down. 
>> Morgan comes in at tailback. He takes the handoff straight up the middle, and he picks up four and sets up second down and six. Tackled by donelle wesley. What everybody thinks about this offense and the growing game, what baylor bricks to the table is a rushing game and how powerful they are in rushing is the football. 

[00:21:22]


>> Average 300 yards throwing and 300 yards passing. I don't know what he I'll -- false start here against baylor. 
>> Referee: False start offense, number 58. Five-yard penalty. Third down. 
>> Justin: Spencer drango goes from a third and three to a third and eight. They converted just before on a third and ten. A little bit of a movement, big drive in a police play for taylor but a in this kind of a game. 
>> Justin: Tipped by florence, and he gets tackled on a beautiful open-field tackle by bruce jones. 
>> Eric: Well, florence made the right read. He just gets outside and it's great pursuit by the text yagsias tech defense. What a great tack. Taking the legs out of florence on number 24, bruce jones. 
>> Justin: Fourth and section on to put down is spencer roth. 
>> Eric: Lets it go by him and into the end zone for a touchdown. It will be texas tech ball from the 20. 
>> Justjn: Texas tech comes up with a defensive stand. They will take over on offense leading 7-0 when we come back. up. I need the best, I need the best. Make him look pretty.

>>> Aerial coverage brought to you by direct t. If you call yourself a sports fan call direct t.1-800-directv. Beautiful day here in arlington texas. I believe this should be the eighth wonder of the world, cowboy stadium. Seth doege and the shotgun. Empty backfield. On first down. A pass that will catch them by surprise. Picks up nine yards. How about the taco bell impact players for the red raiders. 
>> Eric: Impacting this game already is seth doege. Going to make some good decisions, and what I like about him he has phenomenal pocket presence. Moore leads the team with 68 receptions and knows how to use it. 
>> Here is doege. Second and one. Handoff foster, and foster has the first down. 
>> Eric: Impact players, didn't have a chance to talk about the safety, cody davis. He's the field general out there on defense. Watch him today because we'll rarely miss a tackle. Pretty sound. 
>> Justin: First and ten here for the red raiders. Kenny williams now in the backfield. Moore on the catch. Nice move. Cuts inside and up the field. 11-yard pickup. Another first down. Mike hicks there with his second tackle of the game. 
>> Eric: How about the keys to the game on this side of the ball. 
>> Justin: We talked about texas tech's high-powered offense. They need to get vertical. Stretch the baylor defensive balls and get them off the ball. They have to be physical fighting with the big receivers. 

[00:27:49]


>> Justin: Another pass near side. Kennard. Kennard gets six. Second down and four. Once again into baylor territory leading 7-0. 5:00 to go here in the first quarter. Handoff to williams. Williams bounced off a couple of guys, tried to get forward. Maybe gets a yard. Gary mason jr. There for the stop. 
>> Eric: Williams, he just runs into his own guy there. Needs to do a better job of getting his eyes up and finding the crease instead of running into the back of your player. 
>> Justin: Third and four. Empty backfield once again for texas tech. Foster now in the backfield in motion. Doege to the sideline, and that one is caught. Eric ward laying out and picks up 12. Another third down conversion. 
>> Eric: Well, you can see there's some cross routes in the middle of the field, and that what gets the outside linebackers away. Great throw by doege putting. To imout taken here by baylor as this texas tech offense is doing essentially whatever they want leading 7-0 here in the first. marrying mom. You know that, right? Uh-huh.

>> Justin:7-0, baylor leading texas tech. Play under review. Could be why art briles and baylor called the time-out to review the play. The play, we'll get the ruling here from tom walker as we look at this buick human highlight. Is it a catcher an incomplete pass? 
>> Referee: A reminder the band may not play when the play is imminent. You must shut down. 
>> Okay. So we got the mike there for the band. They cannot play as the play is imminent. Mike prayer yeah, ruled a catch. What did you see on that? 

[00:32:35]


>> I don't see enough to reverse it. The ball did move a lill bit but didn't lose possession. I think they stay with that on a catch. 
>> That they stayed with and a handoff to foster. Tackled by brice hager. Second down and four. A lateral and now a pass to the wide receiver. The backup quarterback, and that one is nearly picked off in the end zone. Chance casey was in the end zone against eric ward. 
>> Eric: Wow, as well as they are doing offensively right now, real know need to pull out the trickery. You see the throw and the pressure put on to force the short throw and almost had the interception. That pressure was by brice hager. 
>> Justin: Michael brewer the backup quarterback made the pass. Now it's third and four from the 21 of baylor. Doege, his pass over the middle. It's complete to moore. Still on his feet. Moore breaks a couple of tackles up to five yard line. A 26-yard completion on third down and four. 
>> Eric: That's just taking the ball and throwing it to your receivers on a quick pass and letting darrin moore, the big body, do the work. Saw him downfield. The poor tackling on the baylor bears defensive side of the football, but he's a rumbling guy. A lot of physical attributes that a quarterback would love to have in a receiver. 
>> Justin:6'4", 215 pounds coming off a monster game last week against oklahoma stay. One of the only positives as joe williams is now being helped off the field. Williams, he had that big game against k-state last week. 11 tackles and two interceptions. 

[00:34:40]


>> Eric: That's not a good sign there for baylor. Some early injuries. 
>> Justin: First and goal from the five now for texas tech. Handoff williams up the middle. Touchdown. Fifth rushing touchdown of the year for kenny williams. 
>> Eric: The offense is power forming to perfection right there. And you can see on the drive, they spread them out. So you have to respect the space, and when you give them space, that really opens up your running game. A great job by williams, taking the ball and running straight into the end ?? zone. 
>> And good snap, low hold, and it's 14-0 texas tech. A couple of big third down conversions, and then kenny williams from five yards out makes it 14-0. ?????? ??????

Because it wouldn't be able to fit a flat-screen tv, and then the tv would be about this big, and you would have to hold the wire, and the position you would hold the wire, you wouldn't be able to see the tv. That's a pain in the buns. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[ Male Announcer ] Bud Light. FOR THE FANS Who do whatever it takes. 
>> Justin:14-0 here at cowboy stadium, texas tech leading baylor. They follow up a 75-yard scoring drive with an 80-yard scoring drive. This time it took a little longer, 3:30 to run those ten plays. 
>> Eric: Look at the time that's put into this. In the a lot. Very explosive on offense, but baylor's really got to come through with this offensive drive and put some points on the board. 
>> Justin: Fyfe to kick off. Woodley and darius jones back deep. A short kick. Goodly saved it at the 16 and runs into his own man and breaks it outside. Still on his feet and down the sideline. Finally gets forced out at the 46 yard line. A 31 return for baylor as they TRAIL BY 14.SFX- "sounds of african drum and flute" Look who's back. Again? It's embarrassing It's embarrassing! We can see you Carl. We can totally see you. Come on you're better than this...all that prowling around. Yeah, you're the king of the jungle. Have you thought about going vegan Carl? Hahaha!! You know folks who save hundreds of dollars by 

[00:39:17]


>> Justin: First and ten for baylor. Seastrunk in the backfield. Handoff seastrunk up the middle. Nice move to the outside. Still on his feet, and now seastrunk gets wrapped up at the 47 of texas tech and picks up six and tackled by the middle linebacker, will smith. 
>> Eric: You can understand how big of a part he is to this offense. Saw quick feet right there. Just made a quick little move. Got to the outside to make a guy miss. That's what they know of in this drive. 
>> Handoff against again to seastrunk. Look at him run inside of everybody. Winbush with the tackle. 
>> Eric: Most running backs have to put their shoulders dunn and bowl forward. Take a lot of quick steps in there and still get up the field 
>> seastrunk has come into his own the last few games. Play action. Florence taking a shot. Goes up top to williams, and williams gets tackled inside the five and down at the three. Eugene neboh on the tackle 
>> looked like texas tech got lulled to sleep a little bit by the run. To get beat by the secondary. 
>> Justin: First and goal from the three. Handoff. Martin into theion, touchdown. 
>> Eric: Like we said, baylor can strike fast. Doesn't take him long there to score the touchdown. A few runs. Tries to establish some good yardage and then a big pass in the air and the run on the ground so baylor is back. 

[00:41:26]


>> Justin: Aaron jens on for the extra point. We may have the previous play with a touchdown by blasko martin reviewed. Was the knee down by martin before the ball crossed the plane? 
>> Watch his knee. It's down. 
>> This one is going to come back, for sure. Either way, it's exactly what baylor needed and in the first quarter of this game. 
>> Justin: Again watch the right knee. He's down there, and then he reaches forward. 
>> Kasey: Might come back a whole yard, maybe even two. 
>> Justin: The replay official is tom blackly. I'm hearing rumors that this ball is going to be placed at the one yard line. 
>> Referee: After further review, the runner was down on the one yard line. It will be second and goal from the one yard line. 
>> Justin: I'll tell you what. I've got some pretty good sources. 
>> Eric: You're going to get a lot of fight out of baylor. They are trying to pick up that fifth win. Make themselves bowl eligible. They needed this tremendously, because if texas tech gets the ball back and they could give up very easily. Second and goal now from the one. Lanear sampson not even in the huddle right now with his teammates. Standing on the near sidelines. Salubi and glasco martin are in. It looked like he got dumped, glasco martin. Third down is coming up. Blake dees on the stop. 

[00:44:12]


>> Eric: This is a physical, physical time. You have the opportunity to stop them here. This is where it gets you have to. You've got a foot to defend the goal line. 
>> Justin: Again it's martin. And again he's getting stuffed! So fourth and goal from inside the one. I think you have to go for it right now if you're baylor. 
>> Eric: Yeah, you do. You have to go for t.Credit this defensive line for pushing the line of scrimmage backward. I mean, that is a more than a stalemate. A big win for the red raiders. Only five scoreless border all year long here. And a time-out has been called by baylor. 
>> Justin: Coverage of fox college football continues next right here on forecasts as stanford takes on ucla. Right now we've got ourselves a situation as baylor thought they had a touchdown. It was ruled that glasco martin was down at the one so it's second and goal from the one after a couple of stops. It's fourth and goal from the one. Glasco martin is in at tailback and the handoff martin. Up the middle. This time he's in. If took a couple more tries but the result is the same. There is a flag though after the play. 

[00:46:39]


>> Referee: After the play, personal foul defense, number 91. 15-yard penalty assessed on the kickoff. Touchdown. 
>> You can almost see that they are going to runt football. Receivers are so spread out, one of them is not even on camera here. A good job at the line getting pushed. Glaske putting his head down and knowing where the end zone is and pounding it in. 
>> Justin: Glasco with his fourth rushing touchdown of the year. Now a seven-point ball game here in the first quarter. We told you it would be a shootout. We weren't kidding. right? Yeah. Which house is yours? The one with the silverado out front. So, what do you do? Well, ahhh... NICE! [ clown horn ] ?????? AND BINGO WAS HIS NAME ?????? [ shouting ] 
[ child crying ] ?????? ?????? i...Ahh. 
[ Male Announcer ] THE CHEVY SILVERADO. The most dependable, longest-lasting ull-size pickups on the road. From worksite to home front. Chevy runs deep. 
>> Justin: This december the usc returns to fox as benson henderson puts his title on the line against top contender nathe diaz. Highlighting an epic night of fight. Coverage begins saturday, december 8th at 8:00 p.M. Eastern only on fox. Lake and seastrunk talking things over saying, all right, we got seven back. Down by just seven. There was a 15-yard penalty assessed to kerry haider so now baylor will kick off at midfield. Aaron jones will kick off here for baylor. Grant and stephens are back at the goal lane. A high kick into the end. Grant will take a knee. It will be texas tech ball at the 25 yard line. For an injury report let's go back down to darius walker. 

[00:49:35]


>> Darius: Just a quick injury update, guys. You saw earlier on that last series quarterback joe williams for the bears defense. He had an injury in that last series. It was a shoulder, and the training staff tells me he's questionable. He'll try to go, but, guys, looks like he might be in a bit of pain. That would be had a huge blow to baylor if williams can't go. 
>> Justin: Reigning defensive player of the week. 12 seconds to go here in the corner, which means we probably have time enough for a couple of scores. 
>> Eric: I would think so. Joe williams, so many -- 
>> Justin: A big loss for them in the secondary. Taking a shot down the field, for more! Moore gets tackled. Darryn moore working one-on-one. Looks like he's going outside. Look how much the separation is from the defensive back and receiver. That's what allowed hem to be so open. Not rough time for a scott but it was pretty close. Darrin martin leads at half. 

[00:53:33]


>> Justin: That first quarter, 314 total yards, 14-7 texas tech leads baylor. Justin kutcher alongside eric crouch. What does baylor have to do to stop texas tech because they are moving at will. 
>> Eric: They need to stop putting pressure on doege. Get the lineman up in space and pressure him to make bad decisions and bad throws. 
>> Justin: Doege on first down. A 46-yard completion and a flag comes in and a false start here against tech. 
>> Referee: Five-yard penalty, first down. 
>> Eric: That's against mcdaniel so that backs up tech. Look at dej's numbers. On first and 15, doege drops back and over the middle to his running back williams, and williams able to pick up 11. Now second down and four as eddie lackey made the tackle. 
>> Eric: What a smart decision that was. Had an opportunity to throw it into coverage. Didn't do it. Did the smart thing and stood in the pocket and threw it to his running back underneath. 
>> Justin: And then having the shoulder pad exposed, that's what slows down this offense. The only thing really. Doege. Lobbing one towards the end zone. Touchdown eric ward! 23-yard touchdown pass and what a beautiful touch there was on that pass. 
>> Eric: Great touch by seth doege. You saw the work that was put in by eric ward at the very beginning of that route. He shakes himself free and gets on top of the defender. That's what allows seth doege to throw a perfect pass and catch for a touchdown. 

[00:55:44]


>> Justin: Ryan bustin on for the extra point. How about this start for texas tech? Three possessions. Three touchdowns. All of them at least 75 yards. ?????? ??????

>> Justin: Tomorrow it's a doubleheader on fox nfl sunday beginning with the vikings taking on the bears in a key matchup. Then in the game of the week the NFC WEST LEADER 49ers SQUARE OFF Against the saints. Coverage against tomorrow with a built ford tough fox nfl sunday pre-game show at noon eastern, 9:00 a.M. Pacific. Another quick strike by texas sec. 75 yards. Once again a 23-yard touchdown pass to eric ward. Fyfe will kick off he was here hon thursday playing against the cowboys, robert griffin ii. Guess what, he stayed in texas and is standing by right now with darius walker. 
>> Darius: Here with former baylor quarterback robert griffin. The game isn't going exactly as you like. 21-7. What do you think? It's a long game. They are not going to panic. Something we stress here at baylor. Don't panic. Go out and what you're supposed to do and everything will fall into place. 
>> Darius: Nick florence had to come in and spell you in a game against texas tech. What do you think he can do as a quarterback? 
>> A great guy and as a quarterback he's shown he has talent to be able to do special things so I think he filled in masterfully for me, and i couldn't be any more proud. 
>> Justin: 
>> Darius: You won the heisman trophy last season and who is on your ballot this year and will be the first vote that you'll cast? 
>> I can't disclose who is on my ballot. A tough year for the heisman. A lot of great players on it's that don't have the best records, even in this game, whether you've got seth or terrance for baylor. Having great seasons but their records don't show it. It will be interesting. I'm sure it will come down between te'o, manville. 

[01:00:41]


>> Darius: You guys had a big win on thanksgiving. 
>> It's been a lot of fun after the bye week to have the minds mindset and to come out and win a game like that on thanks giving, was big, not only for our season but for the fans and everybody who supports us. 
>> Darius: Appreciate the time. Good luck the rest of the year. >> Thanks, no problem. 
>> Justin: I think robert griffin iii may want to continue the conversation because they just converted on third down and now a chance for florence down the field. Nobody was there. Kevin reese was the guy he was thinking would be there, but d.J. Johnson was the only one in the vicinity. So second down and ten coming up here for baylor and rg3, I mean what he did for this football team, for this school, he put them really on the map. Florence will change the play and seastrunk is in the backfield. Baylor trailing 21-7. 
>> Justin: Thrown out of bounds was norwood. So you heard what rg3 thought. Do you think anybody in their wildest dreams could have thought that florence would have numbers comparable to rg3. 
>> Eric: I don't think anybody does at all. That's the credit to the type of player that nick florence is, the type of leader that he is. Coach briles says it best. He has that presence about him. That quarterback presence, that huddle presence, and you always talk about when you're talking about great quarterbacks and the things that they have accomplished. He's a winner. 
>> Justin: Florence converts on that third down in the quarterback run. So now it's first and ten from texas tech's 47-yard line. Handoff up the middle to seastrunk. Trying to cut it back, and seastrunk will be marked down at the 32 yard line. A 15-yard run, and seastrunk, he thought he'd get to play a lot. 

[01:02:55]


>> Eric: This is all set up here by 18. You see the big block up front. Gets the linebacker which opened up the hole for seastrunk. Fighting and fight there. They will give him a little forward progression and will mark him down. 
>> Justin: They hand off to martin trying to get outside. Martin diving forward, and they are going to mark him down at the 25 yard line. 24 yard line, a pickup of eight. 
>> Eric: The quick screens and hit them with the quick pass and run. 
>> Justin: Again, it's martin up the middle and martin picked up the first down. You just saw the total yards in this first half. Forget the first half. In the first quarter plus three minutes. 
>> Eric: Yards continue to stack up for these offenses, and that's going to be the challenge. Going to be on the defensive side of the ball. 
>> Justin: Lawrence keeps it. Throws up high and encomplete. Let's check in with patrick o'neill for a game break. 
>> All over in columbus. Last chance for michigan against ohio state. This would be an interception. Urban meyer in his first year as head coach of the ohio state bick eyes, they run the table. 12-0, justin and eric. 
>> Justin: What a job by urban meyer at ohio state. A lot of people thought he would do great things with the buckeyes. I don't know if anyone thought he'd go 12-0 in his first year. 
>> Eric: Thought he'd go 12-0. You just wonder that it had to be the year that they are on probation. 
>> Justin: Florence rolling off to his right and throws to the end zone and jump ball. Incomplete. Rees was there covered by d.J. Johnson. 

[01:05:09]


>> Eric:ING A LOOK AT THE End of that play. 
>> Justin: Pressure applied to smith. Third and ten coming up here for the bears. Florence sets up. Throws, that one batted incomplete. Was looking for terrence williams. Uien neboh there on the coverage to poke it away. 
>> Eric: Yeah. What they are trying to do there. There's three receivers that really stacked on one another. He tries to drive that ball. See him throw a little bit harder and force that throw. Great coverage out there by the corner. 
>> Ross: Jones now on to attempt a 37-yard field goal. He missed earlier from 42. And the kick this time is no good. He hooks it. The bears who are fighting to become bowl eligible. Two missed field goals by aaron jones and texas tech leads 21-7. win. logistics. We play a complicated game. We have over two-hundred plays in our playbook. That's a lot of plays. We play an uptempo no huddle offense. Go...Go...Go. We snap the ball every 13 seconds. Inside zone. Outside zone. Counter. Draw. Simple patterns. Dozens of options. Score. Score and score some more. Fans go nuts. Second saved here is an extra yard there. To win, you need speed, precision, execution and teamwork. In other words, logistics. That's how you win. two one? So all of you do.

[01:10:04]


>> Eric: That's right. Shaved it for thanksgiving. Your wife said it's enough of the beard. She was the one who cancelled it on me. It started itching after a little bit. Probably a lot of guys going through that right now. I'm still waiting to shave. 
>> Justin: Got one hair there. Waddle is off the field. Castor comes in for him. Number 75. Second down and eight coming up here for the red raiders. In the backfield. Doege. Pressured. Running with it. Slides, and he gets hit hard, and the flag comes in. Mike hicks hits the quarterback doege as he slid. A seven-yard run for doege. We're going to have a personal foul coming up after this, and now some of the guys having some extra words. This is kind of what you talked about earlier. When you asked me the question what does baylor have to do, for two plays in a row, put extreme pressure on seth doege. 
>> Referee: Unnecessary roughness, late hit. 15-yard penalty. Automatic first down. 
>> Eric: I'm about protecting the quarterback. He did slide a little bit there, but sometimes when your body, you're trying to defend somebody, I don't know that you can just let up. I think why he got called is because he lowered his helmet. 
>> Justin: All that and he slid. Going to slide and continue to run. Supposed to let up. 
>> Justin: Play action, doege continues the pass over to eric ward and ward marked down at the 50, a pickup of five. Paul with the tackle. Second down and five here for texas tech who has starred on all three of their drives so far. 75, 80 and 75 yards. Those are the three scoring drives for the red raiders. 

[01:12:20]


>> Eric: And I wonder if they are going to bring some more pressure now that it's worked. 
>> Justin: Doege fakes the pressure and runs with it and gets a late block and doege dives forward and has a first down. Eric ward with a block to free up seth doege. I'll tell you what. They brought the pressure. They brought the linebackers up in the gap, but what happened they couldn't find the forecast and doege. You sea the big block on the outside and doege gets the block. 
>> Justin: The block by ahmad dickson so first and ten here for the red raiders. Doege with time. Takes the shop down the field, and that one is picked off! Sam holl with the interception! Well, doege was looking for eric ward. Has to make a good decision and not throw it down the middle of the field when there's a safety there. 
>> Justin: The third int for holl. The third turnover that baylor needed. ?????? ?????? oh. There it is.

>> Justin: Here we are at cowboy stadium. 
>> Baylor with the ball at the turnover and the interception by sam hall. They had the ball at their own four. Glasco martin at tailback. A little confusion getting it started here for baylorch the play clock is down to three. Florence on first down. Trying to look for terrence williams. But he was covered by mays. Time for today's aflac trivia question. Who is the last team from a bcs conference to finish the season undefeated and not win a share of a national championship? Do you know that one? 

[01:17:12]


>> Eric: That one is baffling me. 
>> Justin: Come on now, mr. Crouch. Second and ten. Martin up the middle. Glasco martin with a stiff arm down the sideline! And glasco martin gets shoved out of bounds by trey porter, and a flag comes in as well. 
>> Eric: You've got to just love what glasco martin brings to the table. Saw some missed tackles out there. One was by cody davis. But he was able to use his quickness and his speed to get on the edge and get on the corner. Nice impressive run. 
>> Justin: A 34-yard run for glasco martin. 
>> Eric: And you can see art briles coming in to have the discussion. 
>> Referee: After the play, personal foul, unnecessary roughness, number 2 on the offense. 15-yard penalty at the end of the run. First down. 
>> Justin: That's against terrence williams. A fifth year senior leader with a costly penalty. 
>> Eric: You saw the play before. Thought he was getting held. Looking for a pass interference so on this play frustration sets in a little bit, and he didn't do the smart thing. He's got to get off that block. Not just the guy to the ground. He gave up the personal now. Not good for your team. 
>> Justin: First and ten at the 23. Seastrunk is now in at tailback. The penalties mounting here for baylor. Handoff. Seastrunk up the middle. Seastrunk cuts it back. He's got a couple of blockers. He's got speed down the sidelines, and seastrunk is finally brought out of bounds at the 33 yard line but bruce jones. A 44-yard run. 

[01:19:16]


>> Eric: Sets up the block for seastrunk, and down the field he's got two guys. You've got williams leading to make that block for him. 
>> Justin: Now it's martin in at tailback. Could have been a horse collar, and we've got a couple of flags. Pete robinson with the tackle and that may have been the horse collar tackle. 
>> Referee: Personal foul, face mask, defense, number ten. Half the distance to the goal. Automatic first down. 
>> Justin: So not a horse collar but instead a face mask. 
>> Eric: You can see glasco getting through that line, and there's the definite grab on the face mask as the referee saw by pete robinson. 
>> Justin: Nick florence, first and ten from the 11. And a time-out is taken by texas tech. With 7:58 to go here in the first half. Baylor is marching down trailing by 14.

[01:22:53]


>> Justin: That was a ride on mascot for the texas tech red raiders. 21-7, first and ten from the 11 here for baylor. Glasco martin in the backfield. Locks over to the sideline for the play. It's martin again up the middle. Bounced off a couple of guys and goes backward, and he's going to lose about three yards. Cody davis there to bring him down. 
>> Eric: Coming up from the secondary and making a big stop. You see martin glasco. Gets hit right here. Kind of turns his back to where he wants to go. You're not going to find the hole turning your back to it. 
>> Justin: Second down and 13 now for baylor. Really at this point, baylor has missed two field goals. They are down by 14. You have to think they need a touchdown here. They have had success. 
>> Justin: It's martin again up the middle and trying to explode wand martin will get a couple of yards. Zach winbush on the tackle. 
>> Justin: Once again baylor doing the job on the ground between seastrunk and glasco martin. 
>> Eric: Shows you how high-powered their offense is. Have a lot of passing yards and able to run the ball like they do successfully. 
>> Justin: Almost eight yards per rush on the day. Salubi in motion. The pass is complete to goodley who looks like he'll have the first down. Let's see where they spot it. It's going to be awfully close. 
>> Eric: You see terrance williams outside. He's the one blocking. He's blocking eugene neboh and allowed him to almost pick up that first down. 
>> Justin: It is a fourth down instead. Fourth and one. Shuttling in is glasco martin and also coming in is jordan nage var. And glasco martin gets stuffed. 

[01:25:22]


>> Eric: Texas tech's defensive live has come up big today. Kerry haider, coming in and making the stop. What a great fourth down hold for the red raiders to give their offense another chance at scoring. 
>> Justin: You almost get the sense that right now as art briles went for it on fourth down and didn't convert, that you can almost feel this texas tech team putting forth a quick strike and making this a 21-point game. 
>> Eric: They just didn't have enough confidence in their kicker. Jones has missed two field goals. They were looking for more points than just three. 
>> Justin: On first down, handoff to foster who picks up seven and now to the injury report. 
>> Earlier went into the locker room for an undisclosed injury, full. Will hopefully be able to go. Talked about all the injuries they have seen at wide receiver at texas tech. 
>> Justin: Three key wide receivers for texas tech, they have ?? been out for four games or so. A handoff to kenny williams up the middle, and williams picks up a yard and gets met by bryce hager. 
>> Eric: Talk about what bryce hager means to this defense and how physical he plays. Right there, he put a stick on the running back. Solo tackle kenny williams, not allowing him to pick up the first down. 
>> Justin: Third down and two, a huge, huge play right here for baylor. Can they come up with a stop? Doege play action. Wide open is darrin moore. 
>> Eric: Darrin moore again, the big wide receiver. Looks inside with his eyes. That's what he did so great. He fooled casey that he was going inside and broke outside leaving him wide open for the throw. 

[01:27:30]


>> Justin: A 20-yard completion. He's got 115 yards on the day after 140 last week against oklahoma. Doege the delayed handoff. Williams, and williams gets wrapped up by hager. Hager came into this game with 99 tackles. The son of brett hager, the all-men linebacer who went on to play from the eagles. Think he learned a lot from him. 
>> Eric: Think he learned a lot. A hard physical play. Hard to know whether he's going to throw or run the ball. He came in there and made a great stick. Again, 26 tackles in the last two games. I mean, that's just playing lights out football right there. 
>> Justin: Eric ward is back in. Bottom of your screen. Doege on second and nine and taking a shot down the field again! Hauled in by darrin moore! Taking a chance against chance casey. 32-yard completion. 
>> Eric: Again, I think they found out who they are trying to attack in this defensive secondary. Casey, darrin moore just getting by him. Been the problem for baylor all day today. They are letting the texas tech receivers getting in back of them. 
>> Justin: Foster on the handoff, and foster picks up eight. Sam hall with the tackle. 
>> Eric: Talk about one-on-one coverage. The first thing you learn at the defensive back is not let the receiver by you especially when you're in a one-on-one situation, and that's what happens when you let him get by you. 
>> Justin:21-7, texas tech leading baylor, both teams already over 300 yards of offense. There's the proof. Foster again on the handoff and that's a first down. Foster towards the end zone! And he does not get in. He's going to be marked out at the five-yard line. 

[01:29:51]


>> Eric: Foster here just using his speed. He picked up a really nice block out there by darrin moore. 
>> Justin: Texas tech, they get over 300 yards of offense wit some big plays. Already six plays of 20 yards or more. Now looking at first and goal from the five, and, again, remember this drive began after making a stop at fourth and one from about the two yard line. Doege handoff to williams. Williams. Will be marked down at the two. Ahmad dixon with the tack. Second and goal from the two. 
>> Eric: What allowed them to get down here, too, is the ability of the receivers to block. Even on both sides of the ball, but that is so important. When you have receivers that can block on the secondary, hold their blocks for longer than just a split second that allows you to run in space and get inside the end zone. 
>> Justin: Noster is now running the wildcat. Foster keeps it, and he splips and falls. He's going to lose a yard. Interesting. You've had so much success with doege in at quarterback. You've scored on three of your four possessions, and now they take a chance and go with the wildcat, so now they are looking at third and goal. A time-out taken here by baylor with 1:42 to go and texas tech lacking at third and goal. Ok guys, this kick is for the win. Labels out. 
[ Fan 2 ] HERE WE GO. Wait, what? Our proximity to the field, creates a parallel connection between the bottle and the ball. The outward facing label simulates a smoother contact surface for the kicker. It's like magic. Only real. Really? Yeah.

[01:32:00]


>> Justin:21-7, texas tech leads baylor. Our aflac trivia question. Who is t last team in the bcs conference to finish undefeated and not win a share of the national championship. It was auburn with tommy tuberville back as the coach back in 2004. A couple of first-round picks in the backfield. Four first round picks on that team. Doege from the three. A flag is thrown. A false start. 
>> Referee: False start offense, number 52. Five-yard penalty. Still third down. 
>> Justin: Clark gets called for the false start. 
>> Eric:62 right in your screen right here. Clark, he's the one that jumps a little bit early. 
>> Justin: I didn't see much movement. 
>> Eric: I didn't see a whole lot either. 
>> Justin: Looking at third and goal from the eight. A failed attempt with the wildcat on second and goil goal. 
>> Eric: This passing offense, maybe on maybetter. 
>> Justin: Doege back to pass with some time. Stepping up. Doege gets hit from behind and fumbles! Recovered by eddie lackey. chris McAlister forced the fumble. Other what a big turn of events here. 
>> Eric: And we've really seen this kind of take place from bay lover. Putting a little bit of pressure on doege. Decides to escape out of the pocket, but he's got to be aware of his surroundings. chris McAlister forcing the fumble right there and giving baylor the ball back. 
>> Justin: Second straight texas tech drive that ends in a turnover. The previous one ended in an interception and now this, the forced fumble and the recovery, so with 1:33 to go, baylor has another life here in the first half. They can strike in 1:33. 
>> Eric: Think about the yards that have been put up. We should be seeing a 35-28 game. 

[01:34:03]


>> Justin: Absolutely. 
>> Justin: Going to the backfield with florence. Handoff to seastrunk. Dancing around. Not much room to move. Coming up the halftime report, a look at the bick statement made by the buckeyes. The civil war in oregon is on, and georgia taking on the in-state rival georgia tech. Wasn't much of a game. Empty backfield here on second and nine. Quarterback draw. Florence up the middle, and florence has a first down. Tackled at the 20. 1:01 to go here in the half. Blake deese with a tackle. A 13-yard run by florence. The clock runs as they set the ball. Florence throws it williams, and williams gets bottled up by trey porter. Baylor has just one time-out remaining. A seven-yard completion, second down down and three. 
>> Eric: I didn't like the last draw call that they had. Make sure they account for the quarterback. If you're not going to, run for it. 
>> Justin: Rees has a first down and scampers out of bounds. Marked out at the 41 yard line. A 13-yard completion to rees who can flat out fly. A 4.3 speed. Florence again to the sideline, and it's caught by lanear sampson for a first down. Orror you'd stay it's a two-minute drill but it's always a two-minute drill. 

[01:36:15]


>> Eric: Do it really well and you can see they have mastered the quick offense to the outside. Being smart as receivers and getting out of bounds as well. 
>> Justin: A whistle before the snap. The officials getting together. 
>> Referee: The ruling on the field is a completed catch. Texas tech is challenging the replay. 
>> Justin: They will challenge the catch by lanear sampson along the sideline. Looks like the toe was down on his rightfoot. 
>> Eric: If he has the ball right there, that's a catch because the right foot was down before the right. 
>> Referee: After further review the ruling on the field is confirmed. There is no time-out for texas tech. The pagers are malfunctioning. The replay official tried to page the on-field officials. First down. 
>> Justin: Good explanation there. A catch for lanear sampson, his second catch of the game. He now has a catch in 41 condition sective games, does lanear sampson. First and ten from the 48. Florence stepping up. Throws. Low and incomplete. A head's up play kills the clock, and he took a hit by will smith. 

[01:38:19]


>> Eric: Florence looking downfield. Had to get out of pocket. Takes another hi. He's been getting pushed around and dinged around all day today and still stands in there and continues to make that thro I'll tell you what, baylor really needs to get in the end zone to make this a seven-point game going into half. 
>> Justin: Only 16 seconds remaining. Flofrps completes the pass and spun out of bounds is norwood by cody davis, a yard shy of the first down. They had only 1:33 on the clock starting with this drive. Their average time of a scoring drive sunday 2:00. Only 11 seconds remaining here. Florence taking a shot. Wide open. Touchdown norwood! Wow. 
>> Eric: You would think that a play like that right now, texas tech would have something called defensively for a deep pass just like this, but nobody covered him. The safety was in the middle of the field, and norwood just stayed the seam with a nice throw of keeping norwood away from the safety by florence. Keeping cody davis out of the play. 
>> Justin: Aaron jones on for the extra point. What a drive by baylor. It started with that forced fumble and recovery, and it ends in a touchdown to levi norwood. 

[01:40:34]


>> Justin:21-14, texas tech leads baylor. Aerial coverage brought to you by directv. If you call yourself a sports fan call directv. Call 1-800-directv. 93 yards in 87 seconds. A huge, huge drive by baylor. Tommy tuberville can't be happy at his red raiders. The last two drives have ended in turnovers, and that last turnover turned into seven points for taylor. Eric jones will kick off. Grant and stephens are back deep. And a squibb kick. Taken out at the 22 by grant, and grant gets tackled at the 25. And that is the end of this first half. 731 total yards between baylor and texas tech. It's a 21-14 ball game here at halftime. Let take you to erin andrews, joey harrington and eddie george for the pizza hut halftime show.

>>> Hey there. Welcome inside. Erin andrews alongside eddie george and joey herrington. Said it at the beginning of the day. It's showdown saturday and rivalry weekend. My throat already hurts. My ear is completely exploded from you screaming, and now let's check in on the civil war. Oregon at oregon state, joey. I don't know about these pants that they are wearing. Love the helmet. 
>> Got to love it for t 116th time, the civil war. You know what, when the little circle shows up and the line shows up and the spotlight shows up, happens good thing. 42 yards for the touchdown run. Ducks go for two in typical chip kelly fashion and do not get it. Beavers kicks the p.A.T. And go up 7-6. Nip call chip kelly fashion, fourth and seven, marcus eludes the beaver defenders and finds murphy for an eight-yard gain and keeping the drive alive. Thomas walks in to put oregon back up on top, 13-3, and just moments ago barner takes it in from one yard out. 21-7 oregon. 
>> We had said leading into this game that oregon would real very to lick their wounds and get over what happened against stanford last weekend. They have had success in the civil war the past four straight games. What's been different about them this time around than last week? 
>> You know, they are playing the same type of football that they always have. I think that's what's great about oregon is they didn't let last week affect them. I mean, they are still going for it on fourth down. Still throwing the ball like they used to. Mark is still running. Didn't let last week affect their play. 
>> All had the eyes on the monitor. Looks like barner got rattled. Looks okay, walking under his own power. A huge game tonight, speaking of the pac 12 in primetime right here on fox. Number eight stanford on the road to take on number 17 ucla. The bruins have already secured the pac 12 south while the cardinal will try to lock up the north and clinch a berth in the pac 12 conference championship game. Stan order at ucla on fox later on tonight. More highlights, s.E.C., georgia/georgia tech. Georg big, 34-10. 

[01:47:45]


>> The florida defense looks good so far. Offense not really doing much and now let's go to the big east. 
>> Triple overtime game, bigwater looking at the end zone. Pass picked off by wilson. Uconn lines up for the kick. The game-winning field goal. Huskies win in three overtimes, 23-20. 
>> Battle of the brothers, ray graham facing his brother the linebacker at rutgers. Graham gets the best of this one. 27-6 pitt. 
>> All right. Let's go to the big ten now. Wisconsin/penn state. 
>> A bit of history. Ball takes the pitch and with this touchdown he now becomes the all-time leader in touchdowns in ses history. Wisconsin is winning that one, 14-7. 
>> Now the game and some chippiness. 
>> Yes, indeed. Why I love it right here because of that. I mean, it's the chippiness. Michigan getting some cheap shots in there, but we'll see how ohio state handles that in the course of this game. Jim tressel being raised up as the 2002 title-winning team was honored in between the corners. Second quarter. Braxton miller hits brown tore the quickout. Brown gets from the corner and takes the lead at that point, 17-14. Michigan answers right back. Denard robinson runs through two tackles for ohio state and sprints 67 yards for the touchdown. Denard robinson ran over 100 yard in the pass. Michigan winning 21-17. With the buckeyes, defense wa' all she wrote in the second half. Kicked off here by barnett who does a defense, four turnovers on the day. Mush mish never crossed the line. Crossed the pitching line in the second half. 
>> Great celebration there by urban meyer. How about the buckeyes, go 6-7 last year and finish the year 12-0. How does that sound? 

[01:49:47]


>> Feels good. It really does, but it sounds good. Ohio state is just now -- they are setting the table for next year. Of course, we know they don't win the big ten championship and don't go to a cionship game and won't play for a national title but the focus they needed to have during the course of this year, week in and week out knowing they weren't playing for anything but the standard of play that was created by urban meyer, it's just been phenomenal so looking forward to next year. 
>> Justin: So invested. It was difficult to watch today? 
>> Let see how difficult it was to watch today? 
>> I was calm. 
>> Oh. 
>> I got it, I got it, I got it. 
>> And the score! 
>> Can't miss field goals in a game like this. 
>> Nice breakup. 
>> And for the record the reason why I'm clapping is because then I have a happy guy next to me because if all goes wrong. 
>> A little excited. 
>> Difference between a running back and a quarterback, cool as a cucumber. 
>> I'm an emotional leader, i can't help that. 
>> What about the former dance team member I can't hear out of my left ear, is that a concern? 
>> I'm sorry, I'll pay for your doctor's visit. 
>> And a pair of jeans. Let's check out pizza hut's favorite play of the game. 
>> Indiana/purdue, big rivalry here today. Robert marv tips, tips, tips, tips. Finally ends up in the hands of eben who takes it 70 yards and all the way down for the touchdown. Oh, wait, no we go. Indiana, that would lead to an indiana touchdown. 
>> Mine is michigan at ohio state, and what an honor to have jim tressel there, considering all that's happened. Honoring the buckeyes 2002 national team and now they raise jim tressel. That is my greatest play of the day. 

[01:51:55]


>> My greatest play of the women cave is eddie george going from this side all the way to this side. Now we have to reset. Now we go back around. Like a whole chance. 
>> You have to shift the energy. 
>> I understand things like that, absolutely. A second half come up. Coming up after the break, some of you will get a news update from your local fox affiliate while the rest of us will rejoin us here for the second half as the pizza halftime report returns. A small treehouse? If it's big enough, you can have a disco. Oh, yeah! Why do you not want a smaller treehouse? Because it wouldn't be able to fit a flat-screen tv, and then the tv would be about this big, and you would have to hold the wire, and the position you would hold the wire, you wouldn't be able to see the tv. That's a pain in the buns. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

>> Here's a great play from dallas cowboys stadium. Seth doege takes this in for a 19-yard touchdown run. Texas tech leading baylor 21-14 at the half as we welcome you back inside. Could be up by more. Were driving and a big turnover by the red raiders and baylorable to do something with them. 
>> Seth doege got hit from behind and fumbled it going in to extend the lead. Texas tech has done a good job on defense making up for the turnovers. Stuffing baylor at fourth and goal there, and they have done a good job on both sides of the football keeping the game cross. 
>> Justin: And baylor, still capable of scoring points in this game because of the firepower. Over 400 points. Their problem is they haven't been able to finish and the big time score for them before halftime to pull to within a touchdown coming out of the second half, so we have to wait and see how they do. 
>> Eric: Settled. Settled for field goals and yards all over the place and people will have to take advantage of their opportunities. 
>> Keys to both teams heading into the second half. What do you think in. 
>> I thought you were laughing at me. 
>> No, I'm saying keys in the big 12 chuck it. 
>> Great pint. 
>> That's what this whole conference has done all year. 
>> I'm surprised not to see this GAME IN THE 50s BECAUSE BOUGHT Offenses can score at will. 
>> Speaking of just scoring, used to seeing that out of the organize ducks. The civil war, barner did leave the field and walking slowly to the locker room. That does it for us. This was the pizza hut halftime second half of texas tech/baylor from cowboys stadium. Philabundance largest hunger relief organization.

[02:00:53]


>> Justin: Back here just outside of dallas. It's 21-14 texas tech leading baylor from cowboy stadium. Justin kutcher alongside heisman winning eric crouch. Said there will be a lot of offense, a lot of yards, maybe not as many point as we thought but a huge play by baylor to end that half. 
>> Eric: This is w baylor got themselves back into this game. You see what nick florence does right here. Looks at the safety. A safety in the middle of the field. That's cody davis. That was bruce jones. Responsible for getting back to that area so it's the safety in the corner and here a great call by having the receiver do a hitch route. Allows this ball to get thrown on the end of the numbers, on the bottom of the numbers for a touchdown. 
>> Justin: And the first half stats brought to you by ford. You look at it, a ton of total yards and the two turnovers brought to you by texas tech. Talking about the big plays for texas tech, many big plays. 
>> Eric: Sure do. Baylor is a big-play team. Had them in the running game and throwing game. Had the last play of the game to get themselves back into it. I think that's exactly what they needed confidence-wise. The line is protecting well. The receivers are blocking well so expect this to be a high-flying second half as well. 
>> Justin: Let's go down to darius walker who talked with the coaches. 
>> Darius: Caught up with coach tommy tuberville. Asked about the end of the second half. Completely frustrated with the way that ended for his team. Asked about the turnovers and the busted end coverage for the touchdown at the end of the quarter, and he said this cannot happen with them. Frustrated with the team and had a great conversation with them about what they need to do. He's really upset about what happened to them and hopefully that won't last too long. 
>> Justin: They won the toss so they will get the ball. They elected to defer. Now aaron jones will kick off here for baylor. Grant and stephens are back deep to receive for the red raiders. Texas tech comes into this game 7-4, but they are coming off a loss last week at oklahoma state. They have lost three of four while baylor is at 5-5 trying to become bowl eligible. They upset number one k-state last week, and they have won two of their last three games. Jones to kick off to open up the second half. And that will be taken about four yards deep by grant. Texas tech will start with the ball at the 25 yard line. Seth doege in that first half. I would say those are pretty good numbers. 

[02:03:41]


>> Eric: That's what he's all about. A smart player, ferocious, he's a guy that puts the ball in the receiver's hands, the running back hands. Big part of the offense. 
>> Justin: That's what I like. He gets rid of the ball fast and knows where to go with it. That's why he's been successful this year. Coming off a game 24-36 and two interceptions against oklahoma state. Just better numbers in the first half. First half of the second half complete to tyson williams. His knee was down so he picks up four. How about the glitter on the helmets of texas tec right there. Almost looks like it's raining out there. 
>> Eric: Here's what they have to do. Comes out the second half and we knew it. Talk about it right away. The quick short passes to get the ball into the playmaker hands. 
>> Justin: Foster on the happenedoff, and foster has a first down, an eight-yard run by the small 5'7" and strong 125-pound running back. 
>> Eric: I think he appreciates the run here and there. Got to be something, you know, to your arm late in the season. First and ten, doege stepping up with time. He'll run with it and got caught from behind and hit hard by chris McAlister. IT was McAlister who forced the fumble on the last drive for texas tech. 
>> Eric: That's why seth doege is so smart. Saw the coverage and knows how important this drive is and came out and drives down the field. Keeps baylor's offense off the field. Takes a heck of a hit right there, but he's a tough kid. A sma play of him getting up the field and getting down. 
>> Justin: Second down ?? and three. Play action doege far side. Goes up and coming down with it is eric ward. Ward, who had left the game with an injury. He's back and ward is -- 

[02:05:49]


>> Eric: You can seward again working, and what a great throw this is by doege to throw it outside. He knows he's got some underneath coverage. Got to keep it out of his reach, and he did exactly just that. 
>> Justin: Handoff. Kenny williams up the middle. Breaks free. Into the secondary. Across the 30, up to the 29 yard line of baylor. A 17-yard run by kenny williams 
>> a little confusi baylor's defense, running the ball, throwing, it going back to the run. You're sipically seeing this offense out of baylor and not texas tech. Both teams running the ball well as well. Again, it's williams, and williams gets tackled by brice hager, his sixth stop of the game but not inform williams picks up eight. 
>> Eric: Harvard for the offensive coordinator to go away from the run if they are having this sucky is. I would expect they would run it a few more times. 
>> Justin: Second down and two coming up. Zouzalik has the first down. Picks it up on second and two. Texas tech is moving the ball here on the opening drive of this third quarter. 
>> Eric: Again, I thought they were going to run it, and they came with that quick little pass and holds the line backers in for a second and it works. 
>> Doege lost it to the end zone. Incomplete, looking for aaron moore. And pressure right here by doege just from the outside by number 26. Ahmad dixon. Came into this picture very fast. If you're seth doemg, you've got to be thinking where is that player coming from on the next play. 

[02:08:09]


>> Justin: Second and ten. Doege changed the play. Handoff to seniors, yes. He gets tackled by lackey and hager. He's a got that tore his knee and had to have reconstructive surgery. His coach thought he's never return again. He's come back this year to be a key comb hence for this offense. Third and eight. Can baylor come up with a spot? 
>> Eric: Pressure working. Showing the backers up on the line right now. 
>> Justin: Doege steps up. Doege diving forward, and he's going to be short of the first down. Tripped up by gary mason jr. 
>> Eric: Similar to what we saw here. Maybe they were going to bring the pressure. I think doege thought the same thing, and then they kind of backed out of it. That allowed him to have some misreads there. Did some smart things, put him in position. And now a 37-yard field goal attempt. 29. It's good. Baylor able to hold texas tech to just a field goal. 24-14, red raiders. They say opposites attract. But does that work for a car? Ask Scott Makowski. He and his team set out to combine power and fuel efficiency. People said it wouldn't work out. People were wrong. Here's proof.

>> That's going to be definitely tough when you look at redshirt freshmen and you know starting as a redshirt freshman it's tough. You don't investigation appearance and a lot of stuff can happen. That will be interesting to see. I sure hope they take this one, but it should be a tough set to get the talented scene. 

[02:13:12]


>> You've got manti te'o standing over you, that's a pretty big thing to get over, that's for sure. 
>> Justin: Yeakey was helped off the field. Baylor ball here at the 24 yard line. Strong start here in the backfield to start the second half for baylor. On the handoff. Gives to seastrunk, and seastrunk up the middle picks up a couple of yards. Time for a game break. 
>> We'll stick with the big 12. Oklahoma state at oklahoma. Sooners quarterback landry jones dumps it off to trey miller for the touchdown. First one of the day for oklahoma. 17-10. Justin and eric. 24-14 here, texas tech leading baylor. Second down and seven. Seastrunk again. Seastrunk pulled from behind by will smith and broke free. Able to pick up three yards. 
>> Eric: Again in the secondary they have located their safety and it started and they rotated down and bring an extra man in that box. They know that seastrunk can really run the football. They want to put an extra man in there to try to stop the running game. 
>> Justin: Third and four. Glasgow martin now in at tailback. Florence looking to pass. Scrambling. Throws on the back foot and that's incomplete. Pressure applaud by zach winbush. 
>> Eric: Florence is a little frustrated right there. Where is his outlet receivers is what he's saying? No outlets. The receivers knew he was flushing. Has to come back to the ball. Gives him an opportunity to catch it and keeps continuing to keep this drive alive. 
>> Justin: Bound to happen at some point, right? Our first three and out of the ball game. Spencer roth is on to punt for baylor. And the fair catch made at the 41 yard line but zouzalik. Texas tech looking to move to 8-4 on the season and finish over .500 in conference played. Leads 5-5 baylor, 24-14. box has all our favorites in one epic box!

[02:18:49]


>> Eric: No, not today. In his face all day. I'll tell you what, that's exactly what this baylor defense needs to. Do they need to continue to put the pressure on seth doelgt keep him off balance on those throws and decides to run the ball and will punish him. 
>> Justin: Big numbers for doege. Florence not bad himself. Tries to get outside. McALISTER IS THERE AGAIN WITH Ahmad dixon. A loss of four on the play. 
>> Eric: If you see the baylor bears, beating him to the step on the defensive line. The baylor defense is in the backfield already. Two or three guys right there. You saw 95 blackshear, the one that got in there first. 
>> Justin: Third and 14 now here for texas tech. Is it possible that we have back-to-back three and outs. 
>> Eric: If I was a betting man I wouldn't put my yays on it. 
>> Justin: And good thing you're not a betting man. 
>> Eric: Would have lost that one, wouldn't i? 
>> Justin: A six-yard completion. Mike hicks and joe williams combined for the stop. Williams went down earlier with the injury so it's good to see him back out there. 
>> Justin: Baylor opens cheering on the defense watching the big screen. 
>> Eric: That big screen is mesmerizing here at cowboy stadium. 
>> Justin: The first punt of the day for texas tech. Ryan rekleben. Norwood with the fair catch at the 32 yard line. A 35-yard punt. 24-14. It's a ten-point game here in the third quarter. thinkin' truck, you're probably thinkin' about fuel economy. Well, you're gonna want some torque to go with it...

Florence back at quarterback and empty backfield as seastrunk goes in motion. Florence. Escapes it. Running up the middle, and then he gets met by cody davis and driven backwards but not before it. He picks up six. 

[02:24:02]


>> Eric: This is another smart decision here by nick florence. He sees that the coverage is pretty stiff. Nobody open. Just get the opportunity for the offense to run another play. 
>> Justin: Second down and four. Getsthis play in. Handoff to seastrunk, and seastrunk was nearly stopped in the backfield. Able to dive forward and pick up a yard. 
>> Eric: What a nice play there coming in and making the tackle. 
>> Justin: Third and three, empty backfield. 
>> Justin: Quickly gets rid of it. Complete to rees who has a first down. Nick florence, or florence and mat sheen. I love that headline. Look what he's done at baylor, and, again, this is essentially in one year. 
>> Eric: Yeah. Just astonishing what he does and he keeps the offense on the field, and they put up points. 
>> Justin: Thi time it gets batted down at the line by brandon jackson. A 6'4", 250-pound redshirt FRESHMAN from McKeesport, pennsylvania. 
>> Eric: Brandon jackson right here just kind of watched the eyes of nick florence. When he went up to throw that ball, just put that big paw out there and stopped it. 
>> Justin: Second down and ten. Play action. Florence to the sideline, and that is caught by terrence williams for a do to you deep, you give them a big cushion. That's why he's able to catch those ten-yard passes underneath, and no one is over the top. 

[02:26:18]


>> Justin: Seastrunk on third and one has the first down, and seastrunk looks like he gets up to the 40 yard line to pick up six. Cornielious douglas with the tackle. 
>> Eric: Seastrunk doing a good job here getting involved in cutting and still driving. Can you see him using that forearm move that he has there to continue to keep running down the field. 
>> Justin: First and seven. Takes so much time on the play clock. Florence overthrows terrance william. Time now for a game break. 
>> Let's head over to tallahassee and florida state, four versus ten and many thought florida state might win this one but the gators up to a 13-0 lead. Mike gillislee nine yards. Florida very much in the national title hunt. Back to you guys. 
>> Justin: Florence again going deep and has two receivers! It's williams who hauls it in. There is a flag on the play. Williams is marked down at the four. A 36-yard completion. Let's see what this flag is for. 
>> Referee: Offsides defense. Five yards. Result of the play first down. Decline. 
>> Eric: Wesley there jumps offside. Knows this is a free play. Goes ahead and puts the ball up there. Again, the defensive back of texas tech letting terrence williams get in behind him. Terrence williams slow to get up but he has 134 yards today on five catches. First and goal here for baylor from the four. That is the seventh baylor play of at least 30 yards in this game. 

[02:28:33]


>> Justin: Again, baylor trying to become bowl eligible. On first and goal. It's martin up the middle. Florence, touchdown! What a fake! 
>> Eric: What you see here is that mesh. That mesh work between the quarterback and running back and glasco thought that nick florence had pulled the ball and nick was going to give it. He did a head's up play by finding the ball quickly, and that little spin puts him in the end zone. 
>> Justin: A four-yard touchdown run and aaron jones on for the extra point, and it's now a three-point ball game. A fortuitous bounce for baylor. It wasn't a fake. It was a fumble, and it's a four-yard touchdown by florence. That's a trick play. ??? ??? ??? ????????? How advanced is the new Ford Fusion? Well...it has outstanding performance and handling... ...and it offers a plug-in hybrid that gets a projected 100 MPGe. Of course, there's still one thing it can't do. Introducing the entirely new Ford Fusion. It's an entirely new idea of what a car can be. throat) Thank you, Mr. Speaker, uh, members of Congress. In celebration of over 75 years of our Government Employees Insurance Company, or GEICO...as most of you know members it.Congress. ...I propose savings for everyone! I'm talking hundreds here... and furthermore.. NEWSCASTER:Breaking news. The Gecko is demanding free pudding. And political parties that are actual parties!? With cake! And presents! Ah, that was good. Too bad nobody could hear me. GEICO. Fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more on car insurance. . 

[02:31:58]


>> Justin: Nearly a very dangerous and costly mistake by baylor turns into a touchdown as nick florence runs it in from four yards out and makes this a three-point game. Nick florence trying for his second consecutive victory as a quarterback over texas tech, and you may be saying huh, how was that possible, rg3 the quarterback last year. More on that in a second. Aaron jones to kick off now for the bears. A short kick and grant takes it at the four. Grant has had a hole. Grant at mid-field and down the sidelines. Jones closing in. Grant breaks free. Touchdown! 97 yards by grant. 
>> Eric:245 was a display of just raw speed. He makes one cut. 
>> Justin: Aing play there. Picked up a very good block. Able to use his burst of speed to outrun the kicker. Last guy that you need to outrun for the touchdown. 
>> Justin: Ryan bustin on for the extra point. 31-21. That didn't take too long. 97 YARDS FOR GRANT. Alright, if you're thinkin about gettin' a new truck, you're probably thinkin' about fuel economy. Well, you're gonna want some torque to go with it... 'cuz unless you'r usin' your truck to deliver pizza's ... you ain't gettin' anything done without it. Torque is power. It pulls trailers. Hauls dirt. Drags boulders. Torque is what gets the cap off your beer. And only the Ford F-150 with EcoBoost has the best combination of torque and fuel economy. Think about that. Introducing the new 2013 F-150. 

[02:34:17]


>> Justin: How quickly things can change. It was a three-point game in a blink of an eye. Grant returns the kickoff 97 yards for the touchdown. Right when you think you've got a game on her hands here, baylor gets within three and texas tech gets it right back in the special teams game. That was a huge play and a gain of momentum on the third quarter. 
>> Justin: Let's see now what baylor can do as an answer. Impressive. First return of a touchdown in ten years for texas tech. Kickoff taken at the one by goodley. Goodley up the middle a burst of speed and goodley out beyond the 40, and he's going to be marked down at the 44 yard line. College football's biggest championship game returns to fox. Friday the pac 12 championship live in primetime as the 17th ranked ucla bruins take on either oregon or stanford and next saturday is the big ten championship as 14th ranked nebraska battles wisconsin. Only on fox. Oregon leads oregon state 20-17 right now in the civil war as nick florence is back in at quarterback. On first down, and the handoff to seastrunk and picked up a yard before he gets sent backwards. Kerry hyder with his fifth tackle of the game. 
>> Eric: The key to the texas tech defense was to stop the running game so they have to stop the tackle. Make the tackle and make the big plays at the line of scrimmage. 

[02:36:19]


>> Justin: Comes near side and complete to sampon and sampson has the first down marked down at the 44 yard line. For more on nick lawrence let's check back in with darius walker. 
>> Darius: We talk about leaders and nick florence might be the epitome of one because last year he gave up his redshirt season just for a half of football. Rg3 went out for a concussion and nick florence steps in and you already said it, it was against the red raiders and he led his team to the victory. Nick florence the epitome of being a leader and something eric crouch knows about. 
>> Eric: It was a selfless thing to do. You know, when your coves come to you and ask you if you're ready to do something. You give yourself to the team and that's the type of player that he's become and he is this year a team player and everybody knows that. 
>> Justin: Pressure, scrambles up the middle. Picks up a yard, and you think about that last year andhen rg3 went out with a concussion, there's the numbers. Led the tam over texas tech and 15 years. Red raider fans on the feet. 
>> Lawrence looking over the sideline for the play. 
>> Eric: A lot of cushion out here for the three receivers on the right-hand side. 
>> Justin: Empty backfield. Florence wide open on the sideline is antwan goodley for the first down. 
>> Eric: Obviously don't want to give up the big play at all. Look at the quarterback and see how much space you're giving the receivers. That player to him is wide open and goodley takes that ball and gets the first down and gets out of bounds. 

[02:38:21]


>> Justin: First and ten, handoff. Seastrunk. Seastrunk gets pulled down by kerry hyder. 
>> Eric: Kerry hyder right there makes a big tackle because if he doesn't there's a chance for blake seastrunk to take that ball to the end zone. 
>> Justin: Second and seven. Flrns to the end zone. Sampson's got it. Touchdown! Lanear sampson with a 27 yard touchdown catch on the pass from florence. 
>> Eric: He knew t.Knew he had one on one on the outside. Ball high and to the outside and let sampson use his athletic ability to get up there and grab that football. Again, texas tech cannot allow the receivers to get behind him. 
>> Justin: Aaron jones on for the extra point trying to make it a three-point game again. That score drive was 57 yards. They did it in 2:20. It's a close one. A shootout here in dallas. 

[02:40:24]


>> Justin: Don't blink. You may miss a score, may miss a commercial. 31-28 here in the third quarter as baylor trails texas tech. Lanear sampson able to go up over neboh for that touchdown catch. >Eric: HAVE TO CREDIT WHAT Baylor did. Wind out of their sails after the kickoff return for a touchdown and baylor answers right back and says we're not giving up. 
>> Justin: Aaron jones will kick off. Eric stevens back deep and grant just a couple of minutes ago had that return of 97 yards for a touchdown. Maybe they won't kick it it him this time. They are going to go short. Made at the 34 yard line. You talk about the leadership of nick florence. He led that scoring drive through a beautiful pass to lanear sampson. And that was after it was all set up by antwan goodley's big return following the return of grant. 
>> Eric: Got to like what baylor does offensively. Really lures you are in the running game and they got seastrunk that can make the big play and giving the outside, williams and sampson and seastrunk, make the play go over. 
>> Justin: That's first down. Swings it out to the tailback williams. 
>> Eric: This may look like a bad throw and a bad decision, but he just saved his running back's life. Puts it out in front of him, he takes a heck of a shot. 
>> Justin: How much are you thinking about what that when you're the quarterback? 
>> Eric: I mean, a big hit can cause afumble. Trying to think about smart ways to get your receiver the ball and try to throw it a little bit on the back shoulder which is a really tough catch for anybody to make. 
>> Justin: Handoff to williams, and williams with that burst of speed. Let's see where they mark him down. Very close to that first down marker. Looks like he'll be just a little bit shy. Third and about one coming up. Doege comes out. Going into the wildcat formation. That's eric stevens who will take over as the quarterback. Stevens keeps it up the middle and has the first down. Eddie lackey with his fourth tackle of the game. 

[02:43:05]


>> Eric: Probably a dead giveaway that they are running the ball. Take seth doege out. You will see teams that leave their quarterbacks in on plays so maybe you can get them a double pass or something. 
>> Justin: Doege steps up into the throw and completes the pass to ward. Joe williams with the tack. 
>> Eric: I real like what doege did right there. Takes his eyes out. Coming from the outside and just waited until his receiver turned into the open field to make the completion. 
>> Justin: Looks towards the sideline and coming up on 30 seconds to go here in this third quarter. Doege with the quick pass to moore who slipped. That will be a loss on the play, a loss of two. So third and three is now coming up. 
>> Eric: Really hoping to get a good block and a nice throw and when you throw that long throw to the outside that's exactly what you have to have. 
>> Justin: And that will be the last play of this third quarter. It's an exciting game, a three-point game as we go to the fourth. 

[02:47:22]


>> Justin: Back here at cowboys stadium, a three-point game as we go to the fourth quarter. 948 total yards of offense between these two. Justin kutcher alongside eric crouch. What do we expect for this fourth quarter. 
>> Eric: What we've seen all game offensively. I think you're going to get a shootout. Hence the name of this game. Both teams offensively, now in the second half, success. Hasn't done a whole lot. We'll see if they can get something together. 
>> Justin: Doege scrambling around and buying time. Pressure. Gets rid of it, and picked off. And he's down the other way. He's going to go to the house, and baylor has its first lead of the game! 55-yard pick six for eddie lackey. 
>> Kasey: You can see the replay right here. Did a great job of following the eyes of doege. What a turn events you've got here. First lead of the game for baylor. Three turnovers now for texas tech. And that's six wins. Right in their mind. 
>> Justin: Erin jones converts the extra point. Look at the sideline. They are pumped up watching the big screen. Baylor now leads by four. called myself. I'll give you a lift, sir.

>> Justin: A turn of events here at cowboy stadium and eddie lackey picks off seth doege and returns it 55 yards in disbelief for texas tech. 
>> Eric: We talked about earlier in the broadcast, about seth doege making smart decisions. That was one right there. Not the smart decision to throw it late and across the middle of the field. 
>> Justin: Aaron jones to kick off. Again they go with a short kick and fair catch and called for at the 27-yard line. Time for a game break. 
>> Got to love big 12 football. Got another shootout. Oak state and oklahoma. Whoa, that's why you keep your eye on the ball. Landry jones, still showing the concentration and tied at 24. They just went to the house. Justin and eric. 

[02:52:18]


>> Eric: Bedlam there in the state of oklahoma. Here in the state of texas, the fourth annual texas farm bureau shootout, and it truly is a shootout, but how about texas tech? Can they get back on target with their offense? The last six possessions, three turnovers. They had three touchdowns on the first three drives of the game. On first down. A little pass to grant, and grant will get two yards. Tackled by beau blackshear. 
>> Justin: What's the difference with texas tech? Has it been baylor making adjustments defensively? 
>> Eric: I think so much. We talked to the coaches and you wonder right now if seth doege is trying to put too much pressure on himself. If he plays well, this team does well and right there is that perfect example. If he does it, the team doesn't do well either. 
>> Justin: Doege trying to find his receiver grant and there comes a flag. Dixon was all over jakeem grant. 
>> Referee: Pass interference defense, number 17. First down at the soft of the foul. 
>> Justin: We think it was 26, ahmad dixon. Ahmad dixon is right here on your screen he's covering that slot. He got his hands on the jersey and held him even before that. He's wearing number 26 in honor of rodney chazzic who was hurt earlier in the year. On first down, handoff and breaks it down the sideline. Williams gets caught from behind by bryce hager. A 39-yard run by kenny williams. 

[02:54:30]


>> Eric: Kenny williams picking up some good blocks. Sealing the linebackers, and then you see hager coming down and running him down from the other side of the field which says a lot about his aggressiveness and speed to the ball, but a great run by williams there to get texas tech in a good position to score. 
>> Justin: Red zone opportunity here for the red raiders. Handoff. It's williams again and just launching himself forward to pick up two yards. Sam hal on the player down. got seven stops on the game. We've got a player down. holl's got seven stops on the game. We've got a player down. IT'S terry McDaniel.L on the tackle and holl's got seven stops on the game. We've got a player down. IT'S terry McDanie 6'7", 330-pound senior. 
>> Justin: Tommy tuberville looking on as his team trails for the first time in this game. Fox college football continues next as eighth ranked stanford tries to clinch t pac 12 north as they battle 17th ranked ucla. A possible preview of the pac 12 championship coverage. Fox college football continues next right here on fox. Here is nacogdoches, texas tech trying to answer the touchdown by baylor after the 55-yard interception touchdown return. Doege throws over the middle and complete to moore. Got hit hard by eddie lackey. A one-yard xleempingts third and seven coming up. Eddie lackey all over the field right now. That pick six and now making big hits in the running game and he can stop that screen right there. He's feeling it. On his own and on the backfield. Doege to the end zone and lobs it. Touchdown! Darrin moore again. 

[02:57:03]


>> Eric: This has kind of been the tale of the story today with the defense and letting the receiver get behind you. You can see darrin moore works him inside and buys him a little bit of space on the outside and casey falls down in the coverage allowing darrin moore to make that catch. 
>> Justin: Defensive coordinator. Frustrated to say the least. On to the extra point and back and forth we go. 38-35. Kenny williams got things going. The long run down the sideline, and then darrin moore with the touchdown catch, 38-35 texas tech. bring show-and-tell? One second.

>> Justin:38-35, a three-point ball game with 12:24 to go here in the fourth and let's take a look at that touchdown. 
>> Eric: Look at the front line, a little bit of confusion and you can see the safety that's circled right here. He gets helped in here a little bit allowing darrin moore to get outside and create a one-on-one matchup where he won. Cramer fyfe will kick off here for texas tech. Back at their own ten yard line. And that one will sail into the end zone for a touchback. Baylor will start at the 25. Time now for the last nissan heisman watch. It's getting down to the wire. Who do you have? 
>> Eric: I promise that I didn't talk with rg3 beforehand. Said the same exact names that we have up here in johnny manziel breaking on to the list after that big win against alabama and colin klein falling a little bit with his performance against baylor a little bit. Manti te'o made the list this week, and if he can dominate this game against usc tomorrow with an interception and a forced fumble, something, i think he's going to get a lot of attention. 
>> Justin: First and ten here for baylor from the shotgun. Seastrunk to his left. Fumbled the snap. Florence picks it up and wisely throws it away so it moves to second down and ten. Darius, what are your thoughts on manti te'o? 

[03:01:52]


>> Darius: Well, of course, i like manti, and I think he's doing the right thing and the team is doing the right thing. The heisman race is always interesting at this time of the year. You've got teams that go down late. Guys lose, problems happen, and one loss can really upset, you know, so much and the outcome. 
>> Justin: Florence to williams. 
>> Darius: As we see a big play here from terrence williams. 
>> Justin: Terrence williams continues his big day. 37-yard completion. 
>> Darius: There's still a lot of fight in these bears. Terrence williams running that post route and they are getting a perfect pass right there from nick florence. He knew the safety was out of the picture. 
>> Justin: Florence keeps and tried to get to the outside but tackled with an open field tackle by trey porter. With that last catch by terrence williams, he is now at 171 yards on the day. He has set the single season record for baylor. He was 145 yards shy. Kendall wright's record coming into the game and he's now up 171. Congratulations to terrence williams. One of the three finalists for the biletnikoff award. Again going up, and that was incomplete. Lanear sampson was there. Neboh on the coverage. 
>> Eric: And he thought he had a touchdown because eugene neboh was beat for about three yards. You can see, he gets his right hand in there and just whacks the ball at the last second. Surprised he didn't get an interference call. 
>> Justin: Third and te: Empty backfield here for baylor. Florence dancing around. Florence gets ripped down but there's a flag for the face mask. Pete robertson, that could be the second face mask of the game. I've got to respect how quick he bounced up. 

[03:04:25]


>> Eric: Defense number ten. 
>> Justin: He absolutely gets thrown right into the ground. He almost lost his helmet. That was vicious. Been around a few calls when they didn't call face mask. Glad to see that get called. 
>> Justin: Flashback to kansas state? 
>> Eric: Still waiting for a flag. 
>> Justin: So it's first and ten after the penalty. Handoff to dplasko martin up the middle. Martin gets a couple of yards and tackled by blake deese. 
>> Eric: Right when texas tech had an opportunity to get the ball back or make a stop, they probably could have trade to go for it, but they created an errant penalty that gives baylor another opportunity. 
>> Justin: Under 10:30 to go here in the fourth quarter. Middle of the field is open. See if he takes advantage of it. Throwing out to his right. Throws low on purpose. Looking for rees. The pressure applied by winbush. 
>> Eric: Get on the outside. You'll see another opportunity and take the lead back that they so badly want to get this sixth win. 
>> Justin: If nothing else, keep yourself right now in field goal range. It's a three-point game. From the 12. And going for the touchdown now as the field goal kicker has missed two field goals today. To rees, rees dives. Where do they mark him down? It will be a first down for rees. 

[03:06:37]


>> Eric: This does not surprise me that they give the ball it their speed guy rees. Ve the ball to him quickly and get outside and cut a good block there, too. That will probably result in the extra yard and the first down. 
>> Justin: First and the goal from the nine. Looking for williams, there come the flags as williams applies the pressure on florence. 
>> Referee: Pass interference by the defense, number 12. First down at the two yard line. 
>> Justin: The fans are booing, but I don't know why. He held his man. He held his arm the whole entire time. I think he had a little part of it. First and goal from the two. The low snap, handoff, morgan. Tell you what. That's a very, very good play that may go unrecognized by nick lawrence. It's ball handling skills. When you're expequoting it to be right in your face mask and do everything you can athletically, pick it up and continue with your progression and reads. A very head's up play, you're right. A loss of two on the play, so it's second and goal now from the four. Five wide receivers in. Goodl in motion. 
>> Eric: One-on-one situations here. 
>> Justin: Looking for williams. Williams back of the end zone. Touchdown. It's a touchdown on the field. The question is did he have possession going out? 

[03:08:42]


>> Eric: Terrence williams over douglas. Great throw to the corner of the pylon. Just how you teach it on a fade route. He saw he had a one-on-one matup and went after it. 
>> Justin: And jones with the extra point, and we have another lead change here at cowboy stadium. 42-38. What a ball game.

>> Justin: Baylor leads texas tech now 42-38. Terrence williams with another touchdown and how did he get free on this? 
>> Eric: He's taught to give a little shimmy and get to the corner of the end zone so watch him here. Takes a little step in and gets the separation that he needs and gets a perfect pass from the quarterback seth doege. 
>> Justin: Nick florence the quarterback on that one. 
>> Eric: That's right. 
>> Justin: Throwing so much you're confused. 
>> Justin: Jones has gone short with his kick the last couple of times. Goes short again. Taken at the 27 by eric stephens, and stevens gets thrown to the ground at the 36 yard line by brodie trahan. We'd like to welcome to all the men and women serving around the world. Thank you for all you do. Hope you had a good thanksgiving. Here comes seth doege and texas tech trailing by four. Doege on first down. The play action pass to ward. Ward breaks a couple of tackles and gets across the 40. Sam holl finally there. The eighth tack of the game but a 23-yard completion to eric ward. Chance casey, put a lot of pressure out here on the quarterback trying to cover two receivers. Doege. Stepping up. Doege hats first down and gets hammered by eddie lackey. A 14-yard run. S it he doesn't have what he wants right away. Looking at the post and good coverage on the inside, and just use his speed to outrun the line paccers and pick up that first down. 

[03:13:57]


>> Justin: Son of a high school coach. Son now a principal. He's got a brother in eighth grade. By the way. He, too is a quarterback. Doege with the audible. Checks it out. Handoff to williams. And williams gets tackled by lloyd. A six-yard run by kenny williams. Second down and four coming up. Justin kutcher alongside eric crouch and darius walker. Tommy tuberville's team got off to a 4-1 start. Decimated by injury and embarrassed last week at oklahoma state, 59-21. Doege over the middle and completes the pass to darrin moore. A 12-yard completion. Another first down. Darrin moore on the outside. This is an end route. He just stuck it with speed. That's how he was able to get open. It was a speed cut. Looked like for a second that ball was down between his ankles. First and goal from the eight here for texas tech. Handoff williams, and williams tries to fall forward. TACKLED BY chris McAlister, his fifth tackle of the game. You almost get the sense that the team that has the ball last will be the team that wins this game. 
>> Eric:IA. I think that's exactly what's going to be-to-happen here, as much back and forth as we've seen. Might want to burn the clock out. Just not their style. 

[03:16:02]


>> Justin: Second and goal. Doege. Corner of the end zone. It's moore again! Touchdown! What they have exploited here is a mismatch. Chance casey 5'11". Darrin moore 6'4". They have been after him all day, and that's exactly what they did there. That was pre-determined. That was a fade route. Knew they would give darrin moore another chance to get up high and catch the pass for the touchdown. 
>> Justin: The extra point. Our fourth lead chance of the fourth quarter, and we still have 6:19 to go. Darrin moore with his second touchdown of the game. Three-point game. Texas tech back on top. two one? So all of you do. Yes, for sure. Now what's better? Being able to shoot two lasers out of both of your eyes at the same time or just one laser out of one eye?

>> Justin: From high above cowboy stadium here in arlington, texas. Texas tech has answered back with a 63-yard drive. And they now lead by three. Kramer fyfe will kick off. Goodley from the one. Antwan goodley is going to get to the sideline. Get tripped up as he flies across the 30. How about the touchdown by darrin moore. 
>> Eric: Again, gets the little shake right there, and that's to transfer the weight of the defensive back. He didn't bite on it. It was good coverage. Maybe got there a little bit early but there was a definite mismatch on the side, and can you see there, moore, 6'4", again against a guy that's 5'11". There's a definite height advantage. 
>> Justin: How does baylor answer? First and ten from the 30. Goodlley was late to come in from the zion. come in from the zion. Play clock is down to five. Handoff seastrunk. Seastrunk gets turned around by d.J. Johnson. A pickup of eight on first down. 
>> Eric: If you average this out, could possibly have three, maybe four more touchdowns left in this game. 
>> Justin: It's seastrunk again, and seastrunk gets stuck. Kerry hyder again. His seventh tackle of the game. A loss of one. Third down coming up. The red raider fans rise to their feet once again. 
>> Eric: Maybe some fresh substitutions here. A big play on first down. 
>> Justin: Lanear sampson comes in. Kevin rees is in. Glasco martin at tailback. And a time-out is taken here by texas tech. Third and three coming up in a three-point game. Baylor with the football. ] cool if we took the already great sentra apart and completely reimagined it with best-in-class combined mpg, not to mention more interior room than corolla and civic, and a technology suite with bluetooth, navigation, and other handy stuff? ?????? ?????? yeah. That would be cool. ?????? ?????? introducing the all-new nissan sentra. It's our most innovative sentra ever. Nissan. Innovation that excites. ?????? ?????? 

[03:22:13]


>> Justin: We got exactly what we are looking for in this ball game. A shootout in the texas farm bureau shootout, a three-point ball game. Third and three coming up here for the bears. Florence going down the sideline, and it's caught by lanear sampson. With eugene neboh on the coverage. What a catch. 
>> Eric: Lanear sampson just taking off with speed and all that he did here, he just trusted his receiver that he was going to make the camp almost a back shoulder throw but not quite. Good coverage. 
>> Justin:32-yard completion. Florence forced out of the pocket. And he's going to run out of bounds and down at the 25 yard line. A six-yard run. 
>> Eric: Lanear sampson going up for the grab. Neboh didn't know where the ball was. He's got to find the ball. Too late to look back and sampson just used his strength to haul the ball in at the last second. 
>> Justin: Second down and four. Martin on the handoff. Martin with the first down and is there a flag for a late hit? No. A carry of ten yards. 
>> Justin: First and ten from the 16 for baylor. Trailing by three with four and a half to go. Glasco martin gets met in the backfield. Dennell wesley first there to make contact. A loss of four on the play. 

[03:24:17]


>> Eric: Dennell wesley making a great tackle here for a loss. Tell you what. It's okay. This was first and ten. They can gamble with making a run play because they have three other downs now to come in here and throw the football. 
>> Justin: Salubi is racing in from the sideline. Empty backfield here on second and 14. Salubi in motion. Florence a quick drop. Pass to goodley, and goodley with a second effort barrels over a couple of defenders. Let's see where they mark him down on this one. 
>> Eric: You can tell that they are fighting. They are fighting here. Goodley gets stopped and stood up and still fighting. The leg drive might have been enough to pick up the first down. Let's keep in mind they are fighting for that sixth win to keep that bowl eligible into the postseason. 
>> Justin: It is a firstdown. First and xwel from the six for baylor. 3:30 to go. Handoff, martin up the middle and martin gets a yard. There's kerry hyder again with the stop. Hyder's got eight tackles on the day. Rg3, he's not going anywhere. He was wearing a redskins jersey on thursday and got his baylor stuff on today. Play action florence. Corner of the end zone. Overthrows an open terrence williams. 
>> Eric: I almost think he was more trying to protect a bad throw. I think he was trying to get him on the post. At the last second, he made a good throw there. Had him wide open there in the end zone and rg3 saying, you know, there's one I wish he could take back. 
>> Justin: Third and goal. Florence on the slant. Incomplete and looking for kevin rees. Eugene neboh there on the coverage, and now with 2:52 to go. Baylor will have to turn to aaron jones and see if he can tie this game up. He's 0 for 2 on field goals. He's missed from 42. He's missed from 37. This one is just from 22. One thing you didn't see there is morris. He went up to his receiver and went up. My bad. Threw that one behind you. That one is on me. Now he's hoping aaron jones can pick him up. And the kick is good. So we are all tied up here at 45 with 2:48 to play. 

[03:27:35]


>> Eric: Think if you've given clock management at this time, hey, 2:48 on the clock, that's nothing for these two teams. 
>> Justin: Coming up at the conclusion of this game, we'll have the at&t college fox sort post-game show. Oregon taking on oregon state in a civil war. A tango down in florida between florida and florida state, and alabama. And cruising as they are ranked number two. That's coming up on the at&t post-game show. We have ourselves a ball game here altd cowboy stadium. 45-45. 
>> Eric: I don't know how many times we've been able to predict outcomes this year, but we sure got this one right. Knew it was going to be a bat. Knew it was going to be a close game and we're getting everything that we asked for her in the fourth quarter. 
>> Justin: Aaron jones will kick off. Grant and stevens are back deep. Baylor has been kicking it short. And you can see the deep man. Starting to creep up stevens from the 13. And stephens gets wrapped up at the 25 yard line. Let's check in with patrick o'neill for a game break. 
>> Justin, more great football action coming up. A must win for stanford. Can the bruins keep them from the pac-12 championship game? Find out on fox. Justin and eric, that should be a great one. Hopefully it lives up to the billing like this one has. Think about the stanford cardinal and, eric, I spoke to you and darius, I believe with kevin hogan as a quarterback, they are a top four team. 

[03:29:44]


>> Fortunate enough to see him get the ball in boulder. Kenny williams on first down

Precision induction cooktop, brought to you by the makers of the number-one-selling nuwave oven. 
>> Announcer: When you turn on your cooktop, do you really know what the temperature is? No-- you're just guessing. Are you too busy to watch what you're cooking? Tired of all that burnt food going to waste? Worried abids getting burned or a loved one starting a fire in the kitchen? Well, those problems are a thing of the past. Introducing the revolutionary precision induction cooktop from nuwave, the leader in portable induction cooking technology. The nuwave heats up twice as fast, uses up to 70% less energy and is safer than any cooktop. Best of all, the nuwave is the only portable cooktop that gives you precise temperature control with the simple press of a button. Professional chefs create great-tasting meals by maintaining the precise temperature for the perfect amount of time. Well, now you can get professional results too, with the nuwave precision induction cooktop. 
>> The key to great food is knowing how to control the temperatures of what you're cooking. 
>> Now the p.I.C. Is allowing people at home to cook like you can in a restaurant. 
>> I know that when I turn it on that temperature, it's going to be that temperature. There's no guessing. 
>> Announcer: Not only does the nuwave give you precise temperature control, it heats up twice as fast as an electric cooktop. 
>> I put the water in the pan and turned around and the next thing I knew, it was boiling. 
>> What amazes me about p.I.C. Is how quickly it will heat up. Induction technology is just unbelievable. 
>> Announcer: And because there's no flame to catch fire, no hot coils to burn you, the nuwave precision induction cooktop is the safest cooktop ever invented. Look what happens with this egg: The pan is hot, but the cooktop is not. That's the magic of induction cooking. Make pasta in half the time. Melt butter with no chance of it burning. Melt chocolate to creamy perfection. Make sauces with perfect temperature control. 
>> It's small, it's efficient, it's clean and it's safe. 
>> Announcer: And because it's portable, you can take it anywhere, so it's perfect for buffets and outdoor partie to tell you more, let's join bob warden and jennyko at the nuwave test kitchen in chicago. 

[00:02:10]


>> Let me ask you, do you hate boil-overs and the mess they make in the kitchen? Do you hate burnt grilled cheese sandwiches or shriveled-up bacon? 
>> What about over-fried chicken that's all greasy, or dried-out oatmeal, overdone pork chops or charred steak? 
>> Well, what if I was to tell you that instead, you could now have perfect grilled cheese sandwiches, perfectly browned evenly every single time? 
>> All that cheese is melted in there, so delicious. 
>> Perfectly melted. And I could have perfectly grilled steaks set at 350 degrees that give me a perfect medium rare steak or however you like it and it's never going to burn. Perfect pork chops, and not only pork chops... 
>> Right, salmon, grilled vegetables, sausage, perfect every time. 
>> What if I told you, when you fried your chicken, it was going to be fried at the perfect temperature of 375, gently, perfectly, crispy, never soaking up too much oil. 
>> That's hard to do. 
>> In fact, that's the problem with the old stovetops, whether it's gas or electric-- you can turn it up and down, but because you don't have precise control, you're going to get boil-overs. Because you don't have precise control, you're going to burn the cereal on the bottom from time to time. And because you don't have precise temperature control, you can't help but burn a steak or a pork chop on your stove. You see, you're not the bad cook in the kitchen. The stovetop is the bad cook in the kitchen. 
>> That's right, and those days of bad cooking are over, thanks to the fine folks here at nuwave, makers of the number-one-selling countertop oven in the world. 
>> Well, they've done it again. You're looking at the new wave in stovetop cooking. Now, this ingenious invention will make your life a whole lot easier in the kitchen and a whole lot shorter and a lot more fun. We're going to show you how and why every meal-- breakfast, snacks, lunch, dinner, grilled steaks, fondues and buffets-- will be made perfectly every time. Because now, for the first time, you can precisely control the cooking temperature. 
>> Announcer: Now you can live well for less with the nuwave precision induction cooktop. It's the most energy-efficient way to cook. The nuwave p.I.C. Uses induction technology. The secret is an internal series of copper coils. These coils generate a magnetic field within your metal pots and pans. The magnetic field causes invisible molecules to begin vibrating rapidly, creating heat, so the cookware itself heats the food. 

[00:04:33]


>> One of my passions are butter sauces. And one of the challenges of cooking a butter sauce is that if you get it too hot, you know, over 135 degrees, it breaks down. If you get it too cool, it congeals. The beauty of the nuwave p.I.C. Is that I can control the temperature exactly and keep the sauce for an extended period of time. That's such an added bonus for a professional cook and a home cook. 
>> Let me show you this unusual pan. Bob, what did we do here? 
>> Well, we actually cut a pan and cut a section out, because in here you can see we have cereal rapidly boiling, right? >> Boiling away. 
>> I can put my hand right there. 
>> It's amazing. Move your hand. I'm going to put an ice cube right there. It's not melting. 
>> Because all of the energy is going into cooking your food. There's nothing wasted anywhere outside of the pan, so this is perfectly cool. So wipe that ice cube off there. 
>> O.K., I've got a cloth right here. Watch this, I'll take this ice cube, wipe it up. I'm using a paper towel on a burner. There's no fire, there's no flame, so it's so safe. 
>> And the minute you put the pan back on it starts boiling right again. >> Wow. 
>> Now, because we're cooking without fire, jenny, I'm going to take a sheet of play money and put it between the p.I.C. And the pan. Instantly it starts boiling again. 
>> Have you ever seen anything like that? Cooking through paper? 
>> So now we're cooking far more efficiently, we're saving 40- to 50% of the energy. >> Right. 
>> Isn't that amazing? 
>> Announcer: Seeing is believing. Look what happened when the nuwave p.I.C. Was put to the test on the streets of san francisco. 
>> All right, this is gonna blow your mind. This is the precision induction cooktop, and it is portable, eco-friendly and it saves you a lot of money, saves you a lot of time. >> Wow. 
>> Cooking time is cut in half. You see that the water's boiling now? >> Yeah. 
>> The great thing about induction cooking is it only heats the part of the pot that is magnetic, so everything else stays cool, so watch this. Ah! 
[Group exclaims] okay, everybody, put your hands on it. >> Isn't it hot? 
>> No, it just heats the magnetic part of the pot. This is at 110. You can leave it at 110 and it won't get gloppy, it won't get stale, it won't harden. 

[00:06:40]


>> And you don't have to be a big chef to cook. Like, I don't have time to cook. This would be great. 
>> Exactly-- this makes you look like an actual good chef. It's temperature-controlled, so I pop my fried chicken right in there and I know exactly what temperature it's at, and you know if you go down one, 10 degrees, boom, drops just like that. Can you do that on a gas range? 
>> Absolutely not. >> No. 
>> Not at all. >> This is temperature-controlled so you don't overcook it, you don't undercook it. 
>> I love the temperature control-- that can cook meat without drying it out. 
>> Man: Mmm! >> That's amazing! 
>> What do you think? 
>> Nice and crispy. 
>> You can fry, you can simmer, you can steam, you can fondue, you can do everything with this-- I love it. 
>> It's amazing-- I've never seen anything like it. 
>> I love that if you take the top... The pot off of the top, it stops and that the handles were cool. That's really amazing. 
>> And you know what the great thing is, you guys? It's portable. You can take this whole thing over to the table, plop it down and it will stay at 110 right in the middle of your guests and you can dip all day. Dip, dip, dip, everybody dip. And the best part about it? You can grill on the table. 
>> Man: Oh... 
>> What do you think about that? 
>> Mmm... 
>> So it's raining outside, it's the middle of winter, you still get grilled food. Will it change the way you cook 
AT HOME? >> Group: Yes. 
>> The p.I.C. Makes everything so simple. >> It looks like you ordered it from a restaurant. 
>> It does look like I ordered it from a restaurant. That's because I'm a good cook now with the p.I.C. [Laughter] 
>> Announcer: Introducing the revolutionary precision induction cooktop from nuwave, the leader in portable induction cooking technology. The nuwave heats up twice as fast, uses up to 70% less energy and is safer than any cooktop. Best of all, the nuwave is the only portable cooktop that gives you precise temperature control with the simple press of a button.

[00:08:48]


egg: The pan is hot, but the cooktop is not. That's the magic of induction cooking.

[???...] 
>> one of my most popular dessert dishes is called the chocolate three ways. It's made with a triple chocolate brownie, done with a chocolate espresso sauce that I do, and also white chocolate gelato with a little bit of rock salt and olive oil, and the p.I.C. Induction burner, I can keep it warm and adjust it in 10-degree increments and spoon the sauce right on-- it's perfect temperature all night long... Opposed to my double boiler that I had before, risking to get water in the chocolate-- would actually make it separate. So I love the p.I.C. When it comes down to keeping things warm, and that chocolate sauce can get out fast and I can move that dish out of the kitchen quick. Now the p.I.C. Is allowing people at home to cook like you can in a restaurant. 
>> Well, so far we've been showing you what you can do when you can precisely control low temperatures, like for perfectly melting chocolate or for simmering cereal. 
>> But, everybody loves a great steak and everyone hates it when their steak does not come out just the way they like it. But with the nuwave p.I.C., because it comes with precision temperature control, you won't ever undercook or overcook that steak. 
>> For grilling, use this great cast iron barbecue grill pan that can come with your p.I.C. Now, if you like your steak rare, check this out. It's going to be red and juicy on the inside, but perfectly brown on the outside. If you like it well done, it's not going to be burned on the outside, but it's going to be perfectly well done on the inside. How? Because the p.I.C. Gives you perfect temperature control. Look at this, first I seared it to 575, now I've reduced the p.I.C. To 375 and check out this laser thermometer-- exactly 375 degrees. 

[00:13:38]


>> Check out how 375 degrees gives us those great grill marks without burning or charring. 
>> And you know what I like with my steak? >> I know. 
>> A perfectly baked potato, which I can do right here in my nuwave oven in minutes. 
>> Or if you like my favorite thing, sweet potato fries. Whatever you make in the nuwave, it comes out perfect every time. [Chuckles] 
>> Announcer: According to the u.S. Department of energy, 50 cents of every dollar you spend heating up your gas or electric stove is wasted. But not so with your nuwave p.I.C., Because it uses induction technology. This infrared camera shows how a traditional cooktop heats the area all around the pot. But look how the nuwave p.I.C. Heats up only the pot. This means no more wasted energy. 
>> I love that I'm saving energy, that I'm only heating up the bottom surface of the pot where I need the heat to be, and I really think we're seeing a difference in our electric bills and I love that. 
>> I feel really good when I'm using the p.I.C. 'Cause I'm using less energy to cook whatever it is I'm cooking, and I feel like in my little way I'm doing something for the planet. 
>> One of the best things about the nuwave precision induction cooktop is it's portable. I can take it anywhere, I don't have to leave it in the kitchen. So I'll take it into my dining room and I'll set up my own egg station, so when I have visitors-- especially my family-- I can cook my own omelets, they can cook their own omelets, they can cook their eggs, they can cook pancakes and it's just this simple because I've got precise temperature control. And look how beautifully non-stick this is. All I have to do to make the omelet is tip it, the omelet runs back. I tip it again, it runs back. I'm going to be able to fill this up. So everybody can have whatever filling they like. I always like to have some mushrooms, some cheese, some peppers... >> And you know I like the healthy spinach, bob. 
>> Ohh... >> I just ruined his omelet. >> [Laughs] well, with the perfect green fry pan, we just simply fold that over, it's going to continue to cook while it's in the pan. I fold that out and look at 
this: My pan is clean, I'm ready to cook another omelet again. 

[00:15:41]


>> The heating is consistent, so I can set up a buffet with four or five of these and have different temperatures that are going to maintain. I think one of the biggest complaints is that sometimes the last people that go through the buffet, they get the cold food, and with the p.I.C., the food stays warm through the entire event and the guests really appreciate that, as does the host and hostess. 
>> My husband loves the nuwave p.I.C. Because he can grill indoors instead of having to go outside. He can actually join us as a family and we can all be together and cook. 
>> Announcer: Introducing the revolutionary precision induction cooktop from nuwave, the leader in portable induction cooking technology.

Best of all, the nuwave is the only portable cooktop that gives you precise temperature control with the simple press of a button. 
>> I love the temperature control. >> As you press the buttons, you can see exactly what the temperature is-- you can watch the water boil change. 
>> Mm-hmm. >> That's incredible. 
>> Anything you boil water for... [Snaps fingers] it's that quick. 
>> Announcer: Make pasta in half the time. Melt butter with no chance of it burning. Melt chocolate to creamy perfection. Make sauces with perfect temperature control.

>> Announcer: The nuwave precision induction cooktop is the most convenient and efficient way to cook. You get the convenience of traditional stovetop settings plus the flexibility to control the temperature in 10-degree increments. Sear a steak to perfection or melt chocolate or butter without a double boiler. You can do it all with the nuwave p.I.C. The smart sensors inside ensure you'll create delicious meals every time by maintaining the constant correct temperature. It's like having a professional chef cooking for you. 
The result: No more mistakes, no more burning. 
>> It takes the human error out of cooking. There's no more guesswork in what temperature you're cooking at. It's very easy to just set the temperature at the touch of your fingertips. You can go up 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees. In a matter of seconds, you're at that temperature. It's going to be perfect every time. 
>> Now we'd like to talk about the perfect temperature to fry chicken. Now, up to now we've been talking about what you can do when you have precise temperature control on low temperatures, like with chocolate, right? Look at that, jenny. That's been in there for hours, it's still not sticking, it's still the perfect, perfect creamy texture. 
>> Did you taste it? 
>> I know, it's almost unbelievable, isn't it? 
>> Delicious. Oh, and then we went to high-temperature searing. So with the push of a button, we got this to 575 degrees, seared the steaks, then we brought it down to 350 and we have beautiful grilled sausages, pork chops, salmon, even those grilled vegetables-- they were good too. 
>> Well, frying temperature is 375 degrees, especially when you're using vegetable oil. We want to hold that perfect temperature, so lookit here. We have a probe in here, we set this to 375 degrees. It says 375 degrees. Our chicken is frying gently, it's not going to burn. 
>> Here on my burner-- it's a typical electric coil under here... 
>> I can see jenny's been cooking over here. 
>> This is what happens. It's not safe. And not only is it not safe, I have no idea what the temperature is-- I'm just guessing. 

[00:22:23]


>> When you get that really good fried chicken at one of those fast food chicken places, it's because they have a very expensive deep fryer, they've set it at 375 degrees, they can use that oil all day long without it burning. Well, now you have that precise control at home with the precision induction cooker. Let me give you an example. In the test kitchen, we cooked over 200 pieces of chicken, and this is what the oil looked like. >> It looks like it just came out of the bottle. 
>> And this is breaded chicken, right? Here we cooked just 20 pieces of chicken on a gas stove, same results would have been on an electric stove-- you'd guess. You set it someplace between medium and medium-high, you don't know. The minute it smokes, it's gone, it's ruined. That's typically what happens. You have to throw the oil away. 
>> Yeah. Well, that gets expensive. 
>> Announcer: Third-party analysis shows the advantage of nuwave's precise temperature control versus conventional stove tops. Oil cooked with an electric stove contained 45% more saturated fat. Oil cooked with a gas stove contained 10 times more transfatty acids. Oil cooked with an electric stove contained over 90% more cholesterol than oil cooked with the precision induction cooktop. Now some of your favorite foods can be healthier with the nuwave precision induction cooktop. 
>> When you're cooking with frying foods, you're, um, you're trying to keep that temperature high so the grease doesn't get in the food, where you're not ending up with greasy chicken or greasy fish. And with the precision induction cooktop, I was able to master frying that chicken perfectly. 
>> Announcer: The nuwave p.I.C. Has been tested and recommended by the cooking club of america and is the safest cooktop ever invented. Did you know that every 85 seconds, a fire strikes a home in america? And most often, that fire starts in the kitchen. 
>> My very, very first fire was a 16-year-old kid who was cooking french fries on the stove and he forgot about them and he burned his parents' entire house down. 
>> Announcer: Well, that will never happen with the nuwave p.I.C. There is no open flame, no red-hot electric coil to catch fire and as soon as a pot is removed from the nuwave, the conduction of heat stops. 

[00:24:26]


>> The safety features of the p.I.C. Impressed me so much that I'm going to send one to my mother. She's getting a bit elderly and forgetful and I'm always a bit worried that she might start a fire and the p.I.C.'S going to eliminate that problem. It's a great thing for the elderly to have and it's going to be a nice present. 
>> During our show, we've showed you what a difference the nuwave precision induction cooktop can make in your cooking. Whether you're cooking brefast or snacks. 
>> Lunch, dinner, hors d'oeuvres. 
>> Whether you're grilling or griddling, when you have precise temperature control, it can make all the difference. 
>> Whether you're searing at high temperatures... 
>> Or whether you're having precise temperature control at only 110 or 20 degrees for perfect chocolate, you have got it. In 10 degrees intervals you can go from 120 to 130 to 140, all the way up to 575 degrees, which you can never get with your stovetop-- you're always just guessing. So to sum it up, what do you get with the nuwave precisionooktop? You get, first of all, speed-- it heats up really fast. 
>> And safety. There's no red-hot coil or open flame. 
>> And you get precise temperature control that you can never get with your old electric burner or gas stove.

Mr. Rollins, she doesn't have the bear in the bed? The bear is watch... I'm... Yes. turned around, the bear in the corner watching me. Announcer: She's the judge who gives rules on the law and life. She's intense with common sense. She's Judge Lynn Toler. OnDivorce Court, where real couples deal with real life. ianta, a 33-year-old bus driver met her husband, 20-year-old Rashamond, when he boarded her bus. They rode the fast lane of love for four years, but now, after two years of marriage, Chianta wants off at the next stop. He's been actively being a ladies' man. He... he's living a double life. She dressed inappropriately. She come out with booty shorts on, or little lingerie. I got evidence, too, by the way. Chianta says she's done with Rashamond and his double life. Today on: Bailiff: All rise! Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge Lynn Toler presiding. You may be seated. Toler: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. I'm here with Chianta Williams and Rashamond Rollins. The two of you have been married for, uh, two years. You have been together four years. You do not have any children together. Now you seek to be married no longer. Uh, Mrs. Williams, you have brought Mr. Rollins here seeking $2,000 that you say you gave him, for a 2005 Cadillac. But before we get to the situation at hand, I got to ask you, what's up with the bear? I mean, it's a nice bear, he's appropriately dressed, got on a vest and pants, no jeans, good courtroom attire. But why do you have a bear with you... in a courtroom? This is my security blanket. I feel more comfortable when he's with me. Mr. Rollins, does she do this... routinely? All the time. She always takes it to bed with us; anywhere we go, she got the bear. 

[00:02:01]


I don't even feel comfortable having sex with my wife because the bear's there watching me. I feel like I'm being watched. Wai-Wai-Wai-Wait, wait. Mr. Rollins, she doesn't have the bear in the bed? The bear is watch... I'm... Yes. turned around, the bear in the corner watching me. (laughter) He's not in the corner; he's laying beside me. That's even worse. I want to cuddle... Yes! with my wife, but I can't cuddle with her-- the bear's in between us. When you go out to dinner, does she take the bear? She takes the bear, and she makes sure he dressed. He's always ion. I mean, look at him. So you have... you have a wardrobe for the bear? Yeah, he has a wardrobe. He always has had the wardrobe. N-Now, now, uh, now, uh, Mrs. Williams, 33-- that's how old you are? Yes, I am. That doesn't... that doesn't sound at all inconsistent with you? Well, he's... he's 22 years old, so I feel the need, I mean, he's been there all this time, he's faithful, he's committed, he's not leaving me, so... why not keep him along for the road? Okay, so I see, I got it already, Mr. Rollins. I got the first concern already clear. The bear. (laughter) So I'm gonna go to you, Mrs. Williams. Why don't you tell me what your concern is with respect to this relationship. Tell me why it's gone bad. (sighs) When we first met four years ago, everything was cool, it was peaches and cream, you know. He was sweet, loving, and I... didn't take into account his age, because we weren't on that page. So... when it progressed... Mr. Rollins, you're just 20? Yes. And you two have been together for four years? Yes, ma'am. Oh, my. Go right ahead, Mrs. Williams. He'll be 21 next week, so... he was close to the legal age. (laughter) And we didn't... He was close to legal! He was close to the legal age, and, you know, we didn't... I'm not making any statement. No, we-we... no confessions are necessary. Keep rolling. We didn't get a relationship until he was 18. I gotcha. 

[00:04:02]


So... it was okay four years ago, and it went downhill last year and has been going downhill ever since. Can I ask you a question, just-just for my edification. It really doesn't have anything to do with what's going on here. What, at... 29... did you find interesting about a 17-year-old? He was gorgeous. He still is gorgeous. He's charming, he's, uh... I try to do what I can, that's all, you know? He's charming, he-he's... a ladies' man, and I was taken by him being a ladies' man. What was it? What was it? What did you have? It was my honesty. And I was... well, I am... well, I wa... well... When I first met, I was interested, and, you know, I like older women. They could teach you something, you could learn from 'em, you understand? And younger women, they wasn't... in style at the time. Why do you think he's with you? Because I'm his security blanket. In what respect? Um... I'm completely always there for him. He doesn't have to need much, because I'm always there for him... Economically? Do you provide money? Do you provide shelter? What? I provide everything for him. Mm-hmm. Anger. Do you work-- (laughs): Anger. Uh... the bear and the anger. Right. Mr. Rollins, uh, do you work, sir? I was currently working when we first met, but... due to my part-time job, I wasn't working anymore. Mm-hmm. It was a summertime job... But currently... It was a summer job? Yeah, summer job. When you got together... Which is appropriate for 18. Right. (laughter) Uh... now as a married man, uh, have you been pursuing, actively pursuing employment, or you just don't feel that's necessary? Yes, I try to do everything in my will to provide for me and my wife. And what does that entail? Anything. If I got to go out every day and look for a job, that's what it takes. Have you been going out every day looking for a job? Yes, I have. Mrs. Williams, is that accurate? He's been actively being a ladies' man. He... he's living a double life. So... don't get things... Explain his double life. He has two Facebook pages. Uh-huh. One says that he's single, 

[00:06:03]


and the other one says that he's with me. On the one that he says that he's single, I have proof. You have copies of it? Yeah, I have proof. Yeah, and you know the whole world has proof, Mr. Rollins. That Facebook thing, it feels private at the time, but the whole world, you know, even if they're friends, or friends of friends of friends, the next thing you know, everybody in town knows what you're doing. I don't even get on Facebook anymore g hell. But he has a double life, so don't get it misunderstood. One of the Facebook pages says that he was single. He has about a thousand friends on there, and, uh, 20 subscriptions... Who... who is Polo? Polo Rush is one of his aliases. He has Polo Rush, he has Antonio, he has Rashamond, and he has Ace. From time to time, I don't know who he is, so I try to deal with whoever I can at that time. (laughter) Announcer: WhenDivorce Court continues, are pictures really worth a thousand words? Toler: What was the purpose of this picture? To whom did you send it, why did you take it, and who was behind the camera? 'Cause he said I was sexy. Who said? You got problems with your mate? Call me toll-free at: Or visit our Web site at: And become a fan at: 

[00:09:49]


Announcenouncer: Divorce Court is bacack with the case of Chianta Williams, who is divorcing her husband because, she claims, he's too much of a ladies' man. But does Chianta have evidence to support her claim? That's not me, clearly. Mrs. Williams, let me ask you this. I understand from your papers-- and I found this quite alarming-- that you actually put Mr. Rollins on time-out from time to time when he has failed to conduct himself appropriately. Could you explain that to me? I just... hold back on the nookie. (groans and laughter) Oh, that kind of time out. Oh, I see. Well, that... Oh, that's old school. I got you. I thought it was something different. Well, it... Um... (laughter) Hey, I'm out of everything. Mr. Rollins, do you feel she treats you like a child? Yeah, she do. And can you give me some examples of things that she does that you believe is inappropriate for a wife? Well... Well, I have... I have company over, you know? Some friends or family or whatever. She dress inappropriately. He... She come out with bootie shorts on, or little lingerie. I got evidence, too, by the way. So what? Is this... Is this a bootie short picture? You can look at it and be the judge of that. (gallery groaning and gasping) Y'all see that? Look at the boobs. You got to get the boobs. Got it on the screen and everything. You see Teddy P. in the background? Toler: All right, I'm looking. Teddy P. in the background. CHIANTA: Teddy P. is always in the background. Teddy P. is in that corner over there. Chianta: He's always gonna be in the background, but I can't believe... Rashamond: How she gonna be sexy with her teddy bear next to her? That's what I don't understand. Teddy P. is always gonna be in the background. Now, Mrs. Williams... She loves Teddy P. more than she loves me. ...what was the purpose of this picture? To whom did you send it? Why did you take it? And who was behind the camera? 'Cause he said I was sexy. Who said? He said I was sexy. You are. I always tell my wife she's sexy. I got to compliment her. He told me I was sexy, so I feel like if I'm sexy, then everybody should know it. (gallery groaning) Did you distribute this in any manner? You know what? My friend sent the picture. Uh-huh. And he said that I was just as sexy on the picture, as well. And hesaid? Oh, yeah. And that's why I got 

[00:11:49]


suspicious about her friend, which is a male. Yeah, I got that part. (laughter) Uh... If you... if you were to find Mr. Rollins on a bed in a state of... seduction, not quite completely clothed, would it distress you? CHIANTA: It would, but... RASHAMOND: I would be in time out somewhere. Hang on, Mr... He would be in time out. But the reason that I took that picture is only a reaction to the pictures that I found of him. What pictures did you find of him? You know, people... You can tell the whole new modern society. We're all filmed up and digitized. Yeah, that's crazy. You can't get to anything. I want to see the picture. I've submitted the pictures to the court already. Oh, okay. He's a cheater. He's a cheater. Chianta: I figure... Right. (gallery groaning) That's not me, clearly, so... That's not the behavior of a married man, so I mean, if you taking pictures, why not I take the same? Toler: Now, let me ask you this, Ms. Williams. Don't you see...? Well, okay. Rashamond: Oh, no. Nothing about them pictures, Your Honor. I was about to say, it looks fairly innocent, but there's a lot going on here. Chianta: He clear... Do you see him kissing the lady on the picture? That's not married man behavior. Mr. Rollins, do you have an explanation for that? Only know, I don't know where she got them from. It is, like... What you just said about so much technology these days-- she probably did copying and pasting. Uh... So you're claiming that this was... this was somehow doctored in a manner to become... I don't... Uh-uh... ...uh, to implicate you in something you had no involvement... in which you had no involvement? I don't even know what's going on right there. You don't know anything about it? You don't know her? Never seen her before. (laughter) Okay. This is what I go through. That's your story, and you're sticking to it. And that's what I go through. And that's what I go through. He's a cheater. He's a cheater. What-what...? Announcer: WhenDivorce Court continues... Who's really leading the double life? He was climbing over the fence because the garage door was locked.

Announcer: If you wouldld like your case heard onDivorce Court, call us toll-free at: Or log onto our Web site at: And follow us on Twitter at: Divorce Court returns with the case of Rashamond Rollins, who is demanding a divorce from his wife because he claims she treats him like a child. But will Rashamond be forced to pay back $2,000 Chianta said she loaned him for a car? He saw a car. He didn't have two nicls to rub together, as usual. Your Honor? Yes, Mr. Rollins. The only reason why my actions been the way they have been, because I've been catching her up doing stuff, too. She is not the angel that she presents herself to be today. Tell me what you've caught her doing. One day, I come home, surprised her. d she... I know she did it already, you know. Yeah. Never play poker, Mrs. Williams, 'cause they'll kill you. Aah! Right. Go ahead. So, I come, I see... I-I walk to the back of the house. I see somebody pulling out the garage. And I'm looking, like, who is this guy? You feel me? Now, I see her in the road. Like, "What's going on?" She trying to play it off, that's her cousin. Okay... Or that's her family relative or whatever. That was my cous... I never met the man before. Never seen him before. And I don't think I seen him after that. You did see him after that, and that was my cousin. My cousin asked, can he park his car in my garage. And since... he was coming home, I told my cousin, "You might as well just go ahead and leave, because, you know, Rash doesn't like you..." That don't make no sense. Okay, well, he was climbing over the fence because the... the garage door was locked. (laughter) Yeah. Now, wait a minute. And he have to get his car out of the garage, so I was telling him to hurry up and go on ahead and go outside, because you know, I don't want my husband coming here and find you, and I got this robe on. It looks really suspicious, you know. You know? It was really suspicious. It wasn't just looking. It wasn't really suspicious. It was really innocent because he was my cousin. My cousin. But... You knowthey got 

[00:19:50]


a lot of cousins. You got a ninth cousin twelfth removed, and-and you can do bad things with him. Mrs. Williams, I don't believe you for a moment. Right. Your Honor? Had I not been a judge, I wouldn't have believed you. Anybody wouldn't have believed you. (applause) That was a... You were wrong, you know you were wrong, and... I know I'm a good man. Mr. Rollins, you say that your sex life at home is dead. It's dead. Not sick. Not bad, but dead. Explain that to me. (laughter) Really? It's been explained already. Really? Really? Time out. Stop. Now if it's a time out every day or every other... Listen, the lady has mood swings. (laughs) All right? Now she's got, uh, sleeping problems so she takes sleeping pills. She nods off. She don't even have the energy to have sex with her man. (laughs) What's the problem? I can't believe him. Now you, listen, listen. I can't have sex with you when Teddy P. in the way anyway. So Ms. Williams, he's saying generally, for whatever reason, for a variety of reasons, he is not getting enough sex at home. No. Do you see... Think back. Think about frequency... Once a week. ...and ask yourself, may, does he have a point? No, he doesn't have a point. First of all, Judge, I'm not a machine. He chooses to treat me like a machine, but I'm not a machine. He knew when he got into this relationship that he wasn't getting into a relationship by himself, or by myself, basically. He knew Teddy P. was there. Teddy P. is not going anywhere, so don't use Teddy P. as an excuse for why we not having as much sex. We don't have as much sex as we used to because he's on time out majority of the time now. He's on time out majority of the time now because... Because? Because... he doesn't want to act like an adult. He wants to act like a child. What...first of all, you're standing before me, a grown woman... Childish woman. ...pointing over at this 20-year-old man and telling me indignantly... that he acts like a child, while you're wrapped around a teddy bear. (gallery applauds)

ANNOUNCER: Divorce Court returns with the case of Chianta Williams and Rashamond Rollins who are calling it quits after two years in a bumpy marriage. Why don't you tell me what the final straw was, Mrs. Williams. The final straw was... he decided in November to not come home. He left out going to visit friends and family, and he didn't come home. I didn't hear from him until the next day that afternoon. Mr. Rollins, what is your version of that story, sir? Did that happen? Well, honestly, she just don't trust me. Anything I do, she don't believe. You Honor, um, I take her to breakfast one morning, we at the restaurant sitting down to eat. Now I'm having a discussion with her, I just think that ladies... not like your hair, but she had a low fade like me. Mm-hmm. So I tell her, like, I can't see myself having sex with no female that got a low haircut like mine. That's what I'm talking about. Hey, look, nah... That's what I'm talking about right there. It was way lower than yours. I was trying to work with you on that one, Mr. Rollins Thank you. That...thank you. That was inappropriate. You think so? To me, to me. Oh, absolutely. Thank you. It wasn't like I told her I was gonna have sex with this lady. Thank you. No, but you... (groans) I get it. I get, okay? Why don't you... But, no, this she... Hey, hey, hey. Tell me about the $2,000 you're seeking from Mr. Rollins, please. I loaned him $2,000 so he can get a 2005 Cadillac. You loaned him? Loaned him. She didn't loan me anything. Explain the nature of the conversation that established that loan. He saw a car, he didn't have two nickels to rub together as usual. He wanted the car. Oh. That's my husband. I'm broke now. You rich now? He didn't have two nickels to rub together. That's my husband. Go ahead and write the check for the $2,000, Let's get the Cadillac. Mr. Rollins, do you want to respond? Yes, I do. You don't have to 'cause she didn't establish anything, but go ahead. Um... If you feel like you need to say something, don't say the wrong thing. No gonna say the wrong thing. This supposed to be my wife. Now we joint custody with everything, and we 50/50 with everything. If she sees something she like, or Teddy P. want a n and she ain't got two nickel That's my wife. Right. Now when we first 

[00:28:12]


got the car, it was, okay, it's a gift type thing. Wasn't no negotiating, or none of that. I got that. Ms. Williams, the situation that you explained to me is dispositive, and I will talk about that momentarily. I find it quite ironic that I am about to tell a woman who's actually holding He wasn't mature enough. He was 18. You have to give people an opportunity to become who they are before you marry them. And at 18, a person is not who they are The situation you described to me is he expressed to you as your husband, he expressed a want. You fulfilled it. There are no terms of loan. A loan is, you can have this money for a certain period of time, after which you will pay me back. That is not the situation described. A gift is a gift is a gift. There will be no recovery in this matter. It is so ordered. (gallery applauds) Bailiff: All rise. Parties may leave the courtroom. ANNOUNCER: Chianta says bringing Rashamond into divorce court made her want to hold on to Teddy P. even more tightly than before. She insists that if she has to make a choice between her beloved Teddy and her husband... she will kick her man to the curb without a backward glance.

OUR FIRST ACT BEGINS IN THE MID 1950s, A time when the sounds from juke joints made it into jukeboxes, and finally onto our radios. The days of early r&b vocal groups that began to cross over io the culture of the big cities and helped us identify ourselves in the process. [Applause] and now... Thank you. And now the capitol recording stars, the singing five keys! 
    I sa mok em boo di ay       I sa mok em boo       I went to china town       way back in old hong kong    

[00:02:00]


   took out some egg foo yung       and then I heard a gong       ling, ting, tong, tried to sing that song called       I sa mok em boo di ay, I mok em boo     ??????
we were the first rock-and-roll generation. Before us, the kids had to listen to what their parents listened to, the big band. Nothing wrong with the big band, but it's the first time the kid had his own music. 
?????? And as I looked around     the lights were going down       and this is what I found       a ling, ting, tong, tried to sing that song       called I so mok em boo di ay, I so mok em boo     ??????
Bobby Jay: There was a new market coming along that no one yet identified or targeted, the teenager. They were always there. IN THE '40s WITH SINATRA THEY WERE CALLED Bobbysoxers. They didn't want to hear the music of their parents. They wanted something different, they wanted something daring, they wanted something risque. They found it usually at the top of their radio dials on the a.M. Band with black stations that existed there. 
?????? You know, the landlord rang     my front doorbell       I let it ring       for a long, long spell       I went to the window, I peeped through the blind       and asked him to tell me what was on his mind       he said, money, honey       woo! Money, honey       money, honey       money, honey       if you want to get along with me       I was clean as a sheen and so hard-pressed       I saw the woman that I love best       I finally got my baby about a half past three       said I'd like to know what you want with me       she said money, honey       mm-hmm, money, honey    

[00:04:03]


   money, honey       if you want to get along with me       she screamed and said what's wrong with you?       from this day on our romance is through       I said tell me, baby, face to face       how could another man take my place?       she said money, honey       mm-hmm, money, honey       woo! Money, honey       if you want to get along with me          now I've learned my lesson and now I know       the sun may shine and the winds may blow       the women may come and the women may go       but you know I said I love 'em so       I need money, honey       mm-hmm, money, honey       money, honey       if you want to get along with me       if you want to get along       oh, make some money       if you want to get along       I ain't jivin' you honey       if you want to get along       you gotta give up some money       if you want to get along with me        ??????
Aaron Neville: The clovers was one of my favorite groups, 

[00:06:04]


and anything they sang, my brother was a doo-wopper, he'd bring the records home from the record store, and the clovers was on the box. 
?????? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah     doo-doo-doo-doo       devil or angel       I can't make up my mind       doo-doo-doo-doo       which one you are       I'd like to wake up and find       devil or angel       dear, whichever you are       I miss you       I miss you       i-i mi-i-ss you       doo-doo-doo-doo       devil or angel       please say you'll be mine       love me or leave me       yes, I'll go out of my mind       devil or angel       dear, whichever you are       I love you, I love you       i-i love you          doo-doo-doo doo-doo       devil or angel       please say you'll be mine       doo-doo-doo-doo       love me or leave me       yes, I've made up my mind       devil or angel       dear, whichever you are

   I       love you       I       love you       I       love you        ??????
Neville: My brother art had a doo wop group. I guess I was about nine years old or something like that, and they would sit out on the park bench in the calliope project in new orleans and sing harmony all night, and I used to run up and try to sing with them, they'd run me away. "Get away from here, kid," you know. Till they figured I could hold a note, then they let me sing with them, and it was like, the songs were like magic to me, you know. It was soothing. And matter of fact, just about everything I've done over the years had some taste of doo wop in it. 
?????? Are the stars out tonight?     I don't know if it's cloudy or bright       I only have eyes       for you     ??????
and I think it was music that was very relatable to the teenager listening to it. It spoke about love-- we were all in love, whether it was real or not. We thought we were. And these songs, if you were in love with a girl, the song was for you. If you broke up with a girl, it was for you if it was a sad song, you know, your girl left you and this and that. It was your song. They just sang to you. 
?????? And I only have eyes  

[00:10:09]


   for you        ??????
I was dancing at andrea's pizza parlor in brighton beach, brooklyn, with my girlfriend carole king, and on the jukebox was earth angelby the penguins. 
?????? Earth angel, earth angel     will you be mine?       my darling dear       love you all the time       I'm just a fool       a fool in love with you     ??????
and I heard rock-and-roll doo wop for the first time and flipped. That's a good memory for me. 
    walkin' along       my merry way       singin' a song       I will be gay       I found a love       and love is here to stay       whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa       walking along       just feeling glad       singin' a song       I won't be sad       oh, happy day       I'm just walkin' along       when I'm walkin'       feel just like a king       when I'm singin'       don't care 'bout a thing       the reason I feel       the way I do       you love me and I love you       walkin' along    

[00:12:10]


   my merry way       singin' a song       I will be gay       oh, happy day       I'm just walkin' along          walkin' along       my merry way       singin' a song       I will be gay       oh, happy day       I'm just walkin' along          walkin' along       my merry way       singin' a song       I will be gay       oh, happy day       I'm just walkin' along       whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa       whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa       whoa whoa, step!          whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa       ooh whoa, whoa whoa whoa...        ??????
it was the birth, a new beginning, and the very dawn of rock-and-roll. Great vocal groups were being born every day. They connected with our souls, they made us dance, and they could also croon a love song 

[00:14:11]


like no others we had heard or felt before. Go, go, go, man 
?????? gloria     gloria       yo, oh, oh       oooh       it's not marie     ??????
you're killing me, son, you're killing me. One of the prettiest tunes we ever recorded, if not the most popular, and it was recorded by every group on the east coast. Everybody did a cover on this ditty. But we're very proud to say we're the first one that put it on the doo wop map, that's right. Yes, we did. 
?????? Gloria     gloria       do do do       it's not marie       gloria       it's not sherie       gloria       she's not in love with me       can't you see       it's not marie?       gloria       it's not sherie       gloria       but she's not in love with me       bom bom bom bom       ooh       gloria       hum       

[00:16:14]


 ??????
I think there's an importance to this music. I call this music either classic rock-and-roll or classic rhythm and blues or original american rock-and-roll. One or the other. And I say that because people seem to be astounded that this music is around 40 years later, but they're not astounded that ragtime jazz is around 80 years later or that classical music is around 200 years later. It is, to me, trying to shake off the shackles of this music being called a novelty. This is not a novelty. This is a part of the american experience. Ken Held: Living in brooklyn in one of those row houses, on the second floor in my bedroom, I had bought this record can't we be sweethearts, and I remember just putting my little victrola up on the windowsill, cranking open the window, and putting the little speaker, the one little speaker, up against the screen, and saying to everybody out in the street who was playing punch ball and stickball and johnny on a pony and ring-a-levio, all the things they played in new york city, listen to this. 
?????? Dedeliddle liddle...     yeah       dedeliddle liddle       yeah       dedeliddle liddle dedeliddle liddle       liddle liddle liddle       oh, little girl of mine       gee, you sure look fine       yes, you appeal to me       I'll never set you free       be my loving baby       till the end of time       I can't seem to get you       off my mind       the boys all roll their eyes       as we go strolling by       it's not so hard to see    

[00:18:16]


   that they all envy me       'cause your mine, loving baby       you belong to me       that's the way it was       meant to be       well       my baby       oh, honey       dedeliddle liddle liddle liddle       yeah        ??????
I think the marketplace is always moving because that's kind of the american way, you know. We have a tendency to discard those kinds of things that have gone past their useful life. 
?????? Doo mop ta doo mop ta doo mop duh duh       ooh waa ooh waa       ooh ooh wa ooh wa       ooh ooh wa ooh wa       why do fools fall in love?     ??????
good music never goes past its useful life. Good music is always part of the fabric of people's lives. George Clinton: In 1956, probably, frankie lymon... Frankie lymon hit the scene with the teenagers, why do fools fall in love? I, myself, like all teenagers around that age, around that time, wanted to be in a group. So I started parliament... In grade school. There was a doo wop group on every corner in new jersey, new york, philly... Probably chicago and los angeles, too. But in '56, frankie lymon started me. Brucie Morrow: Always amazed me, 13-year-old boy, and is obviously a 13-year-old boy, asking the age-old question, 

[00:20:17]


hey, hey, guys and gals, tell me, tell me with your heart, why do fools fall in love? Can you imagine that? 13-year-old asking that question? I still can't figure it out. 
?????? Doo mop doo mop doo mop duh duh     ooh waa ooh waa       ooh ooh wa ooh wa       ooh ooh wa ooh wa       why do fools fall in love?       why do birds sing so gay?       and lovers await the break of day       why do they fall in love?       oh, why does the rain fall from up above?       why do fools fall in love?       why do they fall in love?       why does my heart skip this crazy beat?       for I know       it will reach defeat       tell me why       tell me why       why do fools fall in love?        ??????
[applause] what you got to understand, before frankie lymon, there were many other teenage groups, but frankie lymon was the first to hit the national scene and do national tv shows-- steve allen, ed sullivan. And because of the association with alan freed and george goldner, gone, end, and gee, alan was also producing movies with jack cook, so frankie was the first guy, as a teenage group, to hit it really national. Well, goody goody was a great song, I mean it just was up tempo, it was showing off frankie lymon's talents. This man was... I kind of call him the michael jackson of his day. And talking to herb cox of the cleftones, he told me frankie could play every instrument, 

[00:22:20]


he was so talented, it was amazing. People wanted him to stay young forever. 
    so you met someone who set you back on your heels       goody, goody       you met someone and now you know how it feels       goody, goody       so you gave him your heart too       just as I gave mine to you       and he broke it in little pieces       now how do you do       so you lie awake just singing the blues all night       goody, goody       so you think that love's a barrel of dynamite       hooray and hallelujah       you had it coming to ya       goody, goody for him       goody, goody for me       I hope you're satisfied, you rascal you          so you lie awake just singing the blues all night       goody, goody       so you think that love's a barrel of dynamite       hooray and hallelujah       you had it coming to ya       goody, goody for him       goody, goody, goody for me       your love has been denied, baby       you been taken for a ride       I hope you're satisfied, you rascal you       hey     ??????

Tj: Well, you know, denise, what we wanted to do this time with this show was tell the stories of the groups and the songs. First of all, TO SEE THE TEENAGERS WITH THE Ts ON THEIR Sweaters and the great story we hear of brucie asking the question, "why do fools fall in love?" You're 14 years old! Why do you want to know why fools fall in love? Denise: And then you sing it with such passion, too. Tj: Terrific, seeing those moments-- cleftones, and of course, speedo and the cadillacs. Denise: And, for me, it was so nostalgic, I began to tear up and I teared up because we've lost some of the people along the way. And in addition to that, the music was so ingrained in my life and in yours, the lyrics were so ingrained in our lives. Tj: And what we've got here is something really spectacular. We've put together an 8 dvd set. This is the complete my music doo-wop everything, we're calling it doo-wop everything. Every kind of anything we've ever done with doo-wop we've finally put together.

Every great doo-wop song that we could find that we've recorded in the my music series here on pbs, put them all together so when you talk about groups that we've seen, like the clovers-- how about "love potion number 9"? "Had so much fun, I'm going back again. I wonder what would happen with love potion number 10." Another one of those bonus songs from this past segment that you just saw. Excellent, excellent sounds from bill pinkney's drifters. We saw "money honey," alright, but what about "drip drop"? What about "fools fall in love"? We've got that in this dvd package for you as well. "Earth angel" with the penguins, the full version, not just the short versions. What we presented on television tonight are these short clips. We've actually got the full unabridged versions. 150, you can choose that, plus an additional bonus dvd of archival classics that you'll find nowhere else except for right here on public television, and the rarities-- those songs that were never put on dvd but we have recorded as part of our library for history.

?????? tick tock, listen to the bop     tick tock...     ??????
rewinding the rock-and-roll clock back to the doo-wop era, we now go to a time when not everyone had air conditioning in their home or apartment... When a gallon of gas was about 25 cents, a loaf of bread was about 20 cents, and a gallon of milk could be gotten for around a buck. At the same time, the back beat of our musical soundtrack was beginning to hit the mainstream thanks to a cleveland and later new york dj named alan freed, who was credited for introducing what was now called rock-and-roll to the mainstream and main streets of america. If it rocks, if it rolls, you're gonna hear it right here, because we're gonna send you with that rock-and-roll beat. Those few simple words-- rock and roll-- a new name for music we've had around for decades, and then it really started to rock. Why? No one will ever know for sure. Anything as far-reaching as the new musical phase spreading like the wind is mighty difficult to analyze. It just happened. It was, the background was rhythm and blues and blues. But it also was a combination of the humor that jerry and I share. 
?????? One day while I was eatin' beans     at smokey joe's cafe       just sittin', diggin' on the scene       at smokey joe's cafe       a chick come walkin' through the door       that I had never seen before       at least I never saw her down at smokey joe's cafe       you know I started shakin'       when she sat right down next to me          her knees were almost touchin' mine       at smokey joe's cafe       a chill ran up and down my spine       at smokey joe's cafe    

[00:40:48]


   I could smell her sweet perfume       she smiled at me, my heart went boom       then everybody in the room       at smokey joe's cafe       they said "man, be careful!       that chick belongs to smokey joe"          from behind the counter       I saw a man       a chef hat on his head and a knife in his hand       he grabbed me by my collar and began to shout       "you'd better eat up all your beans and, boy       get right on out!"       I know I'll never eat again       at smokey joe's cafe       and so we'll never meet again       at smokey joe's cafe       oh, I'd rather eat my chili beans       at jim's or john's or jack's or gene's       than take my chances eatin' down at smokey joe's cafe       you know I risked my life when       that smokey joe's a crazy fool          wah, ah, at smokey joe's cafe       wah, ah, at smokey joe's cafe       wah, ah, at smokey joe's cafe     ??????

It's, it's, uh... It's, uh... What is it? Genesis. It's where what the kids are doing now came from, you see, and many of them don't even know that. They have no idea that that's where it came from. [Applause] and now our very first recording, sunday kind of love. 
    I'm through with my old love       I loved her through and through       I'm searching for a new love       can that new love be you?       I       want a       sunday       kind of love     ??????
[applause] thank you! 
?????? A love to last past saturday night     I'm glad to know it's more than love at first sight       I want a sunday kind of love       I want a love that's on the square       can't seem to find somebody to care       I'm on a lonely road that leads to nowhere       I want a sundayind of love

   I do my sunday dreaming       and all my sunday scheming       every minute, every hour, every day       I'm hoping to discover       a certain kind of lover       who will show me the way?       my arms needs someone to enfold       to keep me warm when mondays are cold       a love for all my life       to have and to hold       I want a sunday       kind of love     ??????
[applause] Pookie Hudson: Doo wop, I mean, when we were coming up it was called either race music or it was called rhythm and blues. There was no such thing as doo wop. Doo wop came about, I do believe, from us using different words in backgrounds of songs, which we put together and made up. 
?????? Dip doo doo dip doo doo dip doo doo     goodnight, sweetheart       well, it's time to go       goodnight, sweetheart       well, it's time to go       I hate to leave you       I really must say       goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight    

[00:46:59]

Robinson: We absolutely idolized musically the groups who sang in those days. There were groups like the spaniels and the dells and the moonglows. I was in the five chimes at the time, because I was probably about, maybe 12, 13 years old, and when you learned a moonglow record, you learned the background vocals before you learned the lead vocal. Because they always had these exotic, way-out fantastic backgrounds. The first words that I remember from the moonglows is "taiku," and then "shooby doo wop wa da," you know what I mean, because these were the kind of background vocals they had. 
?????? Taiku  they were just awesome.    Woo-wooo-woo       ah-ah-ah       woo-woo-woo-wooo       one       thou shalt never love another       thou shalt never love another       two       and stand by me all the while       and stand by me all the while       three       take happiness with the heartaches       take happiness with the heartaches       four       and go through life wearing a smile       and go through life wearing a smile       and, oh, how happy we will be       if we keep the ten commandments of love       of love       five       thou should always have faith in me    

[00:49:00]


   thou should always have faith in me       in everything I say and do       in everything I say and do       six       love me with all your heart and soul       love me with all your heart and soul       until our life on earth is through       and oh, how happy we will be       if we keep the ten commandments of love       seven       come to me when I am lonely       come to me when I am lonely       eight       and kiss me when you hold me tight       kiss me when you hold me tight       nine       treat me sweet and gentle       treat me sweet and gentle       when we say goodnight       and, oh, how happy we will be       if we keep the ten commandments of love       I know       and, oh, how happy we will be       if we keep the ten commandments of       woo-woo-woo       ah-ah-ah       woo-hoo-hoo     ??????
in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth 

[00:51:01]


and also the ten commandments of love, ha ha! 
  ??????
we would hope that they would help us with the girls 'cause we learned their songs. See, that's why we sang, and like I said, there were so many groups in our neighborhood, man, and we would have these street corner battles, and we would have these battles at the recreation center and at school and what have you against each other. And we sang for the girls, man, that's why we sang, you know, it was... That was the motivation. Let's get this group together, let's go and sing so we can attract some girls. Well, I think that we're singing about love. You know, how people used to love in the old days, you know. The guys used to go to the community centers or the street corners, and we used to sing instead of fight. And it was really love that brought people together. 
?????? The     closer you are       the brighter the stars in the sky       and, darling, I realize       that you're the one in my life       whoa       my heart skips a beat       every time you and I meet       my life, my love, my dear       I can't defeat       that burning deep in my heart       to have only you       when I first saw you       I did adore you       and your loving way    

[00:53:04]


   and then you went away       but now you're back to say       and my love for you grows stronger every day       in love     ??????
thank you! We love you! Bobbie Jay: They're all about love. It was unrequited love, it was, you know, lost love, it was looking for a new love. There was nothing about anarchy, nothing about the overthrow of the government, and that's why that era is still so revered, because it was so basic, so simple, so wonderful. There was a boy met girl, and the relationship, hopefully, by the end of the song will culminate in matrimony. 
    oh!       oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!       oh!       oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!       shimmy shimmy ko-ko-bop       shimmy shimmy bop       shimmy shimmy ko-ko-bop       shimmy shimmy bop       sittin' in a native hut       all alone and blue     ??????
Anthony Gourdine: When we first heard shimmy shimmy ko-ko-bop it was because george goldner brought it to us. The president of gone and end records said, "i think it's gonna be a great song." We said yeah, well, let's hear it. And we said, "we can't do that." Wait a minute. That's gonna kill our reputation. That's the stupidest thing we ever heard. It was a novelty song. But he loved it. It came out great. They put that record out, and it didn't do nothing for the first three or four weeks. I mean didn't move. But then all of a sudden, like out of nowhere, it went woom! And what they found out was kids of 9, 8, 7, 12 years old 

[00:55:10]


was doing that song. They loved-- it just happened. Years later, obviously, as I'm an adult, we do a thing for the government, and all of a sudden we started singing, and we saw all these major movers and shakers of the world get up... And I saw colin powell go... "Yeah!" What happened, they're the kids that bought those songs grown up now. And they're leaders of our country and the world. That is something that is special, really special. Blavat: They were the best at what they did with that harmony. Just two kinds of people in the world. Tears on my pillow. Shimmy shimmy ko-ko-bop. Then there was a period of time when the british invasion started to come in. Music changed. Anthony then hooked up with a fellow by the name of teddy randazzo, who in my opinion was the greatest writer. And the reason he wrote so well, he was going through a terrible divorce, a devastating love affair, and if you listen to the songs that he recorded with anthony, with don costa's arrangement-- hurts so bad, I'm on the outside looking in, take me back. These are all songs written by teddy randazzo.

BY THE LATE 1950s, The convergence of integrated groups and white teenagers emulating their r&b icons took the major cities by storm. The doo wop teen culture spread from high school dance halls to larger in-person caravans. Musical arrangements became more sophisticated with more strings and brass, hearkening back to the big band days, but always made for young lovers.

Harvey Holiday: It's the soundtrack of your life. 1959, if you lost a girl, you were singing since I don't have you by the skyliners. So 30, 40, 50 years later, to hear that song, or to see the group, it makes you feel young, it takes you back. It just takes you back to a happier time when you were young, before car payments and before all the things that, you know, that you had to do as an adult. It brings back your youth, it brings back your young days. It just makes you feel young again and that you're right back there. The music just puts you in a place where you feel that you're 16, 17 again, where you want to go get an ice cream soda, where you want to get in the convertible and drive with the moon out or take your girlfriend's hand and walk under the moon. I mean, just simple things, good times. You know, go to the drive-in and get a hamburger, and that's the music that... That's the music that was there, and a lot of times a lot of our loved ones from that time are gone, there's a lot of other things are gone, your favorite corner store is gone, just so many things from that time. So what's left from that time? What's left is the music. And to have it, and to see the groups and to hear it, is one of the few things we have left from that time.

We saw the robins doing "smoky joe's cafe." Excellent to see grady chapman's robins together on pbs. We've never shown it to you before. Brand-new performance, brand-new discovery with your pledge of support. How about the harptones? There's so many great harptones songs. When we think of that wonderful voice of willie winfield and the inspiration for all of us in "sunday kind of love." But then you think about "memories of you," "please give me more, more than just memories of you," "life is but a dream." "That's the way it goes," one of my all-time favorites from the harptones, all on this dvd collection when you choose at the $150 level right now. Pookie hudson and the spaniels. Lost him so early, but we have him doing probably one of the greatest inspirational vocal group sounds, "peace of mind." All part of this collection. Tough tony, little anthony and the imperials and all his big hits from "shimmy, shimmy, ko ko bop" to "tears on my pillow," "just two kinds of people in the world," "i'm on the outside looking in," "going out of my head," "hurts so bad." They are on this collection as well, the complete performances, every little bit of footage we have with little anthony and the imperials. Every performance we've recorded and now released on this amazing 8 dvd collection with little anthony and the imperials will come your way. Also, we've got great live performances on the dvd package of the skyliners-- "this I swear," "pennies from heaven," "comes love," and one of my favorite songs by them is called "i can dream, can't it?" Incredible to hear donna do this version of that. Jimmy beaumont and the skyliners. We have them here, as well as the duprees, the guys that go out today with their group and continue that legacy-- the duprees. And I think one of their greatest songs, aside from "you belong to me" and "have you heard," I think has to be "love eyes," "i'll always love you, love eyes." I remember hy lit used to play that on the radio, turn iover and say, "now we've got a hy lit forgotten hit for you." And the geator with the heater and harvey holiday sharing these moments and stories. So many memories that came out of philadelphia and new york radio. Don k.

I'm gonna give you an example. By day you went to school. After school, you played in the streets. You played halfball, you played football, you played basketball in the streets. At nighttime, you hung on the corner, the luncheonette, the candy store. You would go inside the candy store, the luncheonette. There would be a jukebox there. You would put 25 cents in that jukebox. You would get six plays of rhythm and blues and rock 'n roll. You would then play the machine, okay? You would come out, and you'd start to sing the song with the guys on the corner that you just heard in the jukebox, you see. You played the pinball machine, and you put money in the jukebox. Harvey Holiday: Well, when the doo-wop era started, I don't think it really was called the doo-wop era. It was part of rock 'n roll. Yo didn't separate elvis and fats domino and chuck berry from the crests and the skyliners. It was all rock 'n roll. It was all the beginning. Over the years, disk jockeys started doing shows where they just played harmony sounds. Part of rock 'n roll that we call doo-wop now, heavenly harmony, was pushed to another side, a special area. Oll-- there's rockabilly, there's hard-core rock, new orleans rock with little richard and fats domino. And doo-wop became a category, I think, after rock 'n roll, the beauty of having those voices sing together. You can go to a party now, and you get five guys that may have sung together 40 years ago, and they may not have seen each other in 40 years, but they go into a corner and they start singing a song they sang 40 years ago and the voices blend, and it's just magical. And it's teamwork. We talk about being good to each other and getting along and life being a team. Well, when you're singing harmony, that's what it is. You can just relate to it. It's just something that affects your life. Denise: I'd like to talk to you about community because the pbs family is a huge community. We take the values that are similar, and with those values, we bring you the kind of quality programming 

[01:13:23]


that you've come to expect, that you've come to appreciate. And when we come to you and say, "look, it's a tough time that we're having. Resources are scarce, expenses are high." And we ask you to invest, that investmenoing to make a difference for the long haul. As part of the pbs family, you're really part of a team, and we're cheerleaders for one another. We believe that you deserve the quality programming that you've come to expect. You believe that it should always be there, not only for you, but for your children as well. So while you're sitting there-- and if you're on the fence, just say to yourself, "i can make a contribution based on what I can afford for my family," and it is appreciated. Pick up that phone right now. Do it. All the music, all the memories. You can choose $150, 7 CDs, ORIGINAL HITS BY THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS. The mighty miracles and "got a job," their very first record, of course inspired by the silhouettes doing, "get a job." How about bobby mansfield and the wrens, "come back, my love"? The sensations, a great group out of philadelphia, "please, mr. Disk jockey," one of the greatest of all time. "Music, music, music" by them. The harptones doing "the shrine of saint cecilia." The dazzling drifters. Ben e. King and "i count the tears." 
?????? Na, na, na, na, na, na, late at night     ??????
love that. Got it on the package for you. The volumes, a doo-wop favorite called "i love you." The fabulous flamingos, "lovers never can say goodbye." The chords and their version of "sh-boom." The crows with "gee." The fantastic chantels and "whoever you are." The dubs and an incredible version of "don't ask me to be lonely." Very rare. Bet you haven't heard it before. But we've got that on this package for you as well. Another great flamingos song, "but not for me." ALL HERE ON THIS AMAZING PACKAGE, 7 CDs. We call that the doo-wop romance collection, and once these are gone, they are gone, so take this opportunity, take this moment, seize this moment to support pbs. There's a question I always ask myself. I say, "self, I can't understand, 

[01:15:26]


why am I still playing all this doo-wop? Why am I playing larry chance? What is going on? What is this music? What is this power that this music has?" And, cousins, that's why we must, we must keep this music. It must survive. We have to have survival of this music, and you're helping us do that. But what is it about this music? It's honest, it's innocent. We all feel we're a part of it. It really all tells the story of our lives, growing up.

?????? there goes my baby   ??????
IN THE '60s, NEW PRODUCTION Influenced by swirling latin beats became part of the rhythm and arrangements of many great vocal groups. But none more so than the sound of the new drifters, whose members included charlie thomas, a man keeping the memories of our good times alive with every song he sings. Memories really do keep a lot of people alive. I mean people that's really hurting, you know what I mean? They look back and see the time when they used to do this and used to do that. 
    well, saturday night at 8 o'clock       I know where I'm gonna go       I'm a gonna pick my baby up       and take her to the picture show       everybody in the neighborhood       is dressing up to be there, too       and we're gonna have a ball       just like we always do       saturday night at the movies       who cares what picture you see?       when you're hugging with your baby       in last row in the balcony     ??????
Reed: Well, the drifters, a song like saturday night at the movies, you went to the movies back then, because, you know, that's what you did. A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE TVs YET. You went to the movie. Back then you courted a girl. If you found somebody you liked, "hey, you want to go to the movie saturday night?" "Sure." That's where you wound up. 
?????? Well, saturday night at the movies     who cares what picture you see?       when you're hugging with your baby       in last row in the balcony       yeah, saturday night...     ??????
they were singing about you taking your best girl to the movies. 

[01:20:06]


And there's something again, too, that I think children today are missing when they watch a movie in their living room. There's nothing like watching a movie with a group of people. A funny movie is funnier with a group. It's scarier, if it's a horror flick, with a group of people. Sitting home on your own couch running to get a sandwich from your own refrigerator is not the same as that group theater experience. And the whole theater experience was something that every teenager at that point in time was doing. Back in the day, we didn't get a chance to really see them on the screen, man. It wasn't too much of that going on, that we got a chance to actually see them on the screen, on tv and what have you, because for a black artist to be on tv, back in those days that I'm talking about, you had to be sammy davis or harry belafonte or sarah vaughan or somebody like that. Somebody singing the music that we were listening to growing up and that we were buying and that we were loving, for us as preteens and as teenagers, we didn't get a chance to see those people on tv because they weren't putting them on tv. Because so many of the groups hadn't performed BACK IN THE '50s OR THE '60s ON TELEVISION, They weren't allowed to perform, or if they did perform, footage wasn't available, footage didn't survive. The mission for me, anyway, became quite clear. I mean, that was the start of, hey, if it's not there, let's go out and create it, let's get all these guys back together again as if we could be at one of the great alan freed shows, one of the great early rock-and-roll shows, and have every great vocal group come out and sing all their hits. That's how this started, and pbs was the way that allowed me to really preserve a legacy and the history of the groups, but also bring the audience back to that moment when the first time we heard these songs, and I say "we" because I heard the songs the same way. In many cases I was listening to the same heritage disc jockeys, you know, whether it was the geator out of philadelphia, harvey holiday out of philadelphia, or cousin brucie or bobby jay or don k. Reed. 

[01:22:08]


They played these songs, and I just felt connected to them. Drifters' songs always tell about true life of a person. They always do. 
?????? When this old world starts getting me down       and people are just too much       for me to face       I climb way up       to the top of the stairs       and all my cares just drift right into space       on the roof, it's peaceful as can be       and there the world below can't bother me       let me tell you now       when I come home feelin' tired and beat       I go up where the air is fresh and sweet       up on the roof       I get away from the hustling crowd       and all that rat-race noise down in the street       up on the roof       on the roof, the only place I know       where you just have to wish to make it so       let's go up on the roof       up on the roof          at night the stars put on a show for free       and, darling, you can share it all with me

Thomas: Like, we used to walk broadway, I mean, we knew broadway. The hustle was, you know, when we first started out walking on broadway, see the big, bright lights and see all the stars. You just wish that one day that might be you up on one of the big neon signs. Charlie thomas. The drifters. Uh. Anyway, that's the memory that's in the brain. It is coming true. It came true. I mean, my rhythm and blues put me on broadway. 
?????? They say the neon lights     are bright on broadway       on broadway       on broadway       they say there's always magic in the air       on broadway       but when you're walking down that street       and you ain't had enough to eat       the glitter rubs right off, and you're nowhere       on broadway       they say the girls are something else on broadway       on broadway       but looking at them just gives me the blues       on broadway       but how're ya gonna make some time       when all you have is one thin dime?       and one thin dime won't even shine your shoes

[applause] thank you so much! Art LaBoe: It was the young kids that embraced this. They liked the simplicity of songs like, you know, you're mine and we belong together, and they liked that. That sound hadn't been heard, and it just grabbed the young kids first.

well, the human voice is the original musical instrument, you know, and we always compare instrumental playing to the human voice. It's very funny, 'cause whenever you teach, whenever one teaches, whether I teach or somebody else teaches, they always say, "you've got to sing this phrase." You've got to sing it. You've got to breathe before you play this thing. Everything that's-- that all involves with the human voice. But I know that some voice teachers always compare, when they say sing it like somebody plays the violin. I don't know if that's just as successful an analogy. I think the better analogy is to compare playing an instrument to singing. And which involves, of course, breathing, and the breathing itself makes the phrasing much more natural. 
?????? Tell me why     why the stars in the sky       they're the same kind of stars       that I see in your eyes       I love you, yes, I do       oh, won't you tell me why       I only want you       oh how I want you

you know, everyone loves name songs, and I think we all look for the name of our girlfriend. Now we have marys and we have sues, we have barbara and barbara ann, right? Did anyone ever write a song or sing a song about denise? Yes, they did. Dominic sofuto, right? Randy, we called him. Dominic sofuto, randy. How he got his name randy, I don't know, but I guess his friends called him randy. So randy takes a look at some girl that he knew, I mean, that's according to rock-and-roll mythology. Her name was denise. He had this song put together, and he said, "denise, if you please."

I grew up with a guy in brooklyn. His name is neil sedaka. An innovator. An amazingly talented guy that was supposed to be a classical concert pianist. In fact, I believe arturo rubinstein gave him a scholarship. Neil became, of course, one of our most preeminent rock-and-roll performers and also a composer. Amazing, he got the experience, once again, from the street. I remember he and I used to go on something called the cyclone in coney island, which one of these rollercoasters that would go up and would have the first dip, would be 80 degrees down. I'd be in the back, closing my eyes, saying, "god, let me survive this. I'll never do anything bad again." Neil would be in the first car with his hands 

[01:34:17]


up in the air. And we'd grow up on mrs. Stahl's knishes. We were kids of the street. Neil got this whole dooby dooby doo thing that he did, he got that from the street. Well, neil sedaka is just another guy who was unbelievable in his performing and his writing and what he did, and his early work, like the diary,to me is a song that I played in the doo wop shop even though it wasn't group harmony. It just had the right feel. The diaryhad the feel of the time. There were certain songs from that era THAT JUST HAD THE FEEL OF THE '50s. 
?????? Whoa   ??????
but it's something that was there, it just fit in. 
?????? How I'd like to look     into that little book       the one that has the lock and key       and know the boy that you care for       the boy who's in your diary     ??????
we all love to get involved in something secret, something behind the scenes that we know we should not have privy to. Well, neil--this is according to rock-and-roll history-- I'm not gonna say that neil told me this... but he did. HE DID. His sister kept a diary of all her, you know, things that kids when they're 13, 14 do every day. Could be romance or something in school, something private, something-- an emotion, a feeling that nobody else should ever see, 'cause this is self-expression. It's self-poetry. Well, neil one day went over to the diary, his sister went out, opened it up, and his eyes bulged, and then he said something like, "oh, how I love to look into that little book, the one that has the lock and key." They all had lock and keys-- the diary. 

[01:36:17]


The diary and things like that. She put letters and love letters and things like that. We all want to get involved in that. That's what rock-and-roll is all about-- involvement, and maybe once in a while, getting behind the scenes a little secret. The diarydid that. 
?????? The boy who's in your diary     whoa oh oh oh oh, oh       oh oh ooh ooh     ??????
we were young people writing for a young audience. So I went to sweet sixteens, I had a girl next door to me who was an angel, and it was a very happy time, it was a very naive time. You could understand all the lyrics, and we were, from that school, we loved lyrics and music. Love of the music, definitely. We're communicating with these people. These people come to enjoy themselves, they come to hear what they remember, ok? And we get out there, and that's what we do. We remember, and they remember, and there's a connection that's just the greatest thing in the world. [Applause] thank you, thank you, thank you, folks. Angles, angels, angels everywhere. Can you hear 'em? I hear 'em. Listen. Here they come. 
    the angels listened in       listened in       when they heard me praying       the angels listened in       listened in       when they heard me saying       please send me someone to love       send the one I'm thinking of       my darling, the angels sent you    

[01:38:23]


   I searched everywhere       just to find someone who cares       they came down to interrupt       just as I had given up       the angels listened in       listened in       and brought you near me       the angels listened in       listened in       I love them dearly       but they gave me the whole wide world       wrapped up in one little girl       my darling, when the angels sent you       whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa       oh oh whoa       whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa       oh oh whoa       whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa       oh oh whoa       [applause]    calling all angels, callg all angels       calling all angels, ooh ooh ooh       calling all angels, calling all angels       calling all angels, ooh       there's trouble in paradise       my turtle doves changing wings       there's trouble in paradise       the birds no longer sing       some devil told my angel a lot of lies       and now my tears are falling       like raindrops from the sky       there's trouble in paradise       the stars no longer shine       there's trouble in paradise       'cause she's no longer mine       that devil told my angel that I'd been untrue       won't somebody help me, please, tell me what to do

[01:48:31]


Don't wait. Pick up your phone and support the station right now. I believe that my friend tj lubinsky, who is on television, on this program with my music and all, he really deserves some real accolades for continuing, you know, the whole... The whole business of remembering all these great songs. If it weren't for him and your programs like my music, they'd be lost because where else do you see and hear them on television? SURE, YOU HAVE YOUR OWN CDs AND ALL THAT, But you don't get to see them like you do when tj brings them all to public television AND ALSO MAKES THE CDs AVAILABLE. I think it's real important that we all support pbs because they keep this music alive, and there aren't many places on the rad that you can really even hear the music, let alone see it. So I think it's real important for people to support pbs as much as they can. I do personally, and I hope everybody else does, too, so we can keep this music alive. And in this program, how could we not remember the guy who coined the phrase "those oldiest but goodies"? Art laboe. These are the legendary disk jockeys. Hearing don k. Reed's voice... I remember being a little kid in the bathtub in new jersey, listening to the radio, don k. Reed playing all these doo-wops, discovering it and really learning about through the geator, jerry blavat, harvey holiday, the guys out of philadelphia, cousin brucie continuing to keep that sound going in the early sixties. This is the complete history of doo-wop. This is the story of doo-wop. Doo-wop discoveries. Join us right now. Last pledge break. The pressure's on. Last time we have to hear from you, and a last package we're putting together OF 8 DVDs. AMAZING! 8 DVDs. One of the saddest moments, of course, was losing johnny maestro, and in this particular package, we've got all his brooklyn bridge hits, 

[01:50:33]


things like "welcome me love," "my name is lonely," "blessed is the rain," and of course, "the worst that could happen." Then you think about those great songs with the crests. All together in this amazing package, starting with "sixteen candles," "gee, but what I'd give the world," "my juanita," "step by step," "trouble in paradise," "angels listened in." Wow! So many great memories that we've shared together. This is the culmination of 20 years of shooting these shows on public television for me. I started by hearing them on theio and wanting to bring these groups back, wanting to hear herb cox and the cleftones sing "for sentimental reasons" on television, wanting to hear earl lewis and the channels sing "the girl next door" or "bye-bye baby." Almost time for us to say bye-bye in this break, so it's important you join us right now, pick up your phone, please, and make your pledge. Let's keep doo-wop proud and strong, and there is more work to do for the next generation of doo-wop. Where? Right here on pbs. How? With your pledge. So, please, call us right now. And thank you. Denise: We believe in our commitment to bring you the best quality programming that you've come to expect. We believe that. And we know that you know that you can trust this station with what we bring to you. So, as an investment, pick up your phone right now and say, "i want public television. I want it forever." Forever. Pick up the phone right now. Make that call. 
?????? Baby, if I pray every night     you'll come back to me     ??????
join us now at the $150 level, and the all-new ultimate doo-wop 8 dvd package is yours. Not just short clips, this special pbs dvd set features full performances from the my music archives, many never before available.

Or at the $150 level, we've got the doo-wop romance collection which will come your way. All the classic doo-wop romance songs you love, the original recordings by the original artists. 
?????? Come with me, my love     to the sea       the sea of love       I want to tell you       how much I love you       you're a thousand miles away       but I still have your love       to remember       because I love you       I love you, I do       angel baby       my angel baby       ah, ah, ah, ah

choose at the $60 level, and we'll send you "doo-wop discoveries live," plus everything pbs brings you all year round. It's the last pledge break during the program and your last chance to stand up and be counted for doo-wop. The legacy is great music, great performers that evoke memories of, as I used to say all the time on the radio, "i'm gonna help you re-live the best memories of your life." Music was a reflection. Songs and records were a reflection of our lives. You play a song, and you knew exactly where you were when you first heard this song. You knew that special person who was in your life when you heard that song. You knew a situation. You knew when you went in the service or something, or if you went overseas. Music was very important. It is not the same anymore. So therefore, without the shows that you've been producing now for quite some time, you're not going to hear that stuff anymore. It's gonna go. It's gonna die, you know? And that's such a... Such a tragedy. 
?????? Well, it's time to go     d-d-duh duh duh       goodnight, sweetheart, well, it's time to go       duh duh duh duh       I hate to leave you but...    

[01:58:35]


   bye, bye, bye, bye, bye       well, bye bye bye, bye bye, baby       oh, I really love you so       bye bye, baby       oh, I'll never, never let you go       bye bye, baby       oh, I really love you so       I       really love you so       bye bye, baby       I hate to see you go     ??????

Through contributions to your pbs station from viewers like you. Thank you. >> Don't you want to remove the fear of disease from your life and feel secure that you can fully enjoy your later years? >> A few simple changes in your lifestyle can change your health destiny. >> The theme of this program is that disease is unnatural. Health is the natural state which can only be realized with superior nutrition. >> "New york times" best-selling author dr. Joel fuhrman is a board certified family physician who specializes in preventing and reversing disease through nutritional and natural methods. >> What I'm telling you here is that your immune system is the mastermind behind your body's ability to resist disease. >> Please join us for "dr. Fuhrman's immunity solution." (applause) >> Thank you. Hi, I'm dr. Fuhrman. I welcome you to dr. Fuhrman's immunity solution. Do you or someone you know have cancer, a relative or a friend maybe? Do you know someone suffering from headaches, allergies, or an autoimmune disease like arthritis? If your answer is yes, this is no coinciden. Our country's in severe health crisis that's tragic, even more tragic because most people don't know these illnesses don't have to be. This show gives a solution to the explosion of illnesses across america, and my goal is to inform you about the new most recent advances in modern nutritional science that can solve many of our nation's most serious health problems-- problems like autoimmune disease, life threatening infections and even cancer. Now I know if there was a way you ladies could protect yourself against breast cancer, 

[00:02:01]


you would, right? If I told you to drink a cup of green tea every day and that would give you 90% protection, wouldn't you do it? >> Yes. >> Of course, you would. It's not as simple as just a cup of green tea, but it is pretty simple, and I'm gonna give you the solution right here in this show. And I know if you men out there knew there was a magic bean you could eat and you would never have to worry about prostate or colon cancer, you'd certainly eat some of those beans, right? >> Yeah. >> If what I'm claiming is true and you really could protect yourself against cancer, against heart attacks and against dementia in later life, what would that protection be worth to you? Millns, right? >> Yes. >> Not even, it's priceless, something money can't buy. Well, on this show, I'm gonna give you this lifesaving information, and I'm claiming we can win the war on cancer in america with some simple steps, and I'm going to explain why i think this is so this is a serious show because I'm talking about some serious problems. But it's very important you pay close attention and learn what I'm going to teach you today. You may even want to take notes. The information may prevent you from years of suffering and pain. It could even save your life. Having a powerful, fully functioning immune system can protect you from breast cancer, from prostate cancer, from colon cancer, from pancreatic cancer. Excluding lung cancer caused by smoking, those are the four most common cancers in america. And that's right, I'm making a radical claim. Here it is. We can win the war on cancer, and we can win it right now. Exactly what do I mean by win the war in cancer? I mean that we can prevent 90% or more of cancer deaths, and the science supporting this is strong, it's logical, and we can't wait any longer to put it into action because not acting is killing people, and not acting could even kill you. Before we review this evidence, I want to state that all the statements here are supported by scientific evidence, and my conclusions are not just the result of one study on any 

[00:04:01]


issue, but on many studies. People will try, but this information is impossible to deny. Look, that's fine if you are an informed adult and you want to smoke cigarettes and eat like other americans eat. That's your right. But I think everyone also has the right to at least know they have a choice to know they did not have to get demented with aging, to know they did not have to have that bypass surgery, did not have to have that heart attack and they did not have to get that cancer. Do what you want, but at least do so with your eyes fully opened armed with the right information, so you can choose to take control of your health destiny. This concept that we don't have to get cancer only seems outrageous because we've been misinformed that these diseases are inevitable ogenetic or that we have to be dependent on medical treatments like chemotherapy and invasive surgery. We've been brainwashed to accept that disease is to be expected and that medicines and medical treatments will save us. These most common cancers are a new delopment in human history. They've exploded to these high levels only in the last 50 to 75 years. We can also look at the dietary changes that have occurred i those countries where cancers used to be very low and it became high. The scientific studies are now demonstrating that a normal functioning immune system is dependent on certain foods, and when you eat those foods regularly, you protect yourself from cancer even developing. Vegetable consumption plummeted over the last hundred years in america, and refined or processed foods and sugars increased dramatically as our body weights increased dramatically, too. The standard diet most americans are eating today is simply deadly. Take a look at this graph that shows the increasing incidence of cancer since 1940. Sadly the upward climb in cancer rates is continuing worldwide as those countries now eat like us and refined foods and fast foods have become available all over the world. But this show is not only about preventing cancer. 

[00:06:02]


This is about preventing and reversing autoimmune diseases that have also exploded in recent years. This explosion of autoimmune disease has matched the increased cancer incidents for THE 1940s TO THE 1990s. Let me give you an example of some common autoimmune diseases... And about a hundred more autoimmune illnesses and related immune system disorders such as asthma, allergies and fibromyalgia. Of course, when we eat a diet style that weakens immune system function, we allow cancer and we create an epidemic of autoimmune diseases from immune system malfunction. Ok at the skyrocketing increase in lupus in the last 50 years. Autoimmune illness, where our own immune system attacks us, is now the third leading class of illness in america after hardening of the arteries or arterial sclerosis and cancer. And autoimmune disease has the same nutritional causes as cancer. These diseases are not predominantly genetic. Environmental and nutritional factors simply overwhelm genetics. How could autoimmune disease and the most common cancers be mostly genetic if they were both relatively rare in past generations and in other parts of the world? How could they be mostly genetic if there's so little of these diseases in asia? Yet when the asian population moves to america and eats our diet style, the same cancers double or triple in one generation. Colorectal cancer risk in chinese immigrants increases with the number of years they live in north america. This exposure to a richer diet with more meat, more oil, more sugar, more refined foods triggers both heart disease and cancer. An asian woman born in the u.S. Will have more than a 60% higher rate of getting breast cancer compared to a woman born in asia. 

[00:08:02]


And this instance of breast cancer was more than ten times the instance of breast cancer in asia 50 years ago. Let's look at some of this data in more detail. First, let's look at the death rate from breast cancer in VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN THE 1960s. Note how in 1967, japan, china, dominican republic and even mexico had only about one-tenth the breast cancer deaths compared to the u.S. And northern europe. Now let's go from 1967 and look at breast cancer incidence in korea in 1988. Wow, still only one-tenth the rate we see in america at that time. Fascinating. Now let's go from 1988 to 2008. Just 20 years later, and breast cancer incidence quadrupled in korea er that time frame. What do you think happened to the korean diet just a few years before this radical explosion of breast cancer? Well, let's take a look. Now do you see how their diet changed? Wow, animal products and sugar consumption more than doubled, and the consption of oils are now eight times as high as they were in 1978. What do animal products, oils, and refined foods like sweeters have in common to promote cancer? Well, they're all foods that do not contain anticancer antioxidants and phytochemicals, and they're foods that raise cancer promoting hormones. What happened was the diet was becoming more americanized like in other parts of the world, and as the diet becomes more like ours, cancer rates become more like ours, too. Let's take a look at the american diet because it's perfectly designed to cause cancer and heart disease. It's not only sad--it is sad. It's s.A.D., The standard american diet, s.A.D. It's very sad because it's deadly. So take a look at this pie chart of what americans are eating. That's about 26% of calories from animal products and over 60% of calories from refined foods such as oil, white bread, 

[00:10:05]


sweets, candies, fast foods, chips, and soda. Not only do refined and processed foods not contain those antioxidants and phytochemicals that fight cancer, but they're high glycemic foods that raise sugar in the bloodstream, spiking your insulin levels, and insulin is a hormone that is cancer promoting in excess. More flour, white rice, sugar means more insulin and more cancer. And as the animal products increased from small amounts in the diet to larger amounts, cancer rates have been shown to increase as well. This is not a questionable finding. Animal products are similar to refined processed foods in that they also do not contain antioxidants and phytochemicals. And the more of them you eat, the more fruits and vegetables you don't eat. But there's somethinmore. One important mechanism we have discovered in recent years is that as animal products increase over 5% to 10% of total calories, we see the cancer promoting hormone igf-1, insulin-like growth factor one, increased dramatically. And igf-1 is another powerful cancer promoting hormone. It's well established in the scientific literature that... What I'm saying here is that white rice and white bread is like a piece of chicken because they both promote cancer as the amount of processed foods get too high as the amount of animal products too high. So why is a piece of chicken like a slice of white bread? That's right. One, because neither one contains any significant amount of anticancer nutrients called antioxidants and phytochemicals. And two, because both promote hormones that increase the risk of cancer. Certainly there's a threshold effect, meaning a small amount of animal products or a small amount of refined grain such as white rice won't likely promote cancer. 

[00:12:06]


When you pass over that threshold, we start to see a stronger and stronger negative effect as these foods rise in the diet. Of course, that threshold could be moved up or down based on your needs. A lower threshold is in order if you have a serious illness you're trying to reverse, and lots of americans are suffering with serious immune system disorders. And the number is continuing to rise. Not only can all this human suffering be prevented, what if you already have one of those troubling illnesses? Should you take drugs to control the symptoms the rest of your life, drugs that are known to cause serious side effects and increase risk of cancer? That's right. I'm saying you can get better even recer without drugs. Autoimmune disease is one of the top causes of death in women younger than 65. Lupus incidents tripled in the UNITED STATES BETWEEN THE 1950s AND 1990s. And death from lupus increased 60% in the 20-year period from 1980 to 2000. Multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis had similar increases in incidents. Is this genetic? Obviously not. Yet as the amount of human suffering and deaths has been climbing, the medical profession has largely ignored looking at dietary causation. This just doesn't have to be. You know, I can say this because of studies done in the medical literature that has documented the results with nutritional methods, and I can say this because cancer and autoimmune illness are virtually unknown in areas of the world where they eat enough immune supporting foods. And I can say this because of my 20-year history with people utilizing a nutritional approach, watching thousands reverse their chronic medical conditions that they were told were irreversible and had nothing to do with food-- like karen schroeder from ocean grove, new jersey. In 2005, karen's joints became 

[00:14:08]


very stiff and fatigued and she developed severe pain in her feet, ankles, hips, wrists, and elbows. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and that began the onslaught of medications. She was told she had to take these medications for the rest of her life, and there were no alternatives. And over the next six years, karen took prednisone, plaquenil, alzulfidine and methatrexate. By 2010, she had worsening side effects. Her white blood cell counts had dropped too low, and she had frequent infections. Her liver enzymes were elevated, and she had gastric and esophageal burning and nausea. She finally had to tell her doctors she'd rather live in pain than suffer with so many medications side effects and higher risk of cancer from medication. Then in january 2011 while searching the internet, karen read about people who'd recovered from rheumatoid arthritis using my immunity solution, and she felt hopeful for the first time in six years. She weaned off all of her medication and followed the plan to the letter. And here's karen's statement. Now you mit not have rheumatoid arthritis like karen, and certainly not every person is able to achieve a complete remission, but now that you can see the healing potential that most medical doctors completely neglect, you can start to get impressed about the ability of a well-nourished human immune system to protect itself against disease and even reverse disease. See, when you eat the right 

[00:16:10]


foods and don't eat the wrong foods, you get well. I told you it was simple, didn't i? >> Yes. >> Nevertheless, these are not isolated instances. These benefits are regularly observed. Let me show you another person who recovered from a serious autoimmune illness. Jodie o'neill from kary, north carolina. Jodie first came to me over ten years ago suffering from psoriatic arthritis, lupus, and autoimmune disease called sjogrens's syndrome. She started experiencing joint pains and skin rashes as a teenager. She was on serious medication and steroids for over 20 years, and she still had psoriasis over here entire body, itching, poor mobility and joint pains not adequately relieved by her medications. She had lesions in her scalp, on her eyelids, inside her ears, and the skin was peeling off her hands and feet. She was a mess. She began my protocol in 2001, and after 30 days the itchiness subsided, and within six months, the entire body was free of psoriatic lesions. Without any effort, she lost 32 pounds, and she's kept those 32 pounds off the last ten years. But her ovarian cyst disappeared. She no longer has osteoporosis. She no longer has chronic sinus infections and congestion and nasal drip, and now at age 62, jodie regained her lost youth and can vigorously exeise and participate in all that healthy active lifestyle has to offer. I know that you want that for your life, too, right? 

[00:30:27]


>> Welcome back to "the immunity solution." This show is aintroduction to the latest nutritional science that can enable your immune system to function at full potential. The immunity solution can reduce your risk of infection, and if you do get sick, it can enable you to bounce back quickly and prevent any damage to your body. The immunity solution can enable to recover from chronic illnesses, even those your doctors may have told you are irreversible. It'll drop your blood pressure and cholesterol, so you no longer need medications and can take away your pain from headaches, arthritis, esophagitis and gastritis no matter what your age is. It can enable you to earn a high quality disease-free life your entire life. In order to activate this miraculous self healing, self repairing powers of your immune system, you need to eat a diet style that offers you comprehensive micronutrient adequacy. Micronutrients are those nutrients needed by the body that do not contain calories. We're not consuming them for energy, like fat, carbohydrates and protein. Those are macronutrients. We are consuming micronutrients because our body requires these immune system activators. There are literally thousands of important phytochemicals concentrated in colorful natural foods. We need to get them from the real food that contain them because some of the synthetic forms of micronutrients found in supplements can actually promote cancer. For example, take folic acid. We've observed in multiple modern studies that folic acid supplementation could increase the risk of certain cancers, especially breast cancer. We need the real folate found in green vegetables, not the fake folic acid found in supplements. So phytochemicals are not 

[00:32:27]


optional. They're essential. It's not important for you to kn the names of all these phytochemicals because there's thousands of them. But these compounds in green, brown, orange, red, black, blue foods, the full rainbow of natural plant foods, they work like a perfectly synchronized orchestra to enable protection against disease, protect against dementia and eveslow the aging process. We discovered some fascinating science about viral infections in recent years as well. We found out that when you don't get enough phytochemicals, a simple virus can mutate and become more dangerous, more virulent. When a persois hospitalized with a dangerous infection, dangerous infection of their heart called a viral cardiomyopathy or a serious infection causing paralysis to their nervous system called guilliane-buree syndrome, we used to think, "oh, how terribly unlucky, this person must've caught this very rare virus that attacked the heart or the nerves." But now we know it's a relatively common virus. It's just a coxsackie virus that can mutate to become dangerous when nutritional deficiencies are present. In the environment of cma, comprehensive micronutrient adequacy, there would be no such attack on the heart, and the ordinary virus would've remained ordinary, unable to mutate to evade immune capture and to become dangerous to the heart or the rest of the body. When your immune system is running on all cylinders, you're not going to be at such risk for recurring sinus infections, ear infections, bronchial infections, and skin infections, and your digestion, headaches, allergies and asthma will improve, too. You know, we have a real healthcare crisis in america, and it's not going to be solved by politicians in washington. We need a population that's highly educated about nutrition, a population that's fully informed, that knows how to protect themselves from diseases. We need a healthy population that requires little medical care. Please remember, I'm not saying that doctors and hospitals don't ever serve a valid function. 

[00:34:27]


I'm a medical doctor myself. It's just we've come to rely on medicines and medical procedures instead of taking responsibility for our own health and following simple and powerful methods such as my immunity solution. Remember, the problem from our consumption of refined foods such as white flour products, oils, and white sugar are not that they're just fattening, they cause immune system malfunction. They cause damage, and that means chronic disease and cancer. And not only do animal products and refined foods not contain cancer protective antioxidants and cancer protective phytochemicals, but they're also the foods that promote the cancer causing hormones in the body to rise. And these refined foods and animal products have increased as a percentage of calories in all areas of the world. And correspondingly we see, cancer and heart attack death rates increase in direct proportion. Take a look at this slide where I plotted the amount of natural plant food like fruits and vegetables, beans, seeds, and nuts against the deaths from heart disease, cancer and diabetes. The data demonstrates an interesting pattern where natural produce was low, heart disease and cancer rates are extremely high. Where produce consumption was very high, cancer and heart attack diseases were very, very low, and this is considering the same age group, this 55-75 age group among all these countries. When natural plant food intake is high enough, cancers and heart disease deaths almost disappeared. Now this slide would not look anything like this if I had used 2000 or 2010 statistics. It's based on 1970 data that was COLLECTED IN THE 1960s. That's about 50 years ago. Back then it was possible to find countries eating high amounts of natural plant foods. But even one decade later, america's commercial food interests were spreading everywhere, and the diets of people almost the entire world over were changing for the 

[00:36:29]


worse. These diseases of nutritional origin were increasing everywhere. Plus, the animal products we eat today are not the same as the wild animals eaten in yesteryear. Today's factory farmed animals are sickly overfed fattened animals fed junk food, given growth hormones and antibiotics. That's right. They're fed junk food like candy, pretzels, and chips that are damaged during manufacturing and broken and deemed not fit for humans. Actually, all that junk food isn't fit for humans. It's actually poisonous and cancer causing, but nevertheless, we feed this stuff to animals, so now we're eating junk food and junk food animals, too. My health equation is... This equation means your long-term health and how disease resistant you are is proportional to the micronutrient density of your diet. Health is nutrients divided by calories. Nutritional science is not just interesting, it's the most important subject we need to educate ourselves about because our health is just that important. Always keep this in your mind. You eat for health by eating more foods that give you a high micronutrient bang per caloric buck. Now this mns not only just the high amount of these micronutrients, but the breadth, the variety of micronutrients. We're talking here about how we extend human lifespan by achieving comprehensive micronutrient adequacy, and that means every peg is filled of every micronutrient we need. And you know what the most important micronutrient that you might need to extend your life, the important micronutrient you need to take to make sure you live longer? The most important one is the one you're missing. So we got to make sure you get all of them. That's the whole point here. Okay, so what I've done here is we've looked at studies, and we see that when people eat less, they live longer. And when animals are fed less food, their telomeres, that's a part of the cell that can 

[00:38:29]


shorten or lengthen or stay long, tells you how fast you're aging and how long you're gonna live. And we find that animals that eat less calories, their telomeres stay longer, they don't shrink as they age, so we're slowing the aging process. When we eat less calories, reducing free radical activity, it suppresses genetic defects and genetic alterations. It inhibits the production of cross linking agents and toxins in the cells. So the cell can keep itself clean, it can slow the aging process, and you can live longer and keep your youthful vigor when you consume less calories. But the secret to consuming less calories is not just willy-nilly trying to eat less food, it's getting back to eating foods rich in micronutrients. Because when you eat foods that are rich in micronutrients, then it naturally suppresses the appetite where you're not gonna want to eat as much. So this is not about artificially trying to starve yourself, it's trying to eat more foods that have a high micronutrient per calorie density. The more high micronutrient foods you eat, the less low micronutrient foods you desire. So this program is predominately about eating more high micronutrient foods. Now wouldn't you like to get to your ideal weight without dieting? >> Yes. >> Wouldn't you like to not have to worry about your weight for the rest of your life... >> Yes. >> And wipe out the risk of serious disease in the process? >> Yes. >> Of course, you do. We all need this information. It will benefit you, and it'll benefit your loved ones. So I've scored most foods with my andi scoring system, which gives you a great tool to easily identify the most nutrient rich foods. Now andi, a-n-d-i stands for... What I did was measure up all the measurable micronutrients in an equal caloric portion, so an accurate comparison can be made of one food to another. Note how greens, berries, 

[00:40:30]


tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, seeds, and even some fruits score pretty high in micronutrients. You see the immunity solution is simple. We flipped the american diet from 10% high nutrient foods and 90% low nutrient foods to 90% high nutrient foods and 10% low nutrient foods. And we do that flip, we make it taste great. You try to eat more foods high in micronutrients and phytochemicals and you automatically desire less calories, you automatically lose the addictive drive to overeat, and you lose weight and you keep it off forever. We eat a diet that tastes better, that feels better and that protects us from dangerous infections, autoimmune illnesses, heart attacks, strokes, dementia, and cancer. Look, if you're still living, and I assume you are if you're watching this show... (laughter) That it's not too late to prolong ur life. It's not too late to have a better quality life. So many people have thrown in the towel. They've accepted the negative outcomes predicted by their doctors. This is not for somebody else. This is for you. Whether you're sick or well at this time, don't wait until some serious disease develops. Protect yourlf now. You think about saving for financial needs later in life, but what good is that if you're not well enough or even alive to enjoy it? Your good health is ur greatest wealth. The savings you need to put into your health bank account are those protective nutrients that contue to work in your body every day to protect you against disease. The theme of this program is that disease is unnatural. Health is the natural state, which can only be realized with superior nutrition. I've had so many hundreds of people who've contacted me after watching my last public television program, "three steps to incredible health." Though last year's show was focused more on weight loss, not on the immune system, it changed the lives of thousands of seriously ill people. Don't you want great health and 

[00:42:31]


everything life has to offer? Becoming knowledgeable about superior nutrition is a blessing that can give us a better, longer and a more pleasurable life. Don't forget I said more pleasurable because you can't enjoy life when you're sick. And food even tastes best when you have a healthy appetite and a healthy hunger, and your taste improves. You enjoy eating more when you eat healthfully. What I'm telling you here is that your immune system is the mastermind behind your body's ability to resist disease. You don't just develop serious diseases or get cancer overnight or even in a few years. It doesn't happen from something you did ten years ago. It's a slow process of gradually increasing cellular damage that takes many decades of immune system weakness. 

[01:06:59]


>> We're back with "dr. Fuhrman's immunity solution." >> Thank you. Welcome back to the "immunity solution." And this is part three, the fun part of the show where we get to talk about food. As if I wasn't talking about it already, right? Now I want you to learn two important new words. Words that I made up-- nutritarian and g-bombs. I want you to eat a nutritarian diet. That's a diet that's strives for nutritional excellence. ...Is a nutritarian. And my goal is to have you enjoy life to the fullest as a practicing nutritarian. I insist it'll make your life more enjoyable, not just disease resistant. Now keep in mind, a vegetarian or a vegan could also be a nutritarian if the diet is designed healthfully. And a person who eats some animal products could also be a nutritarian if their diet is designed healthfully. A nutritarian learns about the most powerful healing foods and consumes them regularly. The second word I want you to learn is g-bombs. G-bombs--g, b, o, m, b, s. It's an acronym that helps you remember the super foods you needo eat regularly to drive the immunity solution. These are the foods richest in anticancer phytochemicals that we don't get enough of in the s.A.D.--The standard american diet. Foods that contain nutrients essential to the immunity solution. So let's talk about green vegetables first. The consumption of raw greens has been proven to reduce cancer rates in more than 200 separate scientific studies. In each of our cells is a dna 

[01:09:00]


sequence called the antioxidant response element. It's like a protective force field around the ship in star trek. Your cells have this anticancer force field and it's fueled by green vegetables. And the greens that have the most powerful fuel for the cells protective function are-- examples of cruciferous vegetables are-- for example, in a recent medical study, men who ate 28 servings of vegetables a week, decreased their instance of prostate cancer by 33%. However, if they ate just three servings of cruciferous vegetables a week, they decreased the occurrence of prostate cancer by 41%. That's three servings of cruciferous, more powerful than 28 servings of regular vegetables. The more cruciferous vegetables consumed, the lower the rate of cancer. This is partularly true of breast cancer. A recent study showed that the daily intake of cruciferous vegetables decreased breast cancer deaths by 62%, compared to women who did not eat cruciferous vegetables. And this radical decrease in deaths from breast cancer is even observed in women who already have a diagnosis of of breast cancer. Amazing isn't it? Don't you think every person should learn about this and know this? >> Yes. >> A group of powerful compounds from cruciferous vegetables that offers this protection is called ISOTHIOCYANATES OR Is. There are over 120 different TYPES OF ITCs, AND THEY HAVE Different effects on the cell to move carcinogens and repair defects that could lead to cancer. What is fascinating is that THESE ITCs ARE NOT IN THE Vegetable yet before you eat it. But as you chew it, the cell wall of the vegetable releases an enzyme called myrosinase THAT FORMS THE ITCs IN YOUR Mouth before you even swallow. 

[01:11:00]


If you chop or blend the veggies well, you will have the same effect to form these compounds. So the better these vegetables are chewed, the better they're chopped or blended, more BENEFICIAL ITCs ARE RELEASED Into the body. The next super food I want you to eat is beans. Scientists discovered a new potent anticancer compound in this fun to eat fo and the name of this compound is long, actually 26 letters long, and it's so hard to pronounce, so it must be important. It's-- this compound was found to inhibit a key enzyme involved in tumor growth. That's right. When you eat beans regularly, they prevent tumors from forming in the body. Plus, they're rich in anticancer polyphenols. Accordingly, a recent study showed that men who ate beans or legumes regularly had a 40% lower risk of prostate cancer. And numerous studies show beans dramatically cut colon cancer risk, too. A 6-year study tracking over 32,000 individuals found those who ate beans, peas or lentils only twice a week decreased their risk of colon cancer by 50%. Wow! If they cut their chance of colon cancer in half by eating beans twice a week, imagine the benefits of eating beans daily. You may not have any friends left, but at least you won't get cancer. Seriously, though, if you do eat beans on a regular basis, your body builds up the bacteria you need to digest them, and you don't get the indigestion and gas. The other fascinating thing about beans is that they're very high in fiber and resistant starch. Resistant starch is resistant to being digested and that means that lots of the carbohydrate calories in beans do not get absorbed by the body. They just pass through us, making beans a very weight-loss favorable food. That's right, about half the carb calories in beans do not get absorbed. So beans make you feel full, they stabilize your blood sugar, they protect you against cancer, and they help you lose weight. 

[01:13:02]


Onions are next. Who would have imagined that onions could be so protective against cancer? A multi-country european study tracked the consumption of food and cancer and found the one most protective variable for prostate cancer was onions. And the strongest causative factor was animal product consumption, specifically meat and dairy. Now if we look at all the studies on prostate cancer, we find that tomatoes get all the publicity because they're about a hundred studies showing a protective effect of tomatoes on prostate cancer. Now even though there may not be as many studies done on onions and cancer, but if you look at the strength of the effect in those studies, we find that onions have even a stronger, more protective effect than tomatoes do. Pooling numerous studies from 37 different countries on onions and cancer, we find between 50% and 88% reduction in the instance of various cancers. And some of the green vegetables, the green cruciferous vegetables, when you cut the onion, it causes a chemical reaction to occur. And the same reaction that creates the acid that makes your eyes burn, is a reaction that forms these organosulfide compounds with their powerful anticancer effects. So the point to remember here is that the enzyme is heat sensitive. So to increase the cancer fighting power of onions in your diet, you want to eat some raw onion and chew them very well. If you cook the onion, and then cut it up or blended it, then it won't give off that gas that makes your eyes tear. So you won't produce those anticancer compounds. But if you chop it or blend it first, when it's raw, you can still cook the onion after and maintain most of the benefits because the organosulfide compounds are not to destroyed by cooking. You just have to make sure you chop it up really fine before you cook it so those organosulfide compounds are formed before cooking. Do you follow that? >> Yes. >> All right, now guess-- who is the king of the cancer fighting all-stars? NOPE, NOT LeBRON JAMES. >> (audience laughs) >> It's mushrooms. Mushrooms have three important 

[01:15:03]


and unique cancer defenses. First, they contain-- antigen-binding lectins. That means they stick to the surfaces of abnormal cells so the body can recognize and attack those cells removal before they become cancerous. Fascinating isn't it? >> (audience) YES. >> Our immune system has the ability to fully recognize abnoal cells and remove them, but only when it becomes fully activated when you eat mushrooms. The second important cancer fighting feature of mushrooms is that they're strong angiogenesis inhibitors. That means these compounds inhibit new blood vessel growth. See in order for a tumor to grow, in order for cells to become cancerous, and spread they have to send out signals that create new blood vessels to grow and feed them with nutrients and oxygen. And mushrooms say, no way. They inhibit the enzymes released by abnormal cells. That promote blood vessel growth thereby restricting the oxygen and nutrients from getting to those cells. So these substances derived from mushrooms starve off tumors and cancers. And the fat on your body is also like a tumor. It secretes hormones that stimulates growth of blood vessels also. The fat can't grow without a delivery system of highways that bring it more calories and mushrooms stop that delivery. They won't let fat grow easily on your body either. The third important protective feature of mushrooms is they contain aromatase inhibitors. These compounds prevent the body from making excess estrogen. And they protect the breast tissue from being stimulated from circulating estrogen. Now because of this, mushrooms are powerfully protective against breast cancer. It's as if mushrooms are a necessary armor for our immunity system. Look, your car needs gas and oil, and your immune system needs greens, onions and mushrooms, or it simply is not going to function normally. So let's move on to berries. I love that berries taste great, they're certainly a great diet and weight loss food. As they're also so low in calories they even have a low glycemic load for a diabetic. 

[01:17:05]


But did you know that berries can slow ageing of the berries and prevent dementia? Did you know berries have powerful anticancer benefits? Ellagic acid and anthocyanins are prominent phytochemicals in berries that inhibit the growth of abnormal cells and cancer cells. One recent study gave strawberry concentrates to patients with esophagus cancer and found that the cancers reversed or stopped progressing. Amazingly, anticancer potential here is even surprising the researchers involved in these studies who've reported to me that this is a hotbed of recent excitement. What's observed is that we can almost wipe out cancers in animals genetically prone to get the cancers, when a mixture of these particular super foods are put together and fed to these animals. So the last on your g-bombs list right, g, b, o, m, b, s, the last on your list, is seeds. Don't forget those seeds every day. Numerous studies on seeds and lignans derived from seeds is simply spectacular, and it's important you know about it. I'll just give you the results of two important studies. You'll get the point. A double blinded placebo controlled trial with flaxseed was done where they gave women who had breast cancer a flax seed containing muffin each day. And, of course, half the women in the study got a muffin that looked just like that, but didn't have the flaxseeds. And six weeks later, the breast cancer tumors were biopsied and analyzed, and they found significant cancer cell death and regression of cancer proliferation, which means the growth of the cancer, in the group that had the flax. Another study on the lignans from seeds studied women who had breast cancer and they tracked the amount of lignans consumed, over a 10-year period. You see, lignans are rich in flaxseeds, chia seeds, some other seeds, the women who ate the most lignans which was less than 1 milligram a day had a 71% decrease in breast cancer mortality over that 10-year period. Now one teaspoon of flax or chia 

[01:19:05]


seeds have about 7 milligrams of lignans, and in the study less than 1 milligram decreased breast cancer deaths by over 70%. That's truly amazing. So here's my nutritarian prescripti number one-- do you eat some beans every day? You should. I wa you to. Check that off. It's important. Do you eat least a cup of berries and two other fruits a day? Are you having three fresh fruits a day? You got to check it off. It's one thing you have to do. It's part of the formula here. Now that 1 ounce of raw nuts and seeds, I want an half an ounce from--i want at least a tablespoon of chia seeds or sesame seeds or flaxseeds hemp seeds, I want at least a tablespoon of those seeds to get the lignans you need. I want some of those nuts and seeds to be some walnuts if possible for the omega-3 fatty acids. Have all the seeds and nuts you want, have the types you want, but have some of the hemp, chia, flax, or some walnuts for those mega-3 fatty acids, and then have some other nuts and seeds, pistachio nuts, pecans, you kn, mac--whatever you want, and I'm gonna give you incredibly great recipe ideas for this, too. One big salad, I want a sign on your refrigerator that says that salad is the main dish. Take out a marker, make a nice sign and--at least one of the meal, make the salad as the main dish--a big salad. Chop up the veg--the lettuce and the cabbage and the tomatoes and the red onion, put a delicious nut-based dressing on it, make a delicious tasting salad, kiwis or strawberries, or cherry tomatoes or sun dried tomatoes in there, make a roasted garlic dressing. One of my favorite dressings has roasted garlic, almonds whipped up a little tomato sauce a little fig vinegar or balsamic vinegar, whipped up, tastes fantastic on a salad. Okay, so at least one nice salad every day, and the half a cup of beans, you can dump it right on top of the salad if you want. 

[01:21:05]


Have at least one double size portion, maybe at night. Maybe you're havinsoup and a salad with lunch and a big serving of greens and a fruit bowl for dinner, or a small salad for dinner, but have a serving, maybe with mushrooms or some green vegetable, like asparagus, like broccoli, cabbage, artichokes. String beans, broccoli, have a nice serving of cooked greens every day. And don't forget check off on your list, have some mushrooms or onions every day. You goal is to have half a cup of onions a day, and mushrooms, you just need a little bit, just a small amount every day, just have some every day on a regular basis. They're tremendously protective. So what happens when you do this? Let's look at some people who tried it. Consider tom deck from rochester, new york. Tom was an overweight food addict and most of his life he weighed 365 pounds. He had high blood pressure and was diabetic for over 40 years. And as a result of this severe out of control diabetes, he had a toe amputated. He developed severe nausea and exhaustion and was found to have acute renal failure. He was told he was close to having to be put on dialysis. Then he was in bed watching my show, and tom said it was an answer to his prayers and those of his family, and his friends thought he wasn't gonna make it. Tom lost 56 pounds in the first five months and amazingly never felt deprived. And he says he enjoyed eating more than any time in his life. And he didn't have to count calories and measure food. Remember, he'd been a food addict his whole life. And he never could stick to any diet before. Tom was taking 12 prescription medications daily and injecting himself with insulin four times each day. Soon his type 2 diabetes was gone, so tom said, "my kidney doctor was practically jumping up and down during my last visit. I was a former food addict, and if I can succeed and enjoy dr. Fuhrman's program with all my problems, anybody can. I hope this letter can give help

and hope to the millions of people who are searching for an answer. To wrap it up, all my many health problems have been a thing of the past. And within a month after starting, I have boundless energy. I weigh less than half of what I used to weigh. And my doctors are all saying what has happened is almost a miracle." It's not a miracle. It just demonstrates the power of mod

Narrator: In the late '50s, four young girls from the Detroit projects formed a group that would soon become The Supremes. But Diana Ross was not one of those girls. In the beginning, the group was made up of Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard and two other girls, but when one member dropped out to concentrate on her homework, neighborhood friend Diana Ross was asked to join. When the fourth girl left to get married The Supremes became a trio, Mary, Flo and Diana, the greatest girl group of all time. And here they are on the Ed Sullivan Show, February 20, 1966.

My world is empty without you, babe. ?????? ?????? My world is empty without you, babe. ?????? ?????? For this old world. ?????? ?????? I try to hide my face. ?????? ??????

Narrator: By the mid '60s, the rolling stones were drawing huge crowds wherever they went. During one concert in '66, at The Royal Albert Hall in London, a group of screaming fans rushed the stage. The attack resulted in a ban of rock concerts at that venue. That same year, riotous fans were subdued by tear gas at The Manning Bowl in Massachusetts. That meant the Stones were banned in Boston, but here they are embraced by Ed Sullivan and on their best behavior performing a top hit of '66, "Paint it, Black." 
Ed Sullivan: The rolling stones. 
[Music Playing]. ?????? The Rolling Stones: I see a red door and ?????? ?????? I want it painted black. ?????? ?????? No colors anymore I want them to turn black. ?????? ?????? I see the girls walk by ?????? ?????? dressed in their summer clothes. ?????? ?????? I have to turn my head until my darkness goes. ?????? ?????? I see a line of cars and they're all painted black. ?????? ?????? With flowers and my love, both never to come back. ?????? ?????? I see people turn their heads and quickly look away. ?????? ?????? Like a newborn baby it just happens every day. ?????? ?????? No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue. ?????? ?????? I could not foresee this thing happening to you. ?????? ?????? If I look hard enough into the setting sun. ?????? ?????? My love will laugh with me before the morning comes. ?????? ?????? I see my red door and I want it painted black. ?????? ?????? No colors anymore I want them to turn black. ?????? ?????? I see the girls walk by ?????? ?????? dressed in their summer clothes. ?????? ?????? I have to turn my head until my darkness goes. ?????? ?????? Until it goes. ?????? ?????? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. ?????? ?????? Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, ?????? ?????? hum, hum. ?????? ?????? Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, ?????? ?????? hum, hum. ?????? ??????

'67 was also the year that Johnny Rivers, singer/songwriter born on the Bayou released, "Baby I Need Your Loving." A cover for the Four Tops hit, the song spent three months on the pop charts and peaked at number three. On March 19, 1967 Rivers made it to the Sullivan stage. 
Johnny Rivers: I didn't meet ed until I walked out on stage and did the performance and walked over to him and he said, "Johnny when you get back to Baton Rouge be sure and tell everybody I said hello." And I went, "sure!" I was living in California, but what are you going to say to Ed Sullivan?

Narrator: Plans for the british invasion began in the late '50s. UK bands inspired by US rockers like Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly, slowly began to win airplay in America. And on February 7, 1964 war was officially declared by four lads from Liverpool. It was a mob scene at New York's Kennedy International Airport when The Beatles touched down two days before their debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. The Beatles were used to this kind of chaos at airports and so was Ed. Months earlier Ed was delayed for hours at London's Heathrow Airport by 15,000 Beatle-maniacs. Sullivan decided any band that could cause such a stir, certainly deserved a spot on his show, and The Beatles didn't let him down on that Sunday night in 1964.

Narrator: The british invasion included roughhouse rockers like The Rolling Stones and The Animals, but in the midst of this revolution were Manchester's Herman's Hermits. They recorded carefree, fun-loving singles like, "I'm Into Something Good," and "Wonderful World." The songs were easy to listen to and for Ed, Herman's Hermits were easy to like. 

[00:45:46]


Peter Noone: He loved herman's hermits, the songs were the kind of songs that, our songs were sort of allowable to people's mothers, you know what I mean? It wasn't like get off of my cloud, it was like I woke up this morning feeling fine! 
Narrator: Here are herman's hermits on the Sullivan Show, June 19, 1966.

Narrator: During world war ii, Liverpool was a gateway to Europe for thousands of American troops. But during the '60s, Liverpool served as the launching pad for rock's British invasion. The Beatles led the charge, but their manager Brian Epstein sent a second wave into America with Gerry and The Pacemakers. These lads from Liverpool paid tribute to their hometown and the river that runs through it on April 11, 1965. 
Ed Sullivan: "Ferry 'cross the mersey," Gerry and The Pacemakers. 
Gerry and the Pacemakers: ?????? Life goes on ?????? ?????? day after day. ?????? ?????? Hearts torn in every way. ?????? ?????? So ferry 'cross the Mersey. ?????? ?????? 'Cause this land's the place I love. ?????? ?????? And here I'll stay. ?????? ?????? People they rush everywhere. ?????? ?????? Each with their own secret care. ?????? ! ??????

Narrator: In 1967 america fell head over heels for the movie, "To Sir With Love." It starred the dashing, Sidney Poitier and the Scottish lass named Marie McDonald McLaughlin Lawrie, better known as pop singer, Lulu. Director James Clavell saw Lulu open for The Beach Boys and gave her a big part in the movie, but as filming began, Clavell was so impressed by the lovely Lulu, he expanded her role, she even sang the movie's theme song. On October 22, 1967 just one day after the theme hit number one, Lulu sang "To Sir With Love," for Ed Sullivan. 
Ed Sullivan: Now here's the cute youngster Lulu in Sidney Poitier's current box office smash singing the title song and her first great hit "To Sir With Love," here is Lulu! 
[Music Playing]. ?????? Lulu: Those schoolgirl days of telling tales. ?????? ?????? And biting nails are gone. ?????? ?????? But in my mind, ?????? ?????? I know they will still live on and on. ?????? ?????? But how do you thank someone. ?????? ?????? Who has taken you from crayons to perfume? ?????? ?????? It isn't easy, but I'll try. ?????? ?????? If you wanted to the stars. ?????? ?????? I would write across the sky in letters. ?????? ?????? That would soar a thousand feet high. ?????? ?????? To Sir, with love. ?????? ?????? The time has come for closing books. ?????? ?????? And long last looks must end. ?????? ?????? And as I leave ?????? ?????? I know that I am leaving my best friend. ?????? ??????

Narrator: As the beatles and the stones were gaining ground in America another band from England was about the break out, but these guys from New Castle were different, they were gritty with a savage sound, they were The Animals. Fans went crazy for The Animals brand of urban blues, the audiences got so frantic they often forced the band to run for cover. After his Sullivan gigs, lead singer Eric Burdon had to escape uptown to Harlem, haven to the rhythm and blues music he loved. 
Eric Burdon: I would make a run for the, um, for a taxi, jump into a taxi, kids would pile into their Daddy's GTOs and T-Birds, the further I got uptown you know, they'd just taper off because Harlem was, was a no go, it was the end of the line. And so in Harlem I felt, I felt a sense of freedom. 
Narrator: Here are the animals driving the crowd wild on Ed Sullivan, August 14, 1966.

Narrator: As soon as tom jones was introduced to the world, comparisons to Elvis Presley began. Like Elvis, he had a raw hot blooded sexuality that drove women wild. It was so powerful in fact, that his female fans soon began a concert ritual. The tradition began during a particularly hot concert when one of his female fans actually removed her underwear and tossd them up to him. Tom, so the story goes, nonchalantly picked up the undergarments, wiped his sweaty brow with them, smiled and then tossed them back into the frenzied crowd. Here's Tom Jones in 1965 trying his luck on the Sullivan stage. 

[00:59:12]


Ed Sullivan: Richard burton was the first Welsh start to appear on our stage. He was followed by the Royal Welsh Choir, now here from Wales singing his new hit record, "It's Not Unusual," Welshman Tom Jones. 
Tom Jones: It's not unusual to be loved by anyone. It's not unusual to have fun with anyone. But when I see you hanging about with anyone. It's not unusual to see me cry. I wanna' die. It's not unusual to go out at any time. But when I see you out and about it's such a crime. If you should ever want to be loved by anyone. It's not unusual it happens every day. No matter what you say. You find it happens all the time. Love will never do. What you want it to. Why can't this crazy love be mine. 
[Music Playing]. 
Tom Jones: It's not unusual, to be mad with anyone. It's not unusual, to be sad with anyone. But if I ever find that you've changed at anytime. It's not unusual to find out I'm in love with you, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Narrator: In 1964 the beatles were the most wanted men in the world. Their second album was on top of the charts. Their movie "Hard Day's Night," had teenage girls in a tizzy. And their appearance on the Ed Sullivan show blasted them into millions of American living rooms. But contrary to popular belief, the Beatles did not make their American TV debut on Ed's show. One month before the Beatles gig on Sullivan, rival talk show host Jack Par pulled a fast one, and aired filmed footage of, "The Fab 4." Even so, when the mop tops finally made it to the Ed Sullivan Theater, they were the hottest ticket in town. CBS fielded 50,000 requests for just 728 seats. Although Ed hated being scooped by Par, he saved one of those precious seats for Jack's teenage daughter Randy. Here are the world's most famous foursome casting their spell over Randy and the rest of America on February 9th, 1964. 
The Beatles: ?????? She loves you, ?????? ?????? yeah, yeah, yeah. ?????? ?????? She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah. ?????? ?????? She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. ?????? ?????? You think you lost your love. ?????? ?????? Well, I saw her yesterday. ?????? ?????? It's you she's thinking of. ?????? ?????? And she told me what to say. ?????? ?????? She says she loves you. ?????? ?????? And you know that can't be bad. ?????? ?????? Yes, she loves you. ?????? ?????? And you know you should be glad. ?????? ?????? Woo! ?????? ?????? She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah. ?????? ?????? She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah. ?????? ?????? With a love like that. ?????? ?????? You know you should be glad. ?????? ?????? You know it's up to you. ?????? ?????? I think it's only fair. ?????? ?????? Pride can hurt you, too. ?????? ?????? Apologize to her. ?????? ?????? Because she loves you. ?????? ?????? And you know that can't be bad. ?????? ?????? Yes, she loves you. ?????? ?????? And you know you should be glad. ?????? ?????? Woo! ?????? ?????? She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah. ?????? ??????

TJ Lubinsky: An incredible collection you really have to have, something you've got to share with your kids and your grandkids and show them what it was like to experience real music, you're not hearing songs like this anymore, anywhere, and we've got them archived and preserved right here on your public television station. 4-DVDs this is the amazing, incredible opportunity for you to support the station, get onboard, pick up the phone, however you can do that, dial in, $150 you can choose this great set and it's got great tunes like The Tops doing "It's The Same Old Song," ?????? sugarpie honey bunch,?????? "Can't Help Myself." Sonny and Cher with "I've Got You Babe," Herman's Hermits and yes, the ever favorite, "I'm Henry The Eighth I Am, I am." #!OK, now Jersey, I'm a Jersey guy so to me the ultimate Jersey guy is Frankie Valli of course The Four Seasons and they're performing the all time, "Let's Hang On."

Some great songs you just don't hear too much anymore like you remember Oliver who did "Jean," that's kind of new, the Broadway stuff is on there, you've got CCR, their rendition of "Proud Mary," is on this collection. Supremes, when they kind of um, um became a little more real about life, lost the glamour and the glitz for their interpretation of "Love Child," on The Ed Sullivan Show, it was a real shocking difference when they performed "Love Child," from the way we'd always seen them with the beautiful gowns and still a class act but much more real to what was happening in the world around them. As the culture was changing, as life was changing in the later 60s and the realities of what was happening with of course Martin Luther King and the Kennedy's and where we were, the challenges, the social challenges of life and you see that reflected as the music changes and, and that's all part of this collection as well.

Still it was banned by several radio stations. On December 12th, 1965 The Byrds quoted a safer source, the Bibles book of Ecclesiastes, with "Turn Turn Turn."

Narrator: The beach boys earliest music was about blondes, boards, baggies and riding a curl. But of the five members of the Southern California band only one experienced what it was really like to catch a wave and be sitting on top of the world, drummer Dennis Wilson. The only thing the other Beach Boys knew how to do was wipeout. Riding the charts was a different story. On the Fourth of July 1964 the All-American boys rocketed to number one with, "I Get Around." Holding a beachhead against the British invasion on America's birthday. And several months later on September, 27th; they got around to the Ed Sullivan Show.

And the "A-Side" was a tribute to a Mississippi Riverboat. On March 9th, 1969 Creedence Clearwater Revival took the Sullivan audience for a short trip up the "Big Muddy" when they performed "Proud Mary."

Narrator: In 1969 a broadway musical called, "Hair" created a cultural phenomenon. It not only stunned America with its drug references and nudity; "Hair" also astonished America with the incredible success of its music. Credit much of that success to this group, The Fifth Dimension. On May 18th, 1969 The Fifth Dimension sang a medley from "Hair." A single that spent a month and a half atop the pop charts and sold 2 million copies in only 3 months. 
Ed Sullivan: Here again singing the hit song from their latest album. The Age of Aquarius, that's the right note. The Fifth Dimension! 
[Music Playing]. 
The Fifth Dimension: ?????? When the moon ?????? is in the seventh house. And Jupiter aligns with Mars. And peace will guide the planets. And love will steer the stars. This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius, age of Aquarius. Aquarius. Aquarius. Harmony and understanding, sympathy and trust abounding. No more falsehoods or derisions. Golden living dreams of visions. Mystic crystal revelation. And the mind's true liberation. Aquarius. Aquarius.

TJ Lubinsky inviting you to join us, pick up the phone, time is running out we need to hear from you right now so that we can continue to preserve all of the great music and the moments of the 1960s, The Ed Sullivan Show, this particular segment we're watching great, great performances like, "Turn, Turn, Turn," poignant, important part, vital part of life with The Birds, "She'd Rather Be With Me," The Turtles with Howard and of course Mark right there, Friends of Distinction, I can dig it, she can dig it, we can dig it together and uh, that's so great. "I Get Around," with The Beach Boys in their prime, look at those guys right? Part of the collection you will have when you call and support the station right now. "Proud Mary," CCR and I love The Fifth Dimension, Billy and Florence of course the great and gorgeous Marilyn McCoo, Big Ron and Lamonte this is just a group that had so much spiritual harmony and it's great to experience this spirit in that moment in time seeing them kind of fly away into the stars and thinking of the new day reminds me of what PBS can bring us and bring you in your world. We have endless possibilities for great programming that helps you inspire and helps to create wonderful moments where you can think and you can be inspired to inspire your grandchildren and your children, it all happens right here. We've got great ways to say thank you either a 4-DVD set or a great 6-CD set original hits by the original artists. $250 put that all together it's a great Ed Sullivan member package that will come your way, but this is our last few moments to tell you about the importance of getting in, getting onboard and helping us soar, soar to great new heights, right here on Pbs.

Denise Richardson: Boy, what a surprise, Jim Brown managed the Friends of Distinction, "Grazing in the Grass," was my very favorite song and like that dancer I was like all over the place with that song. What's not surprising though is to hear that story told here on public television. I think the Four Seasons sang it best and they sang, "Let's Hang On." Let's hang on to what we've got, cultivated interests in something new such as science, nature, art or self-improvement, but there's a cost involved in continuing to hang on to what we've got and to continue to provide the quality programming you've become very used to. We just can't produce specials like this without your help. Your contribution, however small, however large, now helps pay the cost of producing music specials such as this for you and your family to enjoy. So, if you like what you're seeing and you want more of it, go to your phone right now with your gift of financial support and just imagine this, everyone watching right now, going to the phones, picking it up, making a donation. It can happen; all you have to do is do it. 
TJ Lubinsky: During this last pledge break, last opportunity, thinking of the incredible performances that are here part of this 4-DVD collection, this package, songs like "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head," 1970, um, BJ Thomas and of course with the raincloud, it's sort of raining on him right there on The Ed Sullivan Show stage, uh, and these moments, "One Last Bell to Answer" which is just one of those songs with the one last egg to fry, you feel the emotion so much, feel these songs, you feel this music, uh, The Supremes and "Someday We'll Be Together," and the melancholy, sadness of the time that was together, the joy that we've all had together, this wonderful snapshot of the great times of your life is embedded in this music, it's part of this music, it is part of the memory of our lives, the soundtrack of our lives and when you join for this collection you'll have those moments to go back to, just like your own personal time machine things like Elvis Presley, Janis Joplin who you know we lost way too early. Same with Buddy Holly, uh, Mamas and Papas I mean wow, Michelle has been such a great supporter for us and what we're doing with the show, Ed Sullivan and or My Music Series here on PBS but to think that uh, Papa John and Denny and Cass are, are up above right now, right? These moments are so incredible to cherish, to have, to own, Karen Carpenter with "We've Only Just Begun," and The Beatles, The Beatles! Look at the four guys themselves doing their version of "Twist and Shout," it's just incredible, a great opportunity, that's $150 or at $150 you can choose 6-CDs original recordings by the original artists, the great sounds of the 1960s will come your way. Rascals doing "A Beautiful Morning," uh, Percy Sledge, "When A Man Loves A Woman," there's nothing in life that she can see or do wrong and if you try to talk to her about it forget it because loving eyes can never see, they're always blind, Percy doing his thing, right? "Mustang Sally," great party sound with the very wicked Mr. Wilson Pickett, "Knock on Wood," knock, knock, knock on wood, that's Eddie Floyd on there, great tunes by The Association, original recordings by Aretha Frankin, Sonny and Cher, Tommy James and The Shondells, Monkeys are on here, Grass Roots are on here, Spanky and Our Gang, great, great tunes, Cowsills, it's all part of this great extension of the program, PBS brings back the great moments puts you right into the action, center stage as if you were in that Ed Sullivan audience and now you're able to experience this again any time you want, the extension of the program through the music, through the CDs, through the DVDs, this is the second, the opportunity that we need to hear from you and these are the great thank you gifts in the last membership opportunity for you to pick up the phone and join us right now and we'll say wow, thank you, thank you, call.

TJ Lubinsky: How precious time is huh? Ticking down so fast. Who knew, who knew that we'd be here remembering these glorious days so many years after the fact when you lived them, you experienced them, you changed the world. You changed the world. Think about all the things that have happened in your life and your life's experiences and how you had hoped to achieve and how you hoped to build a better world around us for future generations and not sort of being the older generation. Well once 60, 65 hits, kicking back into dotage, more life, beginning its second life, beginning for you, totally different approach to how we live today, how you live today and those values that you've passed on to your children and their children, a new generation. And as these new generations come up understand that it's exposure, we can only truly learn where we're going until we've understood where we've been and that's what's so great, these last few moments of this incredible archiving effort. The last opportunity, last pledge break, just down to our last minute or so and the 4-DVD set will be yours, great songs like 1969 with "The Worst That Can Happen," great tune, originally of course by The Fifth Dimension, Johnny Maestro heard that, took it, made it its own and just became a great inspirational song for all of us, having a group as big as The Brooklyn Bridge and that's why they named themselves that after he reformed The Crests. The Fifth Dimension, "Aquarius," let the sunshine in, what more gospel or inspiration can there be? Your darkest day, no matter how dark it is, right, you can walk forward because the sunshine is going to shine in your life and that is just such a great moment on PBS to experience that with these guys, to see it, to feel it. Songs in a 500 channel universe that are no longer on television, there's no one running these programs like this, just all the Rock and Roll acts we've put together for you on PBS, there's no one else out there that's playing the songs on radio, I mean remember what the radio was when we first heard these things? May have been a transistor, may have been in your car, wherever you were, these were songs that were continually being played and now you can't find them on the radio, in fact many generations today say, "Well, what's the radio? What, what, what, a radio, what?" You know because it's all the latest "I" invention, the iphone, the ipad, whatever the, not the same experience as when you heard these songs and were blasting it out and you know fooling around as a kid, all of these experiences that are part of your life, right? There here, we've got to share them and we've got to preserve them and we do that in these last few seconds with your pledge, $150 you can choose original CDs by the original artists or the DVD set. The CDs are terrific and at $250 you'll see this entire member collection will come your way, but this is your last opportunity for great things like Eddie Holman singing "Hey There Lonely Girl," "Incense and Peppermints," great 60s uh, pure 60s tune right there by the Strawberry Alarm Clock. Sergio Mendez and Brazil '66, Diana Ross and The Supremes, "I'm Gonna Make You Love Me," great tune by them and then as that list goes down you're getting tunes like, kind of the carefree, flower power, Spanky and Our Gang stuff "Lazy Day," "Sooner or Later," love is gonna get you, that's the Grass Roots, "A Sign of the Times," with Petula Clark, "The Letter," with The Box Tops, "You Didn't Have To Be So Nice," with the Lovin' Spoonful. Carefree soundsbut observational sounds when it comes to folk rock, Motown, soul, all here, incredible history, thank you for taking the opportunity to consider this, understand whatever it is that you can help, help in is effort we all come together, we all help each other, we're all better for this, and we thank you for every single phone call that's happened, we still have time for yours if you haven't done that.

>>> "Outfront" next, protest erupt in egypt. Thousands demonstrating against a controversial grab for power by mohammed morsi. Many saying he's acting like a modern day pharaoh. A big republican turns his back on the grover norquist tax pledge. Is the gop preparing to give in to the president?Usands of people packing into stores today. Watch your wallet. We'll tell you how the shopping season is really adding up. Let's go "outfront." 
>>> Good evening. I'm tom foreman. Egypt erupts. Thousands of angry egyptians have been protesting in opposition to a controversial power grabby egypt's president. Clashes with police who fired tear gas into the crowds. The unrest began after he issued a series of orders which allow him to run the country unchecked until a new constitution is written. Morsi says his actions are meant to speed up reform and achieve political and social stability. 
>> Translator: I have said beforened I repeat again, that i would never use a legislation against individuals, parties, men, women or muslims or christians for personal gains and to settlscores. 
>> Now, this is all very problematic for the white house. Morsi's government for helping broker a cease fire between israel and gaza. Today, the u.S. State department expressed concern over the was to ensure power would not be overly concentrated in the hands of any one person or institution. He was elected in june with nearly 52% of the vote, but thousands are calling for his removal today as they stormed the headquarters of one of his chief support groups. The crowd then marched on to tahrir square, chanting birth of tonight. What's the situation right now? 

[00:02:47]


>> Reporter: Well, tom, it's 2:00 a.M. Now in cairo and the protests are still going on. We're still seeing clashes in and around tahrir square between the protesters and the police. We're seeing a range of things cocktails, we've seen tear gas. There are reports of police shooting into the air to scare off protesters. This is a very intense scene we've seen. We haven't seen anything like this really since a year ago when we saw clashes, when we saw dozens of people killed. This has really been the most intense set of clashes since then and all these protesters are angry about that power grab you were describing where president morsi really has no one overseeing him. The judiciary, he has pushed that aside. Tomorrow, we're going to be watching closely, also, the judiciaries said they might strike basically grinding the whole country's court system to a halt in supporters of president morsi out in the streets today. We saw hundreds of people at the presidenti this is the only way to move the country forward. But right now, tonight in egypt, it's very, very, very devicive. 
>> Ian, one more question here. Der group tomorrow. Do you have any sense how much staying power this group has? We see movements rise up in various countries and burn out after 48 hours and move on. Any sense about this one? 
>> Reporter: It's a good question. We've seen protests like this go to tahrir square demanding different things throughout, really since the revolution last year began. And that's the question. We see tenlts going up in tahrir square, giving it a ok like this is going to be a prolonged demonstration. Even we're still seeing hundreds, if not thousands of people still in and around the square at 2:00 a.M.Ergized, but as the week progresses and people have to go back to work, will they stay in the square demanding that there is some change that morsi steps back on his declaration, that' but right now, it looks like it is going to go ahead and have that sort of staying power. 

[00:05:17]


>> Thanks so much for joining us there in cairo. I don't know you'll keep us up to date. We want to bring you more guests now. Josh stacker, he's met and spoken be mohammed morsi more than a dozen times, affiliate with the woodrow wilson international center. Colletti, let me start with you. Do you have a sense of this having lasting power? Is this a deep movement or is this a shallow movement? 
>> Well, it's a very good question. Of course, we have seen many times over the last 20 months or so where various groups have rallied in and around tahrir square with various demands. Seeing something, there's something is a little bit different in that they are speaking in a much more unified voice. T the opposition, the nonislamist opposition is for the first time in a very long time, at least reading from the same sheet of music. Whether that will last I think is the question. 
>> Briefly, if you could, what are the actual powers that the president has taken unto himself? 
>> Well, it's more like what powers hasn't he undertaken? He has full executive authority. He has also full legislative authority and he's essentially neutralized the third branch, which is the judiciary. So they are now unable to challenge any of his decisions. And this is far more sweeping than anything that the previous military rulers had done. Or that mubarak himself had done, so I think there is a lot of well placed skepticism about this sort of an action. 
>> Josh, some of the protesters there are basically saying that what they fear is that at this moment, we're watching the rise of a new dictator ship. Is that just high perbole or a legitimate concern? 

[00:07:21]


>> I think it's a legitimate concern. I think in many respects, when a prosecutor takes the kind of power and says it's temporary, the kind of injection that goes into that office is very difficult to kind of parse out in say six or eight months and there's a new constitution. 
>> Josh, let me ask you about the timing of this whole thing. Is your impression of this is sheer coincidence that he made this power grab because certainly, the white house has to be fearing. He stood alongside us. He looked like he was with us, like he had our backing and now, he lunges for all this power and it makes the u.S. Look complicit! This plan wasn't just hatched the morning after president morsi negotiated the cease fire between hamas and israel, so i really think that you know, they've been sitting and waiting to launch this as a you know, attempt. Because there's a lot of things going on. There's a lot of challenges to the legal, you know, basis of the muslim brotherhood. There's lots of, the fact that there's been virtually no internal civilian or military security sector reform. The fact that you know, there's a court ruling in the drawer of the supreme constitutional court that could disban the assembly, so I think that was meant to preempt a lot of those. Not to mention egypt just signed a $4.8 billion agreement with the international monery fund and I believe that president morsi feels like he needs to be unaccountable as they undergo these very intense neo liberal economic adjustments. 
>> Thanks very much for being here. Obviously, it's a tense situation over there and a very important situation that will bear watching throughout this weekend. Cnn will stay right on it. Still "outfront," is this the return of the cave men? Some republicans are seeing signs that maybe their leaders are about to cave on promises not to raise taxes. Reports that general petraeus told members of his staff to share military reports and other sensitive documents with his mistress, paula broadwell, and israeli troops open fire on a crowd killing at least one palestinian. What does this mean for the cease fire? Stay with us. Tonight our guest, thomas sargent. Nobel laureate in economics, and one of the most cited economists in the world. Professor sargent, can you tell me what cd rates will be in two years? No. If he can't, no one can. That's why ally has a raise your rate cd. Ally bank. Your money needs an ally. ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ??????

>>> Our second story "outfront," republicans turning their backs on the norquist pledge not to raise taxes. Says he does not care that he signed pledge years ago. He's going to do what he feels is right. Here's what he said earlier on situation room. Listen. 
>> The commitment he made to the people of georgia was not to me. It was a written commitment to the people of georgia that he would go to washington to reduce government spending and reform government, not raise taxes. If he wants to change his mind and become a tax increaser so we don't have to reform government, he needs to have that conversation with the people of georgia. 

[00:13:11]


>> Douglas holt eakin and ethan poll lack, they join us right now to talk it over. Douglas, what do you think here? Is this smart repositions by some republicans out there or is this a civil war within the party? 
>> I think this is politics. The pledge has been a political document and you know, over the years, it did have the virtue of focusing the attention on the spending side. In the past 30 years, we've seen taxes go up, down and sideways, but we've never seen a sustained effort of spending and the kind of entitlement reforms this moment's going to require. 
>> Now, ethan, I know you worked with the obama camp for a while. There's a notion in this that both sides were aware that in all likelihood, taxes are probably going to have to go up across the board simply to deal with the deficit and everything else out there, so if you're a democrat, are you happy or unhappy because once that train starts rolling, it could hit l middle class, which the democrats warn they won't touch. 
>> I mean, I'm definitely happy about it. It's thanksgiving and I'm very thankful right now for millions of americans who came out on november 6th and declared loudly that the tax reform in particular making especially the highest income americans, you know, actually paying their fair share of taxes. That that's a priority and something that should be pursued in context of the fiscal cliff. The train is rolling and I think it's nice to see even some republicans now eventually realizing that taxes in particular tax fairness, does need to be a substantial part of this fiscal debate. 
>> But you just skated around my question, which is that if you're going to have real tax reform, almost every economist says the middle class is going to pay more, too. How are democrats going to handle that? 
>> I think the first thing you need to do is make sure the higher income households pay their share. Comprehensive tax reform, where we can broaden the base and make sure we are both getting the revenue we need, but at the same time, the progressiveivity we need to make sure the middle class are still strong. The first step, the last decade, average family is not getting any type of raise when adjusted for inflation and you've seen the income of the highest income americans skyrocket. So the first thing we need to do is solve that problem, then we can have a broader conversation. 

[00:15:43]


>> Everybody in the world will vote for a tax for the other guy, but not for themselves. When you hear ethan say that, the democratic position on that, even as republicans try to reposition, to see an overall reposition of washington. 
>> Well, I think we have two very different problems. One is between now and the end of the year when we see sharp spending increases that come automatically, which are a genuine threat. What we need the leadership to do is to get us to the spring of 2013 safely and then in spring of 2013, we're going to have to have some sort of large deal on the debt. The level is too high. The growth rates are unsustainable. The international ratings community has said we have to see something happen and in doing that, we're finally going to see something that's gone for 30 years end. Republicans for 30 years have said we're not raising taxes unless you fix those entitlement programs. They're dangerous to our future. The democrats have said we're not until you raise taxes. Both sides are going to have to make a deal in the spring and it's going to involve everybody. 
>> Let me ask you this, douglas. Norquist said a number of times in defense of his position, look, what's wrong with saying to a politician, when you want my vote and you make a promise, you should keep that promise. What's wrong with saying that to either side about any topic? 
>> So, I think that there's nothing wrong with that. This is about making political commitments, something politicians have to and should do. My own preference is not written pledges, but in fact, people who say this is what I believe and follow through on it. I think one thing it did do is focus its attention, which is still under discussed. We have an enormous spending problem, it's about entitlement problem. What the president was forced some recognition that the threshold decision is to spend the money. 

[00:17:55]


>> Ethan, your reaction to this whole idea that norquist keeps saying, it's about taxes for him, but also about politicians being honest. You should mean what you say and pursue it in that fashion. What do you think? 
>> Sure, I have nothing against pledges politics make to voters. I have a problem when they're pledging bad policy. If you look at the fiscal cliff, there's a lot of bad policy, particularly on the side of the bush tax cuts. Particularly for those on the higher end that cost a lot of money, that don't provide a will the of benefit to the economy. When tackling the fiscal cliff, we should ask ourselves, which are the most ineffective things. 
>> Keep thinking, guys, that down the line here, the chorus over and over is going to be we all pay more and all get less. Thanks for being here. We appreciate it. 
>>> Thousands of people paid a lot to do cramming into stores everywhere. You might even be watching this on a new tv, but retailers needed more than hype. They needed red hot cash registers on this black friday. We'll tell you how sales added up today because a lot of jobs are counting on it. In just a few weeks after mitt romney's defeat, the gop is already looking forward to 2016. Say it ain't so and there's another bush on the horizon.

>>> our ird story, a mad dash for black friday. Thousands of people rushed into stores aross the country today. Look at them. They're looking for black friday sales while some shoppers didn't actually have to wait until friday. Some stores like target, toys "r" us and walmart offered their events on thanksgiving day itself. So did these big promotions actually work? Retail analyst dana tellsy is out there reading the tea leaves. Did you go shopping? 
>> Of course I did. Yesterday, also. 
>> What did you get for me? 
>> You know what, it's not december 25th yet. Keep the suspense going. 
>> So, was this a good start, a bad start? 
>> I think it was a decent start. Since there's more hours that retailers are open, the traffic is extended over longer period of time. I think it was decent. I think the level of promotions was the same as last year, but black friday is a game for retailers to gain market share and that's what they did this season. 
>> And this is a long shopping season, right? From this black friday to actually christmas day, little bit lopger than usual. 
>> It's typically between 26 and 32 days. It's 32 days this year. Christmas is on a tuesday, so we have that weekend in order to be able to spend the last minute gifts and that's important to deliver holiday season gains that could be better than expected. 
>> So, walmart claims they had their best ever black friday event saying that in four hours last nigh, they processed almost 5,000 items per second. Now, that sounds like a lot, but walmart is huge. Does that sort of sales level indicate to you that really this is a great season or you know, we're kind of holding our own? 
>> I think holding their own. They played it to win. They showed the great ads, consumers responded. If there's one thing that the american consumer knows how to react to, it's promotions and a deal. 

[00:25:20]


>> The national retail federation predicts that the increase in holiday sales will be 4.1%. Why is it smaller this year? 
>> Number one, you're going up against tougher comparisons. You can't always best your best numbers yet and two, retailers ordered less inventory this year than in the past. If there's one thing retailers want to do, they want to come out of the holiday season with a profitable season and that's why a smaller increase this year than last year, but it's not all said until it's done and that's december 25th and even january. 40% of holiday sales take place in the ten days before christmas, so keep a few extra bucks in your wallet. Thanks for being here. Good shopping to you. 
>> You, too. 
>> Thanks. Still "outfront", new developments in the petraeus sex scandal. Reports today that he may have offered staffers the opportunity to share sensitive documents with his mistress.

>>> welcome back to the second half of "outfront" where we start the second half of our show with stories that we care about d focus on our own reporting from the front lines. First, to massachusetts, where a gas leak turned into a large explosion in downtown springfield. The blast was caught on camera this evening. Look at that. We're told the ball of fire levelled at least one building and sent glass and debris flying through the air. They're treating eight people for injuries, but no one's in critical condition. Springfield is about 90 miles west of boston. 
>>> Tonight, 12 people remain in serious condition after yesterday's massive crash on a texas highway. The highway patrol tells us more than 100 vehicles were involved in a pileup on a foggy interstate near beaumont. The crash killed two people. A couple on their way to a gambling trip. 
>> My dad and i, we worked together, we had a good relationship and we had, got to spend time together golfing and fishing and I'm so thankful for that now. My parents are wonderful, loving people. All who knew them, knew that and they'll be sorely missed. 
>> Witnesses tell our local affiliate the dense fog made it impossible to see. 
>>> Good news, in new york, the gas rationing program put in place in the days after superstorm sandy, the rationings ends tomorrow. 85% of the gas stags are now running. Only 25% were openeded just two weeks ago. New jersey and long island stopped rationing gas last week. 
>>> Jailed russian punk musician is now in solitary confinement according to a statement from her lawyer, she was moved to a single prison cell for her own protection because of conflict with other inmates. She and two other members of the band pussyriot were convicted. The musicians are currently serving two-year prison sentences. 

[00:32:24]


>>> It's been 477 days since the u.S. Lost its top credit rating. It was a good day for stocks. All three of the major indices rose by more than 1%. 
>>> Our fourth story "outfront," unraveling the petraeus scandal. It just goes on and on. According to a law enforcement firm, federal agents are investigating whether david petraeus instructed members of his staff to share military documents with his biographer turned lover, paula broadwell. Broadwell visited petraeus on more than one occasion while he was running the war in afghanistan and according to former staff members, she would often ask for records petraeus claimed he wanted her to have. The question, did broadwell have his permission to obtain documents. Fran and ron, author of the secrets of the fbi. Fran, a really basic question here. If you just walk up to someone on a staff and say, hey, the general would like me to have classified documents, is that all there is to it? Would they likely hand them over on that? 
>> No, but you have to understand the military culture. I visited petraeus in afghanistan on business and he walks into a briefing, he speaks to you about sensitive military matters, the staff sees that, there's a military culture and so, if you then ask for a document and suggest that the general has offered it to you in some way or sanctioned your having it, it's very difficult for a subordinate military member to either question the general's guest or the general himself about that. And so, it's not really clear, did petraeus actually direct that she could have these documents? Did he communicate with his subordinate soldiers and command? We don't know that so it remains unclear about the circumstances. 

[00:34:26]


>> So, ron, if it's a staff member who sees this sort of relationship or thinks they see such a relationship and they hand over information, is just the staff member in trouble or does this trickle up to the general as well? 
>> No, I think in the end, they will find in investigating this, that petraeus did issue instructions. I just don't think staff members would be giving up classified information just because they see that he has a close relationship with paula. So, I think eventually, the facts will come out and it will go to petraeus and you know, clearly has bad judgment. We saw that with his affair and I think in this case, the same thing. 
>> Paula broadwell has been cooperating with the fbi in this whole thing. They've got her computers, that sort of thing. Isn't this the sort of information they would have almost immediately when they have this level of cooperation or is this something that would just come out through parts of an investigation? Why are we hearing about it now? 
>> Well, they really you know apparently, purposefully delay this investigation until after the election and that's when they finally did the search. I got a call on october 10th from a long time fbi source telling me about the investigation and telling me that this would not go down until after the election and sure enough, that's what happened. I was still working on the story and then when the resignation was announced, I was able to do a story within an hour saying that an fbi investigation was behind the resignation, which would not come out, but you know, if you just look at the dates, it's obvious that it was time to come out after the election. The day after the election is when the fbi finally informed clapper, the dni and then supposedly president obama was told. I doubt that. I think he was told before by eric holder. But the really serious thing in my mind is this lag time of many months during which petraeus was allowed to stay in office even though the fbi knew he was having this affair. When he could have been compromised, could have been blackmailed by the russian foreign intelligence service and apparently, it was a political decision. That's what really has agents furious. 

[00:36:52]


>> I know there's a lot of edition, too, about the timeline of it and how much political elements were or were not involved, but I want to go back to fran with a question here. If somebody did this, if they pass on this information and they're found out, would that person likely be prosecuted even if told by general petraeus to do this? 
>> There are a couple of questions here that I think we have to parse out, right,ing so we don't know whether or not the general told them, but what an injustice it would be if you prosed the subordinate military officer for passing a classified document if done at the direction of the general. They believed that the initial classified information that came across was low level classified information, whatever that that is. 
>> You and I were talking earlier and how there's classified information, then there's classified information. Meaning there is some classifieded information, just because somebody said let's make it classified. It's not that important. That's right and the investigators we've spoken to have suggested that's what they found. They found more material in the search of broadwell's home. She was cooperating with the fbi and that's led them to really want to find out. In interviews of both broadwell and petraeus, both deny he provided the information. We don't know what she said about who did in fact provide it to her or what the general's involvement is, but if it is at the general's election, then it seems to me that the general and whoever the subordinate is would be in harm's way, if you will, for a prosecution. 
>> Ron, where do you think we are in this investigation? Are we getting near the end where someone's going to say here's the bulk of what we know? Are we still in the middle, the end? Where are we? 
>> Clearly, this keeps on unraveling. I think what we're going so see next is the result of the house and senate committee investigations as to why they were not informed because I know on a regular basis, the fbi informs those committees or at least the two top ranking people on those committees of much less sensitive investigations than this and yet they didn't tell them about this until after the election, so they're going to get the facts. They're going to investigate the timing, including why it took so long to actually bring this to a close. And why petraeus is allowed to stay in office that long because they can call for example, the agents on the case, they can get the real facts and get the records. 

[00:39:38]


>> We're going to have to move on because we're running out of time, but ron, thanks so much for coming in. Fran, as always, good to have you here. I hope you had nice thanks givings. Thank you for joining us the day after.

>>> We're back with tonight's outer circle where we reach out to our sources around the world. First to the border of israel and gaza. Where israeli troops opened fire on a crowd killing at least one palestinian. Hamas is says the crowd was formers going to work. Israel claims the people were rioters. Sara sidner has more. 
>> Well, tom, the palestinian authority has already come out with a statement saying they believe this has broken the cease fire, but you have to remember that it is hamas that is in control right now in gaza and that israel has not responded to this. This is an incident where hamas says that there were 25 people injured. One person killed when israeli soldiers opened fire on farmer, however, the israeli military having a very different take on what happened. They say they were groups of men trying to go under the fence and they fired a warning shot in the air and when not heeded, they fired at their leg. The israeli military has not confirmed whether or not someone died or any of the injuries, but at this point, I think what we're not hearing from hamas and israel, the cease fire still holds and that's what a lot of civilians on either side are really hoping, but really in the end, they're hoping for a permanent solution. Tom? 

[00:45:11]


>> Moving on to the democratic republic of congo, where forces seem to be no match for a group known as m 23. The rebels are trying to topple the government by gaining control of the entire country. david McKenzie is in nairobi and I asked him what the rebels were planning next. 
>> They're pushing on to new front lines after they took the key town. Thousands of civilians have fled the scene. More than 100,000 people are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. Comes after the rebels took the city this week. Right now, there are moves to go to the negotiating table. The rebel leader has been summoned to uganda with talks, but they're worried that this bloody situation could get even worse. Tom? 
>> Our fifth story "outfront." 
>> They're pushing on to new front lines after they took the key town. Thousands of civilians have fled the scene. More than 100,000 people are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. Comes after the rebels took the city this week. Right now, there are moves to go to the negotiating table. The rebel leader has been summoned to uganda with talks, but they're worried that this bloody situation could get even worse. Tom? 
>> Our fifth story "outfront." The election is barely behind us, but speculation is already shifting to who will be running in the next cycle. Can you stand it? I can't. One name is jeb bush. That's right. The brother of president george w. Bush. Part of the bush political dynasty. Maria cardona joins us now along with rion salam. Is jeb bush really going to run? 
>> Well, it's not ctear right now. But I'll say this. Jeb bush is widely regarded as a tremendously effective political operator and having been a successful governor of florida. The truth is, that had his name been smith instead of bush, i think a lot of people would have been wondering why he didn't run this time around. I think he's a formidable competitor. 
>> You bring up a really good point here. If you're a democrat, you're saying sure, give us another bush to run against because we think the bush name is somewhat poison right now, maria, but, but, jeb bush is fluent in spanish. He's married to a woman who grew up in mexico. He has strong ties in a big state with a big latino vote. This is the kind of guy that could put democrats on the defensive. 

[00:47:30]


>> He would give us a whole lot more competition than mitt romney did, but that's not saying much. Jeb bush absolutely I think is a tremendous leader when it comes to the issues that are important to latinos for example, immigration and education. He's got a very good name i.D. Among latino voter he does have a mexican wife, is fluent in spanish. Is very comfortable, the same way his brother is, around latinos. But I think the problem for jeb bush is absolutely his name sake. His legacy. And you know, I know that a lot of people might be sick of legacies and people are talking about hillary clinton in 2016, but if it is, for example, hillary clinton and jeb bush in 2016, a lot of voters are going to think back to the last bush and the last clinton and make a comparison and that's not a comparison that jeb bush will win. 
>> Just because I can't stand talking about 2016 yet. Let's talk about the senate race in 2014. senators McConnell, graham, cornyn, chambliss are thought to be vulnerable to the tea party. Republicans have to sort this out. How much they're going to lean more toward the base or more toward the fiscal conservatives in the tea party or are they going to go more toward the middle and in the end can they get the senate back? 
>> Well, I think getting the is that the back is going to be tough to do and it's going to depend on candidate recruitment, particularly in states like alaska, colorado and louisiana. Where you have a pretty republican electorates, but you have democratic senators coming from those states. Now, as for this tea party insurgency idea, when you look at this cycle in 2012, if you look at 2010 as well, you had a lot of insurgent candidates who ran against firmly, established canned who had one statewide before. It's not obvious to me you're going to see a ton of donors and act vis who are going to be fired up about that having seen that the result of those tea party insurgencies in come cases, threatened a winnable republican candidate. So my guess is that you're going to see moderation on that front. If only to win winnable swing states. 

[00:49:51]


>> Maria, let me ask you about this. You know what I would fear in the senate race? I would look at the recent races and if wasn't for republicans running offer in the woods and shooting themselves in the foot, democrats wouldn't have done as well and that's something democrats can't take too lightly heading into the mid terms. 
>> Absolutely, tom. It will no doubt be very difficult in 2016. It was very difficult this time around and I'm sorry, 2014, and 2014 is by the sheer math of it going to be harder than it supposedly would have been this time around for republicans. Republicans blew it. Can democrats count on republicans blowing it in the next two years? No. That's why you see democrats who are up in 2014 going to continue to focus on the issues that their constituents care about and mary landrieu is very good get married, have a couple of kids,

[00:55:25]


>> Reporter: He has lost his wife and now fears the truth behind her tragic death may be lost, too. 
>> We've seen tampering of the medical cards, basically some key information is missing. 
>> Reporter: Praveen and savita halappanavar met in india, married, then set up home in ireland four years ago. He is an engineer, she was a dentist. They were happy here. 
>> She loved dancing. She forced me to dance with her on a couple of times on the stage. We gave a performance. And that will be the fondest memory I suppose. I have never gone onstage, i never had. I always had the stage fear to go and speak and the belief she gave me was unbelievable. 
>> Reporter: Together, they had dreams of a beautiful future, of children, their children, of having a family. 
>> She was looking forward, basically. In a way she felt she was at the right place. That's the reason why she knew and she was very well organized as well. She knew what she wanted in . That's the reason why she had decided to settle here on the long term. 
>> When savita became pregnant they were overjoyed. Then their ordeal began. Savita got back pain. Here, doctors told her she was miscarrying. Her baby would likely die. Savita's husband says they asked for a termination and were told this is a catholic country, not while the fetus is alive. 
>> We requested for termination. We wanted to go back, go home and you know, think about the next pregnancy because it was a planned pregnancy. We were so happy. We wanted to have babies. 
>> Reporter: Three days after the request, the fetus died, was removed. Four days later, savita was dead from a blood infection. 

[00:57:25]


>> Our bodies, our lives! 
>> Reporter: Ireland has been outraged. Protests in support of savita not just here, but across the world, have urged the country's politicians to update abortion laws, prevent similar tragedies. There has been political fallout, too. Abortion is a hot button issue in ireland. The prime minister is under pressure to get halappanavar to help a health service inquirz. Government steps so far have done little to inspire halappanavar, not just he says because they took weeks before announcing an inquiry but when they did, three of the seven medical professionals on the investigation team were from the same hospital here where his wife died, although they have now been replaced, other issues remain. Not the least of which, the missing medical records. Records the hospital declined our request to comment on. 
>> Basically my request for termination and there is no note of the request in any of the notes and also, the response from the doctor is not in the medical notes either. 
>> Reporter: What do you think has happened to it? 
>> We don't know. It's just strange that there is all other information in there for when we requested for a cup of tea and toast and things like an extra blanket was given, all that is in the medical notes. 
>> Reporter: He says he will settle for nothing less than a full public inquiry, where the health service, not just his wife's death, is investigated. 
>> Every single family person asked me how could this happen in a country like ireland in the 21st century. Because it was just so simple. When they knew that the baby's not going to survive, why wait? Think about the bigger life which was the mother, my wife, savita. And they didn't. 

[00:59:33]


>> Reporter: All he wants, he says, is the truth. Nic robertson, cnn, ireland. 
>> Thanks for joining us.

=======================================================

Web site showing new immigrants how to sign from medicaid to food stamps. Is this the new american dream. Welcome to forbes on fox we'll go to mr. Steve forbes elizabeth and rick and mike. Steve, is this the america you know and love? 
>> No, david, it is not just immigrants of the country. People here now they are trying to make dependent on the government. That means more votes for them and you center the hidous cartoon. Birth to death. Corrupting us and the immigrants and got to stop it 
>> rick, it is it a land of opportunity and hand outs. 
>> No one is handing it out. 
>> Yes, they are. Just information that is available. Same example -- information mitt romney, his father when he came here from mexico. He got that exact kind of government aid and he turned out to be president of one of the nation's biggest autocompanis and became governor of the state of the michigan. 
>> My dear friend rick unger has to be brought up to date. He didn't get them. It is supplement security income and that is it free money from the government. This is in addition to medicaid and to food stamps it is a $1,000 a month you get. It is it a lot of new stuff. This by the way was started under blind and handicapped people. And I have to be kind to my friend rick since he beat me out of a but that said, we have become dependent on government. 3900 20 years ago was the average entitlement spending per person and adjusted for inflation that is it 70 percent increase. We have become a nation dependent on government hand outs and how can we not expect immigrants from saying I want mine, too. 

[00:02:31]


>> It is insulting to taxpayers and immigrants who come here lookg for work and not hand outs . Can't blame the immigrants. 
>> We are blaminglet government for offering too much. 
>> All citizens should be treated equal you have to loo at welfare reform comprehensuvly. There is too much finger pointing at immigrants and they qualify for theame benefits. Steve is right. It applies to everybody. 
>> Emac. The blame goes specifically to a government that is trying to offer craider to grave benefits without offering the opportunity. Hand outs and opportunity are two different things. 
>> You right. Immigrants built this nation and a lot of people called illegal immigrants are helping to build from all sorts of the parts of the earth we spent a trillion on basically on welfare that is more than defense and medicare combined. But we are talking about illegal immigrants that are given food stamps and they are not entitled to medicaid or medicare or social security. It is program and set up with whether mexico is pulling up their fair share. 
>> And john, you go to the web site. Anybody can go to the web site. Welcome to america web site this is it just a page from it government ben fets and welcome to america here are the benefits and here are theending on your immigration status and length of time in the u.S., You may be eligible for federal benefit programs and it goes through a long lit any and it is long and a lot of money. 
>> It is unfortunate. Immigrants are treasures the arrival of each one makes us more american because it signifies. 

[00:04:39]


>> If they are here to work. 
>> Absolutely. It is it the last thing you want to do is offer them hand out to come here. That insures that you get a lower quality person coming here. We want to attract those who want to come here and achieve. 
>> Steve, that is it the problem. I would say the overwhelming number of immigrants come here to work there are some that is drawn like in europe. Offering the benefits. And they came just for the benefits. 
>> Yeah, unfortunately john is right. Most immigrants want to get ahead as lincoln put it and improve your on lot in life. This is about the citizenry and occupiants of the country, they want to subvert us and make us independent and that means votes for the center. We see what is happening in europe with they do that. 
>> Rick, we have a list of all of those aliens that qualify. Lawfully permitted for permanent residence. And people whose deportation is with held. There is it millions and millions of illegal and i would say illegal. They are not illegally. Their deportation that qualify with the benefits. 
>> I suspect this is not what they are doing if they have deportation they have bigger problems. 
>> They are offered the benefits, rick and they get it 
>> they are not offered. 
>> It is it right here in black and white. 
>> Liz is it. And pointed out food stamps are not available to the people that you are talk being. 
>> Hold ohold on, I am reading from the ins. Once a individual qualifies from supplement security income they become eligible for other assistance programs as allowed by federal and state. Medicaid and food stamps and housing choice. 

[00:06:42]


>> Tell us who qualifies for ssi. In point of fact. 
>> Why do I have to repeat this, rick? 7 classictions qualify. 
>> You are forgetting the modifying. They have to qualify. You said it yourself. How do I qualify for ssi? 
>> Your point is taken but the broader point is when you look at what the government is doing unbeknowns to the viewers. They have scripts written for the bureaucrats to say to the recipient. Here's how we overcome your self pride and give you a check even if you don't want it. It is a forced program and saying we want you to take the taxpayer help. 
>> This thing, mike has a tendency to expand as all government programs do. Ssi was meant for the blind, handicapped and elderly. It was a maul amount of money and now larger. All government programs expand. Is it not? 
>> They pitch them as free. But the over all economy. This is a large cost. Look at current recovery since june 2009 and since that time median incomes are down 4600 on average. During the recession. They were down on average 2800. And so it was a great cost. 
>> And when you hear free from the government reach for your wallet and you will be paying for it if you are a taxpayer. College students and parents fed up with soaring tuition and crying foul. But some in the forbes team say it is it great for students and could lower tuition . There is it a flip side you don't want to miss and that's next d. ?????? ?????? 

[00:09:04]


[ Male Announcer ] IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR Again. Medicare open enrollment. Time to compare plans and costs. You don't have to make changes. But it never hurts to see if you can find better coverage, save money, or both. And check out the preventive benefits you get after the health care law. ?????? ?????? open enrollment ends dember 7th. So now's the time. Visit care.Gov or call 1-800-medicare. 

[00:11:39]


>> Live from america's head quarters. I am healther childers. New develop am middle east as violent protest erupted in egypt over president morsi new sweeping powers. Demonstrators accuse morsi of acti like a dictator and demanding he be thrown out of office. Just last week the obama administration praised morsi for the help in brokerage a cease fire. 
>> Americans are mourning the loss of dallas star larry hagman. He was known as jr ewing on dallas. He lost his battle yesterday in a dallas hospital. He was son of broadway star mary martin and known for role of tony nelson. It is one o'clock p.M. Eastern time and now back to forbes on fox. Just in time forhe college football. New report shows that coaches are scoring big-time. Froof them making two million bucks a season and a lot of parents and students are calling for cuts to help cut college costs. John, you say that is good for schools and students. You got to explain. This is a flip side. 
>> Absolutely. Parents and students need to relax and realize that football coaches get a fraction of all of the money. Donations go up that pray for all of the other athletic teams and lower tuition. You want to get rid of the money producers and you will see pruition rise as a result. 
>> John's head if you cut back on the calories you can increase tuition costs. What do you say. 
>> I love john and we go back and forth on college e-mails he's wrong on this one and i will site the university of california. He went 3 and nine and less than half of the football players graduated from an elite institution . This is it a coach who harmed the reputation of one of the elite universities in the country. It is not only the tuitition price. But the value of the degree. 

[00:14:08]


>> Emac you got to break the tie here. 
>> Listen, I think that the college football program is great. How long can you squeeze students and continue to pay high college coach pay? How can you do that when basically the middle class is getting squeezed and can't afford college tuition. Pugh research saying 97 percent of the college grauds can't afford it mississippi state, he gets 2.5 million and a fifth of the population of the state is unemployed and in poverty. I don't know how you can do that and squeeze the middle class students. 
>> Mike as you may had well know is the czar of forbes magazine if you cut the salaries of the coaches, will it increase or lower tuition. Ni think john is right. It would increase it. But measure ceo performance look at kelley in dame dame. He notre dame. And like derec dooly of tennessee earns the same as chemy and their team is terrible. He's not generating the revenue. But you have to look at what john said. A lot of times, people make donations to the school. Like if you want to buy season tickets to the basketball or football program, you have to make huge donations to the school. They fund other programs beside football. We'll hear from a princeton grad. What do you think, steve? 
>> You have to pay for talent in sports and in business the real reason college costs are going up is the bloat of the administrative costs and scott brown in massachusetts was right when he reported that senator warren was making 4--ing you to -- $300 to teach one course. 

[00:16:19]


>> With certain viewers, i will cut them all the way to zero. And I think that the football program should be moved into a for profit subsidary. The university is for learning and football you do on your own time like going to the pool hall. 
>> John, what do you think of that solution? 
>> It is ridiculous. Look at what happened to usc. University of the spoil would children and now it is impossible to get into. Why pete carol arrived and donations to the school soaredlet >> but they are soaring because they are tax exempt. To bill's point. The colleges and universities are out of control because they are nonprofit. They have 40 administrators for every one student. And I don't know why stunes are giting squeezed when football is so profitable. Nand they stand up for t university of the sphoil would children, go ahead, rich.

>> It certainly does feel a lot like winter. 
>> I know. It's getting us that in that christmas spirit already. Thanksgiving is over. Christmas is on the way. 
>> We've got the big coats out. 
> We've got all the gear out. The rest of the weekend much much colder joyce on the heels of this front that came through last night. Almost 60 degrees yesterday afternoon. Today we only made it into the mid 40s. Ultimate doppler showing still some bands of light snow. These are moving off of lakes ontario and erie all day we had that cold northwesterly wind blowing over the relatively warmer lakes. That'sow you get those lake effect snow showers. Everything was fairly light across pa and it usually doesn't make it as far east as the philadelphia area, but we saw some flakes across the suburbs earlier this afternoon. They even made it into the city at some point this evening and right now you can still see a few flurries in central pennsylvania. Most of that into upstate new york. Let's move to the maps and show you the cold air responsible for provideing those snow showers. Today's high was actually 53 but that occurred at midnight last night. Before we fell to a low of 39 degrees and then only rebounded into the mid 40s this afternoon. Now, right now, at the airport here in philadelphia, it's mostly cloudy, 40 degrees. West winds blowing at 13 miles an hour. But that's all it takes to drop your wind chill value down into the low 30s. It doesn't take too much wind as we head into the overnight hours so 40 here in philly. 37 in wilmington. 35 in millville. But it feels about 10 degrees colder across the area. Especially when you head up towards our north and west. Feels like 28 in reading. Feels like only 18 in the poconos. That's where your long weekend plans were it is very, very cold up there. Now, fox future cast shows the clouds from earlier today clearing out overnight tonight but we probably won't see too much sunshine tomorrow afternoon you might start off sunny but there's enough old cold air that actually causes more of those clouds as we go through the rest of the day. By 5:00 o'clock on sunday it's cloudy, we clear out monday should show more sunshine. What we are watching doesn't occur until tuesday. This is our next system which actually it could be cold enough to provide some snow. Especially north and west of us. Then maybe mixing in with some rain as that system moves closer into the philadelphia area. Not a major storm. But something to watch could bring wintry weather to the area tuesday and into tuesday night I'll have more on that coming up tomorrow evening newscast. For tonight 33 in the city much that's your low temperature. 27 in the suburb. West winds still about 10 to 15 miles an hour. That's all it takes for that breeze to make it feel like it's well below the freezing mark. For tomorrow afternoon a little bit of sun mixing with clouds feels more like a mid december day. 44 degrees for the high temperature and it will be windy especially in the afternoon that's when we'll see those gusts over 25 miles an hour at times. Therefore, it will feel colder. When we talk about the wind chills tomorrow morning that 33-degree low temperature will feel like 24. 44 in the afternoon will feel like 32. You need all the winter gear especially when it's your first round. And for preview of monday night football if you are heading to see the eagles very, very cold. 40 at kick off and then the temperature is only falling as you go through the rest of the game. Shouldn't be as windy out at the linc on monday night. Your seven day forecast shows we're stuck in the 40s through monday although it will be less breezy more sunshine as we head back to work and school. There's that system on tuesday. It's a fast-moving one but it could cause messy commute as rain mixes with snow especially late in the day on tuesday. We clear out wednesday but stay chilly basically until about next weekend but, joyce, you might think this is too cold. Too soon, there could be some changes further on. Oh. 

[00:22:34]


>>> Good. Like what? Thank you. 
>> All right. Caitlin. Colleen is standing by. What's going on witness sixers?

According to four different doctors, bynum has bilateral bone bruises and weakened cartilage in both knees. Dileo says he'll continue his rehab process but will not return until he feels healthy again. Referring to the bynum trade he said "we took a calculateed risk. His knees are worse now.

>> Wow! On to tonight's game, sixers hosting the defending western conference champs with dr. Jay in the house. Sixers up by one, and russell westbrook has his way with a wide open lane for the dunk. Westbrook withine assists tonight. Down six after three, sixers closed the gap in the fourth quarter. Evan turner to thaddeus young with an impressive 29 points. 15 boards. A career best.

God's will. 
>> Brawls and gunfire all in the name of bargain shopping. Why do emotions run so high on black friday in why don't we ask dr. Keith ablow. We will do that ahead. 
>> He remembered to take his new tv but not his toddler. He wanted a great deal at this k-mart but I'm going to leave my 2-year-old in the car. 
>> Respect children are dime a dozen. 
>> Tv's at k-mart aren't. "Fox & friends" begins right now. ?????? ?????? it's small business saturday after black friday. Today is the day that we all celebrate and spend a lot of money at small businesses. 
>> We should. I mean, black friday is all about the big box stores. We had a live shot yesterday from one of the small outdoor malls and there was nobody in sight. No one around, two or three people trickling by. Go and help out the local stores in your neighborhood. 
>> Don't bring your gun. That's what happens on black friday. We will get to all the black friday craziness. 
>> Did you shop? 
>> First of all I avoid black friday like the plague. That scares me. I also don't bring my gun to parking lots because anything could happen. 
>> Good move. 
>> Don't leave your toddler in a car. We will get to more of that craziness. 
>> The new protest out of egypt this morning because what started out as some protests in tahrir square has spilled over to other parts of the country. This all comes after thursday's decrees from egyptian president mohammed morsi basically saying you know that judiciary that we have? You know the judges that we have? If I make a decision, they are not going to be able to review anything that I do anymore. Essentially cutting out the judiciary becoming by all accounts a dictator. 

[00:02:00]


>> Yeah. All the checks on his power were essentially removed. And it did appear that this guy became a dick day or two overnight. What was worrisome about it is how quickly it all happened. And basically a 12 to 24 hour span after the united states congratulated mohammed morsi on doing such a great job helping to broker a peace agreement between hamas and israel which may beer maybe not. Maybe he did a great job. There are also arms being smuggled through egypt so maybe he got too much credit. 
>> He seized the day. His name is on top of all newspapers. Here I am, I need to consolidate power this morning. 
>> Charles krauthammer believes there is a connection between the praise that came from the united states and what president morsey has done now in egypt. 
>> I'm not surprised at all that the brotherhood is now essentially engaging in a cudahy that. The shamelessness and speed in which he did this the day after the agreement. I think the administration has to wonder whether the praise it gave which was fusive and excessive didn't give morsey the sense that he can can strike now because he has been elevated to a great world leader. He had to do the cease-fire because he needs the money and he wouldn't have had it otherwise. And also because egypt has never wanted to be dragged back into the palestine wars by the palestinians who want everybody to die on their behalf. 
>> He then went out and spoke to large crowds saying that i am the president of all egyptians. He says though that the reason he did these decrees, what's behind all of this, he says, loe are members of the mubarak regime, remember that regime you guys through out during the arab spring that i don't want trying to get power in my new government. And they are out there. They are lurking. That's why I put these new decrees in place to protect you from mubarak. 
>> Right. These new decrees by the way. He is saying basically there is nothing the judiciary can do to overturny decisions that he makes. He has given himself unchecked power. The expression that absolute power corrupts absolutely. He now is what the demonstrators that you see there that he has become a totalitarian dictator. That's exactly what they had voted against in the first freely elected president, morsey was. And now he, they believe, has become no different than mubarak. 

[00:04:29]


>> Yesterday, the former assistant secretary of defense spoke out on what's happening there. 
>> President obama is really stuck now. That is is, he wants to court morsey but now that morsey is acting extra illegally, he he is almost forcing president obama to have to rebuke him publicly. And the question is whether president obama will do. So. >> 
>> we probably should have been quicker to reserve the praise. Susan rice was the first one who spoke out immediately praising mohammed morsey. To charles krauthammer's point, it's the money that we hold power in all of this over a billion dollars a year goes to egypt. Maybe that's something that the united states holds on to. There are plenty of senators and congressman that want to defund egypt entirely. That money probably ought to be held back. 
>> They're the people once again making their demands. Can you see from the videos here. 
>> Looks like the arab spring, right? 
>> Remember what happened in to your knowledge and spilled into egypt. This all started here and people got their wish and mubarak was forced to step down. 
>> That's the dahlia they know. That's what everybody said. Power vacuum and mother brother hood step in. Here was his reaction to protesters. He said god's will. Protesters have made me the captain of this ship. 
>> Unbelievable. That's the update out of egypt this morning. We have much more on that. Including great expert on the middle east this, no. Talk about what's going on not only in israel and gaza but also egypt coming up in the show. 
>> Get to your headlines and tell you what else is happening at this hour. A smell of gas downtown springfield, massachusetts. Explosion through the area. 18 people were hurt. Among them, firefighters, police officers, and gas workers responding to the calls for a gas leak. Amazingly, no one was killed. It felt like a bomb had gone off. 
>> And blew me right out of the bed. It blew my back bedroom and my kitchen window were completely blown out and blew me across the room. I got up on the car and we ran out of the house. 

[00:06:43]


>> Investigators will be back on the scene today to determine if any more buildings need to be torn down. Well, despite their best efforts. Black friday protesters did not seem to hurt wal-mart sales. 
[Chanting] 
>> a thousand protests were expected across the country. According to statement released by wal-mart only 26 protests actually took place and most of the participants were not even esm employees they say. They say it was the best black friday ever. Sold 1.8 million towels. 1.3 million televisions. 1.3 million dolls. And 250,000 bicycles. Wow, people are really in the market for towels. 
>> Towels? 
>> We measure black friday success in towels now. Don't put your wallets away just yet. And that's because black friday is behind us. That doesn't mean the holiday shopping weekend so ever, guys. Today is small business saturday as we said. A push to help boost the struggling economy by shopping at locally owned stores. The movement is in its third year. And it is growing. According to a new survey 67% of shopper who's know about small business saturday plan to take part in it. That's up 44% from last year. Dave, I know this has made you very sad. Hollywood is mourning the loss of larry hagman. 
>> J.R. 
>> Wait a minute. It's your style j.R., My wife and the man who put cliff barnes in office. 
>> You have got plenty of trouble before y'all got married. I don't understand why you think she has changed. 
>> Hey. Stop. Knock it off. 
>> Classic. 
>> Legend. 
>> Hagman best known for his role of course as the villain j.R. Ewing on his star with dallas. Lost his battle with cancer dallas hospital. Linda gray had this to say on the star's passing. Larry hagman was my best friend for 35 years. He brought joy to everyone he knew. I will miss him enor muresly. 

[00:08:48]


>> She was at his side. 
>> He he was apparently surrounded by family and friends. 
>> Hagman was the son of mary martin. He was also known for his role as major tony nelson in i dream of jeanne, of course, he was 81 years old. 
>> He never became hollywood. Larry hagman remained dallas. He was from fort worth and he always will stand for dallas. What a legend. Love that guy. 
>> Check in with rick reichmuth and see what our weekend first alert forecast looks like. 
>> Looking good. You worry about thanksgiving weekend for travelers getting home and maybe another storm at the end of it we made through the entire thing scot-free. It's cold. 13 degrees in minneapolis. The tenks have dropped off from where you were on wednesday. Aside from that, no big storms. Cold front eastern seaboard. Hind it a ton of sunshine. There will be a little bit of a problem around the great lakes. That cold air will continue to move across the great lakes which have still pretty warm. Out across the west, warm moisture continuing to pull. In it's now moving in across interior sections, idaho and iowa seeing some of the snow. Snowfall totals we will see from lake-effect snow are not going to be all that high. Maybe 4 inches jamestown, new york. In essence maybe 3 to 6 inches. Not all that bad. But it could cause a little bit of problems on the road. Here are your temps for the day today. You see the cold air around the great lakes and northeast. Warming up across parts of the high plains. Second batch of cold air begins to move in towards the northern plains. Foresystem bring another batch of snow across the northern plains. Aside from that, looking really good. Everybody is going to be able to get home just fine. 
>> Yesterday I tweelted this. I said this guy is the moron of the day. See if you agree with me. He goes in late night and tries to get a black friday deal on a television. 1:30 ithe morning in massachusetts. He takes his girlfriend's to the ler with him. 2-year-old. To the store. I'm not sure why and he decides manchts maybe he was baby-sitting. 

[00:10:54]


>> This is a great babysitter. He goes into the k-mart to get a deep discount on a 51-inch television and he leaves the kid in the car. 
>> Right. Then the police are notified that there is a 2-year-old sleeping in a car, who is unidentified. So they take the 2-year-old that they can't wake up to the hospital. The guy goes home with the 51-inch tv and then I guess realizes at some point either in the store or on his way home that he forgot the child. 
>> So the child was in the car. 
>> Right. 
>> Asleep. 
>> That's right. 
>> To so people. 
>> They removed him while he was in the store. 
>> The babysitter was in the store. 
>> He didn't realize -- 
>> he comes out with a tv he is like I have got this tv I'm going home. Oh, where is that kid i brought with me. 
>> He was so high on the fumes of a good deal that he forgot that he was baby-sitting. 
>> Maybe he thought it was a swap. Maybe he thought it was like i get the 51-inch tv, I give you the 47-inch child. 
[ Laughter ] it's not funny. It's horrible. 
>> Took him to the hospital because, you know, he was a kid at 1:30 in the morning. What kid is audible, verbal at that hour. 
>> He we're happy to report the child is fine. But we do need to hear a bit more of an explanation from the. 
>> He is being charged. 
>> Reckless enendangerment of a child. 
>> Keith ablow will be on. Tv picture looks fan task. 
>> Mugshot in full hd. 
>> Technique color. 
>> Coming up, the over evolving accounts of what happened in benghazi sound like a game of he said, she said. We are asking a former cia operative who he believes in the coverup straight ahead. Then we see it year after year. People making a mad dash, stopping at nothing to get those black friday bargains. Why do emotions run so high on black friday? Why do we care this much about getting $20 off of --

[00:16:23]


>> Welcome back, the ever evolving story from the administration about what happened in benghazi is becoming more confusing by the day especially in ambassador rice speaking out. James clapper saying he is the one who took out al qaeda talking points after originally saying he had no idea who did it. So who should we all believe here? Joining us now is former cia covert operations officer mike baker live in boise idaho at 3:15 a.M. Good to see you, mike. 
>> Thank you. Good to see you and thank you for the opportunity. 
>> What do we make of all of this after what susan rice has come out and said? She clearly relayed the intel given to her. Should we expect a diplomat to do more than that. To go beyond and ask questions before relay ago story to the media. 
>> Well, right. Not just a diplomat but the person that president obama claims would be a perfect secretary of state to replace secretary clinton. Ambassador rice is stying five days after the attack. Now it's three mons on from the attack and we are still kind of around with the potential investigation. Getting people in to testify. But ambassador rice is saying five days after the attack all she did, at the behest of the white house was go on the sunday morning talk show circuit and rely entirely on the intelligence talking points which is, again, it just adds to these continuing layers of a narrative. If we are to expect that the u.N. Ambassador, potentially the future secretary of state didn't have access and wasn't involved in discussions five days on from the attacks talking about the scenario of the terrorists the fact that there was no protest she talked about sunday morning show, then we have a serious problem. 
>> The picture in your head is she is handed a packet of paper. She reads it over, says thank you and goes and delivers it to the media. Is that how it works? There is some sort of briefing, it's more than papers there is a discussion about what happened in which someone that is going to be the secretary of state should ask questions. Correct? 

[00:18:33]


>> Right. Absolutely much the idea that someho you know, she slipped one page briefing memo with some talking points that by the way have been edited constantly apparently since the cia produced the basic intelligence, the raw intelligence from the field talking about what had been happening, it doesn't add up. And nothing happens in washington, you know, in a bubble. It's not as if now ambassador rice has decided well, you know, I had to come out and defend my comments. This is a planned move by the white house, I believe, because, you know, they want to put her out there as the secretary of state. I think they are feeling fairly emboldened after the election and just intend to jam this joyce through despite the congress and republicans in congress saying now we are going to block. This I think what they are doing is setting the table for ambassador rice's nomination. 
>> In fact, they may have blown it up. Why didn't they put someone out there, in your opinion, like clapper who actually had all the intel, probably talked with a lot of the intelligence officers in addition to the state department instead of someone like rice that clearly was more relaying information she was told second hand? I think essentially she was willing to get out there for the white house, be the front pointy edge of the spear. Be the sewage and now she is being rewarded for carrying their water. It's a good question. Obviously clapper has his own issues right now in terms of how were the talking points edited from what general petraeus had testified.

>> Well, the black friday madness was not just inside the stores. There were scenes of violence and chaos all across the country. 
>> Take a look at this amateur video out of a cops arresting a woman at a florida wal-mart. Police say the woman tried to bypass long checkout ljnes. Cops say when she was confronted she refused to get back in line and started throwing her merchandise. 
>> This cell phone video shows the chaos at a wal-mart in georgia. Complete bedlam as people shoved and pushed trying to get some on sale items. Listen. Oh,. 
>> Imagine going in there and just buying socks? What's going on today. Some women. You should have seen them in victoria's secret just going in to buy bras. Listen. 
>> This is tulsa. I used to live in tulsa. 
>> Oh my god. 
>> There was a human stampede victoria's secret in tulsa. Captures hundreds of people rushing in as soon as the gates were open. Luckily reports say that no one was injured. Hard to believe. 
>> What was the deal there. 
>> Deep discounts on bras. Didn't you know? We did see 50 percent off sign yesterday at the store. 
>> With all that craziness, venturing to the stores on black friday can be survival of the fittest. The challenge can be especially tough if you are a small business owner watching box stores with deep discounts. 
>> Those local businesses are fighting back against the powerful retail chains by celebrating the third annual small business saturday. 
>> Joining us now is the ceo of new tech. The small business authority berry sloan. Good to see you, berry. 
>> Good to be here. 
>> Talk about small business saturday. It's gone on a couple of years now. How important small businesses are for this economy. 
>> Small businesses are clearly the largest job creator in the united states. Particularly given the price of gas. It's very difficult for shoppers to make the long trip and expensive. So they are really relying upon the small businesses in their local community that provide the goods and services. It's very important for the overall g.D.P. Which small businesses comprise about auto% of small g.D.P. 

[00:26:09]


>> Is there anything we can do more broadly for small business saturday. It's great to get out and help that boutique. Dress maybe want to get something for someone for the holidays. More broadly throughout the rest of the year. Some have said and I read online this is maybe putting a band-aid on a problem and not really a solution. 
>> The I think the announcement of small business saturday is important. What we don't want to do is can that can ba bliz sales for the rest of the year. Our small business customers we have over 100,000 customers in our book of business need to make sure they have the best state of the art ecommerce solutions. Do business and reach and communicate with businesses a little bit outside of their local region. 
>> That's so important. Let's talk about that. 
>> I knew you had him there. 
>> Really frustrating. 
>> I talk about this with my wife a lot because we will, if you need a contractor or need somebody to do something on your house and you want to get some work done, whatever it is in a small business, you might not get a phone call back for a few days. 
>> The folks though that do call you back that have an answering machine that get back to you and receive and return phone calls or maybe have a web site or a store front where you can go on and do a google search. Some of these businesses aren't searchable by google. They haven't thought to go to a google site and make themselves available. 
>> What is amazing today small businesses that that don't have a simple web site. For as little as $6 a month you can have a web site with a hosting plan and gateway to take payments. Small businesses need to take advantage of the internet and tools to communicate both with clients in their local community and in their region to be able to do the business. Today they can effectively compete with big box. 
>> Can they? These massive mega stores are small businesses going the way of the doe doe bird? 
>> The ones that don't advance and position themselves for the way things are today in the market. They are going to get knocked out. But you look at the wal-mart problem. The wal-mart problem you have got all labor unions pushing in and pushing up the costs. Small businesses have to take advantage where they have that capability. We service small businesses we help them manage their healthcare costs, their technology costs. They have got to watch the bottom line and where they disadvantage historically the internet has been a great equalizer. 

[00:28:25]


>> Where are small businesses add a disadvantage. 
>> There are advantages the to the entrepreneurs are close tomorrow employees and customers. That level of customer service is a tremendous advantage. That's what they have to take advantage of. The local. 
>> Personalize it? 
>> Personalized service. The fact that you can go into a small business today and really get taken care of. And you can't get that in a big box store. 
>> Harnessing social media in a local communitiening able to go on facebook and say thanks for coming in today. I really appreciate it. Having that personal connection. You don't get that from big box stores. 
>> If you are in a local community and doing a search. Local store is going to show up on iphone or tab bleted. That's something that needs to be taken advantage of. Don't have to pay a zillion dollars in key words. Just the fact that you have a presence is what is most important. 
>> We're out of time. One more thing. You mentioned $6 a month people at home are saying how do you make a web site for $6 a month. I give advice all the time. Square space.Com $6 a month create incredible store front. Web site. Make you searchable by google. If you are a small business owner go to square space.Com.

>> For someone to come in here and do this. It wasn't like they were trying to steal anything. They just caused as much panic as they could. 
>> Terrifying, that's the last thing aurora needs. Target was evacuated and shut down for the rest of the night. Expected to open again today. Fortunately no one was hurt. One of the fbi's most wanted fugitives is no longer a free man. Los angeles gang member joe luis sian was caught in mexico thursday and brought back to l.A. Last night. Wanted for murder and kidnapping charges. Believed to have been working as hit man for mexican drug cartels. He has been on the most wanted list for three years. The long island hurricane sandy victims went weeks without power and some of them still in the dark this morning are getting slapped with electric bills.

>> Stephan sack, the employer's lawyer shares his ad vice. 
>> How are you this morning. 
>> Great. Nice to see. 
>> You how do you simply ask for a raise? Is there a list of things you need to check off before you go in? 
>> Very much so. You just don't walk in and come up with this idea overnight. You have to plan it out. The first thing you do is is you want to assess the corporate culture, talk to co-workers. Find out, you know, the company culture about getting raises in the not too distant past to others. 
>> You say that you say do your research and find out the company culture. People are very quiet about their paychecks. It's hard to gauge how much your co-workers are making. 
>> True. Sometimes you have some friends. Even in high places like hr that could give you a little wink or a tip and help you out. People have, you know, I think people are kind of friendly about that. And if you need some advice, they will help you. 
>> You say timing is everything. Your second point. So, if you are a wall matter employee and it's black friday, your company's biggest day of the year do you want to put the pressure on. 
>> No. 
>> I make light of it, seriously, is it the best time when it's crunch time for your employer. 
>> No. 
>> Or no? When is the best time. 
>> You don't want to do it when like you want to speak to your boss is about to leave because his wife is giving birth. You know, is he not really interested in talking. It's got to be in a quiet down period. You know, you have got to figure out and maybe even go in before and say when can we talk? You know, what's convenient for you? I would like to address a couple of issues about my performance and possibly let's talk a little bit about, you know, my next year's plan and a raise possibly. 

[00:41:11]


>> Not on election day. 
>> Of course not. 
>> That was a misfire on your part. 
>> Talking points you mentioned your performance. Proving your value is something very important. 
>> Your boss will be aware of it. How do you do it in a unpretentious way or do you want to do in t. In a pretentious way. 
>> You have to go in there having done your homework. Tell the company what you really accomplished in the past year. The money you made them. The customers you brought in. Or maybe, you know, how you helped a merger or you worked 800 hours a week for four months to bring in that new deal. That's the kind of stuff that companies are very very graduate find and will probably reward you. 
>> Okay. Can we role play for a second? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> I'm the boss. You are the employee. Give me the language. You want a raise. Go. 
>> Basically I would say to you I have been working regular hard here during the year as you know. 
>> Yes, you have. 
>> I would like you to be aware of what I believe I have accomplished for the company in the past year. Which I think we can quantify. And then you lay out exactly what you have done for them and how much money you saved the company or how much money you made the company. When you do that and it can't be refuted I think you will go a long way towards -- 
>> you wait for the boss to tell you? 
>> I think it's better not to demand anything, unless and that goes to one of our later points unless you have a new job lined up with another company then you have a lot of leverage. You can make your own demands. 
>> Do you worry about their calling your bluff. 
>> Not necessarily. If you have done a good job, why shouldn't the company reward you especially around christmas time they really should. 
>> Stephan sack. Mr. Roger ailes look out on monday. You will be getting a phone call. 
>> I want to see if people want to go to my web site because I have a lot of great information they can go to stephan sack.Com and really the most important thing is knowing, asserting yourself and same thing with bonuses real quick. A lot of people are going to get fired at the end of the year. They may have expected a bonus and the companies may not pay it don't just allow the companies to do that.

You are going to these stores on a regular basis, ls. There is cameras hidden all over the place how is this different.

My little station I go on the train every morning there is is a sign that says we have camera we're looking at you. Unless they have that kind of notice. They don't have a right to be taping you for profit. 
>> Right I own my own store i want to have loss prevention i don't want you stealing things from me. I want to be able to have security this is is not your home,. 
>> Key thing is expectation of privacy. I think it's gone. I think we have lost the expectation of privacy unless we are in a bathroom or dressing room because the man can cameras even they are creepy they are not collecting anythi the eye in the sky. How long you are staring at the mannequin for. 
>> Let's just. 
>> Really? 
>> The average american is on camera 70 times a day. In this building in the elevators they are everywhere. So we're not home or doing -- 
>> -- put a notice out there. Say that you have got the mannequins there. 
>> People just going in. 
>> What would that do? 
>> Alert you that's what's going on. 
>> You and me aren't going to stop shopping even when the mannequins are looking at you. 
>> Let's say something happened here and someone i could picture this happening someone steals something. You find out later there is video surveillance is of them. Could they have any sort of legal recourse and get this thing thrown out because the whole case pins. 
>> Search and seizure. You have got to give people notice that you are watching them. If you don't give that notice you are a business owner and you don't give that notice. Then I would say there is an argument at least there is expectation of privacy. 
>> How is this different than a nanny cam in my house, not that I had one. Let's say I have a nanny cam set up. Away from work. Nanny at home or babysitter at home. Do they have to let that nanny know they are on camera.

>> Welcome back, everyone. Listen though this creative sentence, 10 years of mandatory church attendance, that was the sentence handed down this week by an oklahoma judge to a 17-year-old convicted of drunk driving and killing his friend who was sitting in the passenger seat. The church sentence was agreed to by both the victims and the teenager's family. Now the aclu is calling this unconstitutional and a violation of the first amendment. We are back with our fox news legal analyst lis wiehl and defense attorney and former prosecutor jona. Thanks for speaking around. This judge sentenced this 17-year-old to 10 years mandatory church attendance as opposed to any sort of jail. What did you think of that? 
>> As a mom. As, you know, I'm very -- i think it's a creative judgment. I like the judgment. It will give the kid 10 years. Both sides agree to it. Give the kids 10 years church and maybe rehabilitate himself. I like the idea of it but let's talk about the -- 
>> what did you think at first blush. 
>> I like it, too. It's very creative. This kid doesn't deserve to be thrown in prison and throw away the key that's why the judge came to have. This the aclu doesn't like it. It's interesting to remind the viewers that the victim's family thought that this would be okay. It was run by them. They stay violates church and state. 
>> Here is a judge coming in and saying you must go to church why love the idea but that is a violation of the first amendment. 

[00:54:54]


>> Lis is probably right. The key here is the families all agreed. If the victim and the defendant didn't agree then this wouldn't be happening. 
>> Give them the option to violate the constitution? 
>> Why not? Isn't this sentence better than making him wear a sandwich board saying I killed somebody in the difference sort of shameful sentences that we have? Those are out of the ordinary, too. The point is just because both sides agree to it doesn't mean that it doesn't violate the constitution. We can't have that kind of precedent. Do I like this sentence? Yes. Is it unconstitutional? Yes. 
>> And I agree. You are probably right. It probably does violate. When everybody says it's okay and a judge puts his pleasing pleasing -- blessing on it, why not? 
>> Both sides agree we can violate the constitution. 
>> This was accidental death. Right? 
>> Drunk driving. 
>> Accidental death. He didn't mean to kill his friend. 
>> Manslaughter and he was below, by the way the legal limit but because he was 17 years old it was counted -- 
>> five years from now if this kid says I'm done going to church, what will the judge do then? That's my own concern. 
>> Does he get thrown in jail and throw away the key? It's. 
>> It's an interesting topic. We would love to hear what you say. 
>> Who coordinated your outfits? 
>> Great minds think alike, dave briggs. 
>> They all though the out off this of this. Great to he sue guys. Thanks for coming in and dressing like me. The department of homeland security stepping up communication by spending millions on new radios, there is one problem. It appears workers don't know how to use them.

>> Meanwhile, thousands of protesters spilling into the streets of cairo again this morning demanding president mohammed morsi be thrown out of office. They are angry over morsey's decision to give himself sweeping powers. A massive power grab on thursday into friday. Peter doocy joins us live from d.C. With the latest. Peter, this was frightening at how quick it happened and how it came immediately after susan rice praised what mr. Morsey did there. 

[01:03:17]


>> Right, dave. And mohammed morsi is actually egypt's first democratically elected president. But many of his people are protesting because he issued this decree that puts all his decisions in the past, present and future above judicial review. He can do whatever he wants and the lower courts can't. ' Assembly writing egypt's new constitution can do so without any objections now, the u.S. State department issued a statement making their reservations about president morsey crystal clear and basically stating that the entire idea of the arab spring was the opposite of what's happening in egypt. The state department says, 
quote: One of the aspirations of the revolution was to ensure that power would not be overly concentrated in the hands of any one person or institution. The current constitutional vacuum in egypt only resolved by checks and balances and fundamental freedoms, individual rights and rule of law consistent with egypt's international commitment. U.S. Officials have also said president morsey's power grab came as a surprise so close to him helping broker peace in gaza. According to a reuters wire that just crossed, this is a quote. Egypt's highest judicial authority says president morsey's decree is unprecedented attack on judicial independence. Now we wait and see what happens next. 
>> Who was that statement from. 
>> That's from egypt's highest judicial authority. 
>> Who is now useless. 
>> Actually, egypt, the supreme basically the equivalent of the supreme court in egypt can challenge his decree but basically the standard judicial review process right now is moot. They can't do anything to stop him. He has all the power in egypt as it stands right now. 

[01:05:35]


>> That's terrible. 
>> We will keep you posted throughout the show on that turbulent situation with the protesters. Get to your head lines because a gas explosion has leveled one business and damaging several others. 18 people were hurt among those firefighters, police officers and gas workers who had been responding to calls reporting a gas leak. Apaysingly, no one was killed. Witnesses say it felt like a bomb had gone off. 
>> The boom you got startled for a minute. And then you could just hear screaming and everybody within the buildings are screaming and you are trying to figure out what, you know, what just happened that would make a building shake like that. 
>> Investigators will be back on the scene today to determine the exact cause of the explosion and if any more buildings need to be torn down. Despite their best enforce, black friday protesters did not seem to hurt wal-mart's sales. 
>> About a thousand protests were expected across the country. According to a statement released by wal-mart only 26 protests actually took place. Most of the participants they say were not even employees. Wal-mart says this was their best black friday ever. It estimates it sold over 1.8 million towels. People are extremely wet. 1.3 million televisions. 1.3 million dolls and 2 auto thousand bicycles. All right. Just moments ago six clergy members became cardinals. Pope benedict xvi elevated new princes of the church. The group is not only tasked with advising the pope but electing the person who will succeed him. The diverse group comes from across the globe colombia, india, nigeria, the philippines and of course, the u.S.

[01:07:39]


>> Hey, wait a. 
>> Oh, knock it off. 
>> Hagman, of course, best known for his role as the villain j.R. Ewing on dallas. He lost his battle with cancer yesterday at a dallas hospital. His co-star on the show linda gray had this to say. Larry hagman was my best friend for 35 years. Pied piper of life. Brought joy to everyone he knew. I will miss him enormously. He was the sob of broadway star mary martin and also known for his role in major tony nelson in "i dream of jean j" he was 81 years old. 
>> Hagman was not just famous here but a legend over in europe when he went to germany he was a rock star, ireland, england, paris. They really loved his character j.R. From dallas. Iconic. 
>> The cowboy icon. 
>> Yeah. 
>> It's nice that he was able to die surrounded by friends in dallas. 
>> That's great. Let's get to rick reichmuth. 
>> He was in the new dallas, too wasn't he? 
>> Yes he was a reboot on tnt. 
>> He and the other guy that popped up on there? 
>> Yes. Played his father. 
>> Two original cast members. 
>> You have got about a minute and a half to find out. 
>> I just gave myself a minute and a half for this weather. Never happen. Minus 2 this morning in international falls. Incredibly cold. We are sending alli there after the show she loves it 12 degrees in minneapolis. Cold is moving in behind the cold front. We have got temperatures certainly cooled down here. 15, 20 degrees for a lot of people. So, get ready for that. It will warm up a little bit and this isn't certainly the worst of it another batch of cold air will move in. Most of it is across the far northern plains. Behind this front, clear skies cooler eastern seaboard. The front moving down through florida. Cooler drier conditions continuing there. Behind this storm now we have got the cold air moving across the great lakes and brings us lake-effect snow. We will see that maybe 3 to 6 inches for some people down across areas of lake erie. It will taper off across parts of mid michigan. In across the pacific northwest rain and a lot of that energy is moving in the northern rockies. Much of the four corners remaining incredibly dry and incredibly comfortable. Temperatures shaping up across parts of the high plains. Cold air northern plains around the great lakes. Much colder across the mid-atlantic states. Tomorrow that cold air continues. See only a high of 59 for your sunday. Good news is although the temperatures are cold not a lot in the way of any big travel problems. No big storms that didn't cause big airport delays. All right, guys. What was his name?

>> Welcome back. The confusion and controversy surrounding the attack benghazi continue with ambassador susan rice. Speaking out in defense of her initial comments where she blamed the video and protest errors for the attack on our consulate. Also director of national intelligence james clapper says he is the one who took out the al qaeda reference in those talking points after originally saying he had no idea who did it. So where does all this confusion leave us regarding the state department? Will clapper take the fall to protect susan rice? 

[01:14:52]


>> Joining us now fox news chief intelligence correspondent catherine herridge. Good morning, catherine. 
>> Good morning. 
>> So now that james clapper -- I don't know if he he said he did it, but his office took responsibility. 
>> That's correct. 
>> For the talking points. Is this now case closed? That answers it? 
>> Well, I think it's important to look at the timing of the last 10 days. We had these closed classified hearings on capitol hill where james clapper is the manager who oversees the 16 intelligence agencies told the committees that he had had no idea who made the changes to these talking points he was quite definite. Then four days later his office put out a statement saying we, in fact, were the ones who made these changes that seemed to minimize the role of terrorism. And then almost on cue, ambassador rice comes out to the stakeout at the u.N. And clearly has some prepared remarks about the situation and then all of this ostensibly got are buried on holiday weekend when most people are not paying attention to the media I don't think that's the end of it because james clapper is going to have to satisfactory the heads of those intelligence committees that what he told them in sworn testimony on the hill was, in fact, what he knew at the time. He have to explain what is ultimately a complete reversal on his position. 
>> Does this further complicate for susan rice that some have leveled the argument, of course, that she is simply a puppet then. Been handed talking points and goes out there and makes thee comments. Would we want a potential secretary of state to be thoughtful, interrogative. 
>> You have hit the nail on the head. What we have heard from lawmakers on capitol hill is that susan rice is someone who had access though this unclassified information so these talking points. But she also had access to classified information. And if she had had the will to dig a little deeper what would have been clear is that there was a good body of raw intelligence that led people in the intelligence community to conclude that it was a terrorist attack within the first 24 hours. For example we know that there were realtime emails saying that this group ansar al sharia had claimed responsibility. That's important because that claim could only have come from someone who was there on the ground. Not from a group after the fact. So that's an important data point. She would have had access to that she is going to have to reconcile why she just seemed to go with unclassified talking points when she had so much information that she could actually access. 

[01:17:23]


>> It's not clear if she has the votes in the senate to be confirmed as secretary of state. Even with democrats. This statement doesn't help her from the dni themselves. The intelligence community assessed from the very beginning that what happened in benghazi was a terrorist attack. That is from the dni to cbs news. So, she is going to have a difficult confirmation if, in fact, she is named. But where do the hearings go from here? Where when does hillary clinton step up and shed light on what happened? 
>> That's an excellent question. And when you look ahead to the next two weeks, what we anticipate is that the secretary of state will testify most likely in an open hearing within about the next 10 days this goes to the other issue that's unresolved culpability of the state department and the death of ambassador stevens and those other three americans. Fox was first to report on a classified cable that was done in august less than a month before the attack which is really the smoking gun warning there was an emergency meeting and what they relayed to headquarters and hillary clinton's office in washington is that that consulate could not withstand a coordinated attack and that these islamist groups were everywhere and that they needed more help. This group in effect predicts the very way they are going to die less than a month later there was no additional security that was added. In fact, a special team that was on the ground was withdrawn from benghazi. So the question for secretary of state clinton is going to be weather this was a decision that was driven by a lack of assets or money, whether it was just bureaucratic inertia or whether this decision was politically driven because the administration wanted to have this light footprint on the ground, this reliance on the libyans to show that, in fact, the arab spring had been a success in libya, when, in fact, the intelligence on the ground showed something quite different. 
>> Oh, boy. Catherine herridge, you obviously have been in the forefront of all sorts of great reporting on this. Thanks so much with joining us.

>> Welcome back, time for your news by the numbers this morning. First $430 million. That's how much the apartment of homeland security spent on radios. Its employees though don't know how to use them. A report from the government finds that only one in 479 employees know how to operate the radio's secure channel. 80,000. That's how much this self-described apple freak from california spent to auto mate his home. This song writer, have you watched that modern family episode of moderning the home. He uses ipad from blind to lights and pole. He is ahead of me. Can I only do my lights so far and tv. Last, $325 million. That's how much the power ball jackpot has soared to. Next drawing is tonight. Alli? 
>> You won't see me tomorrow. You will know what happens. 
>> You're auto mating your home I'm going to the power ball. 
>> If you are planning on doing holiday shopping today. Beware. In addition to all those great holiday deals. You may end up getting more than you par beganned for because the mall can be a hot spot for germs. Dr. Marc siegel is from our medical a team. Is he here to break it all down. Hi, doc. 
>> Hi, how are you? 
>> I'm doing well. 
>> Germiest places in the mall to be on the lookout for. First of all is the air. How can I avoid the air when i got to will will mall. 
>> You can't avoid it full disclosure I i am not a germ phone. When I start preparing for. This I start thinking about the back tier I can't understand virus. The air this time of year. With winter coming you have low humidity, and the respiratory bugs travel up to 12 feet. I'm all for hand sanitizers and washing your hands. For the air I want you to take your flu shot if you haven't had it yet and I want you to know little kids are factories of viruses and they start coughing and you could get hit with a virus 12 feet away. Watch out for who is coughing and sneezing at the mall. Stay away. 

[01:25:15]


>> Alisyn: You say navigate around the coughers. Everyone remember to cough into your elbow. 
>> The dracula cough. 
>> Alisyn: Toy stores are particularly germy. 
>> Mommy is saying johnny put that back in the box. Mean while jobbie is licking this toy. Next kid comes around oh brand new toy. There is e.Coli on that, bacteria. Wipe your hands after you touch them. Use those hand sanitizers and wash your hands if you can. 
>> Shopping works up an appetite but you say be weary. 
>> The guys coming around with that rag. That rag has bacteria on it use your own disinfect tants. Wipe down the table. Wipe down the chairs. 
>> Just a little disposable paper sanitizer and you just wipe it down? 
>> Absolutely. Disinfect tant and the hand sanitizers for your hand. I'm all for this. Rags are spreading germs and person before you may not have warved his hands. 
>> One germy place is the cosmetic counter they use all the disposable places people are applying makeup. 
>> Disposable makeup is probably okay. There is no evidence that you are getting it from the makeup itself but the counters, study shows have 65 to 100% of them have bacteria on. They again, use that disinfect tant, wipe the counter top down. Okay to use the disposable makeup. 
>> The fifth place is you say the bathroom. We're not talking about the grossest parts of the bathroom. It's actually the handle as you are going in and out of bathroom. 
>> The soap dispenser has a the love bacteria. The towel dispenser not the towels but the towel dispenser here is the part you never think of. You washed your hands and used hand sanitizer you are on your way out and touch the doorknob which someone touched on the way in with grungy hands. Use the sanitizer -- use the disinfectant on the doorknob. Try to avoid it push the cure open on your way out. 
>> Also take your paper towel that you just used and keep that in your hand to open the door on your way out and then throw it over your shoulder. 

[01:27:19]


>> You are a genius alisyn. 
>> Alisyn: I knew about this one. 
>> That's a good idea. 
>> You threw me out. 
>> Get that hand sanitizer and enjoy shopping after this. Shop online. 
>> That's the answer. Shop online or use scads of -- 
>> this is just a precaution. I'm not trying to worry people. The cbc says if you use these hand sanitizers you will cut down on risk of infection by 40 to 60%. 
>> We do all survive our trip to the mall so we'll be okay. 
>> Good to see. 
>> You coming up, the unemployment and the number of people on food stamps are up across the country. So are we on track to become the next france or greece? One writer thinks. So plus, all aboard the party train where this party on wheels could soon be making a stop. rosa chantix. When the doctor told me that I could smoke for the first week... I'm like...Yeah, ok... Little did I know that one week later I wasn't smoking. 
[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. Some people had changes in behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serus allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. It helps to have people around you... They say, you're much bigger than this. And you are. 

[01:29:20]


[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. 

[01:32:10]


>> Dogs your family ask you for money when you go back home? 
>> Yes. 
>> Oh, god did you bring up a sore one. >> 
>> why don't you make an announcement right now you are headed home and won't be giving money. 
>> Rather them than the government. 
>> I see. You better give your money away before it gets taken. 
>> Alisyn: That wasn't a punch line. That was actually a provocative statement the comedian tim al ledge was talking about give your money to charity before the government can take it today there is an op. Ed by pete dupont in the "wall street journal" talking about or maybe this week talking about how he fears that america, given the most recent election, is becoming more like europe. He becomes the europeization of america. He has all sorts of examples of why he thinks we are headed in that direction. 
>> He says those who worry about the europeanization of america and social decline are right to be unsettled. This is not just a writer though, this is a former governor, former u.S. Congressman. Former presidential candidate. A guy who knows what he is talking about worried about all the money that is being taken away from you and is soon to be much worse in the next four years. 
>> Here is split screen to give you understanding of some of the numrs here. Some signs that the u.S. May be coming more like europe. Unemployment levels -- employment levels. 
>> Employment that should say. 
>> Employment levels are still 3% lower than they were before the recession. I'm going to cross that u.N. Out there. 
>> Cover that up. Hand on your tv screen. Smudge marks. Number of people on food stamps up 15 million in the last four years. Number of taxpayers earning $1 million down from 400,000 in 2007 to about 268,000. 
>> Isn't that incredible that the number of taxpayers earning $1 million, 26 thousand. That's surprising to me. Brad pitt, angelina jolie and hollywood crew. You think there are some more millionaires in the world. 
>> It if can you sit and think about how many millionaires you know in your life it's probably very very small number. If you do know any, it's probably one in your community or depends where you live per cap attachment if you think about there are 300 million americans, right? It's probably 1%. 1% to 2%. 

[01:34:19]


>> Great way to think about it. 1% of america sounds about. 
>> Right kardashians with ruining it for everybody. 
>> Declining in that short period of time is frightening. The added element we didn't talk about is the fiscal cliff if that comes that's more than $650 billion in tax increases combined with spending cuts that would send us back into a recession. Many fear we would become europe in a matter of speaking. 
>> Here is the interesting part, I think, pete dupont concludes that he says that this recent election proves that the country has become more liberal. That's how he interprets what happened in the most recent election. We would love to hear from you if that's your take away from it. He thinks we are headed in the path of europe and become more liberal. There are many other explanations we have heard since election night. Maybe people just the incouple bent always holds an advantage. Maybe people don't like change. Who knows. But that's his theory is that the country has just become more liberal. 
>> Let us know what you think. Friends@foxnews.Com email address or find us on twitter ff weekend. Don't forget our great facebook page also. If you are a facebooker go there as well. Here. 
>> Here are your headlines. Police are searching for a man accused of walking into a target snore aurora, colorado of all places pulling out a gun and firing at the ceiling. They say he was wearing a ski mask at the time and then he ran out of the building. Terrified workers and customers were left running for their lives. 
>> I seen like people run, just dashing outside. Somebody came out there and just started shaking me. It was like call 911, there has been a shooting. 
>> For someone to come in here and do this. Wasn't like they were trying to steal anything. They just kazmierczaked as much panic as they could. 
>> The target store was evacuated and shut down for the rest of the night. It's expected to reopen today. No one was hurt. 
>> Defective body armor putting u.S. Troops at risk. The military is recalling more than half of the body armor plates used by special op. Forces because they may not protect against direct hit. Equipment underwent months of testing and analysis. Defect was found in about 5% of the plates. No troops hurt to date because of the result of the defect. The company who makes them says it has a solution to fix this problem. For two officers in new hampshire this past thanksgiving was anything but ordinary. They responded to a call for a bird in distress and found this guy. A bald eagle. It had been caught in an animal trap. The officers worked for about a half an hour to free the bird who was not hurt except for small cut on his tallan. They say as soon as it was free, it flew off and ended up in a nearby pine tree. That is a good place for it. Have you ever wanted to be like james bond?

>> Yes.

>> Chilly start to the morning. Take a look at your temps right now. There you go. 12 degrees in minneapolis. 26 in chicago. Certainly colder than we were the last few days. We saw some record-breaking high temperatures earlier this week. Now we have got the cold temperatures. No big precipitation to be had. Take a look at your first alert forecast for the day. In across the northeast there will be some snow. It's snow flying across the great lakes. But maybe 2 to 3 inches a couple areas more than that will not make its way to the coast. See sunshine along the coast. Certainly much cooler than it was yesterday. Down to the southeast. Also cooler. This front extended all the way down through at least central florida. Talking about cool conditions. Only 61 in new orleans. 52 in atlanta. Into the northern plains also cool. See a little snow across u.P. Of michigan.

Pot is still illegal at the federal level. Users can be prosecuted. Dozens in the law enforcement community are urging the department of justice not to interfere with the state's rights. Joining us now is kneel franklin. He is the director of law enforcement against prohibition. He co-wrote the letter to attorney general eric holder saying the justice department should abide by colorado's new law. Also, joining us, is bishop ron allen head of the international faith based coalition and a former drug addict. Good morning to both of you. 

[01:52:30]


>> Good morning, dave. 
>> Kneel, let me start with you in a letter you wrote to eric holder. You say this is not a challenge. This is invitation. Why do you want the doj to stay out of this? I should tell our viewers you are a former narcotics regional commander for the maryland state police so you know of what you speak. Why do you want the doj to stay out. 
>> Not just me. 73 other criminal justice professionals from our organization, law enforcement against prohibition. We want eric holder to give it a chance. The voters decided, the voters are educated today and in colorado and washington they decided that they want to give this a g they realize that their communities have become extremely violent from the prohibition of marijuana, nationally across this country we arrest over 830,000 men and women every year. Most of those arrestees are black. And we stand a better chance of keeping marijuana away from our children in a regulated and controlled market. Under the policies of prohibition, kids can gain access, dealers do not ask for i.D. They do not ask for proof of your age. All they want to see is the money. And so we'll have a reded number of access points for our children. 
>> Bishop ron allen what do you think of the notion that this could prevent children from getting their hands on marijuana? 
>> Neil franklin is so misguided and so is lee. He is an unethical contradictive group of drug legalizers who at one time neil franklin took an oath to uphold the laws and enforce the laws of the state of california. Now you guys are saying to different states and especially the state of california, it's okay to break federal law. That's a total contradiction. And you guys are not. 
>> We're not saying it's okay. 

[01:54:30]


>> Law enforcement. There is no way possible that you can think that by legalizing marijuana will decrease the use. You know neil franklin if you decrease the harm perception of any drug, it will go up. It will be used more. And if you make it more available, it's going to go up. We see that right now. We have 80% increase among our youth. 
>> More available under prohibition. I have listened to you. It's already more available under prohibition because we have drug dealers on just about every corner. Time to get oit off the corners and regulated stores and markets. Our organization does not promote the use of any drug. Including those that are legal. 
>> Neil, you are promoting. You are promoting. We already have illegal drugs. We have two drugs that are legal. Tobacco that's legal. We're not doing a good job with that. 
>> Let's talk about tobacco. 
>> And we have alcohol that's legal. 
>> Let's talk about the tobacco. 
>> You want to legalize one of the most addictive drug, neil. 
>> Real quickly on tobacco, go ahead. 
>> Let's talk about tobacco over the past couple of decades through education and treatment we have reduced the consumption of tobacco almost in half. Don't tell me we can't -- 
>> -- still have problems with tobacco. 
>> Yeah but it would be worse under the policies of prohibition. 
>> We expect just like with alcohol prohibition. 
>> Let the bishop continue, neil bishop allen go ahead and have the last word here. 
>> We expect eric holder to uphold the act, we expect eric holder to uphold federal law. 
>> Okay. 
>> We expect eric holder to do his job and neil franklin and thinking for one moment that by legalizing marijuana or any illicit drug will decrease time. 
>> We have to leave it there. Let me know on twitter dave briggs tv what should d.J. Do. We'll have "fox & friends" after these break. Thank you both.S that's one smart board. What else does it do, reverse gravity?

[02:02:37]


>> J.R. 
>> Wait a minute. 
>> This is your style, j.R. My wife and the man who put cliff barnes in office. 
>> You got in plenty of trouble before y'all were married yond why you would think she would change. 
>> Stop. Knock it off. Both of you. 
>> Hagman, of course, west known for his role as the villain j.R. Ewing on dallas. He lost his battle with cancer yesterday at a dallas hospital. His co-star on the show linda gray had this to say on the star's passing. Larry hagman was my best friend for 35 years. He was the pied piper of life and brought joy to everyone he knew. I will miss him enormously. He was the son of broadway star mary martin. He was also a star on I dream of genie. 
>> In came one of our makeup artist and there is the iconic dallas music that reminds me of my childhood. They said they had watch parties, everyone came. Everyone worshipped in her words j.R. 
>> That western icon. You know, that's why people from japan come over and they want to go see the grand canyon and see the western cowboy. 
>> Consulate american villain image. Great. Meanwhile violent protests erupting across he egypt after president mohammed morsi gives himself new sweeping powers. Angry rioters storm the offices of government muslim brotherhood and are demanding morsey be thrown out of office o. 
>> Meanwhile temperatures cooling down between israel and gaza after a deadly clash yesterday. Israeli soldiers shot and killed a gaza resident who was attempting to breach the border there. Conor powell with the latest on the cease-fire still holding strong, connor? 
>> Three days into this cease-fire agreement and it is still holding. It appears we are moving further and awrtd away from the brink of war. Life is beginning to return to normal in gaza and in israel. Perhaps the most encouraging sign right now is that the heavy equipment in the troops that were massing on the border were move into gaza. There was around have been. Those heavy equipment and troops are being pulled back from the border. Things like bulldozers and armored personnel carriers and tanks they have begun to be pulled back. Some of the 40,000 or so israeli tourists called up are being released and sent back to their normal civilian lives. This is a part of moving away from the brink of war. Another encouraging sign schools are we opening in both israel and in gaza. Yesterday israeli children in southern israel they went back to school with the removal of the threat of bombs and rockets, life is getting back to normal in southern israel. Today gaza. Palestinian children there they return to school as well. Markets are beginning to reopen. Now over the next c are still big chalsz for this cease-fire agreement. Obviously yesterday one of the big challenges was the fact that there was a violation, according to both israeli and hamas leaders of the cease-fire agreement. But with the shooting of one palestinian and 19 others injured. Neither side really took any steps to ramp up the inflammatory comment that we normally see here with this type of incident. Both sides are trying to keep cooler heads to prevail right now, guys. 

[02:06:11]


>> Conor powell three days in saying the peace treaty holding strong. 
>> Someone who knows all about the middle east and israel he has visited many times governor mike huckabee he joins us from florida. Hope you are having a great thanksgiving down there. 
>> You know, alisyn, I had a great thanksgiving and I hope you guys did, too. 
>> We did. Thank you so much, governor. The author of the brand new book dear chandler, dear scarlet. There it is. How would you strike this book, governor before we dive in some of our discussion on israel family book? 
>> Yeah, the best way to say it it's a book for any parent or I can't grandparent who wants to understand how to talk to your kids or grand kids about the big things in their life and connect them to the past in an says tore. The fact is it's an entertaining book. By the time that your kids or grand kids are old enough to hear your stories, you are too old to tell them. The point is write it down now while they are still young enough that they're not going to listen but one day they will want to and you will be able to tell them about it by putting it in writing. 
>> Let's get back to the situation about israel and hamas. And what happened over the last couple of days. The cease firewall appears to be holding. Here is what liz cheney has to say about the situation. We will have you react to that. Here is this. 
>> It's important to remind people that the israelis withdrew from gaza unilaterally, handed that territory over to the palestinians, so, you know, when you hear people saying well the problem here is the israelis aren't willing to give up land for peace. What we're skiing on the screen unfolds tells you the palestinian does not want. Hamas does not want to live in peace. They have no concerns at all about killing israeli civilians or putting their own missile launchers in places where their own civilians will be killed. And this president and this administration's policy of really withdrawing from the world. Retreating from the region. Have put iran in a position where they, tskt, feel emboldened. 

[02:08:14]


>> Has the president's policies anything to do with the situation in the middle east? 
>> I don't think you can blame this one on the president so much as you just blame it on the fact that there is ongoing hostility and there always is going to be between the arab nations and in this case the palestinians and the israelis. You have got to understand there are people who don't think israel should exist. Palestinians don't acknowledge the existence of israel. You can't make peace with people who don't think you audited to be alive. The naivete. Remind ourselves hamas is a terrorist organization. That's not my definition but that's the definition of even our own government. That means they are criminals. Hamas is criminal enterprise. You don't see the police gng out into the streets trying to say let's negotiate with the criminals and just be all august happen and nice to each other. You deal with criminals by thught people away. You have deal with hamas and try to put them away. It's knive to think they will change their ways. 
>> Let's talk about the turbulence at home involving the situation in benghazi. Congressman had a suggestion we would like to know if you think that this is possible saying, basically, that the president has said the buck stops with him so maybe he should be the one testifying. Let's listen to what he says. 
>> If senator mccain and senator graham and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me. 
>> Instead of taking up for susan rice, here is a deal i will make with the president. You come in her placend testify before congress and answer our questions. 
>> Governor, never going to happen. 
>> No. It's not going to happen. But I think congressman gowdy who is one of my favorites because he is so plain spokane spoken and clear. The president tried defend susan rice. If he doesn't want to own up about benghazi then come himself. If he says the buck stops with him they can come after me. Okay then go to congress and tell us what happened. Somebody is not telling us the truth from this administration and it's high time we found out what really did happen and why it happened and who covered it up. 

[02:10:28]


>> Is susan rice now scot-free? We heard from james clapper's office basically looked at the revised it. They took out the words al qaeda in its place and put islamic extremist. Is susan rice now free and clear here and does james clapper and his office need to be held accountable. >>? 
>> I don't think anybody is free and clear because the story keeps changing. This is the most evolving story. I think, you know, since the episodes of dallas and who shot j.R. We don't know. The reason we don't know is because they tell us a different story every week. I think it's like throwing spatting strands against the wall hoping something sticks. At the keep throwing a story out there hoping we believe one of them the more stories you we've weave the less believable they become. My father always said if you tell the truth you don't have to remember what you said yesterday. That simple common sense answer somebody maybe ought to share that with the white house and the people in the state department and the director of national intelligence. 
>> Governor, stick around. Up next he was convicted of driving drunk and killing his friend instead of going to jail, a judge sentenced this young man to church for 10 years. Does the punishment fit the crime? We'll ask the governor next. 
>> Then kids, please don't try this at the mall. Wisconsin teenager making a giant splash from the second floor of a shopping center. This is not a good idea. 
>> Not bad form though, really. ]

[ Male Announcer ] IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR. Time for campbell's green bean casserole. You'll find the recipe at campbellskitchen.Com. ?????? ?????? campbell's. It's amazing what soup can do. 
>> So years of mandatory church attendances that was the sentence handed down by oklahoma judge. The church attendance was agreed to by the victim's family. The aclu is now calng it unconstitutional and a violation of the first amendment. Continue now with governor mike huckabee. What do you think of this sentence 10 years of going strog go to church instead of prison? 
>> The church boy side of me likes this. This is a good thick for a kid to go to church. The fact the victim's family agreed to it is all good. This may surprise you. The constitutional side of me says the aclu is right on this one. Here is the thing. If you sentenced someone to go to a mosque for 10 years, question is how would christians feel about that? Probably wouldn't be all that happy. And they would scream first amendment or if someone was sentenced to go to atheist meeting for the next 10 years or to sun worship society. The point is that's really not the domain of the criminal justice system. Again, I don't think there is anything wrong with the boy going to church. The judge can recommend it. To order it as a part of the sentence that may cross the line. I hate to admit it and I may get nasty letters. 

[02:16:50]


>> I agree. 
>> At some point you can't have the government dick take the what people believe and how they worship? 
>> You have the families who agree with the aclu says no what sort of a precedent does it if someone thinks they can drive drunk the only punishment the slap on the wrist I'm going to get is having to go to church every sunday? 
>> I mean if the judge can sentence to you go to church, can he sentence to you tithe, he can sentence to you memorize a certain number of bible verses a week. And you know ultimately I come to from the christian perspective that says going to church tithing, reading the bible, ought to be something that we do out of our conscience, not because it's a criminal conviction and an order by the judge. 
>> Also not clear how in the world that would be enforced but that's another segment. What's coming up on the show tonight, governor. 
>> We got a great show. Johnny eric. Quad plea jik since 17. Her remarkable story is stunning. Scott mcintyre here the finalist on "american idol" who is just amazing. A powerful story of how he and his father after years of alienation came back together and restored their relationship it is a very powerful thanksgiving weekend show and folks will enjoy and I think be inspired by it. 
>> Governor I have got to ask you where you go. Do you always travel with a stack of books behind you or are you at a book signing. 
>> If no one buys them I have them behind me that and a it's shameless promotion. Of course it is. 
>> Great thanksgiving book. Check out governor huckabee's brand new book "dear chandler, dear scarlt out on book shelves now. 
>> There you go. 
>> Left in the dark for weeks after super storm sandy hit. Why did the long island power authority just bill its customers as if the outages never happened.

>> Welcome back, everybody. Some quick headlines now, former boxing champ hector macho camacho will be taken off life support today at the request of his mother. Doctors are waiting until his three sons arrive in puerto rico this morning. Camacho was declared brain dead after being shot in the face on tuesday and this los angeles gang member no longer on the fbi's most wanted list after being caught in mexico. Luis scienceas extradited back to l.A. Where he now faces kidnapping and multiple murder charges. Clayton. 
>> Dave, more american workers are feeling the fall out from obama care. Community college in pennsylvanan the the hours of part time staffers to avoid the costs tied to the healthcare law. Could a move like this have a domino effect on other company on fox business network. Is he making a special appearance on fox news saturday. 
>> Good to be here. 
>> Defines as 40 hours a week or more. What's happening at the community college how are they skirting this. 
>> This particular college are moving 200 adjunct faculty members and 200. 
>> Part time you mean. 
>> Moving them down to 25 hours a week, that's it. If you work more than 30 hours you are a employee and therefore you have to -- your employer must provide healthcare to you under obama care. So there is a shift to part time work. And the restaurant industry, now in college and other industries across the country? Is that because the workweek was redefined. We always knew a workweek as 40 hours. 
>> Yes, in many respects that is true. Under obama care, you work more than third hours in a week, you are full-time. And if a company has 50 or more full-time employees, they must provide what the law defines as adequate coverage. But nobody knows what is adequate coverage. Therefore, you have got to take precautions because what is adequate coverage? How expensive is it going to be? You simply don't know. So you avoid the problem by shifting people to fewer hours. Which is is a real problem for those people who won't get more hours. 

[02:24:45]


>> With this shaky economy, stewart, something you follow very closely in the stock market and other sectors of business, can we afford this right now? When you look at small costs the overall economy handle this right now. 
>> You put your finger on the precise problem. We went into this healthcare reform, the objective was surely to lower the cost of healthcare. Cost of health insurance. It simply does not. It actually raises it. And what this does, obama care when it comes to the full force january 1st, 2014, when it hits fully it, will raise the cost of doing business for countless businesses and industries across the country. To to answer your question, in my opinion we cannot afford it. 
>> Who are already facing massive regulations on top of now this save about $6 million move, if you move your employees down. 
>> What this particular college is doing is shortening the hours of a lot of employees. That saves them money and they're already squeezed on costs. And it removes the legal responsibility of providing health care come january the 1st, 2014. 
>> Saves you on two fronts. who wants to work more hours this is not good news. Anybody who wants a full-time job and wants to keep the full-time job and not make it part time. Obama care is bad news across the board. 
>> People forget that these tax increases can be businesses alike. This another case where this happens. Stu varney thanks for beingy this morning. 
>> My flesh. 9:20 eastern time on the fox business network. 
>> Stu, thanks so much. 
>> Next up on the run down, big labor boycott at wal-mart on black friday. Did the union protesters actually have the opposite effect on wal-mart? We have the details straight ahead?

Keith ablow about that this psychosis that takes over. are... And you learned something along the way. This is the age of knowing what you're made of.

>> Well, are you all just making it home from black friday? It's causing chaos all across the country taking a oklahoma. 
>> Ladies, 12.5 for yoga pants is a good deal. But let's not get out of hand and stop wearing the yoga pants everywhere. It's not casua 
>> I don't mind. I think it's shapely. I don't mind seeing the yoga pants. 
>> Move on to georgia. That's where a wal-mart. People pushed, shoved, they even bit one another trying to get their hands on sale items. 
>> That's understandable. Cops arresting this woman at a wal-mart in florida. Police say she tried to cut the long checkout lines when she was confronted she refused to get to the back of the line, started throwing her merchandise,cops down. Wow, was the tackle necessary? She don't have merchandise. Let's hope things aren't quite as chaotic today mom and pop shops in america. 
>> That's right. Today is small business saturday. Let's go to wdas kerry, local toy and gift shop in kansas city, missouri. It got a little ugly in oberland park kansas not far from where you are little calmer on small business saturday?

[02:33:02]


>> Why are small businesses still such a huge part of americana. What services do you offer that you can't get in big box store. 
>> People love personal touch. If you tell us you have a 2-year-old boy that is very active or 4-year-old girl that's girlie, we can take you to the right gift. A lot of grandparents wouldn't know what to get or even parents. And you know we can show you the latest item. And gift wrap it for you. And help you to your car if you like. 
>> That's great. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Jim and for all the puppets and the fun this morning that we have been having all morning long. I'm kerry we're fox 4 news. Back to you. 
>> We need to get an outline as a -- owl on a co-host on the show.

>> Unfortunately, it's normal. Because the combination of rarity and opportunity unleashes something in human beings that result in this stampede mentality. After all a pair of yoga pants if it were the fact that you were just at the street corner would you like to buy this at half price you couldn't get a line to were fovment the fact that we put out the word, it's rare, in short supply the opportunity is you make a little money and spend less. That touches something in the human party. 
>> You also must touch something in the human brain, dr. Ablow. People get out of their beds at midnight and they are willing to go and stand in cold lines for hours at a time. They even resort to violence. I mean. Is this an addiction? 

[02:35:16]


>> Well, what it is it is a perfect storm because we consumers, we american consumers consumers around the world the reason the economy works is people really want these things. It's become perhaps tuch a substitute for real identity if you will. People really need these things of the. And when you then combine that with the fact that these are in shorter supply. Not everybody can have them. And that you are going to get money emotional and intellectually perfect storm it unleashes these ties. People standing in line for the iphone. That wasn't even about the fact it was less money. Simply not everyone can have one. Competition is so deep in the american and worldwide soul that it unleashes at this moment. On a black friday. The name doesn't help either. 
>> Do the stores in this case have any responsibility to try to calm this situation down and do something differently? I know a lot are trying to spread out the deals. What can be done I think you could spread this out more than one shopping day. Stage this so that only a certain number of people are allowed in the store at a certain time. You could time it the way that you used to time, you know, school, you know, classes if you had more than one session in your school. So the bottom line is yes, they could. But, you know, I think there is also something about this that can't be well controlled and that's simply. This that if if a particular thing is captured, the american imagination, this day, that we're all going to be become super consumers. It's tough to stem really the momentum of that kind of belief system. 
>> You could actually have workers walking down the line before they open and say what are you planning on buying and give they have vouchers so they know they have those items and not tackle. 
>> Some people were selling those vouchers were profit on fry day. 
>> Scalping the vouchers. 
>> Can't win. Amazing thing. Of course there is competition between retailers. So have you competition upon competition and it's an exponential kind of mushroom clowted. 

[02:37:24]


>> That's where I take it. 
>> Too much yoga pants. 
>> You can never have too many go go pants. 
>> Thank you dr. Ablow on that. Here are the headlines. Despite their best efforts black friday protesters did not seem to hurt wal-mart's sales. 
[Chanting] around a thousand protests were expected around the country. According to a statement released by wal-mart only 26 protests actually took place and most of the participants were not even wal-mart employees. Wal-mart says this was the retailer's best black friday ever. Wal-mart estimates it sold more than 1.8 million towels. 1.3 million televisions. 1.3 million dolls. And 250,000 bicycles. Okay. Meanwhile, long island hurricane sandy victims went weeks without power and some of whom are still in the dark this morning are being slapped with normal electricity bills. Long island power authority sent out bills charging customers the regular estimated rate, with no mention of refunds for storm blackouts. Angry residents say they have tried to get ahold at someone at line pa but no one ever picks up the phone. 
>> Maybe their phone service is out. 
>> Most people go to the mall to shop. But at one canadian mall. This man chose to jump into a swimming pool instead. Something we would not recommend by the way. That is probably not the smartest move in the world. A man decided to jump off the second story at mall in alberta. The shopper reportedly got away without being caught. That's a problem waiting to happen balcony dangling over a swimming pool. 
>> I don't agree showing that. You will get other kids doing that. 
>> Copycat?

>> Thousands of protesters. Morsey giving himself wide powers after helping to broke ear middle east cease-fire. People say morsey is acting like dictator. Earlier this week obama administration was praising morsey for his help. 
>> Let me note our particular gratitude to president morsey of egypt for his commitment to regional security as well as to u.N. Secretary general bon can I moon for his diligent efforts and of course president obama and secretary clinton have worked tirelessly to bring the parties to agreement. 
>> How should the u.S. Handle morsey now. Lt. Ravel peters joins us. Nice to sigh. Morsey has said I want to be president of all egypt. Every egyptian. He said I simply did this power grab or didn't put in those words, I simply did these decrees because there are all members of the mubarak regime the guys you threw out that are still lurking that I'm trying to protect you from. Do you buy that. 
>> I think what president morse is I was really say something hey, democracy is great. 
-- Each mubarak felt obliged to pay deference to the judiciary. You have to go to saddam hussein to find somebody who has seized so much power. Basically morsi says nothing matters except what I say matters. It's a terrible embarrassment to the obama administration after all the gush this week. It's curious because we did doo this to ourselves all the time. Morsi was engaging hate speech to israel all during the gaza campaign. Able to broker a cease-fire because hamas was hurting really, really badly. And suddenly our president and his -- elevated this guy to the status of global statesman and morsi turns around beings back hands him and says well that's enough democracy. 

[02:46:47]


>> He saw his name in the top of the headlines in newspapers around the world for the guy who managed to broker this peace agreement between israel and hamas and here he goes a power grab. Now, that's all in the past. So now how do we handle egypt and president morsi going forward? After all, we give them billions of dollars every year in financial aid to be a linchpin of peace in that region. What do we do? 
>> It's tough. After you have engaged in this orgy of gushing how great a guy morsi is. We weren't in a position to keep mubarak in power. We are not in a position to remove mercy is i. We do have leverage because of our direct aid. Because of our voice in the international monetary fund, which is -- whose aid is very important to egypt's development. And morsi's fundamental problem is a very weak, anemic, recessive egyptian economy. So hit him where it hurts if necessary. Right now it is necessary. Certainly for the moment. Until he acknowledges that the courts have their power. Until he accepts coptic christians have to have a voice in writing the new constitution which is what this is all about, the newer party, the muslim brotherhood want sharia brotherhood behind the constitution. Fine, can you do what you want, but we are not going to fund you while you are doing it a problem here is simply that the democracy as we know in our own system is messy. Isit requires patience it requires begrudging compromise. The only tradition is the tradition of the strong man. When things become very frustrating as is you seen in iraq with neuroly al maliki. As is you see with morsi in egypt. Become dictatorial.

>> welcome back, from sear ago perfect steak to speaking a different language. What if you could become world class at any skill you wish to become in a short period of time. 
>> Author and human guinea pig recipe for success. Cooked it up and served it in his new book "the 4-hour chef" thank for being with us. 
>> Thank you for having me. 
>> Big book. 
>> All sorts of pursuits not just cooking why did you focus on cooking. 
>> I focused on cooking. My readers have been accelerated reader. Cooking is one of the skills that had beaten me over and over. Quit inconvenient. Took too much time. What better way the world's fastest learners to tackle this thing that had beaten me. 
>> There is something about your personality that says look I stink at this thing and I want to fix it whether it's learning a language. You couldn't speak any languages you decided to learn 20 different languages. Tango dancer. You became a world breaking tango dancer and couldn't put on dance shoes before. How do you do that. 
>> First step I take is look at people who are good at something that shouldn't be. You find 250-pound guy who runs ultra marathons or find the 35-year-old who becomes a world class swim coach who couldn't swim beforehand. Then you look at what they are doing that other people are not doing. Can you apply that to learning a language in 8 to 12 weeks. Look at michelle thomas, michel who is intelligence officer in europe. You can apply it to chess. It applies to almost anything. 
>> Language is a big one. People get those programs that they learn spanish or french. How should you learn to speak a language in a short period of time? 
>> I want to learn spanish. 
>> The first thing you have to do is choose the 20% of material or even less. For language it's like 2% that will give you 80% or more of the results. For instance you only have to learn about 1200 words to be function nally fluent in a given language. It's finding those words first and foremost and there is a great company called vis-ed that offers those type of flash cards. 

[02:54:34]


>> That applies to everything. 20% that matters most of whatever it is you want to learn. 
>> You say deacon destruction what does that mean? 
>> Deacon destruction is breaking a big skill like say learning spanish say or tango down into smaller pieces. Swimming how do the arms move? How do the legs move and then removing the failure points. I couldn't swim for 30 years i grew up on long island. It's embarrassing. I had to take out a method that took out the kicking that always exhaued me total immersion you swim without kicking. 
>> I swim with a tiny fck of each foot and I don't get tired. 
>> That's what the pros do. All swim something mostly in your arms. Selection. What can I eliminate. Get rid of the things like the language that you don't need, just focus on what you need. 
>> Exactly. That applies to cooking where you would choose the methods that you can mess up the most but still get amazing results like braising, for instance. The first recipe in the book is easier to make for four people than scrambled eggs for one person. You have to choose the right method. 
>> Easier to make than say. 
>> Exactly. 
>> We could talk to you about this for an hour because we all want to learn something really fast that we are bad at. We have to stay our incompetentselves. The metta learning three is sequencing. Step four is stakes. The four hour chef you can learn the michelin two star bathroom sink meal. A man of many talents thank you for being here.

>> Clayton: Equivalent to sweat pants.

>> Jr. 
>> Now, wait a minute. 
>> This is your style, jr, my wife and the man that put cliff barnes in office. 
>> Your wife got in plenty of trouble before you got married, I don't understand why you think she'd change. 
>> Wait-- 
>> hagman best known for his role jr ewing on dallas and lost his battle. His co-star on the show had this to say.

>> Clayton: And that was a great theme song and in band and the song we played in concert. I used to love that. 
>> Dave: Reminds me of the childhood, one time the family sat and watched dallas. 
>> Clayton: Friday night. 
>> Dave: I believe it was friday night and reminds me of growing up, he was a legend. And violent protests erupting across egypt after morsi gives himself new sweeping powers and angry rioters stormed the offices of muslim brotherhood and demanding that morsi be thrown out of office, to continue our coverage of this this morning, the unrest in the middle east and connor powell live from jeruselem following a cease-fire and peter doocy is following the reaction in washington to the violent protests, we begin with connor, good morning to you. 
>> Good mornings all-out war that seemed so likely in the holy land is seeming more unlikely. And life to returning to normal after the cease-fire is continuing to hold here in gaza. And one of the big steps taken is that the israeli troop and mobilization of equipment on the gaza-israeli border now seems to be moving in the opposite direction, bulldozers, tanks, armored personnel carrierses that would have been used for a ground invasion, ner being moved away from the gaza-israeli borders and so, too, are the troops. And 40,000 israeli reservists are being released and sent back to normal civilian life. Life is beginning to return to normal in israel and gaza and another step, school children in both southern israel and gaza went back to school and southern israel the school children head back yesterday and in gaza, the palestinian children, they went back to school today. So, life is becoming more and more normal here and there's a lot of fear and tension about the future, but for now, the cease-fire is holding, it was tested yesterday after a shooting along the border in which left one palestinian man dead, and 19 others injured, but both sides took steps to tamper down the inflammatory language and beginning to work towards a more sustainable peace in the next few days and weeks. Egypt will host from hamas to work on a concrete foundation for the cease-fire and the top priority what is meant by the easing of restrictions in the blockade, and both sides are working with the egyptian and american government to try to force some sort of concrete agreement going forward, guys. 

[03:07:02]


>> Dave: That's connor powell live for us. 
>> Clayton: Thanks, connor, and let's go to peter doocy, violent protests sparked up in egypt in response to president mohammed morsi and his late power grab this week. 
>> Good morning, the supreme court judicial council in egypt says that president morsi's power grab is unprecedented attack on judicial-- and calling on him to reverse it and the move to make decisions above the law and free he from judicial review until the parliamen surprising. And the president called president morsi to thank him for effort and reaffirm the close partnership between the united states and egypt. Last night the state department issued a statement expressing reservations about what he's doing and made clear in their view the actions he's taking conflict with the idea that fueled the arab spring a year ago. The state department says one of the aspirations of the revolution was to ensure that power would not be overly concentrated in the hands of any one person or institution, and the current constitutional vacuum ingypt can only be resolved by a constitution that includes checks and balances and respects fundamental freedoms and rule of law consistent with egypt's international commitments. And el baradei is more blunt and twitter, morsi usurped all parents and' pointed himself egypt's new garo, a major blow that could have dire consequences. Only a little more than five months since morsi became egypt's first democratically elected president and hands out leaflets saying that the protests are legitimate. Back to you. 

[03:09:08]


>> Clayton: Peter doocy, let's waste no time michelle malcolm from colorado a fox news contributor. Perspective on this, michelle. President morsi saying I want to be president of all egyptians and really the only reason I did any of these sort of decrease was to keep out the former mubarak regime. Do you buy that, number one, and how do you think the obama administration should handle him now? 
>> Yeah, well, I certainly don't buy it and my opinion matters a lot less than the people in egypt who are now saying, we told you so. And this was long telegraphed that these kind of power grabs are exactly what you could expect from the front man for the muslim brotherhood. And the obama administration is making all of the expected obligatory gestures of finger wagging at morsi, but they backed this administration and their followers, basically admonished anyone who raised concerns about morsi's proclivities of being a quote, islamofobe. 
>> And they can hardly be accused of islam-phobia warning about the encroachment of power. And the biggest canary in the coal mine has been the press because its dissidents on tv, satellite channels and in social media who have been talking about the crackdown on criticism of any kind. I mean, even the most moderate of criticism of the morsi administration. It's a sad situation, but perfectly expected. 
>> On the flip side was the praise that the obama administration heaped on egypt and they're handling their government, in particular, susan rice just the other day talked glowingly about morsi and what he did there and brokering this peace agreement. Charles krauthammer suggesting what happened is heaped-- 

[03:11:17]


>> what a lot of people see are the pats on the back not just by the obama administration, but by morsi himself, patting himself on the back and basically flipping the bird to people who believed in democracy and freedom in egypt. As for susan rice, one might give her the benefit of the doubt and call it naivete, but for the longest time she and her ilk in government service and state departmenve been jihad coddlers. 
>> Do you think it's time to withdraw or delay the massive amounts of money that we give to egypt? 
>> Well, yeah, I've always questioned the billions of dollars that we've spent there and certainly, it isn't yielding the rainbows and uncorner results that we were promised. 
>> Do we have a reid war in the making. Colorado and washington state voted on legalizing, and michelle malcolm. We'll ask her about that. 
>> A trap set for another animal, but it called a bald eagle instead. Who finally came to the rescue of the symbol of our nation. line, ]

And should eric holder and the justice department step in. We're back with michelle malcolm. How excited are you about the legalization of pot in your state? 
>> There's already a medical marijuana shop on every corner. I've long had libertarian tendencies on a lot of issues, and seeing the overzealousness enforcement of drug laws in the country, more harm than good. All that said I'm concerned about the slippery slope, as we all should be, but I think from a political point of view, it is a little bit amusing to see the feds now in this position, this quandary that the doj is in of having to negotiate with the states, you know, fairly liberal states on how to enforce or rather, not enforce these laws and trump the will of the people. The thing is the states voted for this, this is what they've determined and a lot of the backing here came from, believe it or not, police chief and law enforcement. 
>> And do you see the double standard here, guys. It's interesting within oun hand the department of justice saying we're the not going to pay attention to what you did down there in arizona in relation to the immigration law, you forced it, but you did it, we're not going to enforce it, and now we may have to step in and enforce something? 
>> Yes, that's exactly the depolitical point and ideological point because you've got the collective federalism on the part of many people and it does show up as hipocracy, certainly of a lot of the leftists who champion their ballot measures, whether it's gay marriage or legalization of marijuana or even much, you know, harder drugs, which is another huge concern. But then want the feds to get involved if it has to do with things that they disagree with, tea party causes, limited government. Taxes, collective bargaining, voter i.D., Election fraud, and of course, immigration issues.

By the way, the odds of winning, 1 in 175,223,510, won't stop me. And do you have bad knees? Better layoff the soda, the more soda men drink, the higher the risk of getting arthritis in their knees. Researchers say it's weight gain and soda chemicals that weaken the knees. And so I rock the coffee, ali. 
>> Alisyn: As we've been reporting shall, the christian owned and operated craft store is battling obamacare, the owner of hobby lobby says it forced to provide contraception to employees and he a claim he violates its religious beliefs. They repeal their case, but can they win? The national operations at the american center for law and justice joins us live from tennessee, hi, jordan? 
>> Hi, how are you. 
>> Alisyn: Doing well. In round one the judge basically said he was sympathetic to hobby lobby's concerns about having to cause some form-- having to provide some forms of birth control and even the morning after pill to their employees, they're morally opposed to that, but he basically said that hobby lobby is not a religious institution, not a catholic hospital, not a catholic university, not a catholic church, they have to do it, does hobby lobby stand a chance? 
>> I think they do. Here is why, in the 10th circuit where it's located in colorado, actually, the same circuit court system as oklahoma, a judge has done the the operate sit with a privately owned business, a regularly owned company not religious organization or nonprofit company. What's tough for some of the judges, it's new. The federal government has never done this type of attack on the freedom of religious and restoration act by president clinton, and makes a high bar and strict scrutiny and set a law as of now, press of citizen awe nighted and said that the private corporations and companies have first amendment rights with free speech. So you would any, well, the other rights, like freedom of religion, why wouldn't that apply as well. Three out of four judges of 40 cases that are active say this is unconstitutional and one judge denied a preliminary injunction and another who tossed out the case are moving now toward the circuit court and this is a major discussion point, as you said, alisyn with the specific companies, and we haven't gotten to the nonexempted religious organization cases yet because they don't have to comply until this coming august and these had started complying months ago. 

[03:25:52]


>> Can you break it down for sort of dies for the people who don't have legal degrees and break it down for us, is this about whether or universal health care and this federal law trumped first amendment rights or whatever first amendment rights trumped the federal government's obamacare? 
>> And what it's about, it's about does, did the three exercise religions as the constitutional rights of ividuals, private businesses, owners of these companies, the ceo's, the people who write the mission statement and founded the company, the majority shareholders, do those rights are they more important than what the federal government wants to give for free to your employees? 
>> And there's some discussion, is it the employees who have the rights and is it the owners? There's never been a found in the constitution as broad as the courts interpreted, cueses a constitutional right to work at hobby lobby. So all the 13,000 employees, which by the way, hobby lobby if they don't win this, would be fined $100 per employee a day. So 1.3 million dollars a day for not providing the morning after pill for free and not providing the week after pill for free. You don't have a right to work there and employees are not complaining and that's where you see the tensions the first amendments, rights we have as religious people, as americans, have been the most important rights and the freedom of religion is the first right there. If the court is going to apply free speech rights and a more controversial world of politics where corporations caspend money as speech and run advertising by citizen's awe nighted. 
>> Right. 
>> Why on earth would you deny the free exercise rights. 
>> They're complicated and we'll see what happens. Thanks so much for sharing your expertise with us. 
>> Thanks, alisyn.

The temps across the ohio valley and mississippi river valley have really dropped, you're around 22 degrees colder than you were 24 hours ago in dallas and certain the colder air moving in and it's going to last for a couple of days and warm back up into an aggressive pattern here, and see the snow across the northeast by tuesday and in the meantime, take a look at the forecast for the day today. Plenty of sunshine along the coast, but it's going to be chilly, certainly chillier than yesterday and see snow across the interior sections around the great lakes.

[03:43:36]


>> Well, no escaping it, in just over a month the nation faces a so-called fiscal cliff. That's those 500 billion dollars in tax hikes and spending cuts set to take effect in january unless congress can reach a deal and get something done. The big question remains, should republicans agree to raise taxes on the wealthy to get that deal done? Let's ask steven moore, editorial board, good morning to you, steven. 
>> Hi, good morning. 
>> John boehner is clear, he does not want to raise rates, he wants to give in if at all on deductions and write-offs saying they can essentially write off the same amount for the treasury, what should republicans do here? 
>> It's an interesting dilemma the republicans find themselves in, dave. Most of them, as you know, have taken this no tax pledge, which is the pledge to voters that they won't raise taxes on anybody, and so, now president obama is saying we're going to raise the taxes on the rich and he won't sign any bill that doesn't have a tax increase on the rich, so, the two parties are still at logger heads. I personally think given the still fragility of this economic recovery, the economy still isn't sputtering on one cylinder now, and high unemployment. It doesn't make sense to me to raise taxes on businesses or investors. That's where we stand right now. I don't see an agreement anytime really soon because the two sides are still so far apart. 
>> I'm a betting man, steven, would you imagine that the house republicans would give on raising rates for the wealthy? They certainly have to acknowledge that the tax-- the bush tax cuts for those making less than 250 have to be extended, that has to happen. 
>> That's right, that's right. 
>> Dave: What about the top 2%? What about happen in your best guest? 
>> What john boehner said, and I interviewed mitch mcconnell the house minority leader in the senate on this and basically their position right now is we will agree he to raise some revenues, we'll do some closing of the loopholes in the tax system, but we're not going to agree to raising tax rates because we think it hurts the economy, it hurts business and it increases unemployment at a time when the economy is still sort of flat on its back, that's why these two sides are still pretty far apart because as you know, last week the president said I will not sign any bill that extends these tax rate reductions for another year for the rich. Right now they're gridlocked, that's all there is to it. This is a classic stalemate between the two parties, i think they will probably reach an agreement, but I wouldn't be surprised if that didn't happen until the day before christmas. 

[03:46:15]


>> Dave: I'm guessing one year extension. And let's hold on to the fact that the democrats say no, we need to raise rights not eliminate deductions and write-offs. Why stick to that essentially the same type of money. Why would they stay there, because of economics or politics? 
>> It's politics. You asked the right question. If it's going to raise the same amount of money, what difference does it make. Two things, the democrats want to be punitive to the rich because they feel the income gap and second, this is kind of a cynical thing to say, but I believe it's a motivation here, a lot of democrats want to kind of erase anything that george w. Bush did. So, they want to kind of erase this from the whole playing field. It's kind of a-- it's an act of symbolism and more than economics and i think they're playing with danger here, investment is low right now. You know the statistics and i said it before on your show. Two out of every three people are going to pay the higher tax rates if we raise the rates, dave. Those are small business men and women, the people who employ american workers. 
>> Dave: Anything that hurts in this economy-- . Thank you, sir. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Dave: Violent protests in egypt and fierce fighting between israel and hamas. And dana perino is here to weigh in next. ???????????? holidays Verizon.

[03:51:22]


>> Welcome back to "fox & friends" on this saturday morning. The obama administration has been under the microscope for its response to the attack in benghazi and four americans killed in that attack and under scrutiny, israel and hamas has come to a cease-fire agreement and whether the policies are to blame in the first place. 
>> Alisyn: Dana, thank you for beinhere. 
>> Happy to be here. Happy thanksgiving weekend. 
>> Let's talk about what morsi had done, a naked power grab where I'm in power here and nothing the judiciary says or does could overrule any of thigh decisions. Some people suggested he was emboldened perhaps by supportive words from washington or is there nothing that washington is doing that could affect what's going on in the middle east? 
>> Well, I think three parts. One, you cannot blame middle east peace problems on any one president because those problems-- 
>> an awful long time. 
>> And it's happening. And morsi, the new egyptian, he, I think, felt early on that power was seductive. What he did yesterday was in completely flies in the face of what the people of egypt had fought for in the arab spring which is they wanted to have more say in their government. It is difficult and you saw this in iraq, as it was trying to build after the war and you had maliki there. And when you're in your democracy and explaining it's not fun when the newspapers criticize them, let it go. Talk to them. Might be a different ato try to do things. When the arab spring happened, how much is america willing to do, with our allies in the west and n.A.T.O., To put forward to help them try to build a democracy. I do think we fell short on that or didn't advertise much of what they did and the efforts fell apart. 

[03:53:25]


>> Dave: And you can't blame the obama administration for tension between hamas and israel, but charles krauthammer did discussion that the praise that president obama heaped on president morsi may have led to what we saw, that power grab. Initially hillary clinton was very complimentary of what morsi and his government did in the cease-fire and susan rice not piled on, but jumped on and complimentary of morsi and should they have been so quick to heap praise on a man we really know nothing about. 
>> Well, perhaps morsi was planning to do something like this or wanted to do something like this all along and that was his target of opportunity, wow I've had my name in the spotlight and I've been seen as a person who helped solve this and I'm now the savior, i think it's hard to imagine that just those words from the past 28 hours or 48 hours, really made that big a difference, but the things are just happening at such a hair trigger over there, that maybe, maybe charles is right. 
>> And charles is usually right, you know, I have a huge crush on him and far be it from me to say that charles krauthammer is wrong. 
>> Clayton: Speaking of a hair trigger, the fiscal cliff, and steven moore putting out questions, should they cave on the bush tax cut or allow the rates to go up or filling the loopholes to drive revenue. You know the back and forth workings of washington so well. What's going on behind the scenes right now? Are the republicans going to cave on that issue? 
>> Well, I know one thing for sure and I'm really glad that I'm not working in washington anymore, because once again, i think that this will go all the way up until maybe the day before christmas eve and finally figure something out. What's sad about this situation is that last february john boehner the speaker of the house at the time sent the letter to the president and said, this fiscal cliff is going to become a huge problem for the economy. Beam are going to be nervous to invest, you see that in the wall street journal this morning, investment dropping oflt let's try to get this done before the polital season gets well underway. President obama says thank you very much, got an election to do and afterwards and now we're coming up against a deadline. Higher taxes leads to less productive and hurts job. You know who else thought that, president obama. In the lame duck of december, 2010, those were his act words in the rose garden why we need today extend the bush tax cuts. 

[03:55:56]


>> Alisyn: Stick around for a minute because 2016 is right around the corner and is jeb bush really considering a run for president? We're going to-- 
>> what's so funny? 
>> And we'll ask in two minutes, stick around. 

[03:59:14]


>> Imagine in 2016, it's clinton versus bush. Will jeb bush run for the republican nomination. 
>> I think he could give it consideration, I think people should be open minded. 
>> Should someone slap us for bringing up 2016 right now. No, because you know, I'll tell you who is thinking about this more than anybody, the democrats, who are they going to run in 2016. 
>> Hillary.

>> Justin: It is actually second down and inches. Martin again. Martin with the effort. Did he get in? He ??does. Touchdown. With some help from his friends.

>> Justin: Aaron jones now on for the extra point. 52-45, baylor strikes with a touchdown on their first air tempt here in overtime. Now it will be texas tech's turn.

>> Eric: We talked about the momentum, and I thought texas tech had it, but now I don't. You know, I really think that baylor has the opportunity now, and I think they are going to -- you know, they put texas tech in a really tough position coming out and scoring a touchdown and not a field goal. 
>> Justin: Don't forget, coming up next, another great matchup from the pac 12 as stanford will take on ucla. If stanford wins, they will go to the pac 12 championship. That game is coming up after us right here on fox. Doege in the shotgun. On first down. Play action. Doege, flag is thrown, another flag is thrown. The pass is complete to foster back at the 29, a loss of four on the play. Let's see what these flags are. It looks like it's holding against texas tech. What do you do here, first and 20 or second and 14? 
>> Referee: Holding, offense, number 68. Ten-yard penalty. Repeat first down. 
>> Justin: Right here. You've got the role. McDANIEL, terry McDaniel, number 68 ON chris McAllister, a guy that's been physical all day long all over the field. 
>> Justin: Terry mcdaniel is the tackle that had the ball bounce off to him and that led to the second interception for eddie lackey. It's first and 20. Quick pass. Was the knee down of moore? They say no? Eddie lackey with the stop. A pickup of five. 
>> Eric: Get another look at it here to see if his knee was actually down. Seth doege, he caught the ball, and I think maybe he was on his way up and that's what the referee saw. 

[00:16:58]


>> Justin: Second down and 15. And it looks like this play will be reviewed. 
>> Eric: It's a tough position for the defensive backs of baylor because if they give him too much cushion they are just going to drive right down the field. If they get in their face they have to be careful because the receivers have been behind them all day. 
>> Justin: Again, the question is was darrin moore's knee down when he made that catch? 
>> Eric: I think he makes the catch, but I think they call him down. 
>> Justin: The replay official is jim blackwood. The ball hit the ground there, and this is going to be an incomplete pass. So now we're going to have second and 20. 
>> Referee: After further review, the pass sin complete. It will be second down from the 35. 
>> Justin: All right. We're joined now by mike prayeria. Mike, what did you see? Did they get this play right? 
>> They got that play right because he didn't possess the ball first before the ball hit the ground. Really possessed it at the same time, and that means that the ground helped you to make the catch, so, therefore, that's the right dsh right call to overturn it to an incomplete pass. 
>> Justin: They get it right here at cowboy stadium, and now it's second down and 20. They need a touchdown. Doege going up high. It's incomplete. Was looking for erik ward. Third and 20 coming up. 

[00:19:15]


>> Eric: I think doege makes the right decision right there. Threw a ball that was a little too high. He was cautious because there was an underneath coverage player sitting right there, so he didn't want to throw aron interception. 
>> Justin: Eric, I've asked this question before. Right now do you try to get all 20 yards or do you try to get a chunk because you've got to go for it on fourth down. 
>> Eric: I think the best way is to get a chunk and put yourself in a better situation for the next fourth down play. 
>> Justin: Doege over the middle. Completes the pass to austin zouzalik. A 15-yard completion, so now fourth and five. And this is the game right here. A time-out will be taken by texas tech. 
>> Eric: Doege makes a really nice throw over the middle zouzalik and comes down with that pass and looking for the first down marker, but he was well short of it. 
>> Justin: Texas tech 7-4 on the season and 4-4 in conference play. They are going to a bowl. They are trying to get to 5-4 in conference play. Would be over .500 for the first time since '09. Baylor, if they can hold on for this victory, will be bowl eligible for the third straight year which would be a first in school history. Robert griffin iii has not left the sidelines. He's been a cheerleader, a coach of sorts down there. And gives us his heisman prediction. 
>> Eric: I don't blame him for not giving us the ballot. 

[00:21:16]


>> Justin: Seth doege on fourth and five. Doege, passing it, incomplete! No flag. Baylor wins! 
>> Eric: Seth doege one, two, three to get rid of it and just tremendous coverage over the top by joe williams. Breaks up that ball. 
>> Justin: Rg3 loves it. His bears win it in overtime. 52-45, and the baylor bears, they are going bowling. Coming up after the brkak, we'll join aaron andrews and joey harrington and eddie george for the post-game show. ?????? ??????

>> The people probably understand what would happen if they didn't show sufficient grief. 
>> Much of this was forced. The state wanted them to behave this way. 
>> And the state was working overtime in the days after kim jong-il's death. They were ensuring that north koreans did not deviate from the ideology and behavior. 

[00:02:08]

>> You say there are tens of thousands of christians in north core use? 
>> There is an underground church. It's ranked the most persecuted church in the world. 
>> The cult of personality established in north korea is probably unlike anything we saw in the 20th century.

>> He believes to have studied in switzerland.

[00:04:13]


>> Korea has been a nation divided by barbed wire, armies, and an unresolved war, stretching back to the enof world war ii. 
>> While the americans took control of the south, the soviet union established the communist north in 1945. Under the leadership of a 33-year-old radical named kim il-sung.

>> By 1948 appointed head of the worker's party. 
>> Over the next decade, the cult of personality established around kim il-sung rivaled any of the 20th century. 
>> They're nothing compared to what kim il-sung did. 
>> In 1955. The north korean government started its bizarre cult-like ideology. 
>> Roughly translates into the national identity, and what it basically says is the north korean people are almost a superior race. And they need to determine the future of their country, and advance their socialist revolution on their own. We have the tower, huge white monument with one brick in the monument to symbol every day of the life of kim il-sung. There are two education centers. The think tank. Everything revolved around imbetting the society. 

[00:06:31]


>> In 1994 after decades spent enslaving the north korean people, kim il-sung dies. 
>> There was genuine grieving and people look at him as almost a supernatural being. 
>> His successor would try to become god like. 
>> He was born to his first wife kim jong-il was said to have been born on the sake credit mountain and this is where, by korean legends,. 
>> BY THE EARL 1980s, IT SEEMS That he had carved out a significant niche in the power structure. 
>> Kim jong-il was a character of fun because he was short and had the hair and elevator shoes but he was a dictator. 
>> Expensive tastes.

>> My mom and others in my family told me about how, during the korean war, the north koreans came across the border into south korea ask they were looking for people that could help them build their infrastructure. So they took him into north korea. I often ask my grandmother about the story and it's difficult for her to talk about. She never heard from or seen her brother since. 
>> The country has been a living hell for millions. 
>> The famine of the late 1990s KILLED MORE THAN A TENTH Of the population of north korea. 
>> We have to make two to three million north koreans starve. 
>> We hear stories of people still starving to death, eating tree bark to survive, and the worst case, the stories of cannibalism. 
>> It had gotten better and worse and better and worse since then but it's always been terrible. 
>> The dynasty continues today with the third kim, kim kim kim jong un, the spitting image of his grandfather. 
>> One of his first acts as a shoot to kill order. 
>> He is terrified of the results. 
>> If you are sent back from china to north korea, what could happen to you? 
>> The punishment is death. running hard, try running four. Fortunately we've got ink. It gives us 5x the rewards on our internet, phone charges and cable, plus at office supply stores. Rewards we put right back into our business. This is the only thing we've ever wanted to do and ink helps us do it. Make your mark with ink from chase. 

[00:12:58]


>> It has been almost a year since kim jong-un the third son of kim jong-il took power in north korea after his father's death. 
>> The other sons were perceived to be losers and this was the one who had the potential to be a leader. 
>> There are some who look at this as an opportunity perhaps he wouldn't be as ruthless. 
>> He made some statements that indicate he is a little hipper than his father was. He allowed his wife to be shown on tv. He appeared with life size character chur-- caricatures of mickey house. 
>> He amowed them women to dress in a more western fashion. 
>> There is little difference between him and his father and grandfather. One of the first things he did upon succeeding his father was to issue a shoot to kill order to north korean order guards. He said shoot anybody in the back who is trying to escape. 
>> They risk everything. They know when they leave north korea they are risking death. 
>> In 2001 mike kim left everything left behind in chicago and moved to northern china to help north korean detectors.

>> For most americans under ground railroad has a certain history for us you think about 1800's and slavery and the fight to get north of the base mays done dixon line. How would you describe the under ground railroad from north korea and china? 
>> It's 6,000 miles running from north korea through china through southeast asia. 
>> It's a network of safe houses and secret groups. 
>> There are contacts along this entire root to help and to aid north koreans. 

[00:15:01]


>> Some within your network some within another network that is willing to help, and you know people in those cities that are willing to risk housing the north koreans. 
>> Mike founded crossing borders a christian organization devoted to helping north korean refugees. This man whom we will call pong is currently the organization's director. 
>> Why are you in this? 
>> I help north korean people in china. It's illegal for any one to even feed a north korean refugee. 
>> If your identity was revealed? 
>> I could go to jail and more importantly the people that are working for us in china would go to jail and north koreans could be executed. Wrue the under ground church in china we consider ourselves the first link to the under ground railroad. 
>> When I would first meet a north korean they would come to our shelter they would be scared ouof their minds. They would sit as far away from me at the other end of the room as possible. 
>> In 2008 crossing borders helped this man a 46-year-old north korean detector who fled his country. We agreed not to say his name. 
>> I had to flee because i helped others from the government. That is a political crime.

>> He interviewed a detector in his small apartment in seoul, south korea. 
>> How scared were you when you were crossing the border? 

[00:17:04]


>> I knew in order to live I had to cross the river and get to the other side. As soon as I got over the first thought that popped into my head was oh, yes, I am alive. 
>> Once you cross from north korea into china it's not like the doors have been flung open for these people. There are dangers in china, too. 
>> They have zero tolerance policy toward north koreans in china. 
>> Not only the police but china has seasons where they announce to their citizens along the borders to report north korean people to them so they can earn money. 
>> If you were sent back from china into north korea what could happen to you? 
>> Committed treason by leaving the country and the punishment is death. 
>> His wife and second daughter crossed over into china almost a year later. 
>> We had an elder leader she called a local church. 
>> What happens to family members in north korea if it is discovered one of their family members has managed to escape successfully. 
>> Their families would suffer. 
>> They will face most brutal torture right out of world war ii concentration camps. After we fled my brothers and sisters and in-laws were taken to the intelligence officer interrogated. My brother in law was beaten so severely he is practically in a wheelchair. 
>> With the help they were hidden in northern china preparing to escape from that country. In august 2009 they boarded a train heading south with strict instructions. 
>> Thoeld us we could not take anything especially not a cell phone. If you are captured they will be able to trace all of the numbers track down the people who helped you.

>> It is worth it to see those who obtained freedom. 
>> Coming up, technology is starting to crack open the hermit kingdom. multivitamin silver. Both of us actually. Our pharmacist recommended it. And that makes me feel pretty good about it.

>> Seoul south korea yaw is 26 miles from north korea. 22 years after he led the communist regime in new york they became citizens of south korea in may 2010. 
>> What was going through your mind when you held your korean citizenship for the first time? 
>> It was very emotional. It was strange feeling to become a citizen in the country. 
>> He and his family are adjusting to life in frdom but sadly the same month they arrived in seoul his 7-year-old daughter died from an unknown infection. 
>> I always think about all of the things I couldn't give her and that weighs heavily on my mind. 
>> That ended a long long journey. There are so many mixed emotions for refugees to come out of north korea to china to south korea. 
>> Three generations of the kim family have maintained an iron grip. But it is not completely inpen et trabl. 
>> Balloons have been going across the dmz since the korean war. Originally it was with leaflets telling people about what life was like in south korea. 
>> One of the women i interviewed her job was to pick up anti north korean leaflets flown on balloons to north korea. How could you pick up these anti north korean leaflets up? 
>> Because the regime taught me if I touched anything from south korea with my hands they would rot and fall off. 
>> Today the balloons have gone high-tech. They are often gps guided and can drop the information that they contain on a more targeted area. 
>> New technology is starting to crack open the hermit kingdom. 
>> The cell phones and internet and other things are giving them windows to the outside world they never had before. If kim jong-il takes them down a path of slightest civilization it could mean much more radical change than he or the political elites are willing to accept. 

[00:25:36]


>> The north korean power elite and military have too much invested in the repression of this society. 
>> It appears kim jong-un has urged some of his father's generals. This man was often seen along side the new leader and then mysteriously fired from all of his duties in july of 2012. Other powerful figures remain. Another seen at kim jong-il's funeral is the general secretary of the korean worker's party. He's the man who over saw the development of north korea's nuclear bomb. 
>> There has been very little indication that he is willing to open the country up. He certainly hasn't stopped with the country nuclear or missile program. The crack down on the people internally still continues. 
>> As long as it does organizations like crossing borders will be there to help. 
>> What does your faith mean to what you are doing in china? A oo it has everything to do with what we do. We believe god has created everyone equal and god created me just the same as god created the north korean refugee. 
>> We have been able to change lives and I would do it all over again. It is very rewarding. 
>> Many kri koreans look forward to a future where their country is unified. 
>> Absolutely. The vast majority of north koreans wish for that day. 
>> Coming up, the medical mystery storyhat almost destroyed a famous hollywood actress.

>> what does a famous hollywood actress, a tough fearless hockey player, and a woman who grew up IN THE 1930s HAVE IN COMMON? They are all in the center of a medical mystery which may effect 3 million people living in the united states. We begin with jennifer esposito's story. 
>> You are new york girl all of the way. 
>> I am. Born in brooklyn and raised in staten island. I wanted to come to the city and start my acting career. 
>> Growing up in a middle class family actress jennifer esposito caught everyone's attention with television shows like spin city to award winning films like "crash." And her most recent work on cbs's "blue blood." While her hollywood star was rising she haved suffering from an illness that was slowly debilitating her. 
>> When did you realize or your family realize that something was wrong? 
>> When I was a teenager I had problems with getting colds and infections, sinus infections all of the time. So much so that I was hospitalized with monday no. 

[00:32:55]


>> She would suffer and as a family we would say, okay, she is sick again. 
>> Susan is jennifer's older sister. 
>> At a young age she was suffering with stomach issues. She had mood swings, she had anxiety. No answers. 
>> How many tests? How many doctors visits are we talking about? Hundreds? Thousands? 
>> I couldn't guess the amount between colonoscopies and enemas. 
>> Did it take a toll on you and your family? 
>> Yes. We didn't have an understanding of it because none of the doctors she had gone to kaep came up with a proper diagnosis. 
>> The money I have spent in trying to make people listen, and I would sit with therapists over and over but every time they would give me a prozac or xanax. I would say that's not it. There is something else going on. 
>> As her career soared jennifer still struggled with her health. It was after 19 long agonizing years a doctor finally gave her an accurate diagnosis. 
>> I was so ill I could barely walk in there. I think she really saw something two-days after that she had called and said, celiac's disease. You have the highest case I have ever seen. I don't know how you are living like this. I had no idea what she was talking about. 
>> What is it? 
>> It is an auto immune disease linked diabetes or roum toyed arthritis. We sat down with the director of center for celiac research at university of maryland. Their studies show that one percent of the population or one in 133 people in the united states have the disease. Only a small fraction know they have it. 

[00:35:10]


>> We don't know what makes people sick with diabetes or ms but it is undisputable is the auto immune process in people with celiac's disease. 
>> What is gluten. That's what we hear about most. 
>> It is the most abundant in specific grains like wheat, rye and barley. We are notable to completely digest this. That is why it creates so many problems. 
>> When you have celiac's disease it damaged or kills the villi the villi around the small intestines. It takes the nutrients from the food. You are starving yourself and not absorbing nutrients. You have a leaky gut which basically is to put it small holes in the gut where when i eat and when I digest anything that slips through those holes and goes into the bloodstream my auto immune system -- it feels as if it is getting attacked so it attacks it. 
>> Where is the biggest source of gluten in our diet comes from? 
>> Biggest source, bread, pasta, pizza, beer, cookies, bagels. These are the obvious source. The other thing that makes it even more complicated is gluten is used as a filler. It is a wonderful natural filler you can mix in prepacked foods. 
>> You bind it together. 
>> Wheat gluten. 
>> It is great stuff. But your body can't tolerate it. 
>> The baby didn't have colic. He had celiac disease? 
>> Besides celiac disease there are two other forms one is a gluten wheat allergy the other is newer and known as gluten sensitivity. It also causes the immune system to react and create problems. 

[00:37:12]


>> The wheatolgy there's a blood test there's a simple screening test that is very very good to identify gluten sensitivity. 
>> Do you think jennifer's case got to that place where they spent years trying to find a diagnosis. 
>> Even when she was diagnosed going gluten free it took much longer than expected to go back to a more acceptable life. Her body took a major hit. 
>> Here she is this successful actress in terms of stereotyping, you need to eat this? Why are you feeling faint? The women's body is collapsing from the inside out. 
>> That's right. She had a serious type for a young woman in this kind of business. You are really too finicky or you are exaggerating and so on and so forth. 
>> What are the symptoms? If someone has xyz you demand your doctor check you for celiac's disease. 
>> The symptoms can go from bloating to diarrhea, constipation to no stomach issues which is tricky for most people. I say any time you are feeling sur mountable feeling of exhaustion there's something going on. If you think that there is a possibility that you have it you want to be safer rather than sorry. You need to get a proper diagnosis, because this left undiagnosed like I have been for years creates havoc, the place i am in now. 
>> Today with more people being diagnosed with celiac disease the market for gluten free products has exploded. 
>> If you look at the market north america in 2002 the market was very limited. It was roughly $100 million.

[00:44:29]


>> Going back to when you were YOUNGER IN YOUR 20s YOU HAD THE Symptoms what was going on? 
>> The lifestyle we led as professional athletes in those days wasn't exactly a lifestyle that would be copyed by a lot of people or should be. There was cigarettes involved and few beers and you are not supposed so feel real good when you do stuff like that. As a result you get used to feeling poorly.

I remember six months later standing in the bathroom still getting sick wondering I am clean as a wiles. Might have been a bottle of lister reason or something like that. I went, wow. Wait a minute. The alcohol or whatever is in it depends on the source and all that. 
>> Just like mickey jnifer is always careful with what she eats which for her is even more challenging. Fox files accompanied her on a visit with her doctor. 
>> We are going to go over your oral gees in addition to the celac, gluten and dairy. We have almonds, beef, chocolate, egg yolk, bananas, broccoli, peanuts, onions, cod fish, soybeans and chicken in addition to the barley rye oats and wheat and all of the other gluten grades.

>> Evidently I had diarrhea, i was not gaining weight. So then they told my mother to bring me down to the university hospital to drop me off don't come see her for six weeks. But I said for over 9 months and the hospital became my home. 
>> After you left the hospital, once they leased you what diet did they put you on? 
>> Baked bananas and bavarian buttermilk. 
>> The routine was she would bake 3 bananas a day. I would eat one for breakfast one for lunch and one banana for dinner. 
>> How long did you stay on this banana diet? 
>> For about two years then the pediatrician said he thought we could add other foods to my diet. He would add a different food each week. And finally at the age of 6 i had my first ice cream and milk. 

[00:48:45]

>> I tell you my day has been consumed with bringing information -- between a blog, jennifer's voice.Org, jennifer foundation on celiac education everything I do to bring awareness. 
>> I do spend a lot o time talking to people on the phone about it. I speak to team about it. I am more than happy to do that to help them get through the early stages of this. Especially younger kids.

>> That is jennifer esposito starring along side donnie wahlburg on blue blood. Little did we know back in september when fox files interviewed her about celiac disease there was turmoil behind the scenes. In october they put out this statement. 
>> Jennifer informed us she is only available to work on a limited part-time schedule. As a result she is unable to perform the demands of her roles and we regretfully had to put her character on a leave of absence. She is a wonderfully talented actress and we hope she will be able to return at some point in the future. 
>> Jennifer sat down exclusively with fox files to give us her side of the story. 
>> When blue blood goes on on friday night twitter starts going crazy. Someone released pictures of him and a new partner. They don't like that. Pem don't like change especially with donnie and what had happened. There was such a surge in where is jackie, actually go jackie was trending one night. Not blue bloods, go jackie was trending. Cbs the next day put out a statement I saw it and immediately was like, oh, really? No. No, no. Let me out of my contract and put me back to work or pay me what you owe me.

>> Cbs put me on unpaid leave and has blocked me from working anywhere else after my dock said you needed reduced schedule celiac. 
>> They have a job to get it done. You don't think I could do it in the 2, 3 days I am offering? I get it you have to replace me. But that's not what happened. What happened was ugliness.

[00:55:18]


>> I got in the van I fell asleep on the way to the set. I felt my head spinning. I got out took a step and my knees just went down to the floor I caught myself in a fence. They brought me into the neighboringup room again I fell. They said I'll get the medic. We were like there's nothing -- unless you can kaur me of celiac disease we have been trying to tell you there's no medic right now.

=======================================================

>>> Ten, nine, eight. 
>> This is the end of the cycle. 
>> It's the magnetic poles will reverse. 
>> It's a wildcard. Astroids are a wildcard, sometimes they can sneak up on you. 
>> It's big bussa. 
>> You just saw our own count down. Summer solstice, june 21st leading up to the date the mayan calendar says doomsday. I'm bill hemmer and welcome to our special presentation. The fact that the mayan calendar will held december 21 but don't believe the hype. We're certain the world will not end that day. Doomsday has been predicted by religions and cultures countless time. On this program we investigate our fascination with doomsday. Why today has been pinned on the maya. Adam housley explores and lauren green investigates the good and evil and second coming of christ is imminent. Amy kellogg what they share with the neolithic builders of stonehenge. But first, we travel to southern mexico and jewel of the mayan period. ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? 
>> most of maya books, there were thousands of them that contacted were burned by spanish fires mostly because they were sasacrilegious. There are four or five fragments that exist. They covered history and mathematics. 

[00:02:22]


>> For the last several decades, intense focus has been put on the mysterious mayan culture that flourished between the second through ninth century. Some say they were prophets of doom. 
>> This was salvaged by accident almost.... 
>> Archaeologist explains the importance of this broken tablet. 
>> This was salvaged? 
>> There was work by the mexican government by archaeologists. When they left some of the locals started digging around and found this monument. 
>> So from a small site? 
>> A small site that was mostly destroyed by a cement factory. Almost all of the architecture has been ground up into gravel or cement. The main body of the textbook. 
>> It's only recently been able to be deciphered. Only the last few years. 
>> Yes. This is where all the controversy. You can see it's v fairly heavily damaged. Famous end phrase, the end of the 13 boxes that will terminate IN DECEMBER 21st, 2012. 
>> Reporter: According to the remaining piece of the tablet, something significant is going to happen. 
>> This is significant fighting a change over. 
>> The flavor of the event is miss forgot text. 
>> It's led to over 3,000 books that many claim to explain the true ending of the maya calendar. 
>> Over 200 million hits on google. When I started this ten years ago, I would get 10,000 which was a lot. That is magic word. 
>> Reporter: She professor of astronomy at colgate university and author of the book "the end of time." 

[00:04:23]


>> In the 1920's it was the egyptians. Maya are center stage and we are goinggh that. 
>> Reporter: They had fantastic legends and some were complete hoaxes like tales of crystal skulls. 
>> It was an animated universe of plants and rocks and stars whom they engaged in a dialogue. 
>> Reporter: They practiced strange sacrifices to thank their god. 
>> They would pierce themselves. The kings through their penises and queens through their tongues then they would collect those bloody pieces of rope and burn them. 
>> They were expert mathematicians. Here is the polenca, there has been all sorts of rituals, even human sacrifices. 
>> Odd rituals, strange numbers, were these symbols of a message that the maya left for us to decode a future apocalypse. 
>> Speaking of that mystery when you have any kind of mystery or any kind of uncertainty it can bring people out of woodwork so to speak. We have seen that with the mayans. 
>> Its natural thing all through history. The change of the last 1,000 ad a lot of people thought it was the end. 
>> End of the world predictions include a collision with planet "x" or the earth passing through the milky way galaxy the disruption of solar flares, even the reversal of the north and south poles. All of them could have a devastating impact on our planet. 

[00:06:26]


>> For example today, if we could see the sun, really interesting effects would occur at temple of inscriptions and ray of light we call it naked eye astronomy. You can do an amazing with four sticks and a some strings. You need a flat surface where the planets and moon and sun sets. So when the sunrise is going to be right there again. 
>> Pretty impressive for people that didn't have any instruments? 
>> They didn't have any tools to keep record of the stars. It was direct observation. 
>> Reporter: A mexican archaeologist has worked on many sites of the mayan ruins? 
>> Only the noble people related with the power were the people that kept the record of this. 
>> They were able to see look ahead. What they looked ahead to and found was significant in what we call the 21 of december, 2012. 
>> She author of the book, fingerprints of the gods. 
>> With the calendar it is possible to tell exactly what the phase of the moon will be on a particular day 2,000 years from now or 2,000 years before now. 
>> Reporter: They had a variety of calendars that ran in cycle of the sun, the moon and visible planets. 
>> Why was the solstice important? 
>> It was very important because they kept a record. They can now know that the rainy season is going to begin and for the construction of the building they only use great amount of labor of many tools, just hammer and chisel. 

[00:08:34]


>> There are sweat baths there. There is an observatory. It was a private space. For all indications was a living space for the king. The temple was a great king that ruled for 69 years is buried deep beneath in a very elaborate tomb. 
>> This is final rting place of the beloved mayan king who reigned here under 70 years. Under his rule, architecture and astronomy flourished. 
>> The way they interact in light and shadows is turning out to be a rich field of study. 
>> There seems to have been an ancient idea to bring down the perfection of the heavens to earth and somehow ui niet them. 
>> Reporter: Among in the world there are others. Stonehenge in england and great pyramids and the temples in cambodia. 
>> What you find in all these sites is align structures to the rising of the sun at one or another or several of tse moments. Story telling in ancient times often involved reference to the heavens. 
>> Reporter: There are even more discoveries hidden in the mayan culture, language, season and temples we have yet to see. Adam housley uncovers mysteries about the maya and why the obsession with the december 21 date. 

[00:13:21]


>> Dana: More mysterys are waiting to be discovered. 
>> We have architectural excellence. But very complex. They like to go way back into the past and talk about the actions of the gods. 
>> I think we are looking at very different cultures than ours and doing things very different ways and under its prime objective a connection between earth and heaven which is done through the medium of architecture and v very precise astronomical observations. The mayan calendar is itself a stunning technological device. It actually has more accurate estimate of the length of the solar year than we used to in modern western civilization. 
>> Reporter: It's amazing when you thing about it. You have light, magicians with the seasons and gee tri-. 
>> And unlike a lot of cultures in the middle east and europe we less time to study the mayan. They were discovered later. Only recently relatively in the MID '70s STARTED TO READ THEIR Language. 
>> The end of the mayan calendar as calculated by the great astronomers will end on winter solstice in 2012. 
>> The granddaddy of all maya calculations, all maya cycles, the 51 25-year cycle known as the long wheel overturn. 
>> The last creation cycle begin on 3114 b.C. And come to an end 1221. It clicks one day at time. 

[00:15:28]


>> There is a difference between your automobile and it's odomoter. That is when the your automobile going over your car is one step closer to the junk yard. If you look at a wide sampling of these messages on the internet you'll find we're here eer in december 21, 2012, we have a big blow up. The blow up is the end of the world. As far as the bliss out, it's really based on the second coming of christ. I think that american religion plays a prominent role in this anticipation. 
>> Even the famous explorer christopher columbus his discovery of the new world was necessary to fulfill an ancient professor I si. 
>> When columbus came to the new world, one of his major purposes was to make this place rey for the city of zion or the coming of jesus. 
>> People are by nature psychologically story tellers. We all understand what it is to have a beginning and middle and end to a story. 
>> Dr. Keith ablo is a fox news contributeder. 
>> The doomsday scenario is at odds to my mind with religion because in fact it is it relieves people of needing to take the journey toward self. 
>> It embraces a range of end of time beliefs clearly suggesting that an event will occur on december 21, 2012. How did this phenomenon get started. 
>> The idea of the doomsday has been around for at least 30, 40 years and it builds as the date approaches. Blame it on internet. People used to gather under a big tent and preacher would tell us jesus coming to earth. 

[00:17:38]


>> The end attracts our attention. We wanted to try to forecast what is going to happen, forecasting is a big part of the hum condition. 
>> The maya were a thoughtful civilization but why did they abandon their great cities and appear to vanish from the face of the earth. 
>> From some mysterious reason, maya civilization collapsed a little more than a thousand years ago. 
>> You can't give the people they need to live so they abandon the big cities and go to the countryside. 
>> One of the reasons why they are abandoned so easily once it 'it was too much to keep the cities to maintain them. It was easy for the maya to pack up and leave. They were self-sufficient anyway. 
>> We look far away for the answers. Maybe the aliens will help us. The ancient maya will help us. 
>> So deep inside the jungle we find a mystery of the maya. We go to lauren green in israel. 
>> Solstice celebrations are few and far between but if you are christian looking for doomsday. This is the si of armageddon and the battle between good and evil. >>. 

[00:22:29]


>> Reporter: From the ruins of maya culture to the other side of the world in rome. At st. Peter's square an 83 foot sun dial that sits outside the basilica brought over from egypt in 30 ad. Nearly every religion, islam, buddhism, hinduism they have the fascination with the apocalypse. Christians prophesize about the end of time and the holy scripture. Lauren green reports. ???????????? 6. 
>> Reporter: Christians mark the end of time in the final chapter of the new testament the book of revelation. Chapter 11 verse 18 reads, now is the time to destroy those who destroy the earth. 
>> Book is not about destruction. It's not about the wrath of god. It is about consequences. 
>> Reporter: Mark translated the book from the original greek text. He collaborated with hollywood writer to publish a graphic novel to help readers visualize the final chapter. 
>> We are trying to get people to see the book of revelation in a new way, not just read it but see it. All we're trying to do is present it in the full message of hope in god and hope for the future. 
>>> How likely john would have been concerned about the end times? 
>> If he was the last 12 disciples of jesus, she church that is expecting the lord to come back but he hasn't yet. There is a yearning in the community and suffering. The apostle john received a revelation from god that he wrote down. That revelation was disseminated 

[00:24:30]


>> Reporter: John's revelation was received through angels while held captive by the romans for preaching the gospels. Jews were also at odds with their rulers. 
>> It was so unlivable on this earth with conquerors and economic. Everything was going wrong. 
>> A biblical scholar that studies ancient writings. 
>> What do they turn to this thought because they can't find meaning there. The human can't exist with some kind of hope. 
>> Just over 60 years ago the dedicated sea scrolls were discovered. Earliest copies of bible were discovered called the essenes. 
>> They were copied here. Earliest copies are here. 
>> Ten commandments were among the documents. 
>> For people living here believe they were living in the end time. 
>> The professor also a dead sea school are show where they were discovered. 
>> The world here ended in doom because you had an invincible army. Roman army. 
>> The romans destroyed the temple, more than a million jews were killed. 
>> They are trying to give meaning to their suffering and the book of revelation can do that for every generation. 
>> Reporter: We visited the site where john's revelations sets the stage. 
>> Most people don't realize that armageddon is a real place. 
>> He has been excavating here since 1994. 
>> I think think it's the most blood soaked area on earth. 
>> Why would john place the doomsday battle here. 

[00:26:30]


>> By the time john was living, there had been 12 or 13 battles fought there. He would have known about those. 
>> Reporter: Many people think armageddon is the site of the final battle. 
>> That is not the final battle. It's supposed to be fought at jerusalem a thousand years later. There are some people that it happened and we're in that period of the thousand years between armageddon and the final battle. You get all kinds of religious disputes. 
>> I believe god gave us the book of revelation as a warning. 
>> Evangelical broadcaster sees signs in matthew. 
>> It's unprecedented the amount of famine and wars and rumors of wars and earthquakes that the earth has had collectively. We are living in the end times. Revelations 20 about the battle of god is referring to russia, that the great bear will attack israel but also have other allies. Iran will be one of those. Bible describes there is going to be so much bloodshed that the blood will rise as high as the horses bridle. Many people believe there is a rapture, that jesus will appear in the clouds that christians from all over the world will be taken up into the heavens. Then there will be seven year period. At the end of the seven years, the battle of armageddon and jesus will come back and he will stand upon the mounted of olives. After that, thousand year reign of christ. 
>> Reporter: We'll be there to capture the second coming. 
>> Any time people can go on our website and when the end comes. Day star will be there. 

[00:28:37]


>> Some people say it's going to happen on this date and this is how it is going to happen. 
>> And prediction who will win the battle of good and evil? 
>> I do believe good is going to win. Not because I'm hopeful but history has shown this. 
>> Bill: Nobody knows how the end will come while doomsday believers have made an industry out of scaring people with predictions. Some claim hard science is behind their calculations. You will be surprised???????? now back to countdown to doomsday. 

[00:32:54]


>> Bill: December 21, 2012 is the winter solstice what some people call doomsday. Six months before it was the summer solstice and thousands of yoga lovers were celebring in new york city's time square. It was literally a far stretch from doomsdayers. 
>> There is nothing to suggest that gigantic floods and earthquakes will destroy our world. 
>> There are prophesy that has say the world is going to end. 
>> I think what we're dealing with is denial of our own deaths. 
>> This obscure relic monument 6 is the focus of the mayan countdown to doomsday. Worn and this strange thing translated the end date and suggestion that something will happen. There is no evidence the maya were counting down to doomsday. 
>> It's not borne out by what we know about the maya. They looked at cycles that went beyond the 2012 date. 
>> We were involved the past summer some amazing inscriptions from guatemala which show computations of numbers longer than the cycle. There is a number that projects into the future a thousand years from today. 
>> Such recent discoveries have not halted speculation about the end of the maya calendar. 
>> I think stories like this get started because you see that the ancient scripts are ambiguous. There is wiggle room. Somebody says, hey, I can make money filling this in. 
>> In all 500 monuments are really about history. What we can read that cycles overturn and endless and old cycle starts a new cycle and we all try harder. 

[00:35:08]


>> I have one word for those people that are concerned about doomsday. Relax. 
>> He says the disaster scenarios are often based on scientific fact. 
>> When people first here about pole reversal -- oh, my god the poles are going flip just like this. 
>> But not all the facts. 
>> No we're not talking about geologic pole shift. We're talking about a wandering of the magnetic north pole. It takes thousands of years for that wandering to take place. 
>> Some say the government is hiding the truth. 
>> I love the secrets that are involved here. 
>> Government never tells us about because its conspiracy theory. 
>> But december 21 is special, the end of the maya calendar, there will be a rare event one that could have been predicted by the astronomers. 
>> If you look at map of the sky jupiter is here, there is a lineup. 
>> But this does not mean doom? 
>> The sun and moon are the primary forces that raise tides on the earth. What the next highest tide raising force turns out to be the planet venus. You know how much it produces, one 500th of an inch. 
>> What they are taking seriously people vulnerable. 
>> Bill:38 members of the heaven's gate cult thought a ufo would be rescued. They went into suicide. Thoughts of doomsday may be comforting but not really. 
>> It's much easier to sthi something is going to end the planet but what are the roots of my fears. There is no asteroid coming but what are ends of time? Cancer, cardiac disease, diabetes, car accidents. We hang by threads. The bottom line the denial of death fuels a lot of myth. 

[00:37:33]


>> I take a controversial view. 
>> Bill: Not predicting gloom he sides that a change for our civilization? 
>> I see in the mayan calendar somehow I don't know how they did it, but they seem to have connected and plugged in to cycles in the human story. Mayan calendar is not saying the end of the world. It is saying the end of chapter of the human story. We can see the birth of a new consciousness taking place all around the world today. 
>> Bill: That we know the maya never had a countdown to doomsday. They still believe there is a countdown to the end of the world as we know it. Coming up an inside look at a group of people that are seriously worried about surviving catastrophic events. We counted down to doomsday by counting different celebrations of the summer solstice like here at stonehenge. We were there. History behind this >>.

>> Bill: Our team has covered the countdown to doomsday in mexico, in israel and here in new york. But one of oldest structures they have found outside of london, england, to the rising sun in the english countryside. Solstice celebration of stonehenge which is most revealing to all of us. Amy kellogg uncovers that mystery. 
>> The times change but the sky remains the same. Neolithic people lived on earth approximately 5,500 to 2,500 b.C. That is thousands of years before maya came on the scene but these early farmers held sacred rituals to honor the sun the same day. Longest day of the year. ???????????? 
>> Reporter: Fast forward to present day stonehenge. Summer solstice, 2012. 
>> This the longest day we will come and play. 
>> These modern day druids look like they are preparing for the end of the world? 
>> We believe that really the mayans ought to start a new calendar. We don't believe that it's the end of the world as far as druids and pagans are concerned. 
>> Stonehenge seems to be a ceremonial spot from the original function but because of the mystery surrounding it it's alignment with the sun on the days of the winter and summer solstice it's an enduring gathering point. 
>> Stone hedge brings many people. 
>> Head of stonehenge for english heritage explains. 

[00:43:52]


>> Some people say it's astronomical calendar, others say it signifies changes in the season. 
>> Nobody knows for certainty how or why it was built. 
>> The problem with cultures, neolithic cultures they didn't leave us any written records. 
>> It's a pre-hioriculultures that means before writing. You have to interpret it. 
>> Reporter: What we do know that stonehenge is aligned with several bodies, it attracts biggest crowds today. It's magic endures. 
>> What happens at sunrise and the alignment? 
>> What people try and do is to observe the sun rising over the hills all waited down to the stone circle. 
>> The picture we get f excavations that have been made and studying the tools and learning about the farming methods is that these people were rather sophisticated. 
>> Archaeologists believe stonehenge was built in stages around 3,000 b.C. 
>> They are not just placed on top. The engineering qualities that is quite remarkable. 
>> The picture of the people that we used to have the shambling like cave people is totally wrong. The brain was same size as it is today. 
>> Stonehenge is not unique. It's part of a pattern of structures throughout europe and u.K. And all over the world. 

[00:45:57]


>> Those who built magnificent architecture, be the pyramids and in southeast asia or the maya temples or stonehenge, we want to make a statement. It's usually the ruler that makes that statement. 
>> Is it coincidence that all of them are aligned with the sun and other sles yal bodies? 
>> I think people look for they look for truth of the sky. It's more accurate than the weather. When it is aligned with the sunset. Farmers know it's time to harvest the crop. 
>> It was all in ancient societies. That is what stonehenge is. 
>> Reporter: It's like others around the world mark the planting season, the builders had other reasons. 
>> They can harvest the crop any way. 
>> We need to reve are ve our connection with the universe. They saw the sun as a good. 
>> This is certainly a religious sanctuary. There is no question about it. The sun was revered. I would have seen to it that alignment was precise, I could stand at the center and point to it. Do you see our god rising? 
>> Our god who gave rise to me. 
>> That is similar to the mayan king on the summer solstice. 
>> They are communicating through us on mortals through the sun. 
>> Stonehenge is more mysterious than other places and coming up you will see people building bunkers and stockpiling food. Find out if they know something that we don't. 
>> Announcer: Stop! Living with hair loss, that is. Losing your hair is no fun and no one wants to be bald, but there is hope. 

[00:47:59]


>> Gettiy hair back was the best thing that ever happened to me.

[??????...] cccccc cccccc >>. 

[00:51:11]


>> Bill: Remember the cuban missile crisis, 9/11, katrina, those were events that felt like the world were coming. There are people that are worried about other kinds of doomsdays and they plan on surviving. 
>> It looks like in has been another series of attacks, cyber attacks on united states banks. 
>> Bill: Recent cyber attacks could have doomsday style consequences. That has our government concerned. 
>> Attackers could also seek to disable or degrade critical military systems communication networks. Collective result of these kinds of attacks could be a cyber pearl harbor. 
>> We have an insane regime in iran run by people who are psychotic who may get the nuclear weaponry to act on their insane thoughts. That means we could have a nucle holocaust. 
>> What we depict on our show they have a variety they are concerned about. Everything from tsunami to a nuclear blast. 
>> A koe executive producer of doomsday preppers. 
>> There are three touch stones. First touch stone is 9/11. Second touch stone is destruction of american cities which is katrina. Third touch stone is the financial collapse. 
>> Most households have enough supplies for a few days, some are moving to remote locations, stockpiling food and medicine and anticipating a catastrophic event. 

[00:53:12]


>> You are the opposite of the mayan calendar people who have no investment in reality. 
>> The preppers on our show are being thought of as a worldwide level. You see banks is one of them. 
>> Believing that radio active fallout from japan will contaminate the food chain there is food bank that can grow radiation food. 
>> They may look at supplies and say, are you kidding me? But if something happens, I win this game. People that aren't prepared, they lose this game. 
>> On a much larger scale, to withstand an earthquake the global seed fault, about 800 miles from the north pole stores about 750,000 different crop varieties. 
>> I think the thinking and logic of the food bank is valid. Why not have an insurance policy just in case. However, the bad side it could take off. People could think, why are they doing this. They are doing this because they know something we don't know. Perhaps there is a doomsday coming. 
>> Bill: But the doomsday concept is not entirely new. IN THE LATE 1950s OUR CODE WORD For a fallout shelter built in virginia for the entire u.S. Congress. 
>> Have prepers who are very wealthy and are preparing for the end of the world. 
>> He has been preping for a nuclear war with russia for the last 35 years. He is concerned that his bunker may not be deep enough in the ground. 
>> To ensure his safety, big al has purchased a salvage fuel tank and gamma ray shelter. 

[00:55:18]


>> Y-2k was for many preppers a turning point. 
>> Just before the celebration in 2000 there was concern about our technology crashing. 
>> The fiasco had a silver lining to it because of the fact that so many people were concerned about the switching of the calendar and fact it could be computer glitches meant that programers were assigned to gather out all the possible glitches. 
>> David is a disabled truck driver. 
>> I'm preparing for an electromagnetic pulse that will disable the transportation system of the united states. 
>> Of all there is one incident they have to be careful about. That is gigantic a solar storm when the sun has a temper tantrum. It would be somebody incidentally flipped the switch on the world. This is live right now. The last few days. It's putting out a lot of flares but we're getting a lot of electrical interference. If one of those pops out at earth that is when things go back zblad in 1859 a solar flare hit united states and europe. It caused almost worldwide failure of the telegraph system. If it were to happen today it would literally throw us back hundred years into the past before the coming of the space age and electricity and internet, but it' not doomsday. Even another event will not destroy life on earth, but it could send us back hundred years. 
>> Bill: Some of you may continue to prepare for survival. There will not be a doomsday december 21. So we hope you have a great first day of the rest of your lives on december 22. 12-22-2012.Ck on monday.

=======================================================

>> On fox news watch, new images of an age old story as israel defends its citizens from attacks by hamas. 
>> Supporters from around the world to tell the story, but are their reports biased to fit an agenda? 
>> There's a clear -- a clear sexism and racism that goes with these comments being made by, unfortunately, senator mccain and others. 
>> And democrats in the liberal media play the race card, calling republican criticism of ambassador rice, racist and sexist, is this new spin working in the coverage? 
>> Thank you. 
>> Jon: President obama gets his second term. The media pour on the positive press to push for his win. New details are out. And joe biden is back making news. 
>> We've got a home boy in the deal who gets-- 
>> on the only, and fox news contributor judy miller, syndicated columnist cal thomas and jim pinkerton, the american conservative magazine, contributor. And talk radio bureau chief ellen ratner. I'm jon scott, fox news watch is on right n 
>> . 
>> Heather: We've been extremely clear about the concern for israel's security, about the fact that israel has a right to self-defense, but I'm not going further than that. 
>> Why can't you say that you don't agree with the turks? 
>> Because I'm not going to get in a public spinning match with allies on either side, not going to do that. 
>> And what is worse, public spinning match is worse than hundreds of people dying every day. 
>> I don't understand the question here, there's not a question here, you're just looking for a fight, let's go-- 
>> no, the fight is already on. 
>> Yes, absolutely. 

[00:02:00]


>> What's going on over there. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> And you guys by refuse to go say anything about what you're trying to do or refusing to say whether you agree or disagree with the comments that are being made by your allies or others-- 
>> we. 
>> That makes things worse not better. 
>> We of course agree that rhetorical attacks against israel are not helpful at this moment. Is that what you're looking for, matt? 
>> That's victoria nuland a spokeswoman for the state department hammered by matt lee who wanted more of a response to this statement from the prime minister of turkey. It read, those who speak of muslims and terror side by side are turning a blind eye when muslims are massacred en masse. For this reason I say that israel is a terrorist state and its acts are terrorist acts. So, we had that face-off at the state department, jim, and there was more of it. We only showed about a third of that actual exchange. Was the reporter right to be pushing her in that way? 
>> That's certainly a new ap. He was expressing the opinion. Look the state department's in a hard spot here, turkey is an n.A.T.O. Ally and I don't agree that israel is a terrorist state and I'm sure hillary clinton and the state department don't either, but the way the camera makes it look, she's sort of on the-- nuland is on the defensive and she's got her job to do with 150 state world capitals watching. It was a little bit of an ambush on the state department. 
>> Jon: Pretty amazing statement, I think, fr the turkish minister, how did they react. 
>> Almost no. I'm going to wait for the article that says that tkey has just disqualified itself as an intermediater, as a mediator in this conflict. I didn't see that statement. I didn't see that story. It's really amazing the way turkey is-- remains under cover in the american media. 

[00:04:04]


>> And now, I had exactly the same reaction as you did and what was even more amazing is why didn't anybody do a story that compared what tkey said about israel with what turkey has said about syria, or not said. There was none of that. It was really quite -- the silence was deafening. 
>> Jon: Here we go all over again, cal. The conflict in that part of the world never seems to end. Things appear to be relatively peaceful and then all of a sudden, you get hamas launching rockets and israel responding and you know, you get a peace deal like was brockered on wednesday and then everything seems to cycle all over again. 
>> I wrote a column this week entitled ground hog day. I think the application is similar to that movie where bill murray gets up and repeats the previous day. 
>> The height of media coverage for israel was 1976. Our bicentennial when they went into uganda to rescue israeli citizens from palestinian terrorists. It was the editorial coverage extremely positive. And unraveled in cnn, c v and the pair palestinians and victims. What about that is the coverage sympathetic to palestinians? 
>> You know, I will probably be a little different than everybody here on the panel, particularly when it relates to that photo that was shown in "the washington post" where they had the picture of the palestinian with the dead baby and then they showed the competing picture was israelis in the bomb shelter. I didn't get as offended by that as other people did in terms of saying that "the washington post" was more towards the palestinians. I didn't, I didn't see-- 
>> more flagrant though is cnn running phony footage and the bbc a sweep from syria they said was palesnian and british reporter, bbc john donovan said I accidentally smeared the israelis and i really meant to smear the syrian government. Stone silent, the bbc won't fire him. Who knows from a week ago other than tweeting again. 

[00:06:27]


>> Jon: Judy, the coverage of what happened then, tends to focus how many rockets were fired and how many casualties on both sides, but there seems to be a vast moral goal between the two sides. Here is a look at the cover of the new york daily news and then, basically the same title and the the photo, in the new york post. And very similar coverage of hamas members dragging somebody through the streets tied to a motorcycle, somebody they had executed on suspicion of being an israeli sympathizer or spy. 
>> Exactly, and that's part of the college of a reporter covering what's going on in gaza, because there are many more reporters this time around from in 2008-2009 which is the last time israel went into gaza, but they are still the captives of hamas, they're being led about, they're being shown things, we have no way of growing whether or not the people who were being portrayed as victims, were really killed by israelis rockets or injured by israeli rockets fire. We don't know. Even the new york times, john, ran an editorial saying, illegitimacy, but the submarine title was-- sub title was not israel is the not the only one in the war-- 
>> and I thought an mea culpa in the column this week several years ago he said it was right for israel to pull out of gaza. Some of us have been saying that for a long time. I think the failure of the media is that they do not accurately report on the history of the two movements and think don't that the palestinians and muslim radicals who say they want to kill all israelis and jews and get them out there, they don't believe it even though that's what they say. 

[00:08:28]


>> All right. Coming up next on news watch, a twist in the coverage of the benghazi attack. 
>> We have seen wrong intelligence before and a lot of people were killed based on bad intelligence. 
>> Reworked talking points on benghazi, getting attention from both sides of the aisle. Will media attention add pressure to get the answers about who knew what and when? 

[00:12:03]


>> All of the things that have-- they have lied about things gone on in this administration, they have never called a male unqualified, not right, not trustworthy. I don't recall it ever happening. They didn't even say that about general petraeus who they're all up in arms about. So, there's a clear, in my opinion, a clear sexism and racism that goes with these comments that are being made by, unfortunately, senator mccain and others. 
>> Now that john mccain sunk his teeth in he's made it about presidential authority and frankly there's a witch hunt going on on the right about people of color let's face it around this president. Eric holder, valley jarrett, before that van jones, it's not who is hawkish in the same way that john mccain is about foreign policy. If you look at those, susan rice, this is a personal vendetta-- 
>> you think mccain and lindsey-- 
>> mccain had his own daughter attacked, accused of having an illegitimate child when in fact adopted a young girl from south asia, you're saying that mccain is being driven by racial prejudice here? 
>> There's no other way to look at this. 
>> Jon: Another week and another twist in the media coverage of the benghazi terror attacks and the aftermath and ambassadors susan rice and reworked talking points about the deadly event. You kind of got a sense testify there, jim. There's a suggestion that any criticism directed toward the obama administration is either racist or sexist. Is that the new media mean? 
>> And rich wilson has no other way to look at it. That settles that. Look, it's clear that for time magazine they said it's ace politics for the democrats, if the obama administration nominates here and see her support there and the tact that they'll take at sort of a mass political level. At the elite level. I think the administration is doing a pretty good job of saying, well, actually the talking points were massaged by james clapper and by the justice department and a lot of fingerprints there and david petraeus came along and said there are reasons why they took out the al-qaeda stuff from the talking points that rice delivered on the air and I think that argument among the elites is kind of prevailing and I think that it means that if the president does appoint-- I think the confirmation goes quickly. 

[00:14:35]


>> Not everybody agrees though. Maureen dowd rights when a gang shows up with rpg's in a place of hot bed sympathizer and extremist training camps. 
>> It's not over a movie. She should have been savvy enough to wonder why the wily hillary was avoiding the talk shows. And the dop diplomate needs to show more sensitivity and independence traits clinton has demonstrated in abundance and obama can do better at state than susan rice. 
>> And an article called susan rice t-- 
>> I was disappointing in the president, what she's said about regime change in african and countries and not looking more to her resume'. 
>> Let me pull up a point on racism and sexism business. It never cuts the other way. Liberals can criticize conservative african-american as conservative black women, like allen west now soon to be former. And condoleezza rice, not being down for the struggle, as being oreos or hanger chief head negros, all of these used by left wing african-american women against conservatives and it's no problem, but it's only when you criticize the content of their character not the color of their skin or gender all of a sudden it's racist and sexist. 
>> I mean, where is the evidence of racial evidence in the questions of what she's done or said. It's not as if she is a reporter who to work with the material you give it and friday and confirm it. She had accessed to the classified. She should have known that that material could be new andsed. She could have done a great many things, instead, jake tapper and others praised her as a good soldier. And msnbc suggested that the optics are very good for the democrats because any questions raise abouted her will be interpreted as racist and I think so that's wrong. 

[00:16:55]


>> Or saw as racist. And maureen dowd, and dan, if they had to vote for susan rice and nothing would make a big chunk of the chatting class in the media in president obama's second term to be sort of light critics, some detachment and ironic distance and meanwhile the agenda goes forward and tarnishment will not stop her being the next secretary of state. 
>> If the press did their job there would be different questions. 
>> If they did, that's a huge "if." . 
>> The former head of the ceo david petraeus, his belief that the attacks were carried out and planned as terrorism attacks, and then came his resignation from the cia. The new york times put this piece out, a phony hero for a phony war, lucien trustcot, and then david petraeus in the iraq and afghanistan conflicts, no matter how good he looked in his biographer-mistress's book, it doesn't make up for the fact that we failed to conquer countries we invaded and ended up occupying undefeated nations. 
>> That's an attack on petraeus and salute from slate magazine, a book coming out called the insurgent, spent a lot of time with patz and questions and problems with him, but on the other hand, trustcot's piece was over the top. David petraeus was not in charge of invading iraq, he was in charge of turning around a situation that was bad and he gets no credit for that. 
>> Jon: There're news watch to come. If you see something that feel SHOWS EVIDENCE OFIf we want to improve our schools... ... what should we invest in? Maybe new buildings? What about updated equipment? They can help, but recent research shows... ... nothing transforms schools like investing in advanced teacher education. Let's build a strong foundation. Let's invest in our teachers so they can inspire our students. Let's solve this. men drivers? Yeah. Then how'd I get this... 

[00:19:29]


[ voice of Dennis ] ...SAFE DRIVING BONUS Check? Every six months without an accident, Allstate SENDS A CHECK. Ok. 
[ voice of Dennis ] SILENCE. Are you in good hands? 

[00:21:58]


>> President obama winning another four years in the white house, delivering his victory speech on election night and thanking his family and his supporters. According to the pew research center he could have also thanked the media for his win. The people of pew found media coverage of president obama was more positive at 29% during the last week of campaigning before election day. Coverage of mitt romney on the other hand, mostly negative, 33% that same week. So, should this be a big thank you to the media for his reelection? 
>> No, I mean, I think he would have lost the election because of their get out the vote things as well. 
>> You're talking about romney. 
>> That's right, but if you look at the media's coverage and the pew people have said that they thought it was that reporters were paying attention to the polls. Well, you know what? Reporters unless they're reporting on a poll should not be paying attention to polls he when they write their story and be aware of any unconscious bias. 
>> Jon: Somehow, I suspect, jim, you're not surprised by the numbers from pew. 
>> No I'm not and I've cited before evan thomas saying it could be 15 points in an election and amended that to say 5 points. Even 5 points covers a potential romney victory, however, I must say that the romney post election period has been kind of a tailspin for him, not just the comments about gifts and so on, but the thriving subculture orca, the get out of the vote effort. Makes anybody who thinks only media bias made romney lose, but his own technological incompetence. 
>> And arguments on what the party needs to do in order to survive. 
>> Right, the party needs to dump the tea party and needs to reinvent itself. You know, the party is going do to do all of this after a while because I presume that the party wants to win. 

[00:24:00]


>> I'm shocked, shocked, isn't anybody else, the media would have been biased to obama? 
>> And the presidential candidate since nixon have had the press against nem, they've found a way to overcome it and that was romney's major failing, he didn't overcome what was obvious going in. 
>> Jon: All right. Next on news watch, momentum america. We don't let frequent heartburn come between us and what we love. So if you're one of them people who gets heartburn and en treats day after day... Block the acid with prilosec otc and don't get heartburn in the first place!

>>> As I kid I spent all my time in jersey shore and northern part of the state come 60 miles across. Everybody in the middle part of my stated goes to the beach. So, I was kind of raised on the shore. 
>> Jon: That is vice president joe biden speaking after getting a firsthand view of some of the destruction from hurricane sandy. He also celebrated his 70th birthday. Other notable anniversaries. 1963 becoming the iconic phrase, four score and seven years, president abraham lincoln delivered the gettysburg address. This photo taken a few hours before his famous speech. 
>> Hundred years later, president john f. Kennedy was assassinated while riding in a motorcade. The media coverage of that event will always be questioned. Also this week the jew dictionary committee in the house of representatives begin impeachment of built clinton. A month later he was impeached by the house and then acquitted by the is that. A liberal bias in the coverage was clear and present in that one. Then we have this. The classic film about inmates taking over eight sigh aluminum.

S the fox report. Tonight, one of the most wanted men in the world and our fbi, just got him. And, it's not how a democratic government is supposed to act. Fresh outrage, after egypt's president makes a near absolute power grab in a country with great influence in the middle east peace process and an american partner and high stakes diplomacy. ?????????????????? 
>> Harris: Returning to the same place that gave birth to the country's revolution less than two years ago, this sends president mohamed morsi message, what freedom fighters say must happen to stop a new cycle of violence in the streets. Fox reports live from cairo. Also, destruction, more than 40 buildings taking a hit, in an explosion, some leveled, new tonight, neighbors bringing us inside the horror with stories you will never forget. 
>> You were startled and then heard screaming and everyone in the buildings are screaming. 
>> Windows are shattered and the window frame is down on the floor. 
>> Harris: The search for answers intensifying as we learn more about split-second decisions that saved lives. 
>>> And his character left hundreds of millions of viewers asking, who shot jr. Remembering larry hagman, the man who played the villain, the world couldn't help loving. I'm harris faulkener well, begin with egypt on edge and turmoil and violence spreading and response to a colossal power grab. By egypt's islamist president, mohamed morsi. Though country's rocky transition to democracy may hit a brick wall, two days of violent protest adding to the tension in what is already one of the most volatile regions of the world, mohamed morsi, the newly elected president and head of the muslim brotherhood giving himself near absolute power at the expense of egypt's courts and the country's justices firing back calling for a strike and protests until his decree is rescinded. And, there is this: A warning from a prominent opposition leader, that egypt's military may be forced to get involved against president morsi's wishes in an effort to restore order. Let's begin with steve harrigan streaming live from cairo, protesters in full force in tahrir square, do you have any idea what is next for them? 

[00:02:39]


>> Reporter: Harris, what we are likely to see on sunday and tuesday, are, perhaps, massive street protests, not just by those who want to oust mohamed morsi, who think he's trying to become a dictator but those who support him, who think he is trying to do the right thing to dry and break the logjam and get rid of the old regime, we could see tens of thousands of people marching on the streets of cairo with opposite points of view, really, close problems im to each other. We have seen violence in the protest and could see more in the days to come and one other factor, to keep an eye on, these judges, they say they don't buy the president's decree, the dges across the country are trying to shut down the country's entire judicial system, harris. 
>> Harris: You have so many staring hoeldz in all of this, steve and we are also keeping an eye on the prominent opposition LEADER, al-FARADI. What is the role we expect. 
>> Reporter: He has been vocal and the most prominent and best known opposition leader in the weel-baradei, a know beal peace prize winner has been sharp in his criticism of president mohamed morsi, saying he's trying to become a pharaoh and dictator in egypt and if he tried to launch a political campaign he might have criticism for people who say he spends a got part of his life outside of the country. But now he is acting, really, at least in western media, as the face of the opposition, harris. 
>> Harris: I'm going to ask you to hang with us. We're going to try to bring up a live picture and hope technology serves us best here. The satellite photo has been shaky. This is live, tahrir square which is basically, steve, turning into a tent city. We saw a year-and-a-half ago, the military in that country, get involved. We mentioned moments ago, that might be potentially the next step in all of this. Talk to me about those people on the ground, right now. 

[00:04:41]


>> Reporter: Numbers smaller today than yesterday. But they are digging in. They s up tents and they say they are not going away. And, both sides are really calling out for numbers. A test of wills, right now, between the president and his supporters, and those who think he is trying to become a dictator. Something people here have fought against a year ago and many are willing to fight against again. We have seen violence and now with tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands due out on the street in the days ahead we could see more violence here in the short-term, harris. 
>> Harris: And people, digging in with the tents and spending the night in some cases, steve harrigan, thank you very much. We'll come back to you as the news warrants on this. Egypt's road to democracy has been a shake one at best. You may recall it was january 25 of last year, hundreds of thousands of protesters demanding an end to hosni mubarak's rule. The so-called arab spring had taken hold in egypt. Then, roughly two weeks later, in february, hosni mubarak stepped down turning over all presidential powers to the military. And, more than a year later in june of this year, when egypt's military officially recognized mohamed morsi, of the muslim brotherhood, as the winner of nationwide elections, it was then six days later that he was sworn in as egypt's first freely elected president, and finally, just about three months ago in august he traveled to china, marking his first official trip outside of the middle east, as egypt's new president. Just days ago, president obama may have seen an ally in egypt's mohamed morsi and, the president helped broker a cease-fire deal between israel and hamas, following 8 days of cross-border fighting in israel and gaza and now the white house has to deal with that egyptian leader, who is expanding his presidential power. And, causing, unrest, once again and molly henneberg live in washington with the news. No coincidence, I'm guessing on his timing of the power grab? 
>> Reporter: That's right, harris, middle east analysts say no, he was riding high on the world stage after helping to negotiate that cease-fire, between israel and hamas and gaza and decided to make his move and consolidate more of his power in egypt. Here's more on that. 

[00:06:53]


>> Now, washington has to take a choice, are we going to put more pressure on morsi, but if we do so he may not work with us on stabilizing the gaza piece, it will be difficult for this administration to deal with. 
>> Reporter: The move, quote, raises concerns for many egyptians and the international community. Harris? 
>> Harris: What about the white house? Any idea what they will do next regarding egypt. 
>> Reporter: So far the obama administration is not calling out mohamed morsi directly. President obama spoke to mohamed morsi on wednesday to thank him for his personal leadership and handling the cease-fire and days later the state department said in a statement, the current constitutional vacuum in egypt can only be resolved by the adoption of a constitution that includes checks and balances and respects funmental freedoms and individual rightd the rule of law, consistent with egypt's international commitment. It goes on to say, quote, we call for all egyptians to resolve their differences over these important issues, piece fully, and, through democratic dialogue. But, no mention, harris, of mohamed morsi by name. 
>> Harris: Molly henneberg, thanks, molly. We move on to hollywood and the world. Actor larry hagman was so good at being bad. He has passed away, and people are laying flowers at his star at the hollywood walk of fame. He died yesterday in dallas, again working as the cracter that maids him famous the world over, best known for his role as is the scheming oil tie can, jr ewing on "dallas" and he was the loveable astronaut tony nelson on "i dream of jeanie." We have more on his life and career and the sidewalk out there has been a flurry of activity as people come by to witness his star. 

[00:09:02]


>> Reporter: And, already, we are having a legend leave us, harris. Larry hagman dying of complications from cancer at the age of 81. He played the villain, people the world over loved to hate. 
>> And, in return... 
>> I get 25% of your earnings from all sources. 
>> Reporter: Remembered as j. R. Ewing with the swagger and grit, he was one of the world's most famous actors, during the height of dallas's popularity. 
>> Who shot jr? How many parodies were that of that. 
>> The evil side, machiavellian plotting... 
>> Reporter: Fellow cast members released statements. Linda gray, who was his on screen wife was with him in his final moments, he was creative, generous, funny and loving and talented and there could have been no j. R. Without him. 
>> He left a legacy of being a top-notch villain and had the little laugh and he was relentless in his pursuit, he was just j. R. 
>> But I do! 
>> Harris: Too distraught to face the cameras, was barbara eden, and she recalls the texas tornado, a whirlwind of big laughs, big smiles and unrestrained personality. 
>> Harris: The come back of "dallas", a couple of seasons ago wasuccessful and a new season starts and I wonder how fans will handle his death and the story line. 
>> Reporter: The writers are doing so, as well, harris, and "entertainment weekly" is reporting that he completed taping a number of episodes, they say and, this fall and he will appear in season 2 of the series, which airs in january. And says it his passing is being incorporated into the show and they'll work on way way to give the character the proper send off he deserves, but, "dallas" without jr, will be really interesting, or, perhaps, maybe boring without him. 

[00:11:15]


>> Harris: Oh, no. I, along with hundreds of thousands of young girls, i imagine, still have the jeans that say, who shot j. R.? I can't fit in them anymore but I was a big fan of the show. Good to see you, dominic. Right now, investigators working on a mystery at a strip club. The place blew up. Among the injured, firefighters. Was it an accident or something else?

>> Harris: They got him, fbi picks up one of the ten most wanted fugitives, jose luis saenz, a gang member wanted for shooting and killing two members of his rival gang in los angeles in 1998. Police arresting him in mexico and taking him back to l.A. They say he thought his girlfriend was going to tell police about the murder and he kidnapped, raped and killed her. She was also the mother of his child. He was on the fbi's most wanted list since 2009, putting him among the ranks of usama bin laden and the notorious boston crime lord, james whitey bollinger: A manhunt comes to a close with police arresting a man suspected of opening fire inside a target store in suburban denver yesterday in aurora and the "denver post" reporting police are holding a 33-year-old man facing a string of charges including robbery and attempted homicide. Police say a man wearing a ski mask walked into the target store last night and fired a single shot into the ceiling. 

[00:16:07]


>> I seen my people run, just dashing out, and somebody came out there and started shaking me and it was like, call 911, there has been a shooting and i thought he was playing around until I seen everybody srt running out of the store. 
>> It was someone acting stupid with a gun and, thankfully, you know, I don't think he got away with anything. 
>> Harris: Fortunately nobody was hurt. Here's the context and maybe aurora, colorado sounds familiar to you, because, in july 12 people died inside a movie theatre whgunman went on a rampage. Investigators are on the scene trying to figure out what caused a massive gas explosion, in springfield, massachusetts, several buildings are leveled and this is what is left of the strip club. That bliterated in the explosion and a neighboring daycare center was thankfully closed at the time, and the scene looks like a war zone, 20 people hurt. 11 of them firefighters. Who were at the scene responding tie gas leak, they say and wiptss described what they saw: 
>> You heard the boom and kind of got startled for a minute and then you heard screaming and everybody within the buildings are screaming and, you are trying to figure out what, you know, what just happened, that would make a building shake like that. 
>> Harris: And nicole jacobs is in boston at our fox affiliate, wfxt. Do we have any idea what the official word of cause now is? 
>> Reporter: No, harris, no official cause of this blast, at this hour. I can tell you, though, natural gas officials commented candidly about the mixture of gas and air and if those conditions are ripe, anything could have sparked the blaze from a door bell ringing to a phone ringing. But, right now, they say they have not been able to find anything definitive as to the cause of the blaze and that part is still under investigation. Harris? 

[00:18:14]


>> Harris: I was telling viewers more than half of the people who were hurt were first responders. How are they doing tonight? 
>> Reporter: We were told tonight all of them are out of the hospital and recovering, at home tonight. As you said, earlier, 20 people, total, 11 of those firefighters, we're talking about police officers, and natural gas workers, water and sewage worker as well as a couple of civilians, even a local photographer, was injured as well and we are talking about burns to the face and hands and broken bones. Head problems, we're told, because of how loud that blast was, but, again, the good news tonight, all of them, we're told, are recovering at home. Harris? 
>> Harris: Thankfully. Nicole, thank you very much. Well, hours ago we heard that the state department had been evacuated. Unfortunately, though, not before several people were seriously hurt. What went wrong at the headquarters for u.S. Diplomacy, we'll let you know and also a plane with more than 70 passengers on board makes an emergency landing.

>> Harris: Two videos coming into fox news and we'll look at it, it shows an 80 foot yacht going up in flames, wow. The yacht is named bliss. It is completely burning up. Billowing out from the ship and the u.S. Coast guard says it was about 15 to 20 miles off the coast of miami beach and caught fire. Three people were on board at the time and we understand they jumped into the water and are okay. Because the coast guard was able to reach them and bliss sank moments later. No injuries reported. No word yet on what caused the fire. Dramatic video, though. In our nation's capitol, a fire at the state department today. They had to evacuate the place. We are told the fire broke out 11:00 this morning while workers were performing maintenance on the building's duct system. They put it out before firefighters actually got there. But, one worker suffered life-threatening injuries, two other people were burned. State department officials continuing operations, during the evacuation in a stand by facility but the headquarters was reopened, a short time later. History in the making this weekend. At the vatican. Pope benedict xvi elevating 6 catholic bishops to the rank of cardinal, cardinals are among the most powerful men in the catholic church and are in charge of electing the next pope and, what makes today's ceremony historic is not just who the new cardinals are but where they come from, lauren green is in our newsroom with more. 

[00:24:28]


>> Reporter: Harris, you know what stands out about this new group is what they are and are not. They are all relatively young, which means the pope is thinking about the long term future of the catholic church and, for the first time in decades, they are neither european or italian. The cardinals hail from columbia, india, lebanon, nigeria, the philippines and one from the united states. A sign of where the church is growing in the global belt of asia and africa and withhe elevation of the six cardinals, pope benedict xvi's papacy may go down in history as perhaps putting in place more members of the exclusive club than any before him and he has appointed well over half of the 120 men who will vote for his successor. 
>> Benedict put a stamp not only on the college of cardinals but on the bishops that he has been appointing around the world, and, that is part of his legacy and it will be interesting to see how that plays out. 
>> Reporter: The elevation of lebanon's cardinal is significant. Showing how important the region is to the catholic church. The trip to syria was recently cancelled because of the unrest there. 
>> He's emphasizing the importance of the middle east and putting someone in there who really I think is a peace maker and willing to dialogue with all of the different parties, i think that is very important. 
>> Reporter: Pope benedict xvi is in relatively good health but at 85 he is showing signs of fatigue and the ceremony was scaled back today, lasting just over an hour but he'll celebrate mass with the new class tomorrow morning. Harris. 
>> Harris: Why such a small group, lauren? I know last time there were 22, I believe, cardinals who were elevated. 
>> Reporter: Many reasons and probably the top reason, since the last in february, a few cardinals turned 80, which made them ineligible to vote in the next conclave, now, 6 brings the number of voting age cardinals to 120 which is the minimum needed. Harris? 
>> Harris: All right, lauren green, thank you very much. A massive electric bill, nobody likes getting them.

>> Harris: I'm harris faulkener, this is the fox report. The bottom of the hour, time now for the top of the news, america mourning the loss of a tv icon. Actor larry hagman passed away yesterday. At the age of 81. Best remembered for his role as a scheming oil man, j.R. Ewing in the hit show "dallas." 
>>> Egypt, growing protests after the new islamist president, mohamed morsi, gave himself virtually unlimit power until the country drafts a new constitution. His opponents calling the move extreme and they warn of growing turmoil and military intervention if the power grab is not withdrawn. 
>>> And the fragile cease-fire between israel and hamas appears to be holding. Some border restrictions in gaza being eased but the threat, a top hamas leader saying the ruling militant group will continue to arm itself despite an israeli border blockade. Connor powell has the latest from jerusalem. 
>> Reporter: Harris, just three days ago, it appeared that israel and hamas were on the brink of a full-on war but the cease-fire is holding and there are encouraging signs life is returning to normal, here in the holy land. Israeli children returned to school yesterday, and now, markets and shops are reopening now that the threat of rockets has ended and today, palestinian children in gaza also returned to school. As the cleanup there begins. No doubt there are still challenges. But, so far, both sides seem willing to continue the cease-fire, part of the agreement calls for an easing of the blockade around gaza. It's not exactly clear what that means but we have seen evidence that the palestinian fishermen in gaza are now being allowed to fish off the coast, something they were not able to do previously when the restriction were in place. Gone are the massive amounts of israeli troops from the border, instead, it is now just small groups of hamas an israeli soldiers, patrolling the border. Harris, no doubt that the cease-fire will be tested in the coming weeks and months ahead. But both israel and hamas are sending representatives to egypt to continue to build on the small amount of progress that already has been achieved. Harris? 

[00:32:49]


>> Harris: Connor, thank you. Let's stay in that part of the world. New developments into the investigation into the death of former palestinian leader yasser arafat. A palestinian official saying his remains will be exhumed on tuesday. Swiss, french and russian experts will take samples from his remains as part of the probe into exactly what killed him. Arafat died in 2004, a month after he had become ill. Palestinian officials have insisted he was poisoned, they say by israel and israel denies the allegation. 
>>> One u.S. Senator calls it political correctness run amock, and we are talking about the result of a government report which show the obama administration's refusal to identify enemies of state as terrorists. The bulk of the problem, accord to the record stems from the justice department, peter doocy with the report from washington. 
>> Reporter: The department of justice has not even identified what topics should be covered in their cowering violent extremism or cve training, despite the fact the report from the government accountability office 210 violent ex islamic extremists are known to have radicalized in north america and 80% began it after 9/11, the face of terror is changing and susan collins, one of the senators who commissioned the report, says the administration's identification of the 2009 shut itting at fort hood, texas as workplace violence, is one reason that law enforcement agents nationwide are not properly learning who they should be on the lookout for. 
>> To counter the threat, to better understand its roots, and, how it may develop among certain people in our own country, we have to be willing to name the threat, to understand it, in order to counter it. 
>> Reporter: The gao report says plainly that misinformation about the threat and dynamics of radicalization to violence can harm security by sending local stake holders in the wrong direction as unsnarm creating tension with potential community partners but there is a bright shot in the gao report. The homeland security department is noted as effectively identifying and communicating to their partners, the elements training on encountering violent extremism should cover. Harris. 

[00:35:20]


>> Harris: A month after super storm sandy, a new york city neighborhood suffered through fire and flooding. Thieves struck at least three houses in the breezy point section of queens. Over thanksgiving and one couple reportedly losing a $25,000 coin collection along with jewelry and watches, that hey hadn't been able to retrieve yet. The break ins happening wednesday and thursday when many families were away for the holiday. 
>>> Also, on long island "the new york post" reporting people without electricity for normal electric bills. As if the outages never happened. Jonathan is one of them. There is his bill, he's holding it up and says the long island power authority sent him a $649 bill for the long beach home he left in october. And, a $281 bill for his new great neck home. He's also expecting a $1700 bill for his storm ravaged restaurant in long beach that still doesn't have power. The statement is making no mention of potential refunds for the blackouts. There is a flip side at least to all of this. Hope for relief for the areas hardest hit by the storm, from small business saturday, the saturday after thanksgiving. When consumers are encouraged to support their local small businesses. The day carries more significance, as you might imagine than a couple of years ago. Especially for local retailers, struggling to bounce back after suffering from sandy. In new york, from staten island to long island, mom and pop shops are promoting huge sales, many of those store owners donating portions of the profits to local relief efforts. Now, that is the flip side we can live with and, anna coyman is here. 
>> This is what has been going on, and many hoping small business saturday will give the bottom line a boost, the owner of rumors on long island says 40% of the business comes during the last three months of the year and because consumers in the area are more concerned about buying necessities than holiday gifts she is concerned it will be impossible to make up those sales, but, the owner is thankful all of her vendors are allowing her to delay payment. 

[00:37:39]


>> I was in tears, actually, over that, because I was scared. I don't want to lose my credit, my good name and my reputation. So, they are sticking b me. 
>> This business is like your child, isn't it? 
>> This is my other home. 
>> Reporter: Small business owners relate to that in the wake of black friday, local businesses are urging customers to keep their wallets out and give back to the local communities, especially in neighborhoods devastated by the storm. Last year, the small business saturday it is estimated 100 million people participated in the growing annual event. 
>> Harris: This number keeps going up but the last I read, impact of sandy will be in the the $50 billion range. What help is out there for these small businesses? 
>> Reporter: The number you are referring to there is coming from moody's analytics and, $20 million is from airlines cancelling flights and restaurants not serving meals and casinos not being able to take bets and the u.S. Small business administration is making loans of up to $2 million available to companies, trying to get their heads back above water. 
>> We have been on the ground for weeks now, and, working closely with families to help them get back on their feet as quickly as they can. 
>> Reporter: In manhattan, mayor bloomberg announcing a new program today to make $5.5 million in matching grants available for new york city businesses, most impacted by super storm sandy. 
>> Harris: The world would not be the same without mom and pop shops. Good to see you, thank you. The president doing some christmas shopping, this small business saturday, and he is taking his daughters, malia and sasha to the one more page bookstore, an independent neighborhood bookstore in arlington, virginia and the white house saying the president bought 15 children's books as gifts for family.

>> Harris: Live pictures coming into fox news, beaverton, oregon and look closely at the right section of your screen. That is a truck hanging over an overpass, we are told, highway 217 in beaverton and in the last few minutes, when we were in the commercial break we saw them pull somebody out of that and we understand it was the driv of the truck. We don't have any idea what is hanging on below them, if there are drivers they are getting out of the way, the story is coming in, but the picture is so eye-popping and moments ago, we are learning the good news, the guy who was in there however he got himself in that position has been pulled out alive. If there is news to report, we'll come back to it. But, now, wow, what a picture. Former championship boxer hector macho comacho died, shot in the face earlier this week and passed away today from his injuries at a hospital in puerto rico. He was taken off of life support early this morning with much of his family by his side. Doctors say he was brain dead and there was nothing more they could do. He and a friend were shot while sitting in a car. The friend died at the scene and drugs were found inside though car and police have no suspects or witnesses. And, he battled alcohol and drug abuse and problems, I should say throughout his life but will be best remembered for his boxing career, amassing several world titles in different weight closs classes and is best known for knocking out sugar ray leonard, the pride of puerto rico, raised in harlem, new york, he was just r50 years old.

>> Now! Now! Open it! 
>> Harris: The bra bandit was anything but a smooth criminal. Taking a swing at a surveillance camera. The clerk said he could tell that she was nervous. 
>> She was scared, too. I looked and she was scared. 
>> Harris: The woman dropped much of the money running out of the store and police hope the video will lead to an arrest. 
>>> Also, in the golden state, a high speed chase ending in a violent crash, just outside of anaheim.

Eating is no longer allowed at historic sites. Amy kellogg explains. 

[00:51:26]


>> Reporter: Police shoo a girl off the steps, she says it's not fair. Critics call it the war o PANINIs AND THOSE BEHIND THE NEW Ban on snacking around rome's historic monuments say the city has fallen to a level of unsustainable vulgarity with the consumption going on about town, an order established by the mayor of rome, bans eating food on the spanish steps at the found and other well-known tourist attractions, all punishable by a fine. An order which has taken many visitors by surprise. 
>> I think it is crazy. Mad. Why? I must pay 50 euros because I am eating my favorite ice cream near the fountain? 
>> Reporter: Fines can range from the equivalent of 35 to $650. All to keep the teenager city clean. 
>> I think I think it is right, this law, because, we can protect the monuments. 
>> Reporter: So far, the bark is worse than e the bite. Police prefer to warn people to take their gelato elsewhere than to find when rome needs tourism in the town, too. La dolce vita experience involves food, but a fleeting piece of pizza may go unnoticed but approximating a picnic will land you in trouble. Similar restrictions apply in other italian cities, too. The hope is that the rules will not deter tourists, but by keeping the historic sites clean will keep them coming, amy kellogg, fox news. 
>> Harris: And, they say it only takes a dollar and a dream, powerball is back in the news and our floor director matt, got a ticket with another mega jackpot tonight, if you win, take us to italy! We'll tell you how big it is. Stay with us. daughter 18th, five days later, I had a massive heart attack. Bayer aspirin was the first thing the emts gave me. Now, I'm on a bayer aspirin regimen.

>> Harris: A decade after she survived a kidnapping or gilles elizabeth smart is telling her story. She was 14 when she was snatched from her bedroom at knife point in 2002. And now at 25 years old she's working on her memoir telling the details of how she was held captive by a homeless street preacher and rescued after 9 months, the book written by chris stewart, a congressman-elect from utah.

It leveled the strip club and damaged 40 other buildings. 20 people hurt, most firefighters, thankfully no one was killed. And on this day in 1932, the long arm of the law got longer when the fbi crime lab first opened its doors in washington, back then it was more reality, than public relations tool for the fbi director, j. Edgar hoover and, the bureau chose the room for the lab because it had a sink. Six years later they installed the lie detector, the one room laboratory which once handled 200 pieces of evidence per year eventually grew into a massive facility and, crime fighting got more scientific, 80 years ago, today. That is how fox reports on this saturday, november the, 2012, I'm harris faulkener, hope you are having a great long thanksgiving weekend. Thanks for sharing part of it with me tonight.

Ken Verdoia) Mary, we've talked several times about the beautiful video that's available only on the DVD. We just saw a few scenes from "Final Journey."

So, on this DVD, you'll be receiving over 20 minutes of bonus material, starting from the headwaters of the Colorado River in the Rocky Mountains all the way to the Gulf of California and, of course, the scenic celebration of the Grand Canyon. (Mary Dickson) And that's what it is, a scenic celebration, and it's one that really is unforgettable. I mean, maybe you've never been to the Grand Canyon.

Barrel. Did you broaden that you stood for nothing. Did you leave out a majority of the country. It may take the republicans four brag. Everybody gets in everything you did and nobody is going to admit he is wrong or she is wrong. Joy read and jonathan alter, both msnbc political analysts. Joy, you first and then john jump in here. It seems like if you look at next time, 2016, there are two directions in the party. People like rubio who is telling you about the seven-days of creation. On the other end of the world, you have chris christie talking about how many days it is going to clean up this mess from sandy. One is living in the secular, real world. One is off in the theological, idealogical, ethereal worth the right likes to get into. Joy, you are shaking your head. They haven't decided to go sky-high into ideology or to try to become a more modern party. That's still the same question. 
>> I think you picked the right person to focus on, marco rubio. There are three rings of the republican party, the evangelical right, the business wing and then the joe the plumber wing, which is, we call the tea party. They all sort of rushed into the void that was created by the economic recession with the business wing deciding they wanted one of their own to be president, mitt romney. With the evangelicals deciding to legislate on morals, on contraception and with the tea party saying we are going to impose small government austerity on the rest of the country. All three collapsed in this election in 2012. They have to decide which is strong enough to survive. My personal theory is that the business wing was always the strongest and will be the surviving wing and you can hear that in this talk about loosening up on immigration. They want looser immigration rules. They are the with unthat is going to try to assert themselves. That's cross purposes with the tea party wing that is dead set against immigration. 

[00:02:50]


>> Don't trust the good will of the business community. By the way, the lay unions ought to be jump out there organizing everybody comes in legal or not. The business community doesn't want real immigration. They don't want work permits. They want to get them in here as fast as they can and as cheap as they can. Let me go to john with history. You and ibout 1988, the democrats had won a race. This is a race. The key thing is not that you lose or that you lose by a lot. They didn't lose by a huge amount. It is when you lose when you think you are going to win, when you rethink your party. Just like dukakis. Everybody thought, the duke has got it. He is up by 17. In august, he loses by eight. He could have lost by more. This time, they thought they would win. They kept thinking. They lose by about six. Here is the question. Are they going to do that kind of thing the democrats did, which is to widen the party, go to the dlc root and go for the middle, go for business and not further right. Which way are they headed right now? 
>> To do a little history here quickly. The actual rethinking started after the 1984 loss to ronald reagan by walter mondale. You had the emergence that year of gary hart in what they call the new democrats. So that idea that we've got to broaden our appeal, get away from some of these kind of paleo liberal ideas that have been dominating the party for a long time helped the democrats. It took eight years before they came back into power in 1992. That rethinking period was enormously important. The republicans have not yet gun that process. They need to come to terms with the fact that they just aren't appealing to enough people. They also have what one writer called a culture of contempt in their party. They disrespect voters and other people. They need a friendlier, more uplifting, more inclusive message and if they don't get it, they won't get power back. 

[00:05:11]


>> The comment I made was that george w. Bush spoke as if it was a foreign language. What's worst, to be condescending or ignorant. They were falling into those two camps, hard right or change with the times. 
>> I think he did honorably well, came pretty close. He is a northeastern liberal. That's not where we are going. I'm optimistic because there was a very strong republican bench that did not enter the fray with all the soul-searching about what ideology we are going to pursue is going to come from them. I think it will be a fairly reaganite, conservative one. 
>> The republican party is a mad man party in a modern family america. It doesn't fit anymore. 
>> By the way, charles crowd, as you and I know, used to be a speech writer for t aforementioned walter mondale. 
>> They must have some fish to fry. What's charles pushing? He is a neocon. His priority will be to make sure they have this very show show venice stick party. They need to appeal to hispanics and to figure out how to integrate all these different wings of the party in a way that expands beyond aging white men. Their party has become a regional white old party. It doesn't cut it if anymore in america. That's what this election showed. 

[00:07:11]


>> Can you, joy, see around the country. They did become pretty much a white party. That has to do with the fact we have an african-american president. There is going to be tremendous loyalty to him. The first person also benefits trendously from group loyalties. Here is the question, if we had had a white liberal running instead of an african-american liberal. Would there have been more of an opportunity for the republicans to run an african-american and change things around that way? Are they flexible enough to reach out to the classic minority who are african-americans who have been around longer than the white people. 
>> I think the problem is forgetting their tone which is very ofutting. Their core philosophy is not popular with the minority groups. A lot of the messaging and tone. You can't just try to find an african-american or latino candidate that will mouth the same words. Happy holidays. The best of campaign 2012. Think of this is a football highlight show after the big game. Corporations are people. 47%. The first debate. We'll go over all the hits and the misses with our all-star cast. This is going to be fun. ?????? ??????

>>> Welcome back to hardball. It is the hardball 2012 post-game show. Mitt romney succinctly summed up the gop primary season in an infamous call to donors. We had 20 republicans debates. That was absolutely nuts. The august 2011 debate showed there entrancecy generals on the issue of raising taxes. Watch grover nord quist's people go to work. 
>> I am going to ask a question to everyone here on the stage. Say you had a deal, a real spending cuts deal, 10-1 as byron said, spend willing cuts to tax increases. Speaker, you are already shaking your head. Who on this stage would walk away from that deal. Could you raise your hand if you feel so strongly about not raising taxes that you would walk away on the 10-1 deal? 
>> Joining me to review that list of greatness, another highlights and low lights. Michael steele, and greg howard, both msnbc contributors. Let me ask you this. Is that a good day or a bad day for the republicans? 

[00:13:19]


>> I think it was a bad day. I thought it was very interesting that later on that huntsman said that he should have taken the 10-1 deal. He could have carved out a new deal on the stage. 
>> It wouldn't have looked very good after the election. 
>> I'm just saying that that moment sort of solidified the rest of the story for this party. 
>> You don't want to be the one that voted against it or vote for it when it fails. 
>> I agree with the chairman it was the beginning and end for john huntsman. It was also in the long-term the beginning of the end for mitt romney. 
>> How so? 
>> It is today's potics. 
>> They used to say, you have to be the most segregationist guy in the south. Somebody would always go to your right. 
>> I guess you could say that whatever an early primary season crowd claps for furiously is going to kill you in ohio. 
>> I get thrilled seeing how great politics is. Let's get back to the iowa caucuses, another unique state. Mitt romney and the superpac that were supporting him were in a mission to an nile late all competition with the ads to bomb the hell out of the city. Newt gingrich was the biggest threat. Here is a romney supporting ad destroying newt. 
>> You know what makes barack obama happy, newt gingrich's baggage? He has more baggage than the airlines. Freddie mac helped cause the xlik collapse. Gingrich paid in. They paid him $36,000 an hour, $1.6 million. He teamed up with nancy pelosi on global warning and together they co-sponsored a bill supporting china's brutal one-child policy. 

[00:15:38]


>> There has been a lot of discussion in my head about whether ads work in general elections. No ad is going to change their mind. 
>> In primaries, they are deadly, particularly in republican primaries. That ad in particular for newt gingrich was devastating. 
>> Didn't you see the loving looks. 
>> Real quick on that. I would have pivot off of that caption of him and nancy together. That's what the people are looking for, that partnership, working, getting things done. They were talking about global warning. 
>> The other thing about that ad, it was symbolic of the entire mitt romney campaign strategy in the primaries, which was a sort of take no prisoners, attack the other guy strategy. It wasn't about philosophy. He did nothing to show that mitt romney was a committed conservative. It just showed that mitt romney had tons of money and some very clever consultants that could carve up anybody in his path. That left him with a lot of making up to do once he secured the nomination. The way he got the nomination as tip phied by that ad showed weakness. 
>> Somebody is is going to be the republican nominee and that person is going to beat obama and all you have to do is be that nominee. 
>> That was his theory. Breaking up is hard to do. Once mitt romney secured the nomination in the early spring, having everybody fall in line, it just wasn't there. 
>> Throughout the republican primary, mitt romney pushed himself so far to the right, especially on immigration that course correction was nearly impossible. I don't think he even tried one. Here is the immigration exchange that became a defining line on the hard right for romney. Let's listen. 

[00:17:51]


>> Let's stay on immigration. Governor romney, there is one thing I'm confused about. You say you don't want to round up people and deport them. You say they would have to go back to their home countries and apply for citizenship. If you don't deport them, how do you get them home? 
>> The answer is self-deportation. We are not going to round people up. 
>> What's wrong with that, howard? 
>> First of all, the phrase self-deportation. 
>> Wainest itablely a headline. 
>> The firing part? 
>> That these people are just sort of numbers on the spreadsheet. The cold heartedness and the coldbloodedness played into everybody's view of romney. 
>> It is just not realistic. The snickering you heard even among republicans in the hall. Grandpa is going to wake up and say, you kids stay. I'm getting out have o here. 
>> We will be back to talk about the big moments of the election. The right ring's most outrageous conspiracy theories are coming up next. This is "hardball," a place for politics. Not today.

[ Gps ] turn left. I don't think so. 
[ Male Announcer ] FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN, And made a monthly trip to the clinic to get his blood tested. But not anymore. Bob's doctor recommended a different option: Once-a-day xarelto????. Xarelto???? is the first and only once-a-day prescription blood thinner for patients with afib not caused by a heart valve problem, that doesn't require routine blood monitoring. Like warfarin, xarelto???? is proven effective to reduce the risk of an afib-related stroke. There is limited data on how these drugs compare when warfarin is well managed. No routine blood monitoring means bob can spend his extra time however he likes. New zealand! Xarelto???? is just one pill a day, taken with the evening meal. And with no dietary restrictions, bob can eat the healthy foods he likes. Do not stop taking xarelto???? rivaroxaban without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping may increase your risk of having a stroke. Get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of bleeding, like unusual bruising or tingling. You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take xarelto???? with aspirin products, nsaids or blood thinners. Talk to your doctor before taking xarelto???? if you currently have abnormal bleeding. Xarelto???? can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. You are likely to bruise more easily on xarelto????, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop. Tell your doctors you are taking xarelto???? before any planned medical or dental procedures. Before starting xarelto????, tell your doctor about any conditions, such as kidney, liver or bleeding problems. Ready to change your routine? Ask your doctor about once-a-day xarelto????.

>>> Back to "hardball." The final weeks of president obama's term were upon us. It is hard to remember all the bizarre conspiracy theories. President obama's 2010 trip to india. U.S. Congresswoman, michele bachmann and others on the right, were up in arms over rumors about what the trip would cost. 
>> I think we know that just within a day or so, the president of the united states will be taking a trip over to india that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day. We have never seen a trip at this level before of this level of excess. I think it is not a good signal to send to the american people when the american people are quite, frankly, struggling with high job losses. 

[00:23:30]


>> For comparison, $200 million a day would have surpassed the daily cost of the war in afghanistan at the time. That nonfactual story from michele bachmann about the cost of obama's trip was started been an unnamed source on an indian news website and somehow got into the ether there. We can't talk about conspiracy theories without bringing up rush limbaugh. Remember the first day of the republican convention was canceled due to hurricane isaac. Rush then floated the idea that president obama was somehow involved with the weather reports showing that tampa might get hit. 
>> You've got a hurricane coming. The national hurricane center, a government agency, very hopeful that the hurricane gets near tampa. The national hurricane center is obama. It's a national weather service, part of the commerce department. It's obama. Obviously, obama is sending fema in advance of the hurricane hitting tampa so that the republican convention is nothing but a bunch of tents, in tampa, A BUNCH OF RVs AND STUFF. Make it look like a disaster area before the hurricane even hits there. 
>> Was he laughing at his own b.S. There? Did you ever think rush limbaugh would warn us of a skewed weather report. Next, an extreme case of preelection fear among gerring. What caused a republican judge in texas to float the idea of a tax increase in his state? It was about the need to beef up the military personnel in case civil war breaks out because president obama got reelected. Do you believe it? Here is judge head on that one. 
>> I am thinking worst case scenario, civil unrest, civil disobedience, civil war, not just a few riots here and demonstrations. We are talking lexington, concord, take up arms and get rid of the guy. He is going to send in u.N troops. I don't want them in lubbock county. So I'm going to stand in front of the armored personnel carriers and say, you are not coming in here. The sheriff, I have already asked him, are you going to back me? He said, yeah, I'll back you. 

[00:25:40]


>> That was his idea of a worst case scenario. Finally birtherism with a twist. Here is steve king with how president obama's mother managed to convince us all that her son was born in hawaii, not in kenya. 
>> I looked into that before he was sworn in for the presidency. We went down into the library of congress and we found the micro fish there, only two in hawaii. Ea had published the birth of barack obama. It would have been hard to fraudulently file the birth notice of barack obama being born in hawaii. There doesn't mean there aren't other ways they could have announced that by telegram from kenya. 
>> Maybe she neglected to consider that naming her son barack obama might be a problem for her son's future run for the united states. Have a great holiday weekend!In your heart.

The nuwave takes the power of a regular conduction oven, the speed of a professional convection oven and the technology of infrared cooking and combines them all into one affordable, advanced kitchen appliance. Couction is the heat that is applied directly to the food's surface. Then there's convection. Now, this is where a fan circulates the hot air inside the oven, distributing the heat evenly around the food. And finally we added far infrared. These are invisible heat waves that penetrate the food, cooking on the inside and outside at the same time, ensuring that the outside is nice and brown while the inside is juicy and moist-- absolutely perfect. 

[00:12:26]


>> The nuwave, from a chef's perspective and a restauranteur and a chef instructor, is ingenious because it uses the three methods that we use with big, gigantic machines, condenses those methods, puts it in a small unit that the consumer can use then at home. It's brilliant. 
>> There's no preheat time, it heats up very, very quickly, so that does cut down a lot of time and extra energy. 
>> Joe: Plus, with extensive independent testing, it's been proven that the nuwave oven cooks up to 50% faster than a regular oven and-- get this-- uses up to 85% less energy too. 
>> The money you save on your electric bill alone can virtually pay for the nuwave itself. 
>> How does the nuwave make food so delicious while making it healthier? 
>> Since the nuwave cooks inside and outside at the same time, more inner fat contents are released from the food, but it also seals in the natural juices. This ultimately reduces your fat intake, making all your foods healthier, juicier and more delicious than ever before. 
>> You still get the convenience of speed, but you're not sacrificing the nutrition, and that's really important. 
>> You know, we've even had world-renowned silliker lab independently test the nuwave oven against a regular oven for fat content left in food. They found that the nuwave oven kept more of the natural juices while releasing more of the fat, proving the nuwave oven makes better-tasting food that is better for you, and that's an independent third-party test. No other product can say that. 
>> As a sports nutritionist, one of the things that i... A couple of things that i really like about the nuwave oven is you don't have to add the fats, and then also the fact that the fats that are in the food itself actually drain off, but what's really nice about it is with doing that, you don't lose the taste. 
>> We just took a group of real people and we put 'em together and we started off by taking "before" blood tests, so that we had a baseline, and 60 days later, we did blood tests again, checking up on cholesterol levels, and 75% of those individuals lowered their total cholesterol without changing anything within their lifestyle other than they started cooking with the nuwave oven. 

[00:14:37]


>> I dropped almost 20 points in my cholesterol and 2-1/2 pounds in body fat by using the nuwave oven. 
>> I've lost 15 points in my cholesterol since I started using this nuwave oven. 
>> I never thought something this simple and this new way of cooking could change my life, but it really did. 
>> By now, it's easy to see that the nuwave oven sets the standard in kitchen appliances. Come on, spend more time with your family and friends. Eat healthier and better-tasting food. Hey, have more fun in the kitchen! Are you ready for the new wave in cooking technology? 
>> The nuwave oven. 
>> Here's how to order. 
>> Announcer: Professional chefs create great-tasting meals from years of experience and by using professional equipment. And now you can too with the nuwave oven pro, the number-one countertop oven in america. No more defrosting or preheating that giant oven. The nuwave cooks all your meals faster, better, healthier and easier, guaranteed. 
>> I think it's a great quality product. It works really well. 
>> The nuwave oven is something I recommend to everyone. 
>> Announcer: The nuwave oven is not a microwave oven, but uses conduction, convection and infrared power simultaneously, cooking foods from both the outside and inside at the same time. This cooks food up to 50% faster than a conventional oven, while using up to 85% less energy. The nuwave oven is a complete kitchen all in one. It can broil, roast, grill, bake, barbeque, steam, dehydrate and even air fry, all in one small countertop appliance. Plus there's no open flame or smoke, so it's perfect to take anywhere: The boat, r.V., Camper, dorm, or even a hotel room! And since the nuwave oven pro is dishwasher-safe, cleanup takes seconds.

>> Man: The nuwave oven for me is the best product I've seen come across since I discovered it eight years ago, just for the fact of its simplicity, its durability, its ease of use and the end product that comes out of it. It's really a joy to work with. 
>> Heidi: Even though the nuwave is small and compact, it's got a huge cooking space. 
>> Joe: Uh-huh. >> Come on over here... Now, look at this mountain of king crab legs. 
>> Oh, yeah! 
>> Where else... Oh! Could you fit... [Joe laughs] this amount of food in such a small and compact oven? 
>> That's a crab fest! 
>> Dinner parties, feeding a large family... >> Right... What do you have here? 
>> Look at these beautiful pork tenderloins. Whether it be a mountain of crab legs, a large pork roast or even a full-size pizza, the nuwave can do it all. 

[00:20:46]


>> Joe: That's why the nuwave is perfect! It's perfect for small kitchens, dorm rooms, the r.V. Or camper... Even your boat. There's no flame, there's no smoke. It's just an efficient appliance that does it all better and faster than anything else. 
>> It is much more convenient using the nuwave oven because of the less pots and pans and cleanup you have after cooking a meal. I believe the nuwave oven does everything it's advertised for and more. Everyone should have one. 
>> You know, heidi, we keep talking about how the nuwave oven makes food... >> Mm-hmm. 
>> Great... >> Mm-hmm. 
>> And fast, but also healthy. 
>> That's right. Now, with the triple combo cooking power, the nuwave seals in the natural juices but it also allows the fats and oils to drip away from your food, which reduces the amount of fat you eat. Eating healthier, better-tasting food in less time-- you can't ask for anything more. >> [Chuckles] 
>> take a look at this test we did. We made three different meats side by side, each in a regular oven and in the nuwave oven. 
>> Joe: First we made a beef roast. We measured the fat drippings left from both the nuwave oven and the conventional oven. When we poured the grease, there were 2.2 ounces of fat drippings from the nuwave oven and only one ounce of fat drippings from the conventional oven-- that's a difference of 120% of unhealthy fat drippings. 
>> Heidi: We did a similar test for country style ribs. When we compared the fat drippings, the nuwave oven produced 250% more fat drippings than the conventional oven. 
>> Joe: Then we cooked about three pounds of chicken quarters. 
>> Heidi: When we poured the grease, there was a difference of 125% of unhealthy fat drippings. 
>> If your family were to eat chicken three times a week for a month-- and some of us do-- by using the nuwave oven, you could be reducing six cups of fat drippings from your diet! 
>> Using less fats and oils when cooking help decrease your risk of heart disease and cancers and also just will increase your mood and give you more energy, make you feel better. 

[00:22:47]


>> My counter space in my kitchen-- you have to earn your place. I love it because it makes the work that I do exercising every day count more when I come home and I eat smart. 
>> So it's the holidays, right? Or maybe you're just throwing a huge dinner party. Well, guess what? We know this nuwave oven is gonna deliver for you. 
>> That is for sure. You know, joe, every year for thanksgiving, we have 30 people...30! [Laughs] 
>> 30, and I cannot live without the extender ring kit. >> Yes, the extender ring lifts it up. 
>> It fits so much more food, great for appetizers, just like we have here. >> Look at it-- we got the extra rack here. This is just a fountain of appetizers. With the extender ring, you can do up to a 16-pound turkey, and I have done that. >> Yeah? 
>> I have done that. 
>> For thanksgiving? >> Yes, absolutely. >> Mmm... 
>> Oh... >> Oh... >> Baby... 
>> Look at that steam... 
>> Wait, wait, I want you to watch this, watch this. I'm gonna just... Watch this. Look at the juice! >> Look at that... >> Do you see that juice? You want a piece? 
>> Right, once you've made a turkey in your nuwave, you will never go back... >> Never go back... >> To your conventional oven. >> Again. >> Mm-mm... Delicious. >> Look at this. 
>> Look at that! >> Oh, my gosh... If you liked the turkey, you're gonna love the ham. 
>> Ham. >> Up to a 14-pound ham-- again, with the extender ring, you have so much more volume... Raises it up three inches. 
>> That would feed a very large number of people. [Laughs] 
>> a very large number of people, and... Oh, prime rib. I love prime rib. >> That is a beauty. >> Do you love it? How much is this gonna cost per plate in a gourmet restaurant? 
>> You know, prime rib happens to be one of my favorites. 30 a person, if not more, depending on where you go. 
>> Here we go... O.K., Let's just take a big slice here. 
>> Beautiful... [Joe laughs] oh, look at that! [Gasps] 
>> oh... Come on, I want to eat! 
>> That is perfect!

>> Did you ever wonder why you often end up with dry food from your conventional oven? That's because dry heat takes a long time to penetrate into the food and as it does, it pushes out moisture, so you can end up with dry meat, poultry and fish. Restaurants and professional chefs have solved this problem using steam-infused roasting ovens. Ninja has taken that same steam-infusion technology and made it available in your home for the very first time. 
>> Mark, I'm going to demonstrate this. We have this beautiful prime rib here. Now, I have just simply seasoned this with a little salt and pepper and now I'm giving it a really good sear to get that beautiful color that you see here. So now I'm going to take this out, put it on my rack. 
>> Got it. 
>> And this is where the magic's gonna happen. A little beef stock. You could actually do this, use your imagination, do whatever you want to do. I use a little red wine. You could throw herbs in there. 
>> O.K., So this is going to give the steam infusion that we were just talking about and it's also gonna give the flavor infusion at the same time. 
>> You can't do that in an oven. That's the beauty of this. Come here and take a look at this. This is a prime rib that we cooked for less than an hour. Take a look at this. 
>> Wow, that looks perfect. 
>> Let me cut you another piece. Look at the juice in that. Is that amazing? 
>> That is definitely cooked perfectly. 
>> But the fact that this cooked in under an hour, absolutely perfect. When I say goof-proof, taste that. Right? 
>> That tastes awesome. Now remember, unlike your big oven at home, with the ninja, no preheating is required, so no wasting time for oven to heat up. 

[00:14:01]


>> Stephanie: And look what else you can do with steam roasting. Check out these ribs. 
>> Mk: Wow! 
>> They are so tender. The meat literally falls from the bone. 
>> You know, I know that if you try to cook ribs like that in a conventional oven, they can come out pretty tough and dry. 
>> I steam roasted a whole chicken. All I did was add lemon and rosemary for a little seasoning. Then I put the chicken broth underneath. 
>> So that's the steam infusion. 
>> That's that beautiful steam infusion. 
>> Also a flavor infusion coming through that. 
>> And 40% less time this took to cook than a conventional oven. Wait till you see how juicy this is. Look at this! Absolutely... 
>> That looks perfect. 
>> So juicy. 
>> That is definitely one juicy chicken. 
>> [Women laugh] 
>> take a look at this salmon with the apricot-mustard glaze. 
>> Mark: Beautiful. Love the apricot mustard. 
>> Cooks up quick and moist. Take a look at this. 
>> Really, in just 10 to 15 minutes? Awesome. 
>> Announcer: No other kitchen appliance gives you ninja's revolutionary steam-infused roasting. Juicy meats and poultry, perfectly tender fish, all done in as little as half the time with less fat. Forget greasy take out and serve ninja fast healthier homemade meals that are juicy and taste great. Your family will thank you every time you steam roast their favorites with the ninja. 
[???...] 
>> I made the prime rib in the ninja and it cooked so much faster than it would have in my regular oven. It was moist, it was delicious. My family absolutely loved it. 
>> I cannot believe how amazing steam roasting is because it helps you get healthier meals on the table a lot faster. 
>> I am amazed by how fast it cooks and how much flavor it seals into the meal. 
>> Steam roasting in the ninja is so easy. I don't even like to cook and even I can do it 
[???...] 
>> our next cooking solution is searious slow cooking. Most recipes have you searing your meats in a skillet, then transferring them to your slow cooker pot. But that means you lose all that flavor in the bottom of the skillet. Only the new ninja cooking system allows you to actually sear, then slow cook in the same professional, non-stick pot, keeping all that delicious flavor in, so your favorite recipes taste better than ever and cleanup is easier because there's just one pot. 

[00:16:30]


>> I love that I can brown my meat and my onions at the same time. I can get this nice flavor, great texture, all in one pot. We're going to make a traditional beef stew here. 
>> Show me how you do it. 
>> Baby potatoes. Baby carrots. 
>> Peas, love the peas. 
>> Frozen peas, ght out of the freezer. 
>> Frozen, no problem with frozen, o.K. 
>> No problem with frozen. A little bit of beef broth. You stir it around a bit. 
>> What happens after that? 
>> Eight hours later, mark, you're home, you're hungry. No problem. The ninja cooked all day while you were at work. 
>> That is terrific. That looks like a beautiful, home cooked meal. That is terrific. Our slow cooking feature is totally programmable, so you're able to prepare dinners in the morning, let them slow cook all day so they're waiting for you when you get home and because it's a professional, non-stick pot, you can even put the ingredients in the pot in the fridge the night before so they're ready to cook in the morning. You can't do that with crockery because it might crack. 
>> I've got chicken wings. Chicken wings with a nice brown caramelized setting. The fact that I could brown them first with the stovetop setting and then put in my ingredients, put the lid on, set it to slow cook and came home hours later to chicken wings that fall right off the bone. 
>> That looks perfectly caramelized, delicious. 
>> You know, mark. The last four years, I've truly used every make and model on the market and this blows out the competition. It is a fantastic machine and it is my new family favorite. Thank you. 
>> You know what, thank you for saying that, stephanie. It is so much more than a slow cooker as you've seen. You have all those different cooking solutions. 
>> Announcer: After a long day, wouldn't you like more quality family time? Now you can. The ninja does more for you than any ordinary kitchen appliance and it's also a revolution in slow cooking technology because now you can sear and saute, then slow cook all in the same pot. Forget transferring from the stovetop to old-fashioned crockery. It's time-consuming and you lose all that flavor. Replace your ordinary slow cooker with ninja's breakthrough searious slow cooking for more flavorful meals that will amaze your family. 

[00:18:38]


[???...] 
>> searious slow cooking with the ninja is revolutionary. I can sear food and then slow cook in the same pot and I've never been able to do that before. 
>> A lot of times, people go for fast foods and you don't know what's in fast foods. You have all the control with your ninja and with the recipes. 
>> Slow cooking is a way to get the meal started before I even leave for my day. And then when we come home, we're done.

>> And the ninja is incredible for gluten-free cakes like the one we made here. Many times gluten-free mixes, they call for an entire stick of butter and they're still dry. That's not possible when you're baking with steam. Look how moist this cake is. We started only 20 minutes ago. 
>> The ninja is perfect for these moist mini vanilla cupcakes I just made. Look how cute they are.

>> And the desserts by the way, you can make with a lot less fat. I just made these strawberry shortcake cupcakes. I only used half a tablespoon of butter. 
>> And my kids say to me, "wow, mom, that was great and it wasn't the same thing you made last tuesday." 
>>>> Does it taste as good as mommy's normal or better than mommy's normal banana bread? 
>> Better! 
>> Better? Oh.

>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you very much, audience. And, welcome to huckabee from the fox news studios in new york city. I hope that you and your family are enjoying some precious and special time together, during this thanksgiving holiday. You know, we all have a lot to be grateful for but sometimes we have to stop and realize it. I'm grateful that I have work, knowing that many of my fellow americans don't. I'm grateful to have the freedom to speak my mind. Even criticize the government, even though in places like iran and north korea it probably gets you killed and I'm grateful to have food to eat and home a sleep in and realize during this special weekend, there are thousands still left stranded and homeless by hurricane sandy and tragically some of our nation's veterans are sleeping on the streets, because we have not provided the resources they were promised. I am grateful for my church. It doesn't just preach the gospel, it practices it. And, it delivered hundreds of food baskets to good families, who just need a little help. To make sure their thanksgiving table has plenty. I'm also grateful for the men and women of our military, who leave their families for months at a time in order to face bullets and bombs to provide me with the freedoms I do so enjoy. I hope never take for granted. I'm grateful for my health. Knowing that many this very day are struggling for their very next breath. I'm grateful for my dogs, because they make me laugh. They keep me company, and, they show me a level of loyalty and unconditional love that is pure and powerful. And I'm grateful for my family. A devoted wife, of 38 years, three children, who are responsible and hard working adults, now. And, for two spectacular grandchildren! 

[00:02:38]


[Laughter]. 
>> Harris: That have given me a renewed hope for the world and also a joy that takes me to a new level. I'm also thankful that I'm going to have the opportunity to personally meet many of you during the next couple of weeks. When I visit about 45 communities to sign copies of my latest book, and that is one that is for every parent and grandparent. Dear chandler, dear scarlett, a collection of letters to my grandchildren but I want it to be letters to your children and grandchildren so you can teach them that more important than material wealth is character and integrity. I hope you will leave them with more than an antique car or knife collection. And, one day, they will say that what they are grateful for, that you gave them, is that you gave your faith and belief in all that is good and godly. 
[Applause]. 
>> Harris: Now, if you want to find out where I'm going to be on the huck-a-bus, visit my web site at mikehuckabee.Com and click on the link to "dear chandler, dear scarlett" and if I'm not able to get to your town it will be available at amazon.Com or your local book retailer. I think you you will be thankful you read it and friends and family will be very grateful that you gave it as a gift. For most of us, holidays are a time to enjoy with our families, for those who are estranged from family members, you know, holidays can be tough. Syndicated radio talk show host larry elder was bitter and angry toward his father who he had not spoken to for ten years, but, all of that changed over an 8 hour conversation when they finally got back together and he writes about it in his new book, "dear father, dear son, two lives, 8 hours." Larry elder joins us now. 
[Applause]. 
>> Harris: You and your -- were estranged for ten years. 

[00:04:39]


>> We were. 
>> Harris: What was it so big that caused you not to talk to him for that length of time. 
>> Governor, thank you for having me. My dad was a marine, one of the first black marines and grew up in the jim crow south and didn't know who his biological father is, the man elder who was in his life the longest, none of which I knew until we sat down after not having spoken to each other for ten years. I was 15. We had a fight over something relatively inconsequential in retrospect and I didn't talk to him for years and I had difficulty sleeping and, can't eat and I wanted to tell him how I felt and I thought I could repair the relationship and that wasn't my goal, it was to call him an sob and he'd all me a name and we'd have a five minute conversation and instead the conversation lasted 8 hours and he went from being a mean sob to an inspiration a learned so many things about him I never knew and when I unloaded the things that bothered me, he said I was a better father to you than mine to me. My dad never said a word about his father and I found out about his up bringing in the conversation. 
>> Harris: You wated to make contact and you had the 8 hour conversation, who broke the ice? You or him and started bringing a little actual conversation into this, rather than just a confrontation I think I did. I'm the one who decided to talk to him. I lived in ohio at the time and my dad is in los angeles and i didn't tell him I was coming and I walked into the restaurant and he was a janitor and worked two full-time jobs as a janitor when I was a kid and cooked for the family on the weekend and no human being worked that heart and that is a reason he was irritable. Go four hours of sleep for a couple of decades and see what mood you are in and added to everything I found out about him. Whence he was a little boy, in the country, athens, georgia, he thought the woman who raised him was his mother, a kid in the neighborhood informed him it was his grandfather and he goes home crying to the grandfather and she said, yes, I'm not your mother, I'm your grandmother. His mother came in and out of his life and had a series of boyfriends and elder was in the mom's life the longest and my dad came home from school and had a fight with the boyfriend and this mom sided with the boyfriend and threw him out of the house, never render, 13 years old and great depression, unemployment 50% for black men. 

[00:07:14]


>> Harris: Larry, what was the relationship with your dad like after you reconciled? 
>> We went from being not speaking to each for ten years, to becoming close, and my dad was emotional and told me about his life, he never told us before and I understood why he was irritable and cold and he believed hard work wins and you get out of life what you put into it and before you complain decide whether there is something else you could have done and sooner or later something bad will happen and how you react to the bad thing tells me whether or not your mom and I raised a man and I said, not too much pressure, dad! 
>> Harris: Larry, how much of your dad do you ever find seeing in yourself? 
>> A whole lot, governor. Much more than I thought. I told myself when I was a kid. I would never be like my father and the older I got, more of my friends said you are just like him, hard working, focused. I'm similar to him. 
>> Harris: It works out like that. People we focus on, ones we think we don't like are the ones we become like because we focus on them all the time. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Harris: Your dad passed away last year, talk about those last months, of his life, and the relationship you had and what you feel like you will always have no matter whether your dad is here or not, of him. 
>> My dad died shortly after this finished the book and i read passages to him. He began having dementia and it was hard to follow that. And I don't want to make light of it but what is good, he had a raucous sense of humor and I had one joke he loved and I told it over and over again and he'd still laugh at it. 
>> Harris: I wish I had a joke like that. 
>> We did normal things, taking him to the doctor, getting a haircut and I took him to a movie," sling blade" and he always wanted to be next to a restroom and I put him next to run and he was restless during the movie, I thought he's ooepd to use the restroom and he said, let's leave. The man in sling blade reminded him of the man who abused him when he was a little boy and he couldn't take it anymore. One of the few times I saw him cry. 

[00:09:31]


>> Harris: Wow. Larry, in the midst of the holidays a lot of families are estranged and people have deep hurts. Give advice to families who are estranged for maybe a mother, father, or husband and wife or sun or daughter? What do they do to start the relationship over. 
>> I hope the book will give to it. 70% of black kids today are born outside of wedlock. Auto% of hispanic kids are and 25% of white kids are, what when you have no male role model in the house? My father didn't have one. And if anybody could have gone awry, it was my dad and, my dad said you should know the difference between right and wrong and value of hard work and no matter how bad the cards are dealt. It is your mortal duty to play them to the best of your ability and the second thing: You never know what is inside someone. What is this downside intelling somebody how you really feel? If it is a relative, parent, child, father, what is the downside, the worst that can happen, and, the best is you can realize you misunderstood each other or had a fight over something inconsequential. 
>> Harris: It usually is. It's a powerful story, and one that really will touch a lot of lives and, may be a great holiday season to bring people together. Appreciate you being here. Thank you, the book is "dear father, dear son." Larry elder. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Harris: Coming up she became a quadriplegic at the age of 17. Later in life, was diagnosed with breast cancer. But with the help of her devoted husband she's battling her challenges and has a great outlook on life. Johnnie ericksson tada and her husband, ken join us next.

[ Male Announcer ] HUMANA. ?????? ?????? 
>> Harris: There is a lot to be said for helping others, johnnie ericksson -- joni eareckson tada became a quadriplegic and, after suicidal thoughts devoted her life to ministering to the disabled all over the world and has now written a book about another battle, breast cancer. Joni eareckson tada and her husband, ken stopped by for a visit, recently. 

[00:14:29]


>> Harris: Thanks for coming here. 
[Applause]. 
>> Harris: Before the show i told you that when I was, you know, just a young by, barely in MY 20s I READ YOUR BOOK AND IT Was life changing to me because you had had this horrible accident as a young person, 17, rendered quadriplegic, athletic person, and, now for the rest of your life in a wheelchair. You you thought about ending your life. What turned you around and you said, no, I'm going to -- life is worth living even in a wheelchair? 
>> Well, I remember one prayer that I prayed in the hospital, it was short, but it was so sincere. It was, lord, if I can't die, then you are going to have to show me how to live. I can't do quadriplegia. I'm an athlete, on the inside. I am on the go, I'm active. I can't do a life in a wheelchair without use of my hands or my legs. But, governor, I really think that it was other people's prayers, cheered me on, that, those prayers broke the crust of doubt and fear around my heart. And, I didn't realize it, but my girlfriends, high school girlfriends were praying for me, every thursday morning with my church youth leader, and for a full year, they did that and, i think I'm resonating from those prayers. I really do. 
>> Harris: Did you ever just say, god, why me? I mean, why me? An athletic, you know, person who has all this physical energy, and, now, I can't move anymore. 
>> I did. Why me. And I got so tired of sitting in the corner, feeling sorry for myself, so much self-pity and one day they wheeled me into the occupational therapy room in the hospital and a guy paralyzed more severely than I was, he was there with his arms like this and had a ventilator and could barely move. At least I had shoulder muscles and a little bit of biceps and they put a pencil in his mouth and said, try writing and i thought surely he'd spit it out because I had, I thought it was beneath me and I saw him and i thought, what courage, I need to have his attitude. And so then, I started to realize, there were a lot of other people with disabilities like me, who needed that same courage, I was beginning to find my friend in occupational therapy found and it was all mainly from digging deep into the bible, to see what god had to say next. What was he going to do next. 

[00:16:58]


>> Harris: You learned not just to write but to paint. Putting the brush in your teeth and I can remember, watching your testimony on billy graham's television specials, many years ago and, just being absolutely amazed that you were able to do this. And, that it was beautiful art. 
>> Thank you, but sometimes i tend to drool over my paintings. And, when I write books and people want me to ought woodward avenue the first page, I would caution them. But thank you, that is encouraging to hear. 
>> Harris: Ken, you and joni have been married 30 years. How did you fall in love with her and tell me about the experiences, it was going to be a challenging kind of marriage. 
>> First of all, governor, one thing I recognized about her is that she has a beautiful heart. And, the bible says, in 1 samuel 16:7, god doesn't look at the things that men look at. But god looks at the heart and she has a beautiful heart. We have had difficulties. We, you know, we have had the same type of difficulties as any other married couple would have. Except we happen to have a disability involved. But, I can tell you you she's my best friend. 
>> I can't fold his laundry or whip up an omelette, I can't rub his back when he's tired. There are many things i, quote can't do but I can cheer him on, affirm him, applaud him. Pray for him. Encourage him, there are so many things that are more important tfolding your husband's underwear. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: And, for respect for johnnie joni I will no longer fold my husband's underwear. 
>> You know what I mean. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: But there are real challenges and it means that for you to travel, for example, it is not just, oh, let's jump into the car and go somewhere. It is -- it involves an extraordinary amount of thought and planning and logistics, for the two of you just to go out, doesn't it? 

[00:19:10]


>> Oh, yeah. I think that one of the things, governor, that we couldn't do on our own. We'd readily admit that. We need help and we have great friends that travel along with us to help the situations, and, you know... 
>> And we tell them that they are helping us, is a way of i don't know cultivating compassion and oh, I don't know, just honoring what the bible has to say about serving others and so I think there is an eternal perspective, people who help us, which is why, ken and I have been so blessed. We want to pass on the blessings to so many other disabled people and their families through our ministry. And, that is what we love doing. Traveling, yes. But also, encouraging a lot of people with disabilities along the way. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: Encouraging things I hear from you guys and this is -- I have to stop and realize, you faced one of the greatest challenges that couples could face. And yet you are not sitting here saying this is a terrible life. I find such joy in both of you and it is remarkable. It is so encouraging and I'm thinking, you know what?

>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: I want to talk about another challenge you face, the diving accident, being quadriplegic was not enough, you were diagnosed with breast cancer. Explain what happened, when you first got that diagnosis, joni, you have breast cancer. 
>> I was overwhelmed. It always happened to other women and there were many issues related to my quadriplegia i didn't have time to get a mammogram. I don't think that way now but when I was diagnosed, it was a shock. And I was frightened what it would mean for ken, my body image is already shot and, how much more to get a mastectomy and chemotherapy, but, my husband, governor, was my strongest advocate through this. Cheering me on, showing up in every blood test and pet scan and bone scan, x-ray, everything. And, it really -- what do you think, ken, drew us closer. 
>> It drew us closer together. I had to pause for a moment. I could have lost my best friend and there was a moment there, where, we didn't know, we didn't know how serious it was going to be. And, you know, every time, one thing we learned, through this journey is that it is hurry up and wait. You get a diagnosis and you have to wait for the lab test and get the lab test and take another test. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: Wait until obamacare kicks in. Sorry about that. Go ahead. 
>> You are right. Yeah. 
>> At one point, I wasn't sure if she was going to make it through the year and I think that probably the sweetest time we had was sitting in the backyard and realizing that we were just in the moment. 
>> Every day is precious. 
>> Every day is precious. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: There were many unique challenges because of your condition as a quadriplegic that bret cancer is daunting enough. But you face extraordinary different challenges, because of the quadriplegia. 
>> That is why I was not able to have radiation. Because, of the quadriplegia, my lungs are already limited, and, to have radiation, it would have damaged them further, and we opted not to have radiation and trust that in what, five or six years I may be declared cancer free, let's hope so. 

[00:26:04]


>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: Your story is truly awesome. You have been through all of these things and god left you here much longer than people would have been able to live with the condition that you experienced as a 17-year-old. What is your life message? What is it that you want to say to the world, every day when you wake up, you say, okay, god, this is what I hope people understand. 
>> That is the way I wake up. I do wake up that way, governor, because, it is so difficult in the morning to just have somebody come into the bedroom, give me a bed bath and toileting routine and pull up my pants and, brush my teeth and I say i can't take it another day, give me strength and I wake up every morning needing desperately, and, that is the only way to live and I wrote this mission out, some years ago, I said, i want to be god's best audio visual aid of how his power shows up best in my weakness. And that is my goal, and, that is what we do at joni and friends, our ministry of just encouraging other special needs families, because, there is so much despair and devastation. People with disabilities are struggling with so much hard ache and I want them to see that god's power can be sufficient in their lives, as well. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: What a powerful story, and I want to stay from the time I first read your book which has been 30 -- 37 years ago. 
>> Wait, you are aging me -- yikes. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: To this day you have been an encouraging and symbol and voice of hope. Ken, thank you for sharing your wonderful perspective. Your life and your wife, with us today. Ken and joni, god bless you and thank you for being here. 
>> Absolutely, thank you, too. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: She says what you think might be chance encounters have already been planned by a higher power. A best-selling author and his wife, an actress and comedienne, join us next. Your gift? Uh... Whew.

[ Male Announcer ] BREAK FROM THE HOLIDAY Stress. Ship fedex express by december 22nd for christmas delivery. me, you know it can be hard to breathe, and how that feels. Copd includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Spiriva helps control my copd symptoms by keeping my airways open for 24 hours. Plus, it reduces copd flare-ups. Spiriva is the only once-daily inhaled copd maintenance treatment that does both. Spiriva handihaler tiotropium bromide inhalation powder does not replace fast-acting inhalers for sudden symptoms. Tell your doctor if you have kidney problems, glaucom trouble urinating, or an enlarged prostate. These may worsen with spiriva. Discuss all medicines you takeeven eye drops. Stop taking spiriva and seek immediate medical help if your breathing suddenly worsens, your throat or tongue swells, you get hives, vision changes or eye pain, or problems passing urine. Other side effects include dry mouth and constipation. Nothing can reverse copd spiriva helps me breathe better.

>> Thank you, governor. 
>> To go from a television network career to writing inspirational books, that is a big leap, man. How did that happen. 
>> Well, I went from conjunction junction, what is your function, to, pray, now that is interesting. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: That is a leap. 
>> All the time I was at kood morning america I was fascinated by those stories where the reporter would say, and ironically today and I'd perk up my ears and I thought it might be one of these things we cal i coincidence and I always felt there was more than just coincidence and when i researched it and talked about it and started write egg this first book, I needed to come up with a new word. And I really prayed about that a lot and talked to the lord about what word would be appropriate. And a little word called god wink came into my mind, little "g", godspeed, god send, god wink and I used it to replace the word coincidence and I found it absolutely worked and became a new word in the language. 

[00:33:29]


>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: What i love, it remind us that if we believe the bible, that god knows how many hairs are on our head, which for me is simpler than it needs to be and if god knows every sparrow that falls, then, that means he is intimately involved in our lives, and some things we look around and say, wow, it really isn't a wow moment, it is as you would call it a god wink moment. 
>> The thing I like best about having this as my job now is that god winks are now a concrete connection between you and you and you and me and somebody up there. A concrete connection. Because, when a god wink happens you know it is special to you and out of 6 billion people on the planet, a direct person-to-person message. Hey, kid, I'm thinking of you right now. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: One of the best god winks that happened to you was meeting your lovely wife, louise, who may be one of the most talented women in america and we're going to absolutely insist that she introduce us to the people that you have to live with all day long. Louise, great having you you here. 
>> Thanks, governor. I did bring one of my favorites, made us laugh 100 years, george burns. I'm happy to be here... I live to be 100, when I was a boy, the dead sea was only six. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: You have made a wonderful career of making people laugh. You know what? We need more laughter and more fun in the world. Some people take everything too seriously. Would you introduce our audience to some of your favorite people, and our favorite people. 
>> I would love to. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: Louise duart, everybody, please welcome her. 
[Applause] nice auto love doing impressions, but I even dream in them, I had a dream the other night I got to go to the academy awards.

>> Margin, teach your child managers. 
>> Bart that is not very nice! Don't you think you should share with everyone in the elevator. 
>> Look over there, hillary rodham clinton, look, how did we get ourselves stuck in this pickle, I ask you. 
>> It is a vast right wing conspiracy, joan. 
>> Somebody yell for help! Help! 
>> Me? Little old me? 
>> Use that trap of yours for something useful and yell for help like that. Thank you, girl. 
>> All right, old lady, I will! Heeelp... 
>> The greatest woman in the whole entire word, barbra streisand, hello, it is babs... 
>> This is dr. Ruth westheimer. What is your problem.

>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: Kwaurment paefpaef. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: We talked about god winks and god winked with you two. How did you meet. 
>> The first time I saw her, she had a green long nose and a water on it. 
>> I since had it removed! 
>> She was platchy-poo on hr puffin-stuff and I didn't know her name and I was running children's tv at abc at the time and the croft brothers and I did a show and I said, how about the girl who played witchy.Poo and, I followed her career 25 years and I was coming to pick up my brain injured son in new york to take him to canada and he was excite and at the last minute the meeting to canada was cancelled and I said, we'll go to a broadway show and we went to a show "dream stock" starring louise duart and we met back stage. 
>> And we saw each other and we both knew we'd get married and we went out for coffee afterwards and we have had coffee every day since. Real blessed. Here's the extraordinary god wink, the meeting cancelled in canada was divinely aligned with the closing of her show. That was the last performance. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: Not only was it she was available that night to meet you, b with the closing of the show was available to continue to meet you, after the show. 
>> Exactly right. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: I think people tend to believe that so many incidents in life or happenstance and chance encounters. In the book that you have done, divine alignment, you are saying god is lining this up in ways to prepare us for the people we meet, the things that we do, give me examples that you have seen where it takes place. 

[00:44:17]


>> All of us have divine alignment. We are all connected by invisible threads and we are on this incredible gps, god's positioning system. And we move through life, we bump into people, we say, wow, what a coincidence. Well, I would say that is a good wink and we move along and say, gee if I hadn't met the person i wouldn't have gotten the job or had this happen and this is divine alignment, how god moves us along towards our destiny and I believe if we get on our path heading for what we believe to be our destiny, it will unfold. I'll tell you a story. Colonel leo forceness who later received a congressional medal of honor, was shot down over hanoi. And he was thrown into a p.O.W. Camp, a terrible experience and they tried to break him and bent parts of his body that didn't bend and prayed every day that he would find a survival, and release. And now, 9,000 miles away, in texas, there was a young girl, a 16-year-old cheerleader, she bought a $2.50 wrist bracelet. It had a p.O.W. Name on it. Hers said colonel leo forceness. And she took him into her heart and wore that bracelet wherever she went, every game that she cheered at and prayed for him like he was a member of the family. When she saw six years later him getting off of a plane into america and he was released, she took off the bracelet and put it into a keepsake box. Now, fast forward. 40 years. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee:40 years. 40 years, she's invited to a houston astros game, doesn't really want to go but her husband prevails and gets there, 40,000-seat stadium. But imagine her delight when she sees the person, the celebrity who had been n to throw out the first pitch, it was the kourm. She said he's my p.O.W.! I have to meet him and step number five in my book of divine alignment. Step out in faith and believe that you will arrive. She stepped out in faith, a went looking for him, in 40,000 seats. She had all kind of obstacles but finally got to a spot where she passed a note over and pretty soon bounding out of the seat was colonel thorsness. He had you had my p.O.W. Bracelet and she said yes. I prayed for you every night and he said, it was terrible there. He said most nights I couldn't sleep but some nights I slept like a baby, now I know why. You were praying for me. And she said, you were my hero. He said, no, you were my hero. That is how divine alignment connected two individuals, 40 years apart, in a 40,000-seat stadium, divine alignment is incredible. It happens in every one of our lives. If we start realizing that there are steps that we can take, we will be able to reach our destinations. 

[00:47:32]


>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: What an incredible story, the book is divine alignment. And I think it was divine alignment that you and louise were here today. What a joy, and a privilege and, what an encouragement to everybody. My goodness, we all need encouragement these days and i hope you get yours. The book is called "define alignment." Squires rushnell. Coming up, former "american idol" contestant scott mcintyre, he performs one of his original songs. Stay with us. ?????????????????? fastest.

>> The nation has spoken. And the pson through and into our top 12 is scott. 
[Cheers and applause]. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: He was the first legally blind finalist on "american idol." Paula abdul called him an inspiration for his commitment and talent. And he has a solo career now and has a new cd, heartstrings and he's also the author of the book "by faith, not by sight." Please welcome scott macintyre. Glad to have you here. 
>> How are you. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: Doing great. What made you you decide you wanted to even try for "american idol"? 
>> You know, it was a crazy thing, and took me a while to actually decide to do that. But, more than entertain, week after week and more than do what I love which is music I wanted to show people that someone less than perfect in the world's eyes, like myself with a disability could reach for their dreams. And make it happen. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: You certainly did and did inspire so many people. But, there's a part of your story the people watching "american idol" never knew. In august of 2007, you had to have a kid my transplant. 
>> I did. You know, this is something i never talked about, on "american idol." I wanted to just compete and enjoy making music, but, in 
-- when I was 19 years old, i was graduating from college, i graduated a little bit early... 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: A little early? You graduated at 19. 
>> Just a little bit. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: Graduated at 19. 
>> I really felt like, you know, it was a testament to overcoming my disability that I was able to do that and I was excited about my future and graduation day, i got this news that my kidneys were failing. And, I did not know what that meant, I was 19 years old at the time. Scared me to death. And, I eventually got so sick i couldn't even play the piano or sing in my own living room. And, it was like my dreams were dying, when I couldn't do the very thing that I believed god put me here to do, it was devastating. And, I didn't know if I missed his calling for my life or what was going on and august of 2007, the wife of my former piano teacher from college donated her kidney to me and saved my life. 

[00:53:55]


>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: Oh, my goodness. Wow. 
[Applause]. 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: Your life is a testimony, scott of god's grace, and your determination, to follow his dream for you. Tell us what song you will do for us today. 
>> I'll do a song off the "heartstrings" album, called "i am hopeful". 
>> Gov. Mike Huckabee: "I am hopeful" ?????? ?????? when day is swallowed up in night ?????? ?????? when you can barely see the light ?????? gone ?????? ?????? when you are barely holding on ?????? ?????? reach for me ?????? 
-- and every time ?????? ?????? when you're in need ?????? ??????

Lewis: I cheated. I was doing men, women, chickens, couples, whatever. 
Judge Alex: Don't you think that that's something she should've known about? 30 seconds ago, of a sudden, there's this [ imitates car screech ].

Announcer: As a cop, he stood up for the law. As a trial lawyer, he fought for the truth. And as a criminal court judge, he commanded authority. Now he returns to preside over america's courtroom. 
--Captions by VITAC-- www.vitac.com Louise deraney is suing her ex-husband, william "billy" lewis, in the amount of $5,019 because she says she unknowingly entered into a fraudulent marriage and later found out he was having ongoing affairs with other women and men. Billy lewis claims he did not 
Mason: All rise! This court is now in session. The honorable judge alex ferrer presiding. 
Judge Alex: Okay, thank you. Please be seated. Okay, miss deraney, you're suing your ex-husband, mr. Lewis, for costs incurred for your marriage because you say that the marriage was a fraud. 
Deraney: Right. 
[ Laughter ] 
-Judge Alex: Yes? 
-Deraney: That's right. 
Judge Alex: Okay, and mr. Lewis, you do acknowledge that you acted out during your marriage, but you say that there wasn't a fraud, and on top of that, any expenses that you would've been obligated to pay her back for, those should've been handled at the hearing that terminated your marriage. 
-L: Correct. 
-Judge Alex: Okay. All right, miss deraney, what are we talking about here? 
Deraney: Well, your honor, I'd like to go back to the very beginning, if I may. 
Judge Alex: Okay. 

[00:02:00]


Deraney: Billy and I grew up three streets away from each other in our hometown in massachusetts. And billy was the first boy that I ever kissed. 
Judge Alex: Okay. 
Deraney: And back then, we had junior high dances, and of course, everybody knows what it's like at a junior high dance. The boys would stand on one side of the room, and the girls would stand on the other. And the boys really wouldn't make a move until it was ladies' choice. And billy always knew that I would ask him for the ladies' choice, and, in fact, everybody -- everybody knew that louise was gonna ask billy for the ladies' choice, and that's what he looked forward to, and in fact, that's what I looked forward to with every dance. 
Judge Alex: Okay. Is that true, mr. Lewis? 
-Lewis: Yes, sir. 
-Judge Alex: All right. Man of few words, mr. Lewis. 
[ Laughter ] all right, so, take me past those days. What happens? 
Deraney: Around the beginning of july 2010, one ofur classmates, who knew I was looking for billy, bumped into him. 
Lewis: Back up a little bit before that. I was involved with a lady three or four years earlier -- prior. In that spring, my mother passed away. She was 96 years old. I was with her. You know, she was very important to me. She passed away. Judge Alex: I'm sorry to hear that. 
Lewis: Thank you. And my current girlfriend at the time, she and I -- I needed some space to whatever. I thought I had to get out. 
Judge Alex: Deal with your grief or whatever. 
Lewis: Exactly. I needed a little break. "Will I ever end up back with her? Sometime, maybe." Right now I need a break. AND IT WAS JULY 4th. And since my mother died, her house had to be resolved. It was an old house. My brother was living there. 
Judge Alex: Okay. 
Lewis: I had to jump in and fix up the house a little bit, so I needed a plug. So I go to the local hardware store. The guy goes, "hey, billy lewis." I said, "yeah." "Hey, louise molander is looking for you." I said, "come on, stop kidding around with me." "No, she's looking for you, yada, yada, yada." So, I gave him my e-mail address, figuring he would give it to louise. 
Lewis: And that long weekend, I said the guy set me up, because now it's monday or tuesday -- nothing from louise. And then all of a sudden, louise contacted me, and we met. I said, "i want to see louise." I know it sounds silly, but "how about meeting for an ice cream?" She goes, "okay." And I said, "how about maybe dinner?" We had dinner. Had a great dinner. And we sat there, reminisced. 

[00:04:14]


Deraney: Well -- 
Judge Alex: Somehow, I'm assuming you end up married because I'm looking at a very beautiful wedding dress. 
-Deraney: Right. 
-Judge Alex: Okay. So, take me down that path. Deraney: We had dinners and picnics, and we went to movies, and we sat in the sun, we rode bikes, we went on trail rides, and we walked and talked. 
Judge Alex: It really feels like there should be birds chirping right now. 
[ Laughter ] 
Lewis: How about dancing around the pool? Deraney: It was like a fairy tale. 
Lewis: We were so passionate. We wanted to make up for all that lost time. Judge Alex: So, how quickly after you rekindled your relationship did you end up getting married? Deraney:13 months. 
Judge Alex: Okay. All right. So, you spent a year together, and after a year, then you went ahead, and he proposed, and you got married. Deraney: We did have some beautiful vows, too, and it will -- we have that, if you'd like to see that. 
Judge Alex: You sent in a video of the vows? 
-Deraney: Yes, we do. 
-Judge Alex: Okay. All right. Deraney: And we wrote our own vows. 
Judge Alex: Let's play those. 
Lewis: Louise, today my life begins with you. I promise to share with you my time and my attention, and to bring joy and strength to our relationship. ...Into my innermost feelings, secrets, and dreams. I promise to love you in good times...And bad. 
Deraney: We are so blessed to have found each other again. You make me feel loved, safe, wanted, and needed. I will be your best friend, and I will be there when you need me. 
Lewis: I needed her, your ho and she wasn't there. Judge Alex: I guess we're gonna get to that. Lewis: Remember that. I needed you. 
Judge Alex: You're about to shake all my faith in marriage right now, I think. 
[ Laughter ] okay, because this is very touching. The vows are -- I mean, he's obviously emotional during the vows. It seems very sincere. And yet you're suing him for fraud. 
Announcer: Coming up next... Is billy a hopeless romantic or just a strung-out addict? Lewis:95% of the time, I loved my wife. I still think I should have been still married. 

[00:06:15]


Judge Alex: You still think you should be married? 
Lewis: Sure. 
Judge Alex: How long have you been having sex with other women behind your girlfriend, wife, whatever's back, or other men or whatever? 
Announcer: And later, billy's new lady speaks out. 
Quinlan: She married him. I wanted to be his wife. If he had cancer, would she cut bait? She probably would, because he wasn't perfect. 
Judge Alex: No, I see that as totally different. 
Quinlan: She only wanted someone perfect. Announcer:r: back with the case of louise deraney, who's suing her ex-husband, billy lewis, for fraud in the amount of $5,019 after learning he was having illicit affairs with other women and men. Billy says he did not commit fraud when he married louise and claims he doesn't owe her any money because during their annulment, they signed a pre-trial agreement that states there are no financial issues to be discussed. 

[00:09:23]


Judge Alex: So, what happened? Deraney: I'm finding that he's distant, and I'm finding that he is on the computer excessively. And I would say, "what are you doing? What are you looking at?" And he said, "oh, the stock market" or "e-mails, jokes -- jokes. My friends send me jokes." And I just felt that was odd. 
Judge Alex: Well, that in combination with the fact that he was distant towards you and dismissive. 
Deraney: Right. And so, I'm trying to put it together, and it was my pc that we were on -- you know, the two of us shared my pc. And his stuff was up there, and I just hit the back button to see what he was doing, and I saw the porn -- excessive porn, every single website that I went into -- and then I saw a craigslist "men seeking men." 
[ Spectators gasp ] 
Judge Alex: Why? 
Lewis: First of all, your honor, whatever she's stating, she is absolutely correct. I did things I'm totally ashamed of, that if someone told me what I did, I'd say, "you're a scum bag." I cheated. I was doing men, women, chickens, couples, whatever. 
Judge Alex: They have a "men seeking chickens" on craigslist? 
Lewis: Yes. 
[ Laughter ] the point is I did the worst things you can think of. I'm not proud of it. 
Judge Alex: So, I guess that begs the question, because, you know, 30 seconds ago, the birds were chirping. I was going down this path with the vows. All of a sudden, there's this [ imitates car screech ]. 
Lewis: Judge, 5% of the time, I was doing bad things. 95% of the time, I loved my wife. I still think I should have been still married. 
Judge Alex: You still think you should be married? 
Lewis: Sure. Judge Alex: So you still love her? 
Lewis: I wouldn't be here. 
Judge Alex: You wouldn't be here in court getting sued if you didn't still love her? Lewis: She made it clear it's over. I have to accept that. But through all this stuff we're gonna talk about, I still loved her very much, and she wouldn't listen to me. 
Judge Alex: Don't you think that that's something she should've known about? That you were and were seeking them for sex and having sex with other women by her back? 

[00:11:34]


Lewis: No. No. That's because -- 
Judge Alex: "No," why? 
Lewis: First of all, I wasn't looking for men, women, whatever. I was trying to take care of some pain that I had in my background. When I was found out -- what happened with louise -- I went to a therapist. I enrolled right away into a 12-step program. I've been 12 -- six months now, no activities at all. Judge Alex: A 12-step program for what? 
Lewis: Sex addiction. 
Judge Alex: Sex addiction. 
-Lewis: Yep. 
-Judge Alex: Okay. So, how long have you had this sex addiction, that you're aware of? 
Lewis: I didn't really -- I wasn't really totally aware of it until louise brought it out. Judge Alex: Well, no, I understand. I don't think she wants credit for bringing it out, but what I'm saying is now that you look back... 
Lewis: Yes. It skyrocketed. 
Judge Alex: ...How long have you been having sex with other women behind your girlfriend, wife, whatever's back, or other men or whatever? 
Lewis: I would say, off and on, over, say, 30 years. 
Judge Alex: Over 30 years? 
Lewis: Right. Once in awhile. And then it escalated after we got married. 
Announcer: Coming up... What's old is new again. Judge Alex: How long were you with him? Quinlan: I was with him for six years. 
-Judge Alex: Six years. 
-Quinlan: Almost six years. Judge Alex: And are you two together now? 
-Quinlan: Yes. 
-Judge Alex: You are? 
Quinlan: We're engaged.

Announcer: "Judge alex" is back with the case of louise deraney, who's suing her childhood sweetheart and former husband, billy lewis, in the amount of $5,019 because she says she unknowingly entered into a fraudulent marriage after she learned he had affairs with other women and men. But billy claims he was simply acting out when he had the affairs and insists he still loves louise. He also says he doesn't owe her any money because he doesn't believe he committed fraud. 
Judge Alex: You see that he's looking up porn and he's reading ads for men. Deraney: Well, then that stopped. But I saw -- I realized that he was still on the computer excessively. 
Judge Alex: Right. 
Deraney: And what was he doing? I assumed that the only thing he was doing that I couldn't see was something in his e-mail. Maybe it's in the e-mail. And I then discovered an e-mail that he had written, which I have, if you'd like to see it, your honor -- Judge Alex: Whatever you have, pass up. I'll look at whatever you have. 
Deraney: It was an e-mail to his ex-girlfriend telling her that he missed her. And they have pet names for each other -- spider and fly -- and apparently -- 
Judge Alex: Well, that's not as romantic as your story. 
Deraney: No. And apparently he likes "weave a web," and she replied with a very sexually explicit e-mail explaining what she might do to him and so forth. 
Lewis: I admit it to this day. I'll always admit I was wrong. Judge Alex: You listed your ex as a witness. 
Lewis: Right. Judge Alex: All right, let's bring her out. 
[ Spectators murmur ] 
Judge Alex: Miss quinlan. 
-Quinlan: Hello. 
-Judge Alex: Hi. How are you? Quinlan: I'm very good. Thank you. 
Judge Alex: Okay. Um... You know why we're here. "-Quinlan: ABSOLUTELY. 
-Judge Alex: Okay. He was surfing the porn sites and surfing ads for other men, and now, when I look at these e-mails, it's more than that. 

[00:18:31]


-Quinlan: Right. 
-Judge Alex: Right? He wasn't just surfing the ads for other men. You were meeting other men for sex, correct? 
-Lewis: Right. 
-Judge Alex: Okay. So, it wasn't just surfing the ads because you were curious. You were having sex with other men, having sex with other women all the time. Just married three months with her. How long were you with him? Quinlan: I was with him for six years. 
-Judge Alex: Six years. 
-Quinlan: Almost six years. Judge Alex: And are you two together now? 
-Quinlan: Yes. 
-Judge Alex: You are? Quinlan: Yes. Yes. We're back together. 
Judge Alex: Are you boyfriend and girlfriend? 
Quinlan: We're engaged.

Announcer: Coming up... Did louise give up on billy too soon? 
Quinlan: I didn't cut bait. I didn't run, as miss deraney did. She walked away.

[ Female Announcer ] Pillsbury Pie Crust. Let the Making Begin Alex: alex. We'd like to invite you and your friends TO VISIT US AT judgealex.com, Or you can join the conversation on facebook. We'll see you there. Announcer: back with the case of louise deraney, who's suing her ex-husband, billy lewis, for fraud in the amount of $5,019 after learning he was having illicit affairs with other women and men. Billy says he did not commit fraud when he married louise and claims he doesn't owe her any money because during their annulment, they signed a pre-trial agreement that states there are no financial issues to be discussed. He's in court today with his new fianc??e, pamela quinlan. 
Judge Alex: You came here to discuss this, okay? I usually don't get into this kind of depth with people. 
Lewis: No, I came here to discuss the case. 
Judge Alex: Yes, but you knew what her allegations were in the case. The reason for the annulment and all of that, she raised it in the complaint. I read it, okay? 
-Quinlan: Yes. Judge Alex: So, he is saying, basically, during periods of stress in my life and maybe because of my childhood upbringing, I behave in this way that, as he says now, he's not proud of. Life is stressful. [ Chuckles ] I mean, don't you think that during your life there's gonna be other stressful points? He might lose his job, another family member could die, you could get very sick. I mean, didn't you consider that? 

[00:23:33]


Quinlan: I did, your honor, but the difference is I didn't cut bait. I didn't run, as miss deraney did. She married him. Iwanted to be his wife. 
Judge Alex: Before you shift the blame to miss deraney, it sounds like the argument you're making is "she married him for better or for worse, "and she didn't stick around for the 'for worse' part. As soon as it got" -- 
-Quinlan: That's correct. 
Judge Alex: Okay. Well, I got to differ with you there. Okay, that's a tall order. It isn't like he forgot to mention that he likes his oatmeal with extra milk, okay? 
[ Laughter ] that's probably not the best analogy for me to give, but this is a significant, significant failure to disclose. 
Quinlan: So is cancer. If he had cancer, would she cut bait? She probably would, because he wasn't perfect. 
Judge Alex: No, I see that as totally different. 
Quinlan: She only wanted someone perfect. She chose not to go to therapy to find out this. She walked away, and therefore, I will do that for him. 
Judge Alex: Okay. Let me -- let me -- Quinlan: I will be there for him. Judge Alex: Okay. And that is your choice. 
Quinlan: That is my choice. 
Judge Alex: And you can do that. I don't think you can shove your choice down her throat. 
-Quinlan: Right. 
-Judge Alex: Okay? 
[ Applause ] here's where we are. You submitted an order -- a pre-trial memorandum -- from the court that granted the annulment, wherein both of you say there are no financial issues in this case, okay? And I have the memorandum, and yes, there is a doctrine called judicial estoppel, which means you can't go in front of a court and represent to one court one thing, and turn around and go in front of another court and represent something completely different. You're absolutely right about that. Here's the problem. The problem is that courts typically conduct what's called a colloquy, and that is where they question the parties to make sure that they clearly understand the representations they're making. The reason that that's important is because it's very easy to confuse financial issues related to the marriage when you're talking about financial issues that pre-date that marriage. This is -- the whole reason that she's suing you is "before we got married, I shelled out all of this money in order that we could get married." There's no evidence here that a colloquy was conducted. I doubt it ever was, because it's a pre-trial memorandum. The judge probably signed the order, said, "you agree. You agree. You're annulled," and that was the end of that. With that, I cannot say that she has her right completely foreclosed to recover for this. I hope you get help for your situation. If you say it's an addiction, I have no reason to doubt you. My problem is I think that you had enough of a history that you should've disclosed it to her instead of putting her through that. So, judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $5,019, inclusive of court costs. And good luck, folks. 

[00:26:02]


Mason: All rise! 
Announcer: Judge alex has ruled in favor of the plaintiff and has ordered the defendant to pay her $5,019. 
Deraney: I feel that I will never get over this event, but I will get through it. 
Lewis: I feel bad for louise. I definitely do. I feel bad for the whole situation. 
Quinlan: I just can't believe that, you know, that she won. Nobody told her to buy all of that stuff. I just feel that she's just an angry, angry person, and I hope this will give us closure and to have her stop harassing us. STOP SENDING CDs. We don't like it. 
-Man: Right this way. 
-Deraney: Oh, come on. 
Quinlan: Grow up, louise. 
-Deraney: Oh, you grow up! 
-Quinlan: Grow up. 
Deraney: Your fianc?? is the one that sends me e-mails every day, asking me to take him back. 
-Quinlan: Yeah. 
-Deraney: Good luck with him. Quinlan: Well, send them to me, please. b?? I don't even feel comfortable having sex with my wife because the bear's there watching me.

Honor. 
>> Announcer: This son says he's ctim... 
>> She told me that I need to leave the house, and george pointed a .9 millimeter at my face. 
>> Announcer: ...With a gripping tale to tell. 
>> And I picked up a baseball bat, and I hit the tv. 
>> Judge Judy: You mean somebody's pointing a gun at you, and you started smashing things? 
>> Announcer: But is his truth stranger than fiction? 
>> She put me in jail for a month and filed terrorist threats against me, said i threatened to kill her. 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy." You are about to enter the courtroom of judge judith sheindlin. The people are real. The cases are real. The rulings are final. Captions paid for by cbs television distribution 21-year-old ryan fraidenburgh is suing his mother, carolyn perry, and her husband, george, for the return of his property and for falsely accusing him of making terrorist threats. 
>> Byrd: Order! All rise. Your honor, this is case number 52 on the calendar in the matter OF FRAIDENBURGH vs. PERRY. The parties have been sworn in. You may be seated. 
>> Judge Judy: Mr. Fraidenburgh, this is your mom and your stepfather. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: And who is this? 
>> This is my father. 
>> Judge Judy: How old are you, sir? 21 years old. 
>> Judge Judy: How long are your parents divorced? 
>> Since 2000. 
>> Judge Judy: And who did you live with? 
>> My father. 
>> Judge Judy: Until when? 2004. 
>> Judge Judy: What happened in 2004? 
>> I moved in with my mother. 
>> Judge Judy: What happened with your father, sir? 
>> I can't really remember that far back. 
>> Judge Judy: Maybe your father remembers. Stand up, sir. 
>> Yeah, well, it goes back to the -- I'm sorry. Ryan -- when there was a divorce in 2000, the sons were awarded to me, and ryan broke down emotionally, so he wouldn't attend school. So I sent him to live with his mother, and she had him sent to a private school in mexico, but basically he was kidnapped and sent to mexico and falsely imprisoned there. And the mexican government has since shut down that place where he was. So then when he came back, he lived with me again. 

[00:02:06]


>> Judge Judy: Who's he living with now? 
>> He's living with my father. He's doing very well. 
>> Judge Judy: He's not living with you. 
>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: Just stay right there. Let me lay out the lawsuit as i see it, and then I'm gonna have discussions with both of you. Mr. Fraidenburgh, it is your claim that your mother and your stepfather either kept or disposed of property that belonged to you in the house -- some couches and a tv. And in addition, they filed false charges against you. Your mom says that you gave them these couches when you moved in. They sold the tv after you destroyed things in the house in a fit of temper, and they're counterclaiming. So I have a few questions to ask of you. 
>> Okay. 
>> Judge Judy: Are you currently in therapy? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: Do you currently take any medication? 
>> No, no medications. 
>> Judge Judy: Have you in the past six months taken medication? 
>> No, I haven't. 
>> Judge Judy: In the past year, have you been in therapy? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: You think you need it? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: You think you're doing okay. 
>> Yes, I think I'm doing a lot better than I used to be. 
>> Judge Judy: You have a sadness about you? 
>> No, I just have, you know, a problem with people lying, you know, stealing from me. That upsets me. 
>> Judge Judy: Is that what you think your mom did? 
>> Yeah, she put me in jail for a month and filed terrorist threats against me, said i threatened to kill her. And while they did that, while i was in jail, they stole all my property, which totals $7,500. 
>> Judge Judy: So you left your father's house. I assume that there was a good reason for that. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Judge Judy: And I assume that there's a good reason that he's living with his grandfather and not back living with you. He's 21 years old. I've had a lot of children when they're 21 years old. It's very hard to get rid of them. They stick around like flypaper. 
[ Laughter ] all right, ryan, why don't you tell me what happened the day that you were arrested? 
>> I was in my mother's home, and my stepdad came home and started to argue with me, tried to provoke me into an argument with him. My mother was out baby shopping for my sister's baby, and george started drinking. He was drinking an apple smirnoff, and my mother came home, and she said, "what are you gonna do with your life," and just got in my face. 

[00:04:14]


>> Judge Judy: You mean you were just sitting there, and she said, "what are you gonna do with your life." 
>> Not true. 
>> Basically, we started an argument over that. And she basically told me that i need to leave the house. And george went back to the office and pointed a .9 millimeter at my face and told me to, "get the [bleep] out of my house." And then, basically, a fight happened, and I hit some things in self-defense. 
>> Judge Judy: What did you hit? 
>> I hit a wall. I put some holes in a wall, and I hit a tv. 
>> Judge Judy: And what did you hit the wall and tv with? 
>> He came at me with a gun, and I picked up a baseball bat, and I hit the tv. 
>> Judge Judy: Ryan, you mean somebody's pointing a .9-millimeter gun at you, and you picked up a baseballat and started smashing things? 
>> I was very scared, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: Then you leave. You don't start smashing things. Smashing things shows a temper, ryan. If somebody's pointing a gun at me, I leave the house if I'm behaving rationally. That would be a normal reaction. If you could get away, you'd run out of the house, not pick up a bat and start smashing things to provoke the person who has been drinking and pointing a .9-millimeter gun at you. It doesn't sound reasonable, ryan. 
>> Then he did leave, your honor. 
>> Judge Judy: Were you there? Don't speak if you weren't there. 
>> I then got in my car in the driveway, and I left the house. 
>> Judge Judy: After you smashed a tv and made holes in the wall. 
>> And I called the cops. I was the first one to call the cops, and I told them exactly what happened. AND WHY I WAS AT RayLee's, THEY Went over to the perry's residence, and they took their report. They told the cops that i threatened to kill them and that I threatened everybody's lives and carolyn perry's life. And then when they came to RayLee's PARKING LOT, THEY Arrested me for terrorist threats and vandalism. And I was the first one to call the cops. And they took their report before my report. 
>> Judge Judy: Let me ask you this question, ryan -- was there any evidence in the house whatsoever of any act of violence perpetrated by either your mother or your stepfather? 
>> Everything happened so violently, so fast, that i really did believe that he was gonna shoot me. 
>> Judge Judy: You didn't answer my question, ryan. My question was -- other than the damage that you caused with the baseball bat, was there any other damage caused in the house? 

[00:06:23]


>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: Now, first of all, you didn't give me the date of this incident. 
>> August 9, 2007. 
>> Judge Judy: And how long had you been living with your mother? 
>> One week. 
>> Judge Judy: Prior to that, where were you living? 
>> I had roommates in citrus heights, california. 
>> Judge Judy: And what happened to that apartment? 
>> I was actually in a house with these people, and I just didn't like the way that they treated me. And they were taking money out of my safe in my bedroom. And so I just called my mom and told her I couldn't -- I needed a place to stay. "I don't have anyone right now to live with." And so she agreed that I could move my things in and live with her temporarily until I find a job and can get working again. 
>> Judge Judy: How long had you been living with these roommates in a house? 
>> About four months. 
>> Judge Judy: Were you working at the time? 
>> No, I wasn't. 
>> Judge Judy: Who was supporting you? 
>> I actually was supporting myself. On february 23, 2007, I received an award of $101,000. 
>> Judge Judy: From what? 
>> Confidential settlement. I'm not allowed to talk about it. 
>> It's a legal settlement. 
>> It's a legal settlement. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you have control over that money? 
>> Yes, I did. 
>> Judge Judy: Do you have any of it left? 
>> Yes, I do. 
>> Judge Judy: How much? 
>> About $13,000. 
>> Judge Judy: What did you do with the rest of the money? 
>> I gave my brother a loan, and he's actually paying me back in payments. 
>> That's the $13,000 -- 
>> Judge Judy: Shh! 
>> For his college tuition at u.O.P. 
>> Judge Judy: How much did you loan to your brother? 13,000 even. 
>> Judge Judy: What did you do with the rest of the money? 
>> I bought a mercedes, and i bought some very nice furniture, AND I PUT SOME MONEY IN CDs, About $5,000, and I took a trip to hawaii by myself. And she put it on her credit card prior to me receiving my settlement, and so I paid her $5,500 as soon as I was paid. 
>> Judge Judy: You still have the mercedes? 
>> NO, I SOLD IT TO CarMax. 
>> Judge Judy: And you got money for it. 
>> Yes, I did.24,000. 
>> Judge Judy: What did you do with that money? 
>> That's when I moved in with my roommates. And they stole about $6,000 from me, and I had to pay rent. 
>> Judge Judy: Did your father tell you that when you got this settlement when you were 21 that he thought it might be a wise idea for him to help you invest that money or put it in a bank or something so that maybe you would have something for the future? 

[00:08:31]


>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: And what did you say to your father when he told you that? 
>> I moved out of carolyn's house, and I was by myself. I didn't really have anyone around me to help me. 
>> Judge Judy: Are you telling me that your father never made that suggestion to you? 
>> He did have a friend of his who works for an investment company, and I did not listen to him. Instead, I bought a mercedes and bought all of the things that i didn't need. 
>> Judge Judy: That's a more truthful answer. 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy" continues in a moment. 
>> Judge Judy: Don't show me what your attorney says. I am telling you that at the end of my trials, the justthing happens. 
>> Announcer: And later today... 
>> Judge Judy: What would you prefer to be? Dumb or a liar?

>> Neither.

>> They're at our house. 
>> Judge Judy: He's going to pick them up. Do you understand? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay, ryan? 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Judge Judy: You're gonna pick up your couches. Now, whose television set did you smash? 
>> I bought it for them as a gift. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay, so it was their television set. Now, what television do you want back? 
>> Well, they sold my 50-inch toshiba plasma television, which was in the back bedroom when they kicked me out. 
>> Judge Judy: What television did you smash of theirs? 
>> I believe it was lg 42-inch plasma. 
>> Judge Judy: Good. You just made a fair exchange for the one they sold. You can't smash their property and then expect your property what else, ryan? 
>> There was a $2,000 mattress i purchased at becks furniture. 
>> Judge Judy: Where is that? 
>> It was at their house. 
>> Judge Judy: Do you have it? 
>> No, we don't. He brought a mattress with him. I don't think it would be $2,000. There was no -- 
>> Judge Judy: Just a second. Where is the mattress? 
>> The mattress had cigarette holes, and it was stained and smelled very bad, so we put it outside our garage. It was gone within two days. 
>> Judge Judy: So you don't have that? 
>> No. 
>> I have a receipt, your honor, for the mattress that I left at their house. It was in brand-new condition. You can see when I bought it. 
>> Judge Judy: Ryan, what else? 
>> The mattress and two safe boxes. 
>> Judge Judy: What do you mean? 
>> I had a safe box that she stole from me. 
>> Judge Judy: Shh! I don't want to hear "stole." 
>> Okay. 
>> Judge Judy: You got a lot of people stealing from you, ryan. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Judge Judy: Describe the safe boxes to me. 
>> It's about four-feet wide. 
>> Judge Judy: Is it metal? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: Do you know where that is? 
>> Yes, there are two security boxes at our house. ONE'S ABOUT 2'x1' 
>> Judge Judy: Wonderful. When he picks up the couches, he's gonna pick up his safe boxes. What else, ryan? 
>> There was also a sprint check the night that we got into the argument. And when the fight broke out that day, I bought a cellphone. And she got mad that I bought a cellphone for myself. And she actually took my sprint check -- it's a check that i refunded a cellphone. And the check was for $350. I'd like that back. 

[00:14:07]


>> Judge Judy: Do you have that check? 
>> I don't know anything about that. 
>> Your honor, she's lying. 
>> Judge Judy: Ryan! Couches and two safe boxes. What else? 
>> Well, I should get money for the tv they sold. That's property conversion, and I also have a note from my attorney that the restitution in the case was set at zero dollars for the damages to their house. 
>> Judge Judy: Listen to me, sir. Don't show me what your attorney says or what any other court says. When you came here, you signed a document that says you would be bound by whatever judgment i make. And I am telling you that at the end of my trials, the justthing happens. Now, what else? 
>> That's it. 
>> Judge Judy: Great! Judgment for the plaintiff for the two sofas and the two safes, which will be picked up by someone that his father will arrange for. And as far as your counterclaim is concerned for damage that he caused to your house, I'm dismissing it, do you understand? You understand why, miss perry? 
>> I wanted to show him grace -- 
>> Judge Judy: Do you understand why? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: The case is over. Goodbye. That's all. 
>> Byrd: Parties are excused. You may step out. 
>> I'm very satisfied. I think she was right, you know? And I'm ready to move on with my life. 
>> Announcer: And now the next case. 
>> Byrd: All parties in the MATTER OF VASSER vs. ROBINSON Step forward, please. 
>> Announcer:19-year-old brietta vasser is suing her former friend, kevin robinson, for taking her car without permission and damaging it. 
>> Judge Judy: Miss vasser, you claim that mr. Robinson, who's a friend of yours, took your car without permission, had an accident, and you want him to pay for the damage. 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: And I've read mr. Robinson's answer, and mr. Robinson seems to feel as if it's really no big deal. 
>> Correct. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay. Good. How long have you known him? 
>> A few years, since high school. 
>> Judge Judy: Are you friends? 
>> Used to be. 
>> Judge Judy: Tell me about this incident with the car. 
>> On august 13, 2007, kevin was staying at my apartment. I would let him stay out there because he worked not too far from where I lived, so I would bring him to work. About 6:00 in the morning, he had come into my room and asked me if he could get my garage-door opener so he could get a pack of cigarettes out of my car. I was a little hesitant but said, "okay." Then he took the garage-door opener, and I fell back asleep. 

[00:16:31]


>> Judge Judy: So far, is that correct? 
>> The part with the garage-door opener -- she actually was half asleep, and she said that she wanted cigarettes herself and wanted me to go get her cigarettes. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay, go ahead. 
>> I keep my cigarettes in my room, so I don't know what he's talking about. Anyway, when I got up to bring him to work, it was me, matt, and him and another friend of mine. And we all went outside, and we opened my garage door and noticed that my side mirror was dangling off with scotch tape on it. And we all turned to him and asked him if he took my car, and he denied it. When I got in my driver's seat, the seat was way back and the mirror moved. There was no way I could have seen out of it. And we kept asking him, and he kept denying it. After we dropped him off at work, we pulled over on the side of the road and walked around the car to see, and we saw very bad damages that he had done. 
>> Judge Judy: Just what you saw, not what anybody else saw. 
>> Me? No, everybody. We all saw it. 
>> Judge Judy: I don't care about everybody. Just you. Everybody's not here. Just you. 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy" continues in a moment.

>> Marlboro reds. 
>> Judge Judy: "Marborettes"?

=======================================================

Did the wrong thing. Isn't that right, sir? 
>> For eight years, I've known him. 
>> Judge Judy: I don't care. That's your problem. That's your trouble. And your stupidity, I might add. 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy." You are about to enter the courtroom of judge judith sheindlin. The people are real. The cases are real. The rulings are final. Captions paid for by cbs television distribution 24-year-old casey burns is suing her ex-boyfriend, juan ortiz, for the balance on a suzuki motorcycle. Juan says casey knew he was financially unstable when she helped him buy it. 
>> Byrd: Order! All rise! Your honor, this is case number 105 on the calendar in the matter of burn 
>> Judge Judy: Thank you. 
>> Byrd: You're welcome, judge. Parties have been sworn in. You may be seated. Ladies, have a seat. 
>> Judge Judy: Miss burns, you must have been absent on the day when we discussed not co-signing for a loan for a boyfriend. 
>> Yes, I was not smart to do this. 
>> Judge Judy: Right. And the loan that you co-signed for was for something even dumber. It wasn't for, you know, some medical thing that he needed. It wasn't for a medical emergency or even a car to take him to and from work. You co-signed for him for a motorcycle. 
>> For something luxury. 
>> Judge Judy: And mr. Ortiz does not deny that you co-signed this loan for him, correct? 
>> It wasn't a co-sign. She basically signed for the motorcycle. 
>> Judge Judy: Because you had lousy credit. 
>> I didn't have any credit. I didn't attempt to purchase the bike myself. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, explain that to me, mr. Ortiz, because i see in your answer, sir, you say that this was a loan, but your defense is that you told her that you couldn't always make the payments on the loan because you had other expenses. And she said, if you couldn't make the payments on the loan, she would make payments on the loan. That's what you said in your answer, sir. Now, do you want to rephrase that? 

[00:02:04]


>> Yes, I do. I wanted to have a motorcycle. 
>> Judge Judy: You wanted a motorcycle. 
>> I wanted a motorcycle. I didn't havthe means to purchase a motorcycle, nor the credit to do so. Miss burns offered to -- 
>> Judge Judy: No, no, miss burns didn't offer, 'cause she didn't know what was inside your head, sir, unless you told her. 
>> I told her I wanted a motorcycle. 
>> Judge Judy: You said, "honey, I want motorcycle." 
>> No, not "honey." 
>> Judge Judy: What did you say? 
>> I wasn't with her at the time. This was in '07. We stopped going out like in '05, '06. 
>> Judge Judy: Yes, go ahead. So, you said to her... 
>> I said to her that I wanted a bike. She knew that I wanted a bike. 
>> Judge Judy: Don't tell me what she knew! It's in her head. Just tell me what you said. 
>> I said I wanted a bike. I couldn't get the bike, obviously, because I didn't have the money to put down on the bike, nor the credit to do so. 
>> Judge Judy: What did she say to you? 
>> Let's go get the bike. 
>> Judge Judy: And what did you say to her? 
>> Okay. 
>> Judge Judy: And what did you say to her about payinfor it? 
>> I said -- 
>> Judge Judy: Don't look over there or over here. Look right here and tell me, what did you say to her about paying for it? 
>> I told her, okay, that i wanted the motorcycle. We went to the place to get the bike, all right? As far as the payments go for the motorcycle, all right, at the time, was actually employed. I told her that I had the means to pay the monthly fee for the bike. At the same aspect, okay -- 
>> Judge Judy: Don't tell me, "at the same aspect." That's not english. I don't know what it is, but it's not english. So, you told her you were working. 
>> I told her I was working. 
>> Judge Judy: Shh, I'm speaking. You said, "i'm working, and i can make the payments on it." 
>> I just had started working. 
>> Judge Judy: You just told me that, "i said to her, 'i'm working, and I can make the payments on it." 
>> Right. 
>> Judge Judy: Keep going. 
>> Okay. So, after that occurred, all right, I received the motorcycle. I had the motorcycle for about a month, two months, and I got in a motorcycle accident. The bike went to the mechanic's shop, where it stood there, and he was charging storage per day. I contacted miss burns. I let her know what occurred with the bike. I told her that I didn't have the means to take the bike out of storage, nor fix the bike. 
>> Judge Judy: What about the insurance? 
>> What about the insurance? 
>> Judge Judy: Well, if you have a bike -- 
>> it wasn't covered. 
>> Judge Judy: I'm speaking. If you have a new bike, you're required to have, by the loan company, insurance. 

[00:04:05]


>> Yes, and it was insured under her. 
>> Judge Judy: What do you mean, it was insured under her? What does that mean? 
>> That means that the motorcycle insurance was under her name. 
>> Judge Judy: Did you pay for it? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: Why would she pay for your motorcycle insurance? 
>> Oh, for the insurance for the motorcycle? Yes, I'm sorry. 
>> Judge Judy: What language do you think I'm speaking? 
>> I thought you meant for the motorcycle. 
>> Judge Judy: I'm talking about for the motorcycle. When you buy something like that sort of luxury item, the lending company requires that you have insurance. 
>> Yes. I did pay for the motorcycle insurance. 
>> Judge Judy: Then why wasn't it covered? 
>> Because it wasn't full-coverage insurance for the motorcycle. It's not required to have full coverage. 
>> Judge Judy: What kind of coverage did it have? 
>> Basic liability. 
>> Judge Judy: No, you're required to have full coverage if you have a loan on it. 
>> It wasn't fully covered. It was only liability insurance. 
>> Judge Judy: Go ahead, miss burns. 
>> Okay, I was with him between -- for eight years, I've known him. 
>> Judge Judy: I don't care. Do I care about that? That's your problem. That's your trouble. And your stupidity, I might add. 
>> That's correct. 
>> Judge Judy: All I want to know is what happened to the motorcycle. 
>> We took it out, we went together to purchase it -- 
>> Judge Judy: I heard that already. What happened to it after he crashed it? 
>> After he crashed it, he called me, told me that he crashed it, and that he was gonna still make the payments. I agreed -- that was fine. I didn't know anything about where it was for quite some time until I further investigated it myself. He called me and said -- 
>> Judge Judy: What about the insurance? 
>> The insurance was under my name at first so we could drive it out of the parking lot. After, I'd say, three weeks, i cancelled the insurance. 
>> Judge Judy: Why? 
>> Because I wasn't driving it, so he had to get his own insurance. 
>> Judge Judy: Oh, no, that's stupid. That's stupid. That's ridiculous. How old are you? 24. 
>> Judge Judy: You have children? 
>> Two. 
>> Judge Judy: Eh, so, you're a responsible girl. You had no basis to cancel the insurance. That's your problem. He's a bum, but it's your problem. 
>> Well, I mean, he basically said that he was gonna pay it. 
>> Judge Judy: I don't believe that this bum, who's standing here now and telling me, "listen, she knew I didn't have the money," should have had insurance. He never said that to you. "I don't have the bike, but I'm gonna make the payments anyway." I don't believe he said that. 
>> He did to me. He said it. He called me, made many phone calls to me, and said that he was gonna pay it. He knew I had two children, which I do have two children, and I get very -- 

[00:06:06]


>> Judge Judy: You shouldn't have cancelled the insurance. 
>> Well, he said he was gonna put it u his name, and I did trust him. 
>> Judge Judy: Let me see the title to the bike. 
>> That I don't even have with me, 'cause I don't have the bike anymore. They repossessed it. 
>> Judge Judy: Show me. 
>> I have -- this is where it went into collections the first time, where they contacted me. 
>> Judge Judy: I'll see it. Sure. 
>> And this is the second -- this is where it's going to a lawyer now. 
>> Judge Judy: This doesn't tell me anything. Tells me that you owe somebody $5,900. 
>> Do you want to see the loan, as well? 
>> Judge Judy: I want to see where somebody took it, repossessed it, sold it. 
>> That I don't have on me. 
>> Judge Judy: Yeah, and in whose name was it? 
>> Under my name. But I wasn't familiar, 'cause i never took out a bike loan. 
>> Judge Judy: That's your problem. 
>> How was he driving it without insurance then? 
>> Judge Judy: What do you mean? There's not something on the bike that stops you from putting the key in the ignition and driving it. 
>> What about the plates? 
>> Judge Judy: What about the plates? Plates don't indicate whether it's insured or not. 
>> And registered and everything? 
>> Judge Judy: What do you mean? It was registered. You registered it. You drove it out. U should have had insurance. Why did you cancel the insurance? 
>> Thinking that he was gonna put it under his name. 
>> Judge Judy: Why would you think about that? Why would you think he's gonna put it in his name? 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy" continues in a moment. 
>> Judge Judy: It's gonna cost her a lot of money. They'll probably take it out of her salary. Don't you feel good about that? 
>> Announcer: And later today... 
>> Judge Judy: Who do you live with? 
>> My grandmother. 
>> Judge Judy: You must make her very proud. 
>> I made some mistakes, but I'm trying to, you know, get my life on the right track. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, I want to give you that opportunity right here, mr. Ealy, to get your life back on the right track.

>> Announcer: Real cases. Real people. "Judge judy." Casey burns says her ex-boyfriend, juan ortiz, stuck her with the balance on a suzuki motorcycle that was purchased with her credit. 
>> Judge Judy: Now, listen. You can't get rewarded by your stupidity. If he said, "i put insurance on the ke," and he didn't, that's one thing. But you really defrauded the loan company, my dear, because you signed a document that said, "this bike is in my name, I'm taking out the loan, and I will maintain full coverage on this bike for as long as the loan is outstanding." You did sign that document. 

[00:10:50]


>> Right, of course I did. 
>> Judge Judy: And then you cancelled the insurance. 
>> The only thing I have from there is this -- the insurance copy. This is the only thing I have. 
>> Judge Judy: You just learned a good lesson. It's gonna cost you a lot of money. It's gonna cost you a lot of money. 
>> I have an e-mail. 
>> Judge Judy: It's gonna cost her a lot of money because you did the wrong thing. Isn't that right, sir? 
>> Judge? 
>> Judge Judy: Hmm? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: It's gonna cost her $5,900. They'll probably take it out of her salary. T you feel good about that? Don't you feel good about that? 'Cause she's not getting a penny from this court, because she defrauded the loan company by canceling the insurance. Do you understand that? Your case is dismissed. That's all. 
>> Can I show you the e-mail, judge, that have? 
>> Judge Judy: E-mail from what? 
>> From him sending it to me. 
>> Judge Judy: Saying what? 
>> Saying that he's gonna give the money he's going to give me. 
>> Judge Judy: Then show it to him. He should give it to you. What are you coming after me for? What are you coming to court for? I'm coming to show you that i was being a good person. 
>> Judge Judy: You signed a document on a bike tt was in your name with a loan that was in your name, and you promised, by contract, that you were going to keep the bike insured while the loan was outstanding. As soon as you drove the bike out -- he drove the bike out -- you cancelled the insurance. 
>> I did not till three weeks later. 
>> Judge Judy: That's as soon as you drove the bike out. You cancelled the insurance. 
>> He crashed it about a week after I cancelled the insurance. It was crashed. 
>> Judge Judy: Don't you understand why you're supposed to keep the insurance on the bike for that reason? 
>> Right, maybe I was naive not to -- 
>> Judge Judy: Well, no, you weren't naive. Your case is dismissed. That's all. 
>> Byrd: Parties are excused. 
>> Judge Judy: I think you ought to pay her, by the way, sir! Are you listening to me very carefully? You listening to me care-- I'm speaking to you. 
>> Yes, I'm listening to you. I heard you. 
>> Judge Judy: I think you ought to pay her, sir. You got it? 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Judge Judy: Good! 
>> It is what it is. 
>> It is what it is, you know? 
>> I have two kids to take care of, but I can do that. I've been doing it all myself. I can do it. I'm not worried about it. 
>> After I actually had the motorcycle accident, I let casey know. 
>> Didn't really care about seeing it. 
>> Not get myself in these situations again. 
>> Never do anything for anybody else, besides family.

[ Light laughter ]

>> Judge Judy: Well, I want to give you that opportunity right here, mr. Ealy, to get your life back on the right track. 
[ Laughter ] now, what were you arrested for when this lovely lady tried to bail you out of jail? 
>> Actually, I had a -- I had a -- 
>> Judge Judy: Look, listen to me. 
>> A d.O.C. -- 
>> Judge Judy: Mr. Ealy, listen to me. I want you to come to your core for a second. I want you to take a deep breath. I want you to understand that i know everything. 

[00:14:59]


>> Right. 
>> Judge Judy: I know everything about you, mr. Ealy -- everything. So, I'm gonna ask you questions, but I expect, because we have to have a record of what goes on here -- are you wearing a belt? 
>> Yeah, but I got a small waist, so it's just slipping down. 
>> Judge Judy: You should have gotten a tighter belt. 
>> I got a small waist. 
>> Judge Judy: They make small belts, mr. Ealy. You think you're gonna get the last word in on me? It's not gonna happen. 
>> No, okay. 
>> Judge Judy: Now, what were you arrested for when you got bailed out by the plaintiff? 
>> D.O.C. Violation. 
>> Judge Judy: Department of corrections? 
>> Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: How did you break the rules, sir? 
>> I missed a drug and alcohol class, and so -- 
>> Judge Judy: You missed a drug and alcohol class because your last arrest was for... 
>> Um...Assault? 
>> Judge Judy: And part of your sentence was you had to go to classes? 
>> No, I had -- I got a dirty u.A., And so they put me in these classes to where, you know, I can't use and all that. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay, so, you had a dirty drug test. 
>> Yeah, so they put me in these classes, and I missed a class -- 
>> Judge Judy: And then the judge -- 
>> all right. 
>> Judge Judy: And then the judge gave you another chance. 
>> Yeah. Yes. 
>> Judge Judy: That's their first mistake. Second chances are always their first mistake. See, with me, there were never any second chances. I put you on probation, gave you the rules, you broke the rules, you went to jail. Otherwise, if you don't do that, you think that the system doesn't mean what it says. You think that the system -- don't look at me like that. You know how many times I've seen that look? 
>> I'm sorry. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> Judge Judy: That's a look of, "maybe I can get over her, and maybe I can't." 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy" continues in a moment.

>> Announcer: Real cases. Real people. "Judge judy." Maria abdullahi says ex-boyfriend michael ealy owes for a loan to bail him out of jail. 
>> Judge Judy: Okay, so, now you're in jail, and she comes to visit you. Tell me about the conversation, mr. Ealy. 
>> She came to visit me, came to see me. She said, you know, "i miss you. When you gonna get out?" You know what I mean? Really, that's what happed. We was actually dating. I'm not her friend. You know what I'm saying? I never knew her. I was downtown. She seen me. She stepped up to me. My friend was talking to her friend, chocolate, right over there. 
>> Judge Judy: Don't say anything. I mean, your taste stinks -- in friends or boyfriend. Go ahead. 
>> So, my friend was hollering at chocolate over there, talking about -- 
>> Judge Judy: Listen, I'm not interested in all of this baloney. 
>> I'm telling you. 
>> Judge Judy: Do you wear glasses? 
>> No. 
>> Judge Judy: Why are you squinting? I'm asking you a question! Why are you squinting? I didn't think I was squinting. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, you are. 
>> Okay. 
>> Judge Judy: Better. Now... 
[ Laughter ] what was the conversation that you had that inspired her to bail you out? Don't look down at me like that. 
>> She offered to bail me out. 
>> Judge Judy: And what did you say? 
>> I said, "you know, I can sit." You know what I mean? And she was like, "no, I want you out right now. I miss you." Her friend had just left for college, and so, you know, she was like, "i miss you. I don't have nobody to kick it with, so I'm gonna get you out." I said, "all right, you can do that." 
>> Judge Judy: And? 
>> And she got me out. 
>> Judge Judy: And? 
>> When I got out, you know, i heard she was dating some of my homeboys or whatever while I was in jail, and so that didn't really sit too well with me, 'cause I really liked her. You know what I mean? And so, you know, I kind of started talking back to my baby's moms. And so, she found out about that, and then she got mad, and so she figured she wanted to, you know, sue me for this money that she put out to get me out of jail. 
>> Judge Judy: Why did you put out money for him to get out of jail? 
>> I just want to start off by saying all that he said -- it's a lie. 
>> Judge Judy: I asked you a question. I determine if what he said was a lie, and so far, you're not a genius. Go! 
>> I put money forth because he asked me to bail him out. And I was skeptical to bail him out at first, but he gave me a list of reasons. He begged for me to bail him out and swore that he would pay me back. That's why I bailed him out. I did not do it as a favor. 

[00:20:30]


>> Judge Judy: How many times did you go visit him in jail? 
>> Two times. 
>> Judge Judy: And did you know that he has at least one child? 
>> Yes, I did. 
>> Judge Judy: And he's 20 years old? 
>> Yes, I did. 
>> Judge Judy: And I assume you know that he has no gainful employment. 
>> Yeah, I did know that. 
>> Judge Judy: And that he makes his living just hanging around with his homeboys. 
>> That I did not know. 
>> Judge Judy: Well, what do you think he does? 
>> I didn't know, but he always had money. 
[ Light laughter ] 
>> Judge Judy: Genius. How much did it cost you to bail him out? 550. 
>> Judge Judy: And you bailed him out on what date? 
>> January 27, 2008. 
>> Judge Judy: When, for the first time, did you ask him for the money back? 
>> I ASKED HIM ON FEBRUARY 10th. 
>> Judge Judy: Tell me about that. 
>> He told me he'd pay me back two weeks after I bailed him out. February 10th was the 2-week mark. I called him. That day was the day he was giving me excuses about how, you know, "i need an extension, because, you know, this and that," and I was like, "look, i don't need excuses. I need you to pay me back." So, he was like, "all right." I called him back the next day, the day after, and for weeks, he wasn't answering my calls. So, I waited a couple of days, i called him from a different number, and he picked up. He obviously wot trying to answer my calls. And he was giving me excuses about how, "you know what? I don't feel like paying you back, and if you want to have an attitude, I'm not gonna pay you back." 
>> Judge Judy: Any of that sound familiar to you? 
>> The part about her calling me, talking about she's trying to get some money after we broke up, yeah. 
>> Judge Judy: I didn't hear anything about breaking up. 
>> Well, 'cause she's not telling you the truth. She's a liar. You know what I mean? She lies. You know what I'm talking about? 
>> Announcer: "Judge judy" continues in a moment. hands age.

=======================================================

>>> Tonight, justice investigates some of the moats mysterious criminal cases. Tonight, your helpes needed solving the mystery of this georgia teacher, missing since 2005. And law enforcement also needs you help in the disappearance of two young girls, missing since july of this year. Hello and welcome to justice. There are new revelations regarding one of america's most infamous killers, charles manson. Take a look. 
>> That's your judgment now. The judgment you're making on this mirror you got carry. 
>> More than 40 years the murders shocked a transfixed the nation, both for the brutality can and the randomness of the killing. There were ten victims in all, including actress sharon tate, then eight and a half months pregnant. Charles manson and seven of his his followers were convicted of first degree murder in 1971. They still remain locked up in a california prison. Around the time of those crimes, one of manson's followers, charles "tex" watson may have admitted to even more killings in audio recordings with his attorney. Now the los angeles police department's cold case unit believes the manson family might also be responsible for at least a does more unsolved murders FROM THE LATE 1960s. But a federal judge is blocking access to those tapes because they are currently tied up in a bankruptcy court. Now, 77-year-old manson, who has been denied parole 12 times, will not provide police with any information that may help solve these murders and bring peace to the surviving family members. 
>> With me now is the ap the day they occurred more than 40 years ago. Linda deutsche is joining us from los angeles, and charles "tex" watson's attorney, joins us from dallas. Linda, this case must have affected your whole life. You were there from day one. How do you feel about the fact that there may be other murders out there that might have been committed by manson that los angeles police are trying to find out about? 

[00:02:34]


>> Well, I'll tell yo to crop up, I'd say, well, okay, maybe. I don't see any evidence at this int that there were additional murders. Tex watson at the time he spoke to his attorney, was possibly insane. By the time he came back to california, after a long extradition fight, he was declared insane. The lawyer at that time, i remember the judge all said he was a human vegetable at that point. 
>> Let me ask you this. This guy, tex wat manson murders? Clearly a co-follower but what do we know he did? 
>> It was a very major role. He was manson's lieutenant. He directed the girls in killing, and he killed. The most famous thing that he said was he walked into sharon tate's house, looked at the people there and said, I am the devil and I'm here to do the devil's work. 
>> Wow. Doesn't sound too insane to me. The acts themselves are clearly evil, but if he is the lieutenant and has the ability to organize, orchestrate and say what highs going to say -- but then that me with the insanity defense. Let me bring kelly in here now. You're now representing texas watson in this whole issue regarding the los angeles police department's effort to get the tapes, the audiotapes of texas watson, who linda kells us, was a lieutenant, and his conversation with his lawyer at the time, I believe bill boyd. Why should the los angeles police not get these tapes? 

[00:04:40]


>> Well, judge, this goes back to 16th century where attorney-client communications is privileged. Those tapes are made between attorney and client, privileged. As you well know, judge, back 34 years ago we didn't have laptop computers, iphones, a lot of other things, so lawyers at that time would -- instead of write on their note pad, they would tape conversations between clients. Now, to go back now and to get those tapes, it's just like going and hearing the communication between the lawyer and the client. 
>> Look, look, kelly, no one disagrees with you. There is an attorney-client privilege. But I understand your client, tex wasson, indicated he does not have a problem with the lapd listening to the tape. He just has a problem with the lapd possessing them. Is that correct? 
>> Well, judge, back in 1976, he signed a limited waiver that allowed his biographer at that time to write a book. As you're probably well versed with the decision in new york where professor wrote a book on a man who was accused of a crime, found guilty. Professor appealed the decision. 
>> What is your client's position today? 
>> His position today -- it's very clear, and I've made that clear through the court filings, that he wants those tapes to remain confidential. 
>> He does. I understand that there was a bankruptcy appeal where the judge had indicated that the lapd could look at it. Let me ask you one more question, kelly. It appears that the lapd spokesperson says that there is an urgency required to the resolution of this issue. Why do you think that is? 

[00:06:46]


>> Well, judge, it's judge shell, our eastern district court judge, said in his order, here we are 40 years later. So, he can't see the urgency of seeing these tapes now. It's been 40 years. And obviously mr. Watson has mott committed any crimes since he has been in prison, and any -- 
>> but here's the issue. Linda, I'm going back to you. What do you think about this? The lapd spokesperson saying there's an urgency to getting these tapes that apparently tex watson didn't have a problem with releasing severalears ago. Do you think they're on to something here, the lapd? 
>> They think they are. They think, from what I have heard, they have found bodies in the area where manson and the family lived. Over the years, they've found bodies. It was a very remote area. There's no question that people could have been buried there. Whether they were related to the manson family is a big question. I think there's always a tantalizing kind of temptation to tie things to the manson family. It's headlines. It's a great story. If they did even more than we think they did. 
>> All right. Well, linda and kelly, thanks so much. We'll see where this ends. AND COmING UP, WHAT COULD Possibly be on the tape that the lapd wants to hear? Our great expert panel weighs in next. And then later, two cousins are missing. Their parents big their kidnapper to sed -- set them free. Can you help bring these girls home? Stay with us. ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ??????

>> We're back with our terrific expert panel. Missed you guys a lot. With me is former lapd fox detective mark fuhrman, and arthur isola, former prosecutor and now defense attorney, joey jackson, went the other side. 
>> The dark side. 
>> And forensic pathologist and fox news contributor. I'm fascinated with this grace. Mark, you're lapd. Why, after 43 years, does the lapd have an urgent need to hear these tapes. 

[00:11:47]


>> There could be an urgent need because you might have witnesses they know about they're not going to bring forward. 
>> Why not put it in the application of the jung who can 
-- judge would can say attorney-client privilege. 
>> There could be certain other things with the cases that have a time attached to it. People that are in prison that aren't supposed to be in prison. I. 
>> He's a smart guy. Arthur, why? 
>> Doesn't make sense on its face. What you said is right on point. If there's exigent circumstances, someone is in prison, shouldn't be, witness is about to die, you put it in black and white and shay this is why we're tribe to leap frog the system because we could use valuable leads. 
>> Joe jackson, watson at one point -- he is just an animal. The one that sharon tate begged for her life and begged to save the baby. But he waived the attorney-client privilege. If you have a conversation with your lawyer, nobody can hear it, period, end of story. But he waived it many years ago. 
>> He did. 
>> There is any way to get around it? 
>> I think there's two reasons you could get around it. Number one, he waived it. Whether it was a limited waiver or not, it was waived. Why? It was in a book. Number two I think a judge can rule if if has any indicia of criminality -- another way to waive the privilege is something you communicate is arguably of a criminal nature about a past crime, a current crime, or prior crime, you may in fact have a waiver there. 
>> Joey, ever defendant tells this lawyer about the crime. Not about -- 
>> not about the crime at issue. 
>> Another crime? 
>> Exactly. Hold on. 
>> In. 
>> But, even if you get through the waiver, the question becomes, how reliable is the information conveyed to the attorney? 
>> Once they get over the hurdle, they'll get the body. 
>> He was already known -- he was declared by the court to be legally insane. I know you disagree with that. 

[00:13:55]


>> That's hogwash. How do you determine they're insane. Give them a blood testifies -- test? 
>> What difference does it make. The information is information. 
>> It's not reliable. 
>> Hold it. 
>> The unreliability of evidence doesn't mean you have to use the statement but it can point you in the direction of who the suspects are. 
>> If you're okay with a police officer kicking down -- 
>> we're not going there. Doctor bob. Guys, stop it. If the police have found some bodies, at least 12 unsolved crimes, is there a way for them to corroborate through forensic if the evidence tex watson said? 
>> Yes, if tex watson says, we shot them, those bullets will still be in the body 40 years later and could corroborate -- 
>> tex, the crazy guy. 
>> -- Or not. Just because he gives information, doesn't mean you have to accept it. What happens if watson dies, to those types? 
>> What happens if watson dies? 
>> Obviously what happens is the estate -- 
>> this is in bankruptcy. 
>> It is. But the issue is the estate would have it and the same argument attaches. 
>> Does it die at death? 
>> It does. 
>> There's the catholic church has had privileges where in pedophilia, it is died. In the martha moxley case they tried to claim a privilege because the investigators were working under the lawyer and investigating what michael skakel. He had no part in giving the information but they had an independent party edit and put together all the information -- 
>> mark, we know it's been done. What about the fact that he waived it and he is on record as saying, lapd can look at it, but not possess it. I'm the judge. That's enough for me. If we can solve a crime, let's do it. 

[00:16:07]


>> Ultimately I'm in accord. The problem is not the waiver. You get by that. A judge said, you can look at it. Then one other subject said, hold the phone, not yet. The question becomes, when that information is released and they look at it, how relevant, how reliable, how credible? 
>> He can connect it forensic include. That cross-corroborates the liability. Mark, do you think it's interesting that they're only looking at 12 unsolved crimes that occurred around that time in that area? 
>> I think it's very interesting. I don't think they're just looking at that. I think they're stating that because that's the obvious. There's unsolved homicide, could be in the geographic area of the operation of the manson family in the time in the m. O., possibly the m.O., But there's also solved cases where you have people doing life, perhaps on death row, in some other location, that have been convicted of these crimes or a crime that the manson family could have committed in their insanity, but the physical evidence and the statemen, whether you're crazy or not, you can put somebody at the scene, you start -- 
>> why now? 
>> Might be -- 
>> one of your clients of death row -- 
>> these are 12 unsolved crimes. I don't believe -- 
>> that's not the only consideration. Always go town solved crimes first. 
>> I think the point is well made, and that is if you can say to judge, look, not only are we looking at 12 unsolved cases, it may help people who have been wrongfully convicted. That from an lapd detective. 
>> If you want to violate the attorney-client privilege, you want specifics, not hunches, not guesses. 
>> All right. 
>> Attorney client privilege was violated by tex. 
>> Was able to with a it in the past, von bulow. 

[00:18:08]


>> Who? 
>> As far as I'm concern and you're concerned they should be able to go after the tapes, right? 
>> Yes, for many reasons, including the fact, as mark points out, maybe there are innocent people who -- 
>> wrongfully accused. 
>> Sometimes they have to do their work. 
>> Yeah. All right, guys -- 
>> just one thing. Remember, when this happened, the lapd looked into these cases and knew about manson, so they did a whole examination -- 
>> now we have the technology, the dna and all the stuff we didn't have back then. Coming up, imagine two young girls, go for a bicycle ride. They're now missing for more than four months.

>> Thank you for having us. 
>> How are you two doing? 
>> We're doing okay. We're just doing whatever we can do right now, and to keep the word out, and get through every day. 
>> Let me just kind of repeat what happened. In july, the girls go for a bicycle ride and go to a place they often went to, and they didn't come home. This investigation has been ongoing for four months. I believe that law enforcement has indicated they believe the girls are alive. What do they base this on? 
>> I guess the fbi spokesperson base it on there was no evidence that they weren't. So, that's all they would tell us. So, as far as we know that's the only reason they said that. 
>> And, you guys decided, after four months, anniversary of their going to missing, to write a letter to the person, whoever, who took the girls. Your daughter and your niece, lyric. Why did you make that decision to write a letter? 
>> Um, we just kind of decided to do that and to put an ad in the paper, because a lot of times you see people that have taken kids, have done time, they always keep the clippings, and they keep updated on their case. So, I just thought if I could put it in the front page of the paper, you know, hoping and praying that the person would see our letter, and do the right thing and bring the girls home. Return them anywhere. 
>> You know, we have covered this case extensively at the beginning, and I must ask you this question. Your niece, who was the daughter of daniel and misty, she is with family where the dad has been sister, elizabeth, your star misty, just recently was supposed to have her release revoked by the feds and then they made a decision not to your brother-in-law's drug trial was delayed yet again last week. What is going on? Do you think drugs had anything to do with your girls disappearing? 

[00:25:42]


>> We honestly don't know. We leave that up to the fbi. We honestly have no idea. 
>> It's just one possibility. Of many. And in our minds we've -- we think of everything. That's just one of the things that goes through your head, could that be, or it could just be a random person. We don't know. We know they've -- the fbi and dci have looked into many different things. We don't know how much they looked into that, though. They don't tell us those things. 
>> Have they told you of any leads recently? I mean, is anything new happened? 
>> They haven't told us any new leads at all. There have been very few leads in this case. And that's what makes it frustrating, is the small amount of leads that have come from this case. It's almost as a vanished into thin air. 
>> It certainly is -- 
>> it's a very tough case. 
>> It's a very frightening case, and heather and drew, on behalf of all of us, we certainly wish that, as we start to go into the holidays you get some good news. Thank you for being with us this evening. 
>> Thanks for having us. 
>> If you have any information relate though disappearance of lyric and elizabeth, call the police at 1-800-thelost. 
>>> Coming up, young teacher disappears, never to be seep again. How many women disappear like this without a trace? Later, a murder suspect tries to make a quick get away, in an airplane? plan. You have a plan? First we're gonna check our bags for free, thanks to our explorer card. Then, the united club. My motr was so wrong about you. Next, we get priory boarding on our flight I booked with miles. All because of the card. And me. Okay, what's the plan? Plan? Mm-hmm. We're on vacation. There is no plan. Really?

>> Live from america's news headquarters. President obama doing his part in virginia to promote small business saturday. The president, along with his daughters, stopping by an arlington, virginia, book store to do some christmas shopping. Small business saturday is generally the day after black friday. Instead of going to larger sales the holiday promotes mom and pop shops. Pope benedict xvi elevating six to the level of cardinal. The pope choosing cardinals from various countries. During the ceremony he said he wanted to highlight that the catholic church is the church of all people. 
>> Now let's get you back to "justice with judge jeanine." For all the headlines when you WANT THEM GO TO FOXNEWS.com. 
>> It's been seven years since school teacher tara grimsted went missing from a small town in ocilla. Her body has never been found and no suspect has ever been charged. Joining me now is tar tara's stepmom. Now, connie, I'm going to start with you. It's been right now seven years since your stepdaughter went missing. Is there anything new that you can kind of rest your hat on to say, gee, maybe this thing will be solved? 
>> Not really. Because we don't know any more than we did in the beginning. The only thing that we feel in our hearts, 100% about, is that it there was foul play involved. Other than that, we really don't know what happened to tara, or even who is responsible. 

[00:32:29]


>> Now, I understand that even though you're her stepmother, you raised her from the time she was three years -- old, connie. 
>> I married her dad when she was three years old. She actually lived with her mother when she was younger. 
>> You've been in her life since she was very young. 
>> Yes. 
>> But do you have any feeling, any inclining who might have done this? Did she ever share a concern that some guy was going to do her in? 
>> No. I don't have any idea who is responsible. I have heard all of the persons of interest, all of the names and possibilities, but i honestly don't know what happened to her. 
>> Okay, so I'm now going to gary rothwell, who I understand is recently retired from the georgia bureau of investigation. You have had a stellar career, gary, you work this case from the beginning, and you say that it's one of the cases that continues to haunt you. Why? 
>> It's a convoluted case that is maddingly frustrating. Everytime we would open a door, there would be several harps and nor doors. Almost feels like a disservice we have not resolved this case for the family and tara. 
>> The truth is, gary, there were several guys who might have been involved. I counted five as I went through the file. A boyfriend, a police officer who was looking for her the day before she meant missing, student arrested at her house. She was a teacher. A landlord's son, the man who stalked her in the past. So you had quite a wealth of possible suspects. 
>> Absolutely. The evidence indicates that the person responsible for tara's disappearance is very likely someone that knew her. So we had to look at people that were close to her, and there were a lot of them. But we have not been able to link any of those people to her disappearance. 
>> We don't know what happened to her. As I understand, the door was closed to her house, and she took her purse and her cell phone. Is that correct? 

[00:34:30]


>> Yes. There's no sign of forced entry. Her purse and its contents are gone. The cell phone remained at the house. It was not common for her to do that but not impossible. 
>> Did she go to some kind of barbecue or some event that night? 
>> Yes. The last time we can account for hers 11:00 on a saturday night before she was reported missing. She was at a cookout, watching football games on television at the residence of a former employee who lived nearby. 
>> You say there were some lie detector tests and alibis checked out. 
>> Yes, yes. We checked out alibis of all the people that we looked at closely. We administered several polygraph examinations. One case that makes it solvable, we have dna evidence and we have compared all these -- 
>> from what? 
>> Dna evidence from a latex glove recovered in the front yard of the residence. 
>> So you have these lay desk gloves, dna. Has it matched? 
>> It does not match any of the 200 people whose dna have obtained. 
>> You've gotten 200 dna samples? 
>> That's correct. 
>> You have really worked this case. 
>> We tried hard. We obviously haven't succeeded. There's a lot more work to be up done. 
>> Do you know who did it? 
>> I have no idea. We think it's someone who knew her -- 
>> it's in the becomes there. 
>> The name is in the box but we don't know which one it is. 
>> Connie no instinks -- by the way, your step daughter was absolutely stunning. I understand she won a beauty contest, she was very popular, and she was well-liked. There had to be people who were jealous? Other than these guys, were any of them married? Gary, back to you. 
>> One of her associatesas married. The remainder were single. 

[00:36:35]


>> All right. Well, you know, gary, I have no doubt that, as I read from the talking points, you're going to continue on this case. Connie, we issue for the ohio only good news as it relates to your stepdaughter. 
>> Thank you so much, thank you for including tara's case. 
>> Our pleasure. Thank you. All right. Coming up, we'll have our expert panel on the missing teacher. Tara grinstead case, and later, a murder suspect crashes a getaway vehicle, and guess what.

[00:40:25]


>>> mark, are thousand joey, back with me to talkout the tara grinstead case. You heard gary roth well. Knows what he doing. He says all the guys we haveline looking at have an alibi and passed the polygraph. How do you have an alibi if his missing from 11:00 p.M. And they don't look for her until school on sunday. 
>> Now electronic alibis. You're texting somebody, you're in contact with somebody and they can actually locate that device many times, whether at it at the home or another location. That's one way. The other thing is, sounds like these guys had other lives other than her. 
>> Yes. What does that tell you, detective? 
>> Well, there's a lot of subtext. 
>> And don't forget the polygraph. Doesn't mean they pass it. Inconclusive is where you can't move forward. 
>> Arthur? 
>> Seem like they have done such a good job, worked so hard. Uncovered everything. They looked for the needle in the haystack. I was coming on here, ready to be cavalier. It seems like they've done and it haven't gotten anywhere. 
>> What they do have are latex gloves on the frontyard with dna on the gloves. The guy is not in jail. 
>> Not yet. 
>> You know what's interesting about that? They looked at that dna glove and the latex. It doesn't match any of the men that apparently were in her life who all have alibis, and they not only ran it through the state dna database and the national database and it matches no one, which is more frustrating. 
>> Therefore one of the possibilities is she is still alive. Maybe she has amnesia. In 50 years I've been involved three times -- very rare but happens -- where somebody has gone missing and turns out had a head injury or something and really has am meese ya. 

[00:42:28]


>> Very good point, doctor, but as you know because of the drew peter send case, there are often situations where someone who is extremely onliable in law enforcement investigations might throw something off which would throw the whole case off, i.E. A latex glove. 
>> Dr. Bodden's making a claim that amnesia, but her car is there. She takes her purse, doesn't take her phone. There's some indications sometimes she didn't take her phone because she was with somebody else, didn't want the phone to ring. So, that being said, the body needs to turn up. Or somebody needs to have their dna taken where it pops up. But don't forget that sometimes in homicide investigations you're doing an autopsy of a personality and a lifestyle that nobody knew existed. And one other thing. And it's probably been done. I'm sure it has. Sometimes neighbors will watch the conduct or watched a single woman, and somebody that you would never think in a million years would be a suspect in a crime like this, and was never a suect, and many times that's exactly what occurs. 
>> Without a trace at all? This is confounding. Why? Because even if it were a maybe, you could establish linkage. But nothing at all? 
>> If the neighbor looks so innocent is what he is saying -- 
>> a married male with three kids at home -- 
>> why don't the guys -- 
>> you have to believe they have gone through the house with a fine-adopt comb. 
>> The neighbor's house? No. 
>> Not the neighbor's house, her house. 
>> She knew who came in. No forced entry. She allowed them in went with them or was taken but she knew them. 
>> The implication, if you have 200 of their closest friends, doesn't match the dna, that maybe the supposition that it's something she knew isn't correct and it is a stranger. 

[00:44:32]


>> Do we all remember how dna started in england? They had a dead girl what was raped and murdered and they decided the only way to do this is dna the entire village. 
>> An entire village. Okay. 
>> Is that a what you're saying? 
>> What I'm saying is the example is they did a very good job. But what they did is they had a voluntary compliance -- 
>> I remember that. 
>> What are the chances of this being solved without the body? 
>> I think it makes it much harder to solve without the body. But still, I don't understand how you can have -- first of all, be able to get dna from skin cells from a latex glove is something that is relatively new, and at it sort of the -- 
>> I'm sure they re-tested that. 
>> Yes. I think the fact it doesn't match anybody known to them, maybe at some point, if they get a match, and then -- 
>> that's why you have to believe it's shin might have known, right and there's no forced entry. No sign of a struggle to speak of. No trails of blood or anything else. 
>> Let's go back to what I said about doing an autopsy of somebody's personal life you don't no who people are unless you're living with them all the time. So when you do that up a circumstance doesn't mean you went deep enough or went in the right direction. 
>> To your point about electronics and what we do there she has a computer. Text-messaging with respect to a cell phone. We have twitter -- 
>> here's the thing, guys. The police have looked at everybody. This could very well be someone who was at the cookout and saw her come home. 
>> What about the latex glove? 
>> It's a throwaway, it's not outside. Not in her house. 
>> Or the suggestion, the only person who would wear latex glove to a homicide would be a police officer. 
>> And his dna would have been matched. 

[00:46:33]


>> That's right. 
>> The latex glove fell out of somebody's pocket. Two latex gloves people put on. One was there. 
>> If it's someone she knows not going to wake -- 
>> when your done disposing of the body and walk away from the scene -- 
>> you're not disposing of the body there. 
>> We're running out of time. Thank you so much, and I think we're coming back inmont. Coming up, he didn't use a getaway car. He used a getaway plane. The amazing video is next. holidays Verizon.

[00:50:31]


>> a strange series of events up ralph -- ununravel in utah. You can see a plane plowing through the parking lot at an airport. And it only gets stranger once investigators discover who is in the cockpit. Here's the story. 
Reporter: Air force security cameras captured almost everything that happened when bren stole a sky west jet and crashed it into the airport. But police tell fox 13 their investigation resulted in no conclusion as to motive. He was wanted in connection with the murder of his ex-girlfriend in colorado. Employs say in the early morning HOURS OF JULY 17th, HEDGEN Climbed over a fence and ran to the jet. A sky west pilot, he knew how to get in the play so police say he climbed in and started it up. But as you can see here, the plane clipped a sky bridge. The jet then scraped the side of the airport terminal. Police say they have no evidence he was trying steal the plane. 
>> I'm looked at the crash scene, and I doesn't appear he goes any other direction. Didn't make any movement to go toward the runway, he throttled up and went towards the parking lot. 
>> The plane barreled into the parking lot before stopping. Police spend quickly to the incident. Officer says the plane was still running with cars piled-under it in. Officers say the man was found dead inside the aircraft with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
>> That detective, that cop said he wasn't trying to steal the plane or get away. Maybe am wrong but he was wanted for the murder of his ex-girlfriend. 
>> His girlfriend was found stabbed to death at her residence. 

[00:52:35]


>> Right. 
>> And he, after they got in the plane, found out he actually had a stab wound to his body, and he ultimately committed suicide. So you wonder if the stab wound might have been debilitating enough where the loss of blood actually he did try to fly away -- 
>> does anybody think he is going for a spin in the parks lot? 
>> It wasn't a stab wound. It was a bruise, and it wasn't so debilitating if he shot hielf in the head, because he killed him. What is interesting know, talk about cop shoesness -- consciousness of guilt. We know who did what here. 
>> Consciousness of guilt. 
>> You have a knife, says he stabbed -- 
>> defense attorney, despondent of the death of his -- 
>> forget it said that. 
>> I think you're correct. When someone jumps in an airplane who is wanted for murder, think -- as the guy who knows how to fly a plane, common sense would dictate he is taking off. The reporter said he didn't head toward the runway can he headed toward the parking lot. 
>> Exceptionally interesting, how on earth was he able to get the airport -- I know he got there, motorcycle and everything else. Climbs over the fence. Gets on the tarmac, starts the plane, movers the plane. , Where the security? 
>> Kids climb over a fence, know how to start a cessna and they're off and running. 
>> Probably a regional airport. We don't know when he shot himself. We're talking bat span of two minutes where he could have shot himself when he got in the plane and the pne was now going by itself. Could have shot himself once he came to rest. 
>> Maybe he was going down in a blaze of glory. 
>> Christopherly started the plain. 

[00:54:37]


>> I want to go back to crime scene. You have to two dead people but you need to see what's going on. Who stabbed who spirit? Did she stab him first and then he took the notify and stabbed her out of rage? Knives of the defensive women of women in a dispute. 
>> You think so? 
>> She is wrong or she is a suspect. But you also want to know, was there anybody there? Was anybody else involved in. 
>> I don't disagree. I would have to say in the event it was an innocent -- for example, he just raged and as a result killed her, turn yourself into a lawyer, explain the scenario, it's manslaughter i think it was a murder-suicide. 
>> Both military people so they're trained in killing. 
>> Correct. Very good. 
>> They have a mindset, psychologicall prepared to kill and see death, and obviously in your investigation, and I agree there should be an investigation. Just because he popped a bullet in his head doesn't end the investigation. You need to see what happened. Maybe there was a third party involved. Who knows. 
>> You need to know exactly what actually ignited this dispute that led to murder. I mean, you're probably most likely either a situation or a third party. 
>> So let's assume he did it or didn't do it. My car, let's say, is one of the cars in the parking lot. Who am I suing? 
>> Everyone. 
>> That's what they do. 
>> I'd hurry up and get your money from delta airlines. 
>> That's true. But the regional airport, the community, the municipality, the faa for let -- never got out. 
>> Glad you're not sitting in that car at the time he was able to violate that security, that airport should be on lockdown. No way, municipal or not, anybody should be able to get into the airport, start a plane and take off on the plane. As a result of 9/11. 
>> Once he got on the tarmac, he hood i.D., And plus he probably knows all the people at the airport. 

[00:56:37]


>> No, no. He was a runaway because he was wanted. That may not have -- 
>> I don't think the people on ground crew would know -- 
>> the great movie, flight, with den -- denzel washington and the planees upside-down. I won't tell you what happened. 
>> Involves a lot of alcohol. I saw it, too.

=======================================================

Deejay: Ho, boy, another day of triple-digit temperatures. Now it's official, this heat wave has lasted longer than my second marriage. So wherever you are, Rhonda, this song goes out to you. Oh, too hot. Can't make it to my house. (shouts, sighs) Mm-hmm. Dang. Well, I'll be. I guess that makes it official. It's summer, all right. Is it me or did it just get a few degrees cooler since Boomhauer walked out. Aw, man, dang ol' breezy, man. Man, that's a straight cut. Will you do me a half shirt? Nice Daisy Dukes. (both laughing) Bobby, have you seen my... (Hank gasps) Joseph, isn't it time you think about, uh, heading home? I can't take it at my house. My dad has the heat cranked all the way up. He said something about fighting fire with fire, but it wasn't working for me. Quiet! Look. 
?????? Get wild, get wet, get cool, go bananas, ooh       Where the water's gone wild off the San Pedro exit       Take the second left on Ancinita Boulevard.     ??????
Now featuring the Big Ka-tube-ah. The hottest, coolest wave in Texas! 
?????? Go bananas!   ??????
We have to go! 

[00:02:00]


Dad, will you take us? Please? Yeah, you gotta take us, dude. I'm starting to leave a butt-puddle. Ugh. Fine, just put on your pants. (tire pops, screeches) Oh, that's not good at all. HANK (on phone): Hank Hill here. Hank, it's Bill. I got a flat on the bypass. It's hot! It's so hot! You gotta come get me. (sighs): Fine. Dang it, now I gotta go pick up Mr. Dauterive. You kids remember the exit to the water park? 
?????? Take the second left off Santa Anita Avenue.    No, dude, it's...    Slight left on Ancinita Boulevard.    No, it's...    Get wet, get wild, get cool, go bananas       Off the San Pedro exit...     ??????
It's right there. (sighs): Thank God. Where's Hank? I, I can't take it! Help! I need help! (honking) They're waving at me. (honking) They're really waving at me. I'm waving at you! And you and you! (honking) Hello! (honking) Do you guys hear that? That's water! Look how high that slide goes. Connie: That's "The Avalanche," and it's horrifying. Some kid went on it, and all that came out the bottom was a bathing suit. They never found him. I heard in the middle of the slide, there's a moment where you're traveling so fast, 

[00:04:03]


you actually become water. (shuddering) Three tickets, please. Would you like to get summer passes? No. Please, Dad. won't do it for me, do it for your lawn. A slip and slide can be very destructive. Okay, but this is your entire summer entertainment budget. Don't come to me in a couple of days and say you're bored of the water park like you did with the French horn lessons, the karate lessons, and spy camp. I won't. I'll be too refreshed to bother you. Hey, man, dang ol' air hockey, man? Who wants to dang ol' take on the champ, man? Let me see what you got. (multiple cars honking) Hi there! Have a nice day! Well, your tire's fixed. (honking) You can get out of here now. In a minute. Ooh! I got a school bus coming. Hey there, children! Uh, Bill, it's over a hundred degrees out, and you don't have... uh, how do I say this? You don't have many... health assets. You should get inside. (honking) Deejay #1: It is a hot one today, I'll tell you. Too hot for pants. Deejay #2: Yikes, I gotta work with this guy, people, and he's serious about taking off his pants. I am, but I'll tell you, one resident of Arlen is offering this community a little relief from the heat in the form of a kind, cool wave from the side of the highway. Deejay #2: People toss around the word "hero," but this guy's a real hero. I don't know his name, so I guess we can only call him the Heat-Waver. Deejay #1: Thank you, Heat-Waver. (tires screeching) They talked about me on the radio! I matter! Take that, Dad! (honking) 

[00:06:09]


(honking continues) (gasps): That's the kid from the commercial. And he's going bananas! Visor dude, you're in. Hot girl, you're definitely in. What about us? Why don't you kiddies hit up the tad pool? Get out of here. Boy: Locals only, mothers! Get off our wave! (boys laughing) Maybe we should go. No way. I didn't spend my entire summer budget to slide down a little frog tongue. Can I help you? Oh, thank goodness, an adult. We want to ride, but they won't let us. I see. Then I guess it sucks to be you. What? I have a summer pass and I demand to cool down and get wet! Hey, Harkey. These kids want to get wet. You know what that means. Yeah, full on, Bodie. (screaming) Welcome to The Avalanche. You must ride feet first with your arms crossed over your chest. Don't do this! Ride this wave, Grommet. (screams) (screaming fades) I think he just turned into water. New pink lemonade 5-hour ENERGY? 5-hour ENERGY supports the avon Foundation for Women Breast Cancer Crusade.

They wouldn't let us ride because we weren't "lolocals." Locals only? That's the most insane thing I've ever heard of. Nobody lives in an amusement park. That is so weird because I always have really good experiences with surfers. Didn't they help put your sunscreen on, Bobby? No. I got it. I have found that bullies are actually very insecure. Tell him he has a nice smile, and he will become your best friend. I'm not going back. They specifically told me not to. By the way, I'm gonna need some money for the mall. No, you don't. We're going back to that water park and I'll deal with those locals. Not all surfers are bad, Bobby. I read in a magazine about a girl surfer who was attacked by a shark, and against all odds, she still managed to be pretty. (honking) Happy Hump Day! Hang in there, it's almost Friday! Buckle up now! (honking continues) Stay cool, Arlen! Welcome to Big Water! Can I point you to the gift shop? No. My son wants to ride on your endless wave, but some giblet heads won't let him. They're giblet heads! And the last time I checked, this was America. U.S.A.! That is terrible. I will take care of this immediately. Big Water may be owned by Germans, but we have very American policies when it comes to customer service. Well, all right. Excuse me, Bodie. Can I speak to you for a second? Of course, Tim. What's up? Tell him what's up, Tim. This kid's daddy just came and talked to me about you guys. I just call him "Dad." Dang it, Bodie, I don't ask any questions about what goes on on Coconut Island. Now, I'm leaving this boy in your hands, and I don't want to have to come back here. In fact, I'm not coming back here because I trust 

[00:12:05]


that you'll take good care of the situation. Yes, sir, Tim. No, no, no, wait! Wait, Tim! Don't leave now! (shouting): Tim! Yep. Yup. (groans): Oh, man. (car approaching) What are you kids doing back already? The locals messed with us again. I go to get the kids and those punks throw me down Avalanche, too. And they disrespected my half-shirt. Well, what happened to the manager? That manager made things worse. I got thrown down the Avalanche, naked! Joseph, why didn't you help him? Because I ran away. Nicely done. I'm never going back to that park again so long as there are surfers. Maybe you could talk to those guys, Boomhauer. Boomhauer used to be the best surfer in Corpus Christi. Now, I don't know about that, man. What do you mean? You were amazing. King of the beach. A golden god on a wooden board. Not too bad. You know, that ol'... Do you really think you could talk some sense into these guys, Boomhauer? Dale: Wow! Look how stable he is. Is this even surfing? I think he's kayaking. (horns honking, Bill whimpers) Bill, what are you doing out here? You look terrible! We got to get you inside now. (blabbering) I won't go! I have a responsibility to the people of Arlen. (honking) Stop looking at me like that, Peggy. Stop it! 

[00:14:15]


Yeah, I've surfed all the big waves. Six Flags, Busch Gardens. Even tore up Tivoli World. That's in Malaga, Spain. Yeah, bro. I told you he was the man. (cheering) Hey, brahs, check out this hodad. What are you lookin' for, brah? I'm talkin' about them little kids, man. You got to let them little kids ride, man. I'm talking one surfer to another, man. Well, if you're really a surfer like you say you are, then you'll do your talking on the wave. That's the only language I comprende. Comprende? Check it out, Harkey. You order a picnic table? (laughs) Harkey: This old dude's confused. Your shorts should be long, and your board should be short. You got it backwards, broham. (laughter) (cackling) Do you have a shorter board, Mr. Boomhauer? Hey, man, it's like I said, dangl' surfin's surfin', man. You show 'em how we do it in Arlen, Mr. Boomhauer! Fog! Crumb-eater! (laughter) Harkey: Loser! Ugh. Do they have air conditioning at the library? Use it or lose it, old friend. You losed it. Hershey's makes smiles. Smiles make more smiles.

Great idea. Bill? It's Hank. Uh, just wanted to stop by and see how you're doing. Bill: Oh, I'm feeling much better. B-a-ah! I'm getting back on the road, Hank. Absolutely not. But I'm The Heat-Waver. The heat... (strained groan) You're not leaving this home. Oh. Oh,the burns! My skin hurts! (sighs) Okay, okay.

The Department of Water and Power requested everyone conserve energy until 6:00 p.m. But your father had to show off and counter with 7:00. Hey, Bobby, how was the surf today? Did Boomhauer do his famous Flamingo? That's when he stands on one leg. That's not easy to do even on the ground. No. All he did was fall flat on his face and embarrass himself. Boomhauer was embarrassed?

to her place near the river You can hear the boats go by You can spend the night beside her And you know, she's half crazy That's why you want to be there She feeds you tea and oranges That come all the way from China And just when you mean to tell her You have no love to give her She gets you on her wavelength And she lets the river answer You've always been her lover And you want to travel with her You want to travel blind And know she will find you For you've touched her perfect body with your mind Yes and Jesus was a sailor When He walked upon the water And He spent a long time watching From a lonely wooden tower And when He knew for certain Only drowning men could see Him He said, all men will be sailors then Until the sea shall free them But He, Himself was broken Long before the sky would open an He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone You want to travel blind And you know he you can trust him For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

It's coming through a hole in the air, from those anmen Square. It's coming from the feel that this ain't exactly real, or it's real, but it ain't exactly there. From the war against disorder, from the sirens night and day, From the fires of the homeless, from the ashes of the gay: Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. It's coming through a crack in the wall; on a visionary flood of alcohol; from the staggering account of the Sermon on the Mount which I don't pretend to understand at all. It's coming from the silence on the dock of the bay, from the brave, the bold, the battered heart of Chevrolet: Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. It's coming from the sorrow in the street, the the holy places where the races meet; from the homicidal bitchin' that goes down in every kitchen to determine who will serve and who will eat. From the wells of disappointment where the women kneel to pray for the grace of God in the desert here and the desert far away:

It's here the family's broken and it's here the lonely say that the heart has got to open in a fundamental way: Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. It's coming from the women and the men. O darlin', we'll be making love again. We'll be going down so deep the river's going to weep, and the mountain's going to shout Amen! 

[00:37:20]


It's coming like the tidal flood beneath the lunar sway, imperial, mysterious, in amorous array: Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. Sail on, sail on O mighty Ship of State! To the Shores of Need Past the Reefs of Greed Through the Squallsf Hate Sail on, sail on, sail on. I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean I love the country but I can't stand the scene.

(applause) >> I grew up on a kibbutz in the north of israel nearby the ?? jordan river and the jordanian border. The kibbutz is a very special place dedicated to mutual aid and social justice. The are no rich or poor people in a kibbutz and everyone has the same status. The values of the kibbutz have shaped my personality and made me devoted to use the gift that god gave me to promote tolerance and love. I hope that my voice will reach people all over the world and will open their hearts.

>> I decided to dedicate my career for peace.

=======================================================

>>> Due to mature subject matter, viewer discretion is advised. 
>> An inmate's stress prompts an emergency response. 
>> He's been trying to abuse himself all day. Threatening suicide. Trying to swallow things. 
>> I'm in here because of ike and tina. That's what I named my hands. Ike and tina. 
>> A repeat offender is charged with beating her mother and must now rely on her daughter for support. 
>> Please don't forget to get the money, alexis. You know where to put it at in the machine? 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> An inmate known for his brawn decides to focus on his brain. 
>> Keep it coming. Keep it coming. Keep it coming. 
>> And -- 
>> she was stabbed 19 times. 
>> After two prison sentences for attack women, another inmate is accused of an unthinkable act. 
>> He's going to have emotional triggers that nobody else in this jail can understand. And he's safest being by himself. ???????????? 
>> louisville, kentucky is a city of landmarks. Many of them household names from the world of sports. In the heart of downtown, however, there's a landmark of a different sort. The louisville metro department of corrections jail houses 2,300 inmates, most of whom have been charged with crimes and are awaiting trial and the resolution of their cases. 

[00:02:11]


>> Bucket, boy. Get all that. 
>> The vast majority of inmates are men, who try to pass time with sports activities themselves. But in the eight dormitories house the jail's daily average of 210 female inmates much of the focus is on beauty. 
>> Pencil. You draw and color with them. And they're also good for makeup. Great eye shadow and great mascara. Just add a little warm water to it. And voila. I put yellow on for me because of the uniform. 
>> Monique jeffries might have an eye for color, but it's her hands that landed her in jail. 
>> I'm in here because of ike and tina. That's what I named my hands, ike and tina. 
>> Why? 
>> Because ike was aggressive. And tina finally fought back. 
>> Are you a good fighter? 
>> I'm going to pat myself on the back. Yes. I'm 39, and I ain't never took a loss. And the only person I ever took a loss to is a male. But I refuse to let a woman beat me up. 
>> Fighting has earned jeffries three prior assault convictions and numerous jail stays on related charges over the past 15 years. 
>> People are going to look at it and watch this and say she's too old to be fighting. You're not too old to give an ass whooping and you're not too old to take one. 
>> I basically know my whole career over 12 years, she's seen me go from officer to lieutenant. It's kind of like following a professional relationship through her career coming in and out of jail and my career going through jail. So it's pretty unique. 
>> [ Bleep ]. 
>> Damn, I'm moving out of town. 
>> We've had this conversation before. 

[00:04:11]


>> He's one of the good ones. Yeah. He's my favorite. 
>> Jeffries' latest assault conviction for which she is now in jail awaiting sentencing struck closer to home. During an argument she knocked out two of her mother's teeth, gave her a black eye, and burned her arms with a curling iron. Jeffries said her mother provoked it and she is confident that she will be released on parole at her upcoming sentencing hearing. 
>> Nature itself joins in. Let the rivers clap their hands. Let the hills be joyful together before the lord. 
>> But the judge could give her up to five years in state prison. 
>> I'm learning to control my anger. 
>> While faith might keep jeffries calm, maintaining her femininity lifts her spirits. 
>> If I don't get up and glamify myself and just lay back, I'm depressed. So I get up and I take a shower at night and I take one in the morning. I get up, brush my teeth, comb my hair, and I lay right back down. 
>> It's not just women that are concerned about their appearance at louisville metro. The jail allows for a makeshift barber shop, where male inmates can get haircuts during their one hour of daily recreation time. Darryl campbell is one of the inmate barbers at louisville. 
>> Triple phase. Double phase. 
>> This is my favorite barber in here. I think he might be the best barber. 
>> For campbell most cuts are routine and remind him of his life on the outside. But occasionally he's called upon to groom inmates from a special wing of the jail. 
>> That's horrible. I'm sorry to hear that. 
>> This dorm is dorm 7. It's a single cell dorm. It's a 23-hour lockdown. 23 hours in the day, one hour out during the day. And it's a non-compliant site dorm. 

[00:06:15]


>> Today sergeant dejarnette will escort dorm cell inmate anthony politti to the gym. 
>> I was out there the other day. There were so many people out there. It was really cold. 
>> Politti is in the dorm while psychiatric staff continue to monitor and evaluate his state of mind and medication. Though he is currently considered to be stable. This will be politti's haircut in the 3 1/2 months that he's been at louisville metro. 
>> Come on, big cat. Got your arm band? Get that for me. Slide that on there. 
>> Politti has been charged and pled not guilty to murder, rape, sodomy, and tampering with physical evidence. 
>> How are you doing? 
>> What else you want? What do you want done to your hair? 
>> Whatever you recommend. 
>> All the way back. 
>> According to police reports and the prosecution, politti committed an especially vicious crime. At the time he was living at a rooming house in louisville, after having recently completed a prison sentence. The police report says politti and a 45-year-old woman were engaging in sexual activity. The sounds of a struggle prompted another rooming house resident to call 911. 
>> I just had a manicure done two days before I come here. Whole works. Had my eyebrows arched. Now they're back to klingon, you know, eyebrows. 
>> Despite his not guilty plea, the police report says politti actually confessed to strangling the victim to stop her screams. But he now says he confessed under duress during his long interrogation and doesn't really remember what happened to the victim. 
>> I mean, I black out sometimes, do stuff and don't remember. And it really ain't my fault. I don't know why it happens. It just happens. 

[00:08:27]


>> There's a mirror over here so you can look at it. 
>> Politti says he only remembers falling asleep with the victim, then waking up and going to a store. 
>> When I came back from the store, I laid down. Then I heard the police there, bam, bam, bam, bam, police, open up. And I pulled over the sheet, or the comforter. And there she was. I just seen some blood. And the body was like it was dead. I was just about to open the door and they bashed it in. And I didn't know what to say except could I light this cigarette? 
>> According to the autopsy report, the victim was strangled and suffered massive internal and external wounds caused by a sexual device this was confiscated from politti's room. 
>> I'm usually a real good guy. Police trust me with their kids even to babe why zit. I mean, I'm not a bad person. 
>> But this isn't the first time politti has been charged with a crime of a sexual nature. Coming up -- 
>> I hear a lot of voices. 
>> Anthony politti opens up to the jail psychiatrist. 
>> Are they telling you to hit me now? 
>> And -- 
>> he swallowed a comb. He was spitting up blood. 
>> A disturbance sends the special operations response team into action. And these come together, one thing you can depend on is that these will come together. Delicious and wholesome. Some combinations were just meant to be. Tomato soup from campbell's. It's amazing what soup can do. smartphones bonus card? That's right. So it's like I won. Sure. Oh my gosh I won!!! I won!!!

>>> Boxing champion muhammad ali might very well be louisville, kentucky's most celebrated native son. But fame and fortune have eluded many of the other would-be or former athletes inside the louisville metro department of corrections jail, including thomas "bam bam" lewis. 

[00:13:14]


>> I mean, bam bam's a good nickname I've had since I was 12 years old. When you I boxed, I mean, it was a good nickname. When I competed in arm wrestling, I mean, I guess it's a pretty good nickname to have. Well, I don't box anymore. I quit. I'm too old for that stuff. But I've always got to find something to compete in. Arm wrestling's a good sport. And I've seen even the old guys get in there and really kick ass. 
>> The problem is lewis can't always find many opponents willing tle him. But he has found another way of testing his strength. It involves outdated phone books. Lewis is currently serving a one-year sentence for non-payment of child support. He says it was always hard to make ends meet without a high school diploma. But now, thanks to a program offered by the jail, he's just days away from receiving his g.E.D. 
>> My mom's proud of me. I finally can say she's proud of me. After a lot of other stuff, she's always worried about me in boxing, always worried about me getting hurt in competition and other stuff I do. She don't really like tattoos. But this is one thing I can actually say she's proud of me for. 
>> While lewis has made the most of his time at louisville metro, some inmates continue to struggle. The special operations response team, or s.O.R.T., Has just been alerted to a disturbance involving an inmate currently on suicide watch. It is jail policy to document such calls on video. 
>> Behavior has been self-abusive. Today he is stating that he has swallowed items. He's told the officers he swallowed a comb. He's been spitting up blood. Also, we did catch him in an attempt to swallow part of a toothbrush. He has been strip-searched. 

[00:15:29]


>> He's a level 1 inmate, which means he's on suicide ups because he keeps trying to harm himself. 
>> And being naked? 
>> He refuses to put the smock on. 
[ Yelling ] 
>> THE INMATE, LaRON MOORE, HAS Just banged his head into the door frame. 
>> Grubbs. 
>> He just rammed his head into the wall. 
>> Just give it to him right now. 
>> Medical personnel are called to administer a sedative. 
>> Ow. 
>> Take it easy, man. 
>> Moore, who has pled not guilty to 13 charges including wanton endangerment, receiving stolen firearms, and evading arrest, is placed in a restraint chair, where he is secured at the feet, arms, and waist. 
>> This guy has had issues in the past with self-abusive behavior. The restraint chair is to prevent that behavior. 
>> Officers also place protective head gear on moore to prevent further self-injury. 
>> The nurses will keep monitoring. The officers will be checking him every 15 minutes. And he'll have an inmate one-on-one watcher that will sit outside and observe him also. And we'll just keep a check on him. And probably here in 30 minutes or an hour, maybe if he's -- if the medication takes effect then we might look at taking him out of that restraint chair and placing him back in his cell. 
>> Psychiatric staff will also meet with moore in an attempt to better understand his self-abusive behavior and to formulate a treatment plan. Over in the women's wing monique jeffries has been formulating fashion plans for herself and her dormmates. 

[00:17:29]


>> It don't make it look no better. 
>> She makes earrings from candy wrappers. 
>> Look at it. Bam. Boo-yah. 
>> And she also makes jewelry from comb tynes including the one for her facial piercing. 
>> It's called the marilyn monroe. Change it like every three days, I change it and put a new piece of comb in it. Because when you eat bacteria get on it. I don't want it to be infected. 
>> Jeffries' homemade jewelry could be confiscated because in jail any item that is altered from its intended use is contraband. But she can legally acquire her raw supplies like candy bars and combs from the jail commissary, a virtual general store. 
>> That's real important to the inmates if they've got money on their account because they can buy cookies, pops, potato chips, soups. 
>> I try to not laet a lot of sweets. But I'm a diabetic. My commissary snacks are cupcakes, pop tarts, snickers. 
>> And how do these qualify as not being sweet? 
>> I act naughty sometimes during my -- I'm not supposed to have sugar, but I have it just in case my sugar level drops. 
>> But jeffries faces another risk every time she wants to place an order for new commissary items. 
>> Hello? How are you doing? 
>> Having enough money on her inmate debit account to pay for it. 
>> I'm lucky, each time that I've been incarcerated that somebody's put money on my books. And most of the time I was incarcerated my mother put money on my books to make sure that i was all right. 
>> Answering machine came on. 
>> That's one source of funding jeffries has lost. She is currently awaiting sentencing for an assault on her mother that included knocking out two teeth and burning her with a curling iron. 
>> You can put -- will you put $100 on my book? I can't eat ts food in here. I tried. It made me sick. 

[00:19:37]


>> So today jeffries reaches out to an ex-boyfriend for commissary money. 
>> I am grateful. Huh? He said everybody calling me and telling me you starved and hungry. You ain't hungry. 
>> You ain't hungry. 
>> I was. I have been hungry. 
>> I think with me that's the most important thing when you're locked up, food and that phone. 
>> Call you later on tonight. I sure will. You have a nice workout. Okay? And I appreciate everything you do for me. Okay. Bye. 
>> No. Because he was yelling at me. 
>> Coming up -- 
>> I tell him give you $25 so you can give it to me. And don't take it, alexis. Hello. 
>> Monique jeffries seeks another source of commissary funding. Her daughter. 
>> Why do I have to be your mama? Why do I have to be there when i need you to be there? 
>> And anthony politti relives the past. 
>> I wrote stuff on the wall in blood, and it was threatening. add up to 100 calories? Your world. ?????? ?????? 
[ whispers ] Real bacon... Creamy cheese... 
[ whispers ] 100 calories... [ Chef ] Ma'am 
[ Male Announcer ] Progresso. You gotta taste this soup. 

[00:23:43]


>>> Most of the inmates inside the louisville metro department of corrections jail prefer living in dorm-style housing units where they can at least socialize and have access to tv. But anthony politti is happy to be housed alone in his cell and to occasionally chat with a neighbor. 
>> Politti. What's up? You got a haircut. Let me see. You ugly, man. 
>> I could not be in a room with 20, 30 people all day. That would drive me insane. I'd end up hurting somebody or I'd make them hurt me. I just couldn't do it. 
>> Politti is charged with murder and rape. But despite police claims that he confessed after he was arrested, politti says he has no recollection of the murder. 
>> How did the 40-year-old girl end up dead in your room, man? What happened? 
>> I don't know. Somebody strangled her, they said. 
>> Somebody strangled her, it weren't you? 
>> I don't remember. 
>> I would have been pissed if i came home and there was a dead body in my room. I'd have been pissed, man. 
>> Well, from my past experiences, I don't know, it's possible I did it but I don't think I did. I really don't. 
>> Well, you've done [ bleep ] before. 
>> And not remembered it. That's when people pissed me off, though. 
>> This is not the first time politti has been charged with a violent crime where he says memory failed him. He once served a 15-year prison sentence for assault with intent to commit murder after he stabbed an ex-girlfriend. 
>> She was stabbed 19 times. I don't remember it. 
>> Shortly after his release from prison politti was living with family. A female relative said he attempted to rape and strangle her. Politti denies all that but admits to another disturbing action. 
>> I wrote stuff on the wall in blood and it was threatening. I didn't write anything threatening, but because it was blood -- 
>> what did you write? 
>> "I love you." Stuff like that. 
>> Whose blood? 

[00:25:45]


>> Mine. 
>> After the relative chose not to confront him in court politti's charges were dropped to wanton endangerment and he was sentenced to another seven years in prison. Less than a year after his release he was arrested on his current charges of murder, pe, and sodomy. 
>> He was talking about getting the death penalty if te tried to give you a life sentence or something. 
>> I'm not doing any time anymore. Either let me out the door or, you know, give me the death penalty. 
>> Death penalty -- which would you rather take? The injection or the -- what's it called? 
>> Injection. I would never do the gas. 
>> You'd rather take the injection? Oh, my god, man. You're crazy. 
>> It's more humane than the gas. 
>> Politti, man, you're crazy, man. 
>> Mr. Politti, how about you sit over here and I'll sit here? It might work better. 
>> While he awaits trial at louisville metro, politti receives checkups from the jail psychiatrist, dr. Easley. 
>> How have you been? 
>> Not very good. I can't sleep. During the day or at night. I hear a lot of voices. Sometimes I go over the same thought -- think about the same thing over and over till it keeps me up all night. Sometimes they argue among themselves and sometimes they argue with me, telling me to do stuff over and over again. 
>> So the voices tell you to do things you don't want to do? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Can you give me an example? 
>> I mean, sometimes it's violent things like hit this person. Hit them, hit them, hit them over and over again. Hit them here, you know, hit them there. 
>> Are they telling you to hit me now? 
>> They're telling me to shut up. 
>> Politti went on to describe several graphic accounts of sexual abuse he says he suffered as a child. 
>> Is there anything else you want to tell me about? 
>> Not that I know of. 
>> Are you safe here in the jail? 
>> As long as they keep me in that little room I got. 

[00:27:46]


>> We need to be wrapping up. I'm going to change your medicine a little bit. All right? 
>> All right. 
>> I hope you feel better. 
>> All right. Thank you. 
>> Thank you for talking with me. Can I come back and see you? All right. Thanks. 
>> This is a man who has an unusual -- I mean, enough that it even surprises me. His life is that unusual. His background. So he's going to have emotional triggers that nobody else in this jail can understand. And he's safest being by himself, without triggering all that. 
>> Coming up -- 
>> I won't touch -- I mean, I've got to touch them, but I don't like to. 
>> A louisville metro lunchtime tradition. And -- 
>> you don't want your son on the streets. 
>> No, sir. 
>> Is that why you were hurting yourself? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Dr. Easley attempts to get THROUGH to LaRon moore. I told him, sure. Can't hurt, right? Then I heard this news about a multivitamin study looking at long-term health benefits for men over 50. The one they used in that study... Centrum silver. That's what I take. My doctor! He knows his stuff.

>>> And in-store sales for black friday were down 1.8% from last year but online sales were up more than 20%. Back to "lockup."

>>> Due to mature subject matter, viewer discretion is advised. 
>> Last call. Come on. 
>> At the louisville metro department of corrections jail lunchtime means the cellophane-wrapped meals most everyone here calls zabos. 
>> The reason we call them zabos is our vepding company was called zabo and they made the sandwiches at the time. And we no longer use them, but the name stuck with the sandwiches. 
>> Would you eat that szabo right now? 
>> No, I would not. 
>> Why? 
>> Why? Well, for one thing inmates prepare it. 
>> Inmates like brian walden. 
>> What you do is you lay five rolls, four pieces of bread with two pieces of mustard, two pieces of cheese, three cookies, and then you just wrap them up. A szabo wrap. I won't touch them. I mean, I've got to touch them, but I don't like to. 
>> But make szabos earns walden $3 a day and he appreciates that. 
>> It comes in handy because I'm indigent. I don't have people to come visit me and put money in my books. You work like a slave but you can't complain. Yeah, it keeps your mind from wandering or getting pressed out because I've got a little girl at home. You know what I'm saying? Keeps me from thinking of her too much. Pressed out means depressed. Some of that louisville slang. 
>> Walden is not alone in feeling depressed about leaving a child on the outside. LaRON MOORE'S RECENT Self-abusive behavior resulted in his being removed from his cell and being placed in a restraint chair. Now in a calmer state of mind he explains why he was upset. 

[00:34:23]


>> My son. I know -- I know some way he's missing me as much as I'm missing him. But I try not to think about him. 
>> Moore, now on new medication, has been taken off suicide watch. The jail's goal is to return him to general population. 
>> Hi. 
>> How are you doing? 
>> I'm doing pretty good. How are you? 
>> That decision will depend in part on whether dr. Easley feels he's ready for it. 
>> What made you so mad and angry? 
>> That I let my son down. Because I ain't never -- my father was there but he was doing the same thing I'm doing, in and out. And I feel like if I can be there with my son more he won't turn to the streets like I did. Like I was looking for a role model -- 
>> so you're hoping your son doesn't imitate -- if he does imitate you that he imitates the good parts. 
>> Yeah. Pretty much. 
>> You don't want your son on the streets. 
>> No, sir. 
>> Is that why you were hurting yourself? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Make more sense of it to me. 
>> Basically, most of the meals you sit here in jail, period, you had a father that wasn't there. Or had a father that was in and out of their life where they didn't have no role model, a male in their life. There's only so much a woman can teach them, a male -- a son basically. And I just feel like I let him down. 
>> And you didn't want your son to be disappointed in you like you're disappointed in your father. 
>> I just feel like if he was there in the past I probably wouldn't be here today talking to you. I'd probably be successful somewhere. I'd probably have a job or something. 

[00:36:26]


>> And what are you going to do to make sure nothing bad happens to you? 
>> Stay focused. 
>> Okay. We're going to try to move you from the single cell this evening, after shift change. So it will take several hours. Don't get aggravated. If it even takes till tomorrow. Okay? We're trying to get it done. Okay? 
>> Okay. 
>> I'll see you. Okay. Have a good weekend. All right. 
>> Just as moore's son occupies his thoughts, one of monique jeffries' daughters, 20-year-old alexis, occupies her. 
>> I'm getting dolled up today because I get my visit with my daughter and I'm just excited. 
>> For alexis visits bring mixed emotions. 
>> I really don't like visiting. I'm not going to lie. Because I feel like I shouldn't have to come here and see my mother behind a screen. 
>> Though alexis has had tw adopt to her mother's frequent stays in jail, adapting is something she's done all her life. 
>> She got shot accidentally by a sawed-off shotgun. Smi daughter. She has one arm. She was 17 months old when that happened. And she's the most intelligentest person I've ever met. And she is so strong. 
>> I'm here to see monique jeffries. 
>> In and out. I go through like most people i know hell and back. Just hoping that my mama can get out and share it with me. 
>> You know what you want to talk to her about? 
>> Money. I'm running low on it. I need $30. 
>> Hey. Look at you. 
>> Did you cut your hair? 
>> Uh-uh. 
>> Look. 
>> You got nails. 

[00:38:26]


>> You see how long they are? 
>> They are. That means you ain't been nervous or angry. 
>> I miss you. You look beautiful. 
>> Thank you. 
>> During the visit alexis gets a cell phone call from monique's brother. 
>> Oh, my god. Tell him I miss him so much. 
>> Your sister says she misses you so much. 
>> Tell him to meet you to give you some money for me. Tell him to give you $25 so you can give it to me. And don't take it, alexis. Hello. 
>> I am listening, mama. 
>> Tell him we don't have that much time. What'd he say? 
>> He said I'moing to give you some money. 
>> I want to be happy with her, not stressed about having to be locked up and having to have money on the books and money on the phone when you've barely even got money, you know, to eat and do everything else. 
>> I can't wait to see your apartment. Don't do anything else so I can help you decorate. 
>> I just put a little mirror up and this little thing that say hope and this little thing about god. Just a couple things. You supposed to be here. You know, you done missed enough. I have my first apartment, first new car, first everything. 
>> I know. 
>> At the end of the day sometimes you just being around and me coming to see you and to hear your voice helps me get over everything. You know I'm crying. You know I'm still going to love you. 
>> Yeah, I know. I miss you so much. I don't want to make you cry, make your makeup run. But I miss you so much. Stay away from people that be trying to get me in trouble and fight. 
>> At the end of the day we've got to learn how to walk away. 
>> I'll be walking away and reading my bible, everything. And when I say I've been reading my bible, you should see how people look at me. 

[00:40:29]


>> The lord needs you and you need the lord. 
>> So please don't forget to get the money, alexis. You know where to put it at in the machine? 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Alexis, please put it on there today. Please before you leave. 
>> I will. 
>> And I miss you. And -- 
>> I miss you and love you too. I am. 
>> Bye-bye. 
>> At the end of the day it's like I don't care what she does, what anybody says or any of that. I just feel like you know, it's my mother. So just because she is like my best friend and bundle of joy. Why do I have to be your mama? Why do I have to be there when i need you to be there? 
>> Coming up -- 
>> okay. Look at the cameras. 
>> A graduation. 
>> Welcome to the dorm. 
>> A transfer. 
>> A salaam aleikem. 
>> Aleikem salaam. 
>> And a conversion.

>>> Louisville metro department of corrections jail inmate thomas "bam bam" lewis has been many things. A tattoo artist. A boxer. An arm wrestler. And a high school dropout. Most recently he's shown a talent for disposing of old phone books. One thing he thought he'd never be is a math tutor. 
>> All right. T's start by finishing up doing -- 
>> the ones we missed? 
>> Doing the ones you missed. 
>> Lewis says the one thing about jail he's grateful for is the g.E.D. Program, which he has just completed. And now he wants to pay it forward. 
>> I'm helping the gentlemen get ready for their g.E.D. Test. It's just something I volunteer to do. And to help somebody else, man, makes me feel like I've achieved something. 
>> You're flushing too much. You've got too much on your brain. Just calm down, relax, and just work the problem. 
>> But now it's time for 40-year-old lewis to play a new role. Graduate. 
>> Put on my dress. Cute little dress I get to wear. 
>> Still, his reputation precedes him. 
>> Hey, listen. You know this is the gift, right? Don't rip it in half, bam bam.

>> G.E.D. Graduates are allowed to have one visitor at the ceremony. And lewis's has just arrived. 
>> My baby. 
>> I'm here to watch my son finally graduate. 
>> Good seeing you again. It's been a year. 
>> Yes. 
>> But you finally get to see me walk down the aisle, huh? 
>> Yeah, finally. 
>> I'm just so glad he's doing this. And getting it done. I've been trying to get him to do it for a while. And it's the first time I've actually gotten to touch him for a long time. 

[00:46:55]


>> Keep it coming. Keep it coming. Keep it coming. 
[ Applause ] yeah. 
>> I did it. I graduated. Seeing all my friends get their high school diploma and my daughter's got hers. I mean, it's something that i really should have had a long time ago. 
>> Get over there with her. 
>> Thomas lewis, come on up here, tom. Give it up for thomas, you guys. Congratulations. We have mom here with you? 
>> Yes. 
>> Okay. Get in here. Hold your certificate. Okay? Look at the camera. Congratulations. 
[ Applause ] 
>> I knew she was happy and proud of me. Looking in her eyes said it all. My life right here. 
>> All right. Say your good-byes. You've got to go. 
>> I'll be out soon. Come on. I'll walk you out. 
>> Okay. 
>> Walk you as far as I can anyway. They won't let me walk you out. 
>> No, I don't think -- 
>> oh, no, I'm in black, they might let me get a little further. 
>> LaRON MOORE MIGHT FEEL HE'S Graduating as well. After several counseling sessions and adjustments to his medication the jail's mental health staff has approved his transfer from a single-person segregation cell to general population dorm. 
>> So tell me how you're feeling about this. 
>> I'm happy. Kind of ready to move back to a dorm and get out of the single cell. 
>> No anxiety about it? 
>> No. 
>> I think a single cell's meant to break you down mentally. You don't got nobody to talk to. You don't got nobody to vent to. You don't got nobody to do nothing with. It's just you and four walls and the sunlight. So the only time you do -- you've only got time to think, think, think, think, think. 

[00:49:06]


>> How are you doing, man? Welcome to the dorm. Some other guys in there. You'll get along fine. We play cards, watch tv, watch movies. It's all right in here. You'll like it. The doctors work with you. 
>> Due to overcrowding there are no available bunks in the dorm. So moore will sleep on the floor in a boat, a plastic shell used as a temporary boat. But moore's still happy to be here. 
>> I'm glad to be out of the single cell. Been in there for a while. 
[ Banging ] now, that ain't me. It used to be me. 
>> That's how we playing? 
>> Another inmate at louisville metro has always seen significant change. Six weeks after seeing her daughter -- 
>> I'll be walking away, reading my bible. 
>> -- And soon to be sentenced for assaulting her mother, monique jeffries has had a conversion. 
>> What are you doing, monique? 
>> Going to muslim service. I changed my religion. Okay. I've got to go. 
>> There's no such thing as i hate this group of people or i hate this race of people or i hate this individual. No. They're all a creation of the creator. So you want to respect the creator? Respect his creations. 
>> Yes. 
>> We want to do the right thing and show the people the real islam. How be kinder to people. You kind to your neighbors. You kind to society. 1:00. Got to go. 
>> Oh, wow. I'm mad. 
>> I'll come back next week, and I will see you guys next week. In what? In shah allah.

>>> Do you solemnly swear or affirm the testimony you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? 
>> Frequent court appearances are common for jail inmates. As most of them are still in the process of resolving their cases. For that reason the courthouse and jail at the louisville metro department of corrections are housed within the same structure. And monique jeffries is in court today. She has already been convicted for assaulting her mother. In fact, she knocked out two of her mother's teeth and burned her with a curling iron. Now she is about to be sentenced. 
>> All rise. 
>> Please be seated. 
>> Jeffries is optimistic that she will be allowed to leave jail on parole. Her mother, debra brown, I also present in court. 
>> Okay. The case of -- versus monique jeffries. 
>> Before delivering his sentence the judge allows jeffries to make a statement. 
>> Go ahead, ms. Jeffries. 
>> I would just like to say today that I have forgave myself for what I have done. I'm not a savage beast. I'm a human being. I will admit that it got a little bit out of hand. But I just didn't intentionally put my hands on her. I was provoked. I'm only protecting myself. And I can't help it if I protect myself to where I'm not going to let anybody put their hands on me anymore. Since my incarceration I have a new religion as a muslim. I've learned more than I have as a christian. And being a muslim requires a whole lot of structure. And I finally found something that's really to structure me and help me get out of myself to be a better person. 
>> Thank you very much, ms. Jeffries. Carl? 
>> Yes, thank you. Debra brown, who is the mother, is here in the courtroom today, and I believe that she would like to address the court and if the court would permit her I'd ask her to come forward. 

[00:56:33]


>> All right. 
>> Debra. 
>> Yes, ma'am. 
>> Monique done hit me, jumped on me four times within my lifetime. She is a beast. I still have nightmares to see her hands come down in my face. She took both of my phones so i wouldn't call the police. She burned me on my arm with a hot curler. And her attitude, she went into her mode, oh, shut up, you're not her, your teeth wasn't no good anyway, you going to sit there and you going to let me hot curl my hair and get ready before you call the police. I had to give her a bus check to get out of my home and to leave but she kept hot curling her hair. I asked her for my phones. She said, you keep on I'm going to burn you. I grabbed for my phone while she stood there and hot-curled her hair. She kept laying the curlers on my arm. When she knocked my teeth out one at a time. She was hitting me so hard I did like this. And she beat the daylights out of me. 
>> I understand it's -- 
>> and I can't take her beatings no more. Monique was wrong, sir. 
>> I understand. I don't want you to get too -- 
>> I'm her mother. I'm not her friend in the street. You don't hit your mother. You don't beat your mother. 
>> Well, you don't do that to anybody. So okay. Well, I appreciate your comments, ma'am. Thank you very much. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Okay. Well, you know, the court's heard from the defendant and from the victim. And it's immediately obvious to the court that there are a lot of very strong emotions involved here. But ms. Jeffries, I'm going to deny your motion for probation and impose a sentence at this time because I think that you have to accept responsibility for what you've done. So I wish you the best of luck and will impose a sentence of five years -- was that correct on this? 

[00:58:37]


>> Five years, yes. 
>> So ms. Jeffries, I wish you the best of luck. 
>> Now facing five years in state prison, jeffries was feeling less forgiving toward her mother and her decision to press charges. 
>> You guys have probably one of the most [ bleep ] uppest relationship, yes. If she needed blood I wouldn't give it to her. If she was on her dying bed i wouldn't even go. I have forgave myself and god has forgaven me. So I'm done. 
>> Monique was born as a monster. And I said I'm going to take this creature off the street because I created her. I hadn't seen her in two years. And I brought her back into my home. I'm embarrassed that my own child beat me the way she did. And that's all I got to say. Bye.

=======================================================

>> In this jail, man, it's like you got to be strong. You got to be mentally strong. You got to be physically strong. 
>> I said, "if you touch my food, we're gonna have a 
>> Narrator: A lunchtime dispute turns violent. 
>> It was really a bully situation, like what you would see on a commercial. 
>> Another inmate learns crime doesn't pay and jail isn't free. 
>> This is bull[bleep] anyway! I got to give you $35 to lock me up?! 
>> Are you good at it?Ve never been beat. 
>> Narrator: And an inmate with a violent past prepares to return to the streets. 
>> I'm the predator, not the prey. 
>> Narrator: Famous for baseball bats, bourbon, and betting, louisville, kentucky, is a city there's a place downtown where it all gets sorted out. The louisville metro department of corrections jail has a daily population of about 2,000 men and women charged with anything from minor crimes to capital murder. Jail facility was built right across the street. 

[00:02:03]


>> Let's go! 
>> Narrator: Today, both buildings are overcrowded, and their layouts are outdated. 
>> How are you guys doing back 
>> Narrator: Director mark bolton wants to change that. 
>> This is an old facility. It's a very costly facility to operate, and one of my goals that I would like to accomplish before I leave here is master capacity planning for a new direct-supervision jail. 
>> Narrator: Direct supervision is a system where offices are stationed inside housing units 24/7. Research shows it to be more effective in reducing violence than in facilities where remote supervision is used. 
>> You're trying to look like me today, right? 
>> [ Laughs ] 
>> no. They are not designed to have an around-the-clock staff presence. 
>> This is more of an indirect, remote type of inmate supervision, architecture here. But what we can do is we can traverse the jail and get in andt of those housing units and really develop that community-policing model in the jail. 
>> Unlock door, door, door. 
>> Officer. 
>> Narrator: So when a fight breaks out, response times are slower than those in direct-supervision facilities because officers are not already inside the housing units. Officers have just broken up a fight between two inmates. To do so, they had to deploy o.C. Gas, also known as pepper spray. 
>> Let's go! 
>> Narrator: One of the inmates is william mitchell. He's in jail awaiting trial for burglary and has pled not guilty.D with cocaine possession. He, too, has pled not guilty and is awaiting trial. 
>> Just like could be beef from the streets. But inevitably, fights will happen. But most times, people will get in a fight and we don't even know what happened, and then we do an investigation into it. 

[00:04:04]


>> Narrator: Mitchell and beavers are placed in temporary holding cells just a couple of doors down from each other and continue their dispute. 
>> That's right, fool! He snuck [bleep] when my head was turned [bleep] 
>> bitch, you talking about life! 
>> Fat-ass [bleep] 
>> Narrator: Mitchell got cut on his nose, so officers bring him to medical for treatment. 
>> [Bleep] snuck me while i wasn't looking. 
>> My whole chest red, man. 
>> Narrator: Beavers got the worst of the pepper spray. 
>> Ooh [bleep] my face ain't what's burning. It's from here, on my neck. 
>> The heat's not gonna go away for about a half-hour to 45 minutes. all right? That's all that's gonna happen for 30, 45 minutes. Trust me. I've been sprayeat least 50 times. 
>> Okay. 
>> Narrator: While inmates often keep quiet about the cause of 
>> calm down. booking fee to help reimburse the facility. If they can't pay it, a lien is put on the debit account they use to buy food and other items from the commissary. 
>> If you're locked up multiple times and don't have no money, that booking fee just keeps adding on and adding on, so it can be several hundred dollars that you owe the jail. 
>> Narrator: Beavers had such a lien on his account, so he made a deal with mitchell. Beavers' family would deposit commissary money on mitchell's account. Mitchell would then order commissary goods for beavers. Would give to mitchell for agreeing to the plan. 
>> So mr. Mitchell expected some type of payment more than two ramen noodles, and he refused, and that's when the fight broke out. 
>> Lean over. Don't blink. 
>> [Bleep] 

[00:06:05]


>> Narrator: Both beavers and mitchell will soon meet with disciplinary officer hale, who will determine how much time they will each get in segregation -- a solitary-confinement unit or, among other things, they're locked in their cells 23 hours per day. 
>> They're not allowed visits. They're not allowed to go to the gym. They're not allowed to have books. 
>> Narrator: Most inmates don't like to fight, but some relish violence. 
>> I love to fight.[ Laughs ] 
>> are you good at it? 
>> Fighting? I've never been beat. 
>> Narrator: Brian voltz is currently serving six months for an act of violence, though the victim was anything but a heavyweight. He admits an argument with the mother of one of his sons got out of hand, but denies injuring her. Still, he pled guilty to domestic abuse and returned to louisville metro once again. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19 times he's been in jail. You can pretty much say he's grown up inside the facility. 
>> I started coming in this jail when I was 18, and I've probably been back three times a year, four times a year, sometimes more, sometimes less. 
>> Narrator: Voltz, who has also served two terms in state prison for robbery and assault, says the recent car accident that has forced him to walk with a cane hasn't slowed him down. 
>> What don't kill you makes you stronger. 

[00:08:07]


>> Can you still fight like this? 
>> The last guy I whuped was on my cane, so yeah, still fight. And I don't use it as a weapon neither. I'll throw it to the side, put my hands up. I'm the predator, not the prey. I do the eating. I don't get eaten. 
[ Chuckles ] BUT A LOT OF THE C.O.s WILL TELL You I've done calmed down a whole lot, so I've been the inmate before with the buck-wild mentality, with the not caring for nothing and not knowing the code. You know what I'm saying? I've been there, dude. 
>> Narrator: Now at age 33, voltz says he would like to begin a new chapter. He will soon be eligible for a work-release program, where he'll spend his nights in jail, but can spend days in preapproved locations, such as the louisville tattoo studio he owns with a friend. 
>> Whatever I do, I'm gonna have to do it on my own or with my group, because I ain't gonna be able to be accepted in the professional world. 
>> Yeah, that's a question i have for you. 
>> Job search sucks. 
[ Laughs ] my job search is usually "don't waste your time filling out the application." 
>> Narrator: Coming up... 
>> It's my nickname my first time in penitentiary. Self-explanatory. 
>> Narrator: Brian voltz explains his ink. 
>> It was really a bully situation. 
>> Narrator: And another inmate uses a food tray as a weapon. 

[00:12:50]


>> Narrator: About 45,000 men and women are booked into the louisville metro department of corrections jail each ar. Even though most will bail out within a day or two, the jail is completely maxed out. 
>> ...Baby! 
>> We are up against our capacity every day. Every day, we're approaching 2,000 inmates, with 1,793 beds. 
>> Hey, over to your side. 
>> I think we lock up too many people in this country. I think we have to look at alternatives to incarceration for people that are lower risk, for mentally ill population, 'cause we cannot build our way out of this problem. You know, there's a saying in this business, "if you build it, they will come." And, you know, you build a jail 
-- we build 3,000 beds tomorrow, I guarantee you it'll be filled by the end of the day. 
>> Narrator: With every bunk filled at louisville metro, some inmates sleep on the floor in boats -- hard, plastic shells that act as temporary beds. One of the boats was assigned to 34-year-old angie davis. 
>> This obviously is not where a bed is supposed to be. 
>> I want your juice, sugar. You gonna take this cake for a juice? She's...Her juice. 
>> It's right by the table where everyone eats, where everyone sits and talks and plays cards and gets on my nerves. 
>> They're sitting overtop of me, eating their food. I want to talk to obama about this. 
>> [ Laughs ] 

[00:14:53]


>> well, these are the bunks. It looks like the projects back here. Somebody didn't flush the toilet, and that's gross. 
[ Toilet flushes ] all right. Toilet. This is the shower area, which someone has been in here. And you see this is just where people don't have home training. They just open stuff and just throw it all over the floor like they have maids. The women -- you just wouldn't believe how silly it is. 
[ Indistinct shouting ] you hear that [bleep] 
>> yes, you did! 
>> No, I didn't! 
>> So here we go. 
>> People be coming up, telling us bull[bleep] about y'all! 
>> How old are you, though?! 
>> How old are you?! 28! 
>> I'm 27, I'm 27! Ain't nobody going back [bleep] ain't nobody tell j.P. That y'all was talking about her! So what the [bleep] wrong with you? Bull[bleep] when the girls say that [bleep] nobody say that to me or j.P.! Right there, that's when y'all started [bleep] ain't no mother[bleep] say that, and that's for the [bleep] camera! How y'all like that?! That's what you wanted?! That's what the [bleep] they got! 
>> Narrator: Knowing a shouting match can turn physical, officers quickly separate the inmates. 
>> Ladies... 
>> What's the matter? 
>> ...It's quiet time for a minute, okay, please? All right? Just keep to yourselves. Leave everybody else alone. All right? 
>> There you have it. That's why I don't like this dorm. 
>> Every day, you come in to a situation like that where, you know, we have to intervene. It's not just with the females. I mean, it's anywhere in the jail. And that happens every day on every shift in the facility, multiple times most days. 
>> Narrator: At louisville metro, male inmates outnumber females by about nine to one. Most live in dormitories designed to hold either 16 or 24 men, but they, too, are almost always beyond capacity. 
>> This jail is horrible. This is by far the worst jail I've ever been to in my entire life. It's like trying to fit five families in a house. You know, it just don't work. And you have, you know, animosity and people getting up in each other's faces and trying to kill each other. Whenever you have that many personalities clashing, it's gonna happen. 

[00:17:00]


>> Narrator: And less than 24 hours earlier, ben thompson, serving time for burgly, was at the center of one such clash. 
>> Yesterday, I guess it was my eighth day here. 
>> Chow! Make sure you got your... 
>> They holler "chow." I get up and get my tray, and i hear somebody say something to me when we're in line, but i didn't really pay attention. I was half asleep. And I walked back to my place, and I'm sitting there, and this guy -- he says, "either you're gonna give me some of your food or you got to get up." And I said, "hey, if you touch my food, we're gonna have a problem." And he proceeded to touch my food. 
>> Narrator: Thompson rises from his seat. Seconds later, the other inmate, keith reeves, appears to put a hand in his face, and thompson strikes back. 
>> I punched him in the mouth like four times, and then he tried to take another tray and pour it overtop of my head. And then I got him in a headlock, and I just choked him out. 
>> Narrator: Other inmates step in to break up the fight when an off-camera officer arrives and threatens to use pepper spray. After initial interviews with both inmates, staff identified reeves as the aggressor and temporarily assigned him to a single-person segregation cell. 
>> Damn. 
>> Narrator: They allowed thompson to return to his dormitory. 
>> It was really a bully situation, like what you would see on a commercial, you know, about kids bullying. 
>> [ Sighs ] 
>> look at him, cool, laid-back type person. You know what I'm saying? To people start getting on my nerves. I can get an attitude problem. And you know what I'm saying? He hit me first. But they didn't see it that way. They looking at it I started it. So I guess they figure I'm a troublemaker. You know what I'm saying? They moved me there and put me in the hole. 
>> I got to stay in the room all day, confined. Can't do nothing. Can't talk to nobody. No tv, no anything. I'm hoping for the best. 

[00:19:10]


>> Narrator: Coming up... 
>> You're in charge of me to be locked up. I didn't ask to be locked up. 
>> We're not charging. 
>> I didn't say, "come lock me up." 
>> Narrator: ...Deamon beavers learns that jail comes with a price. 
>> You're taking money from us, from metro government. 
>> How?! gas meltaways, or treat gas with these after you get it. Now that's like sunblock before or sun burn cream later. Oh, somebody out there's saying, now I get it! Take beano before and there'll be no gas. 

[00:22:27]


>> What's up, y'all, what's up?! 
>> Narrator: Inmates at the louisville metro department of corrections jail get one hour a day of rec time. The options are basketball... Or working out on exercise equipment. Some inmates find more creative methods. FEW, HOWEVER, CAN MATCH DionTray Jackson's routine. 
>> [ Gasps ] 
>> eight [bleep] you gonna try for nine? Eight. Mm-hmm! Eight. 
>> Huh? 
>> In this jail, man, it's like you got to be strong. You got to be mentally strong. You got to be physically strong. People see a weak spot, you know, they come for you, you know? 
>> Narrator: There are about 24 fights per month among the jail's male inmates. After each one, staff must sort out what happened. 
>> Let's go! 
>> The recent fight between william mitchell and deamon beavers is due to a disagreement over how many packages of noodle soup beavers would pay mitchell in return for a favor. Mitchell allowed beavers to use his account to buy commissary goods. Since any money beavers had in his own account would be garnished by the jail for unpaid booking fees. 
>> You ready? 
>> Narrator: Beavers must now tell his side of the story to disciplinary officer hale, who will decide how much time he will get in segregation. 
>> I don't have no problems. You know what I'm saying? Come on, harvey. You know me. You know I don't cause no ruckus. 
>> You complied and laid on the ground. Mr. Williams kept on trying to fight. And like I do with everybody in here, your first offense for fighting's gonna be 10 days. 

[00:24:29]


>> Oh, man. Come on, man. I mean, come on, hale... I comply with everything the officers have asked me to do. I've been in here. I ain't been kicking on no doors. I ain't been causing no ruckus or nothing. 
>> Sign right there and right there. 
>> [ Sighs ] that's just bull[bleep] man. Lose all the way around. Lose my money, lose my commissary, and lose my privileges. 
>> You want to sign that? 
>> That don't even make sense, man. You know me. Collins, that don't even make sense. 
>> All right, let me explain something to you real quick, all right? I ain't got nothing to do with this, but I'm just witnessing this. However [clears throat] you know what this started from. 
>> Dude's trying to steal my 
[bleep] 
>> what's it originally started from? It started from putting money on an account illegally. 
>> I ain't know nothing about that was illegal. 
>> No, man. 
>> Come on! I ain't never had a problem with my account. 
>> All right, let me ask you something. 
>> I ain't never had a problem with my account. 
>> If you didn't know nothing was wrong with it, then why did you have to put it on somebody else's account? 
>> Because I owe the jail money. 
>> Exactly! So you're taking money from us, from metro government. 
>> How?! 
>> Because that money would come. If you put it on your books, that would go to your booking fees you owe. 
>> Booking fees is bull[bleep] anyway! I got to give you $35 to lock me up?! 
>> Absolutely. You know how much it costs a day to incarcerate somebody? 
>> I'm paying you to lock me up. I didn't ask -- 
>> you ain't paying me. You're paying tax dollars. 
>> You just said I'm taking money from y'all. 
>> You're taking from metro government. I work for metro government. 
>> So I got to pay the government for them to lock me up? 
>> Yeah, 'cause the government has to pay for your housing. It has to pay for these bills. 
>> No, I'm not going to bull county. 
>> You got to pay $25 a day to be incarcerated. 
>> That's bull[bleep] though is what I'm saying. You're charging me to be locked up. I didn't ask to be locked up. 
>> We're not charging you. 
>> I didn't say, "come lock me up." 
>> Taxpayers voted that, all right? 
>> I didn't say, "come lock me up. Here comes some money. Here. I want to be in jail." I get bills on the street to pay. 
[Bleep] I don't like paying the government to lock me up. 
>> Step back in. 

[00:26:31]


>> [ Clears throat ] 
>> he got kind of mad, but, you know, he's got to deal with the consequences. Like lieutenant collins told him, put money on the books illegally. You know, that's his fault. He lost everything he's got. So, you know, I was fair with him. I do the same to every inmate when they first get in a fight. They get 10 days. He's just not happy right now. 
>> Narrator: Coming up... 
>> Say a-b-c-d-e-f-g >> 
Narrator: ...Brian voltz puts his tough-guy image aside, at least for a little while. 
>> I don't know who my daddy is. If I was to ever meet him, I'd probably hit him in his mouth. 
>> Narrator: And... 
>> I was gonna move his tray out of my way 'cause he was sitting where I was sitting at. 
>> But you were already sitting in a seat, and he was sitting on the opposite side of you. 
>> Narrator: ...Keith reeves attempts to prove security cameras wrong. 

[00:31:19]


>> Narrator: Brian voltz's numerous tattoos reflect his beliefs and are a road map through his past. 
>> It's my nickname my first time in penitentiary. Self-explanatory. 
>> Narrator: They're also among his most prized possessions. 
>> I've always been unique, and when I met tattoos, that was my way to be even more unique. I like to stand out. What's up? 
>> It's my nickname my first time in penitentiary. Self-explanatory. 
>> Narrator: They're also amg his most prized possessions. 
>> I've always been unique, and when I met tattoos, that was my way to be even more unique. I like to stand out. What's up? I just got self-expression everywhere. 
>> Narrator: But voltz says he treasures more than his ink. "I'm daddy's baby." Say it loud in prayer. Say, "i'm daddy's baby." 
>> Narrator: Voltz has 2 sons, a 2-year-old and a 13-year-old, by 2 different women. He is currently in jail for domestic abuse against the mother of his 2-year-old, brian ii, or deuce. 
>> Deuce, daddy loves you. When I'm free, I take great pride in spending time with my kids. No, daddy's not at the doctor. Daddy's locked up. I don't lie to my kids. 
>> [ Laughing ] 
>> you hear me? I love you. I love you more. Even though I've slacked and I'd be less of a man to not admit that through addictions, I did neglect them somewhat, but even in my neglectful states, I was always a great father. Say a-b-c-d-e-f-g h-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p I'll be damned if I let them grow up without a father like I did. I don't know who my daddy is, so if I was to ever meet him, I'd probably hit him in his mouth. Dude's been making up songs. 
>> Does he? 
>> He got one called "my money in my pocket." He goes... My money in my pocket money in 

[00:33:28]


MY POCKET >> Narrator: While voltz strives to be a father to his children, he must also reconcile his relationship with deuce's mother. 
>> Thank you for sending that money or giving them the money to send. 
>> Check. 
>> Raise it to me. 
>> I got me some hygiene products. I ain't ordered no food yet. Tell him I love him. Spider-man! All right. I got to go. 
>> Money in his pocket. 
>> He got money and he ain't 
[bleep] me up. And one day, I heard him singing that. 
>> Money in his pocket. 
>> Trying to be influential to my kids. I mean, that's my life. That's my sunshine. When I talk to my kids, i brighten up. Other than that, I got to get back to reality, and this right here what you see is reality. 
>> Narrator: For deamon beavers, reality is 23 hours a day in a segregation cell, 10 days of it, for fighting with another inmate. And to make matters worse, he says some of his personal belongings, including letters from his daughter, were stolen by other inmates when he transferred cells. It's dirty. It's nasty. It stinks. I wouldn't let my dog live like this. I lost my phone privileges. I can't talk to my kids or my wife. The commissary's nothing. I'm not even depressed about that. 20 ain't nothing. But it's the point of my letters from my daughter. That's what gets me through. You know what I mean? I'm through, man. I won't talk no more. 
>> Narrator: While segregation is hard on many inmates, DionTray JACKSON NOW USES HIS Time there to do what he does best -- built more muscle. During his time in general population, jackson was known for his extreme workout methods and staying fit for the fight. 

[00:35:42]


>> People see a weak spot, you know, they come for you. Ain't no guns in here. 
[ Chuckles ] 
>> Narrator: And it was, in fact, a fight that landed jackson here. 
>> Little altercation. Came out. Nobody hit me. I hit them. And they brought me down here for assaulting another inmate, 15 days, you know? You got to stay in shape. You got to stay militant. You got to stay alert. 'Cause anything goes. I learned how to protect myself. 
>> Narrator: Though jackson stays in peak physical condition, he says he's as much a lover as he is a fighter. 
>> These are my letters I got this morning, my love letters from my wife. She's always sending me beautiful encouragements, keep me motivated, keep my mind from being inside these walls. I love her to death. It's like her words are right here with me. Of course, they always are when you love someone. I just got this one today. That's a beautiful card, too. It says, "in all the world, there is no heart for me like yours. In all the world, there is no love for you like mine." Then it says, "i am thankful for all that has happened to bring us together. I know our love was meant to be." 
[ Laughs ] then she signed it. Then, I like this one the best, because it says, "hats off to you." 
[ Laughs ] because, you know, it touched me on the inside. Then this one right here -- I didn't understand that one. I guess she was telling me to meditate before I punch people. 

[00:37:43]


>> Narrator: Keith reeves might not have thrown the first punch, but staff say he instigated a fight with ben thompson. 
>> You're gonna see inmate keith reeves right here come in and sit down at this table with his tray right here. And here comes inmate benjamin thompson. Comes around and sits at the opposite seat. Then that's when inmate reeves tries to take something off his tray. And there he points in his face, and then that's when the fight starts. 
>> Narrator: If reeves can convince disciplinary officer hale that he did not instigate the fight, he could return to his dorm. If not, he could face up to 60 days in segregation. 
>> I mean, now is the time to explain your situation, and I'm gonna tell you, don't lie to me, because I've already watched the tape, and I know what happened, okay? Go ahead. 
>> We just started fighting. I feel like if I wanted to really fight him like that I'd have -- you know what I'm saying? -- Caught him off the camera we'd have fought where i wouldn't have to deal with y'all right now. 
>> When I watched the video, it showed me that you were trying to take his food from his tray. 
>> I was gonna move his tray out of my way 'cause he was sitting where I was sitting at. 
>> Well, I mean, you sat down at a chair, and then he sat down at a chair. I mean, where did you want him to go to? 
>> Right, but where he was sitting at is where I was sitting, 'cause he got to the table before I did. He was sitting right there where I was already sitting at before he challenged me. 
>> So you can't sit at that same table and eat? 
>> Not if I'm sitting right there in the seat where he tried to take my seat. No, he's not gonna just sit in my seat. He can sit anywhere he wants on the table. 
>> In the video, you come in, and you sit at a chair right here. You come around. You sit down. He comes around this way and sits in this chair, and it shows you looking at him. I guess you're saying something to him. And then he stands up, okay? 
>> Right. I was telling him, "you'd better get out of my seat," or move his chair. 
>> But you were already sitting in a seat, and he was sitting on the opposite side of you. That's what I'm trying to explain to you. 
>> I know. 
>> And then when you stand up and you reach and try to grab something off his tray and he blocks you, then you poke him in the face. So, I'm saying there's five chairs at that table, and you were the only one at a table. He just came around and sat at another table. He wasn't trying to sit in your chair. 

[00:40:06]


>> He was already sitting in my seat. 
>> You were the first one to sit at the table. 
>> How was I the first one to sit there? He got his food before I did in line. 
>> You were the first one to sit at that table. 
>> All right, all right. 
>> That's what I'm trying to explain. I done watched the whole video, okay? 
>> Any chance I can watch the video? 
>> The video's for my use only. So, you admit to fighting, right? 
>> Yeah. 
>> I can give you 60 days in disciplinary segregation for the write-up. If the other inmate wanted to, he could have taken out assault 2 charges against you for using that tray as a weapon during a fight. Evidently, he didn't. Being your first-time offense, I'm gonna give you 15 days. And this is your copy. You'll be moved to disciplinary segregation sometime today. All right. You're good. 
>> [ Mumbling ] 
>> reeves, will you just switch out jump suits for me, man? I need the orange one back. And pack all your stuff up. I'm gonna move you. 
>> You got these young guys. Some of them don't care. So they all get smart. You can see his demeanor was a little agitated. Tried to lie a little bit, saying the guy was already sitting at his seat. So right there, he tried to lie his way out of it. 
>> Damn! 
>> All right. Step forward. 
>> Narrator: In this case, the surveillance footage not only revealed the truth, upon closer examination, it also revealed something about the binding properties of jail food. 
>> It's gonna take one, two hits, and then the food finally comes out. I would say more than likely that's either macaroni and cheese or it's scalloped potatoes, which they make them kind of thick so it sticks to the trays. I guess that's what they say. "If it sticks to the tray, it sticks to your ribs," and it keeps you fuller. I don't know. I've been eating it for 17 years. It ain't killed me yet, so i guess it's good. 

[00:42:16]


>> Narrator: Coming up... 
>> It's not something you want to eat, but you got to use your imagination with this, like I'm at ihop or something. 
>> Narrator: Diontray jackson fantasizes about freedom, while brian voltz takes a significant step toward it. 
>> I love you, bro. 
>> I love you, too, boy. 

[00:45:47]


>> Narrator: While the louisville metro department of corrections jail must deal with overcrowded conditions on a near daily basis, several inmates have cells all to themselves. But most don't cherish the privacy. They are in segregation for a variety of disciplinary issues and have little to do all day but to look out the window. 
>> Sometimes, I wish I was an eagle. I could fly over everything. My birds come up here in the morning time, wake me up, and that's one of my songs I wrote. The birds, the birds have sung everything I've done I say the birds, the bids have sung everything I've done them birds sing everything I've done. You know, in the morning, the first thing you hear is the birds, you know? And they wake you up, and they sing everything you do. You can't understand what they're saying, but I do. 
[ Chuckles ] 
>> Narrator: Diontray jackson copes in segregation better than many other inmates. Perhaps it's due to an active imagination, even when it comes to jail food. 
>> Oh, man! Thank you. Thank you very much. See me get room service. Cornbread, rice. It's not something you want to eat, but you got to use your imagination with this, like I'm at ihop or something. 
[ Laughs ] o'charley's or something. You know, you got to make the best of the crap. Mind over matter. You know what I'm talking? Mind over everything. 
>> Narrator: Soon after jackson's segregation time is complete, he will leave the jail altogether and serve the rest of his sentence in a home-incarceration program, where he will be back with the woman he loves. 

[00:48:02]


>> You got somebody as beautiful as her, it's like finding a diamond for the first time in your life. And I finally found my diamond. All the other ones was decoys, preparing me for the real thing, you know? So when you finally get somebody you really love, you got to take care of that person. 
>> While jackson feels lucky in love, brian voltz found himself locked up over it. Though he denies harming the mother of his 2-year-old son, he is nearing the end of a 6-month sentence for domestic abuse. 
>> We did have an argument. We did have a dispute. But it was never to the degree that it was made out to be. 
>> Narrator: During his time in jail, voltz has maintained a relationship with the woman he's accused of abusing. 
>> I need her to put money on my books. I need her to bring my child to see me. I need her to do things. 
>> Narrator: But soon voltz will be able to do more for himself. He is about to transfer from the main jail to a work-release facility, where he can spend his days back in his tattoo shop. 
>> Jailhouse business card. You feel me? Body tags tattoos. I make jailhouse business cards and pass out my information. Everybody in here can tell you where my shop is. Buy one, get one free for everybody in here. 
>> Is that right? 
>> Yeah. 
>> What's up? 9 times out of 10, when people get out of here, they're gonna come see me to get a tattoo. I mean, plus, I got a lifetime warranty on the work. 
>> Right there. 
>> Put it right there? 
>> Yeah. 
>> On the shoulder blade? 
>> That's where I want it to go. 
>> It don't go well with the bullet wounds in the front. 
>> That'll be good on your back. 
>> You're on the move. Let's pack it up. Okay, you're going to ccc. 
>> All right. 
>> Ccc... Letting him through. 
>> Love you, brother. 
>> Love you, too, boy. 
>> Reach out. 
>> For sure. 
>> I'm gonna catch up with you, man. All right. 
[ Both laugh ] 

[00:50:08]


>> Narrator: Voltz is transported two miles away to the jail's community corrections center, or ccc. 
>> Miss me? 
>> Did you miss us? 
>> Hell yeah. 
>> Obviously. You came back. 
>> I couldn't wait to get back. 
>> Narrator: The facility is not unlike the jail dorm voltz has just left. He will sleep here at night, but get to wear civilian clothing and go to preapproved locations during the day, such as his shop or out for medical treatments. But some things here are all too familiar to the jail he just left. 
>> Overcrowded. It's real overcrowded in jefferson county. Keep people locked up for bull[bleep] this is what you get. Every bunk in here filled up. You get people on the floor, on the boats. 
>> Overcrowded. It's real overcrowded in jefferson county. Keep people locked up for bull[bleep] this is what you get. Every bunk in here filled up. You get people on the floor, on the boats. Causes for high tension, and that's where a whole lot of aggression and aggravations come from. You know what I'm saying? But at the same time, it's a whole lot better. 
>> Narrator: Coming up... 
>> Back to the streets. I got my swag back. 
>> Narrator: Brian voltz is back slinging ink... 
>> Bop! 
>> Oh! [ Laughs ] 
>> Narrator: ...And back with the woman who filed charges against him for domestic abuse. 

[00:53:45]


>> Narrator: Except for trips to or from court, inmates at the louisville metro department of corrections jail rarely spend time outdoors. 
>> These guys get very little access to outside, to fresh air or anything like that. There are little windows in their housing areas or in their cells, like on the single cells. That's what they get. That's what they see. There is no outside recreation at all. 
>> Narrator: Diontray jackson is about to step outside for the first time in three months. 
>> [ Laughs ] take a hot bath, eat real good, then make long love. That's it. Then sleep like a baby with the music on. 
>> Narrator: Jackson will also his jail-issued scrubs for the clothes he was wearing when he was booked into louisville metro. A few days earlier, his judge allowem to finish his sentence under home incarceration as long as he agrees to participate in a drug-rehabilitation program. But before he leaves, he must be fitted with a special ankle bracelet. 

[00:55:53]


>> Taking your shoes off. 
>> Where are your shoes? 
>> I gave them away. That's what we do when we leave jail. We leave someone else our shoes. That's just tradition. 
>> You can take a bath in these things, okay? 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Completely waterproof. H.I.P.'S pretty simple. We got three rules, okay? No drinking, no drugs, and stay in the house. Okay? If you go outside the house, this ankle's gonna tell us, okay, and we're gonna be up at your house, finding out what's going on, all right? Follow your schedule, okay? If you got a job where you leave at 9:00, be back at 5:00. Make sure you follow that schedule, okay? If you don't follow that schedule, it's gonna send an alert to us, and we're gonna call you and find out where you're at, okay? 
>> All right. 
>> So make sure you do not leave your house without permission or without a schedule, okay? 
>> Okay. 
>> You got any questions? 
>> Mnh-mnh. 
>> All right. Let's get you out of here then. 
>> I'm feeling good -- good to be free. You know, get to go home, see my kids, get some money, you know, make love. Yes! Yeah, I mean, it's hot as a mother[bleep] out here. You can tell I got locked up in the wintertime. 
>> Narrator: Brian voltz is spending more time outdoors, as well, now that he's qualified for the jail's work-release program. 
>> I'm back to the streets. I got my swag back. I mean, it just makes you feel less captive, less like an animal. You know what I'm saying? 
>> Narrator: Voltz still spends his nights incarcerated, but is free to leave during the day to go to work at his louisville tattoo studio. This is body tags. This is my heart and soul. 
>> Hey. 
>> You ready? 
>> I'm ready. 
>> What's up? 
>> This is what I love doing. I love tattooing. I love the fact that, you know, we got our shop going, and it is what it is. 
>> Tattooing's like riding a bike. I mean, it comes back naturally. You know what I'm saying? I've been tattooing probably an average of three people a day, so I'm doing all right. Bop! 

[00:58:04]


>> Oh! [ Laughs ] 
>> you know you got the lifetime warranty, too? 
>> I better have one. 
>> Narrator: Though voltz' professional life is back on track, he still has some personal relationships that require attention. 
>> Yeah, it's my baby. 
>> Narrator: Alicia russ is the mother of voltz's 2-year-old son, brian ii, or deuce. She is also the victim of his last criminal act -- domestic abuse. 
>> He had a physical altercation with me, and it just landed him in jail. But it's a blessing in disguise, because now he can't experiment with nothing, except for tattoos 
[chuckles] and he's sober, and he's happy. I mean, I got the man that I met back, you know?

=======================================================

>>> Right now we're going to call the sergeant, let them know what's going on. And there's urine coming up the floor. 
>> Recently sentenced to prison, a troubled, young inmate attempts to make a final impression on staff. 
>> Why can't you ask like you have some sense? 
>> Another inmate acts out in order to achieve a very different goal. 
>> I'd rather be someone for myself where I can focus on getting out, traveling to get my life back together. 
>> She didn't -- she's not going to say dada first, she's going to say mom. 
>> A young woman who gave birth in jail now sees her baby grow up without her. 
>> You've got to be innovative. 
>> And an inmate with an arsenal of talent -- 
>> we've got one here says "louisville." 
>> -- Faces 25 years to life. 
>> But it's all good, because one day I'll be back in the block with a sack full of green, I'll be packing a block. ???????????? 
>>> welcome to the streets, louisville, kentucky. 
>> On any given day, the louisville metro department of corrections jail holds about 2,300 men and women whose lives have reached a significant crossroads and whose futures are anything but certain. Though angela griffin says they're all crystal clear to her. 
>> Put this right here, put it in your heart, you know, like really concentrate. I mean, if not, you've got to focus, really believe in what you want to hear about. Take that in your heart and shuffle these three times. 

[00:02:03]


>> Thanks. 
>> Thank you. 
>> You know that's how I get my hustle on, it's how I eat. 
>> Griffin, who was recently sentenced to five years for theft and promoting contraband, has resolved to playing cards to read inmates' fortunes. 
>> All right, this is a travel card or something, but this is ten weeks, ten months, ten days, ten years, or it could represent the tenth month, which is october. Usually, the girls that have commissary, they know that i don't get a whole lot, so they'll offer me chips, crackers, pops, sometimes for soap, sometimes for shampoo, whatever I need at the time. But basically, this is my hustle. I love to do it. And all the girls say that I'm right on point when I do it. 
>> As a sentenced inmate, griffin is in the minority at louisville metro. 
>> All right, you're on the money. 
>> That's pretty awesome. 
>> All right. 
>> Next. 
>> Thank you. Who's next? 
>> Next! 
>> Most others here are only charged with crimes and are awaiting trial or the resolution of their cases. Brian sauer has been here for the past 15 months, facing charges of burglary and fleeing or evading police, to which he has pled not guilty. Because of several prior convictions, he now faces a sentence as high as 25 years to life if he's found guilty. 
>> Sophisticated? Eloquent, articulate. 
>> He says, if nothing else, jail has helped his vocabulary. 
>> I got tired of going to courts and stuff and the judges and the prosecutors using words that I was oblivious to, so i would go back to my cell, look up the words or have somebody look them up for me and just implement them into my vocabulary. I probably implemented 750 words just in the year that I've been here, but we're talking about ultrasophisticated words. My vocabulary is astronomical, no, it's phenomenal. Some people say I'm a pretty intriguing guy. They say I'm meig natick. Obviously, scrabble doesn't have enough letters for words I like to use. What the hell is an otter? 
>> Otter is an animal. 

[00:04:03]


>> It is? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Ain't never heard of no otter. I don't know [ bleep ] otter. I don't know everything. Pretty much off and on for the last 14 years, I've been in and out of prison. I come from a good background. Six brothers and sisters. WENT TO SCHOOL, MADE STRAIGHT As For the longest time, but i dropped out in the tenth grade, and that's when I veered off into the wrong crowd, selling drugs, stuff like that. 
>> Sauer says he's earned his ged in prison, but that doesn't make up for all he's lost while behind bars. 
>> You've got to go all the way down. My mom passed away, my dad passing away. They took my kids, adopted my kids out. So I've been through a lot the last 14 years, and here I am back in the same situation, square one. But it's all good, because one day I'll be back on the block with a sack full of green and I'll be packing a block. They can take my freedom, never attack my thoughts, most people couldn't follow me in the tracks I walk. I'm really being into music, i guess that's why I've got the music notes on my face and my hands. You know, I try to write a lot about my life, because you know what I'm saying, music is the soundtrack of your life. I really don't talk about anything I've never been through, I try not to fabricate anything. My dad was musically inclined. I kind of got my music aspirations from my father. Just one day, I just started writing poems and I just seen that I had a hidden aptitude. I try to convey my feelings and transcribe them on paper, but i ain't never really been out of here long enough to apply myself on the streets. I'm trying to be the most eloquent rapper that the world has ever captured. 

[00:06:17]


>> Sauer's interests have helped him stay out of trouble here. That has not been the case for 20-year-old joshua schilling. 
[ Bleep ] schilling is housed in a single-person segregation cell. Officers have just shut the water off to his sink and toilet after he threatened to flood the walkway. 
>> So, right now we're going to call the sergeant and let them know what's going on. And there's urine coming up the floor. You all may want to step back. 
>> Have a seat on your bunk. Have a seat on your bunk. Don't move. Sit down. 
>> Is there a reason why you're doing this, schilling? 
>> Police. 
>> Who? 
>> Police, I'm mad at the police. 
>> Well, we're not the police, so. 
>> Y'all are the police. 
>> Schilling was recently sentenced to 15 years for multiple felonies, including assault, and is awaiting transfer to prison. 
>> What is wrong with you? Why all of a sudden do you want to start acting a fool, start flooding the walls and -- 
>> I didn't flood the wall. 
>> There was water all over the floor. 
>> They were going to cut it off, so I grabbed the cup. 
>> Because you're flooding my wall. 
>> I wasn't flooding. 
>> You do this all the time. I'm not putting up with it. 
>> During schilling's 11-month stay at louisville metro, he has been anything but a model inmate. 
>> He's very childish, got a middle schooler's kind of attitude. Every time he wants attention, that's how he acts out. 
[ Inaudible ] 
>> do you feel better now? He's standing up on the bench in here kicking my door. 
>> Put them tighter, even tighter. I ain't going to worry about that [ bleep ]. 
>> It disrupts the entire wall. You get one person started, the other person started. The other inmates, whether they're trying to make a phone call, read, concentrate, whatever it just, you know, they all kind of start acting out the same thing. 
>> Got to take these off. 
>> So, usually one starts acting out, we try and remove them from that situation as quick as possible because we know what's going to happen with the other ones. 

[00:08:20]


>> Still kick like this. 
>> Now I'm going to -- 
>> why do you insist on making things hard? 
>> I'm just playing. 
>> Stand up. 
>> We're not playing. We're done playing. 
>> Stand up. 
>> I can still kick them to the back, too. 
>> We're done playing. 
>> All right. 
>> Because I'm going to take everything you've got, okay? Are you good with that? 
>> Yeah, that's fine. 
>> Good. 
>> I can still kick like this. 
>> Mr. Schilling, let me ask you something, is this really all about attention? 
>> No, it's not about no attention -- 
>> yeah, it is. 
>> I'm just bored. 
>> It's about attention, because you've been bored all week. 
>> I ain't trying to get no attention. I've been bored. I ain't trying to get no attention. 
>> Eventually, you've got to grow up. That's not the way to get what you want. 
>> Yeah, right. 
>> I can put them right back in the front. 
>> Some bull [ bleep ], man. That's all it is. This ain't nothing but a waiting game. 
>>> Coming up. 
>> Inmate schilling got 60 days on this write-up. 
>> Joshua schilling gets some discipline. 
>> You know what recidivism is? 
>> No. 
>> And some advice. 
>> You're only 20 years old, man. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Don't fall into this trap. 
>>> But first -- 
>> I probably started using methadone and cocaine together when I was about 6 1/2 months pregnant. 
>> After giving birth in jail, an inmate struggles with being an absentee mom. 
>> He said last night that she actually said her first words, which was dada. It wasn't mom, which kind of sucks. ???????????? ?????? look at me now, I've lost some hair, my heart grown cold, the pain inside from the tears I've cried, I can't let go ?????? ?????? look at me now, doing time, cell is now my home ?????? ?????? I can't go back, changed my life, losing all control ?????? ?????? look at me now ?????? ???????????? 

[00:13:48]


>> it's hot. 
>> Brian sauer is just one of many aspiring musicians at the corrections jail. ?????? I cry and dream at night and wish I didn't leave this life ?????? ?????? they try to send me to a bone trip, vacation, a strip ?????? 
>> the themes of their songs and raps are often based on pain and suffering. ?????? A lot of ass-whoopings ?????? 
>> but some, like sauer, hope to sing a different tune the next time they're released. ?????? I know there's more to life than this, and damn, I miss my wife and kids ?????? ?????? was a sad day when they took my life away ?????? 
>> you know, I want to live a normal life, you know what I'm saying? I've got a good girl on my side. She's there for me, sends me money, phone calls, letters, cards, things of that nature, visits, you know what I'm saying, the things, the small things that are important in places like this. It's going to be tough for me out there, you know what I'm saying, because I don't want to have the stuff like with the tattoos on my face and it's going to be hard for me to find a job, but whatever's necessary for me to do. I'm tired of being in the system, but I don't know where i see myself 5, 10, 15 years from now, hopefully not in prison. Maybe I have a couple more kids with my fiancee. She's looking forward to that, living a normal life. 
>> His incarcerations have already cost him custody two of children from a prior relationship. 
>> The state of kentucky involuntarily took away my parental rights to my children, which is a hard pill to swallow. Haven't seen them in four years now. 
>> Sauer's not alone when it comes to missing children on the outside. 
>> Okay, you've got a strong relationship, all right, but you're worried about it. You've got a lot of worry about this relationship. Strong relationship coming up twice, and it's with somebody you love, so you're worried. It has more worry behind it, too. 

[00:16:00]


>> Patricia smith has definitely had some worries. She has two daughters, a 4-year-old and a 7-month-old with two different men. 
>> Shows him three times. 
>> Smith was given probation after pleading guilty to drug possession. When she entered a methadone clinic for treatment, things only got worse. 
>> I probably started using the methadone and cocaine together when I was about 6 1/2 months pregnant, trying to sneak around and do it without nobody knowing about it, but that didn't work out so well. 
>> Smith arrived at louisville metro eight months pregnant. 
>> It hit me that, yeah, I am eight, nine months pregnant, about to have a baby. What have I done to her? What is she going through? Make sure that you bring the baby on saturday so I can see her. 
>> When she went into labor, smith learned the realities of giving birth while incarcerated. 
>> They shackled me. I had the cuffs on my legs and my hands. I was handcuffed going into the hospital. They put me in a wheelchair while I did my paperwork, handcuffed to the wheelchair. And so, I was in there by myself with a bunch of strangers around me, you know, no family there. 
>> The baby, named jada, seemed healthy at birth. The next day, she began withdrawing off methadone and had to be put on morphine. 
>> Make sure she's not fussy. That way, you know, I can stay for the whole visit. 
>> Jada eventually recovered and now lives with her father. 
>> I can't believe I actually put this baby, who's innocent, had nothing to do with my problems, had nothing to do with any of my outside issues, through something like this. No, she's going to say dada first, she's not going to say mom. 
>> Because she violated parole through drug use, she will transfer to a state prison to complete her two-year sentence. 

[00:18:02]


>> It's kind of sad that i didn't get to hear her say her 
[ bleep ] first words. He said last night that she actually said her first words, which was dada, rather than mom, which kind of sucks. But, so, of course I missed that, and I'm sure there's more, there's more that's going to happen that I'm going to end up missing. Try to record the baby saying "dada" to you. At least I can hear that. Love you. Bye. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> I wish I was there. I mean, this freaking sucks. 
>> Close your eyes and tap your heels three times and you might get out.

[00:21:44]


>>> It's just how we live. 
>> Most of the 2,300 inmates at the louisville department of corrections live in dormitory housing units, where they're able to move around and socialize throughout the day. But those who break the rules can wind up in disciplinary segregation. 
>> This is our disciplinary segregation housing unit. The doors down here are solid. They have plexiglass on the windows so the inmates don't throw urine or feces, water, anything like that out on the staff or the work aides as they go through. You'll see the black-and-white striped jumpsuits, which represents disciplinary. These inmates only are allowed to have their legal work in their cell and a pencil. They get to come out one hour a day. They'll stay in their cells for 23 hours a day. They do not get visits, they do not go to the gym, they do not get any commissary or anything like that while they are doing disciplinary time. You'll hear the inmates refer to this as the ho. It tends to get a little loud and noisy. 
[ Inaudible ] 
>> sometimes they get bored, sometimes they act out. So, that's life in the ho. Business as usual. 
>> Come on, let's go. 
>> I almost got your back, man. 
>> All right. 
>> Why do I got to go for? 
>> Basically because you're running around and acting crazy. 
>> Y'all are lying, man. 
>> A lot of these guys, you've got to understand, they're locked up 23 hours a day, you know, and they get bored. 
>> Get your hands off me, man. 
>> Quit touching me, man. 
>> You know, I've seen guys flood because they're bored, bang on doors because they're bored, broke chairs because they're bored. 

[00:23:55]


>> It's just jail. 
>> Michael draper's recent behavior might also appear to be motivated by boredom. 
>> I was just playing, just acting ridiculous and acting silly and playing and stuff like that. 
>> Draper has been in jail for the past 17 months, awaiting trial on charges including domestic violence, unlawful imprisonment and fleeing or evading police. His behavior has resulted in him spending most of his time in segregation, but he says that's by design. 
>> I'd rather be somewhere by myself where I can focus on getting out and trying to get my life back together, and so that's why I'm here in ho, is because basically, I told them get me away from everybody. I need to get myself somewhere where I can get my head, focus on my case. 
>> Michael draper likes to manipulate his housing. He prefers to be in a single cell. Not common, but it happens with inmates that don't want to be in, what you'd say a chaos of a dorm, 30-man dorm, whether it's for reasons of fighting their case or just the solitude. But what he does is, when he's about to serve out his disciplinary, he'll create a situation where he gets written up internally, whether it be flooding, whether it'd be verbally abusive to an officer, create a situation where it warrants him getting written up, gets continuous disciplinary. 
>> Draper isn't the only inmate with a history of acting out in segregation. 
[ Bleep ] joshua schilling's recent outburst in his cell, which included banging on the door and flooding the hallway, prompted staff to remove him and place him in a holding cell, pending disciplinary action. 
>> Joshua schilling, he received a write-up for damaging departmental property, being disruptive, stopping of the plumbing -- that's flooding. Inmate schilling does that when he gets mad, I think it's 15 times in 12 months. Inmate schilling got 60 days on this write-up. 

[00:26:09]


>> With schilling about to leave for prison to start his 15-year sentence, one of the jail's veteran officers, lieutenant collins, hopes to get through to him so that he might some day learn from his mistakes. 
>> How old are you now? 20. 
>> You're 20 years old, man. You know, you continue down that path, it's just going to go back and forth. You're going to be in the system. And you know what recidivism is? 
>> No. 
>> It's just you keep coming back, keep coming back. But you're only 20 years old now, so you have an opportunity to get your mind right. You see what I'm saying? 
>> Yeah. 
>> You got any kids yet? 
>> No. 
>> You want some? 
>> Yeah. 
>> You want them to see you going in and out of jail your whole life? 
>> No. 
>> Well, it could follow you, but if you get a chance now to get your life back on track. You have opportunities left. You're only 20 years old, man. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Don't fall into this trap, all right? You've been in prison yet? 
>> No. 
>> You're going to see, man, it's big boy stuff. 
>> Yeah, but I'm a criminal, though. I can't -- I don't feel I can live out in the community because I'm a criminal. 
>> Well, why do you feel you can't change? 
>> Because it's easy, like easy money, so I get out there and try to -- I'm doing wrong -- 
>> to try to get easy money? 
>> Yeah, I can't seem to do right. 
>> Why don't you try getting a job and work up from the bottom? Sometimes you've got to start as a janitor to be president of that company, you know what I'm saying? 
>> Yeah. 
>> And you've got to suffer, and that's part of life's transition, turn into a man. You know everybody's good at something, right? Obviously, you told me you've been in the system since you were a juvenile, so you're not a good criminal. So you've got to do something better, all right? But you keep getting caught. Right here, you can change that. You're the only one with the ability to do that. You can't let these folks control you, you can't let me control you. You've got to do that. 
>> All right, man. 
>> All right, collins. 

[00:28:10]


>>> Coming up -- ?????? I get another letter from my granny the other day ?????? ?????? she says stuff's the same, ain't nothing changed around the way ?????? cccccc 

[00:32:20]


>>> you're limping right now. 
>> I'm not limping. 
>> You're limping! 
>> Hey, johnson! 
>> At the louisville department of corrections jail, many of the staff have been working together so long that they think of one another as family. And some of them actually are. 
>> Just to let you know, the new sanitation sheets that they're doing -- 
>> yeah? 
>> I got one today where you're not to fill anything out -- 
>> lieutenant DeJarnett and his younger brother, who's a sergeant, have been on staff together for nearly 14 years. 
>> And I'll make sure we get something before it becomes a bigger problem. 
>> The mentoring part's pretty much done. He did that, though. He took care of me early on in my career. He bought my first gun for me. I paid him back, but you know, he really helped me along with a lot of things, you know, helped me out immensely coming through academy, you know. Probably a big part of the reason that I was the honor grad out of the academy was because of what I knew coming in from him. We're pretty much equal footing now except for the rank thing, so. 
>> But when the brothers have a dispute about rank or anything else, there is one person they both like to call. 
>> I'm going to tell mom on you. Your shirt. 
>> It's tore off. Can't get any bars. Not like your lieutenant bars. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Call mom. 
>> Over in the disciplinary segregation unit, michael draper would like nothing more than to call his mom, but he has no ney on his inmate account with which to make a phone call. 

[00:34:29]


>> I ain't got no family with no time put on the phone. My family don't do that. They just do it old-school. ?????? Fighting for my life, fighting for my life, yeah ?????? 
>> draper might not get to speak to his family, but they often make their way into his music. ?????? Got another lettery from my granny the other day ?????? ?????? she says stuff's the same, ain't nothing changed around the way ?????? ?????? she said my kids are growing up, they asking where I am ?????? ?????? I'm sitting in my cell, can only think of them ?????? ?????? singing, oh, oh, oh, you got me singing oh, oh, granny, i miss you ?????? ?????? I got another letter from my mama the other day ?????? ?????? says she's working overtime for another place to stay ?????? ?????? bills are stacking up, a new problem every day ?????? ?????? I'm thinking in my mind, next time my mother stays in ?????? ?????? oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, mom, i miss you ?????? 
>> and draper recently received some troubling news about his mother. 
>> I got a letter from my grandmama saying my mama's sick, saying my mama "has been going to the doctor. She's afraid that something really bad is going on with her body, and I pray that it's not true." I don't know. That's why I'm really worried, because I don't know what it is. 
>> Draper has been known to act out in order to stay in segregation, but the news about his mother has made the isolation harder to take. 
>> It's a bad day. They say there ain't nothing to do but sit in here and think. 
>> Draper is due to be released from segregation in just days and placed back in general population, and thisime, he might just let it happen. 
>> Because I don't want to be sitting in here worrying about my mama because I'm really making it worse. I'm liable to snap out, catching whole new charges and all kind of crazy stuff. So, that's pretty muchhat I'm going to try to do, though, get my head together and do that. 
>> While draper copes with his mother's illness in jail, patricia smith has had to cope with being a mother in jail. She gave birth to her now 7-month-old daughter, jada, shortly after her arrival at louisville metro. 
>> Tell her. 
>> Today, jada and her father, jason, are schedulo visit. 
>> Today I get to see jada. I'm just excited to see her, see how big she's gotten. She actually said "dada" for the first time, so maybe I can get her to talk to me. 

[00:36:45]


>> And say what? 
>> And say maybe mommy. 
>> Visits, usually most inmates, you can get your mind off your problems just for a minute. Do you see mama? 
>> But it comes with limitations. At louisville metro, they are noncontact and are conducted through a video monitor and telephone. 
>> They don't actually have a face-to-face visit anymore. 
>> Why? 
>> Because we had a lot of problems with contraband in the place, you know. We would sit them on one side of the table and the visitors on the other side of the table. They would distract the officer for one reason or another, throw something under the table or throw it over the table, you know. So, we had a lot of problems with contraband, so we decided video visits was a whole lot better. 
>> The last time I saw jada, i tried to get her to look at me, but she was too busy trying to get the phone, so, she really didn't say much. Oh, there's my baby. Hey. 
>> What's up? 
>> Pick her up. I can't see her. She looks so cute! Let me talk to her. 
>> Jada. What are you doing? Say dada. 
>> Say hi to your mom. 
>> Say mommy! Oh, she's holding the phone. Were you holding the phone? 
>> It's like she's ready for conversation. 
>> Hi, baby. 
>> Look. 
>> Hi, baby. She's probably wondering where i am. 
>> Talking to mama? 
>> Yeah, she's so pretty. 
>> Show mom your tooth. See it? 
>> She's sticking her tongue out. So, she only has one tooth? 
>> Yeah, working on two. 
>> Smith is waiting transfer to prison to begin serving a two-year sentence for drug possession. On the bright side, kentucky state prisons allow for contact visitation, so smith will soon be able to hold jada. 
>> I wish I was there. 
>> Just close your eyes and tap your heels three times and you might be there. 
>> Shut up. 

[00:39:05]


>> On the other side. Ain't heard nothing on when you're being sent out? 
>> They don't tell you in here for security reasons when you're leaving. They just call your name and you go. This sucks. I wish I could hold her. We've got a minute left. Oh, let me talk to her again. Jada, mommy loves you. 
>> Who's that, mama? 
>> Love you. Make sure you record her walking and talking and stuff, so i won't miss it all. I love you guys. Put her up. 
>> It's kind of sad. Last time I touched jada, she didn't have any teeth, she wasn't talking, she wasn't crawling, she wasn't sitting up. 
>> Try to keep her where she still knows her mom, you know what I'm saying? Because she really ain't held her or nothing like that. Probably about a week total, like, that's it. So, I just try to keep it where she knows her. 
>> Visit wasn't long enough at all. Happy before and sad after. Because I feel like I'm going to lose all the baby years, you know? All the baby things are going to be gone. So, it's kind of sad. 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> got one here that says "louisville." 
>> -- Brian sauer becomes a jailhouse jeweler and michael draper finds trouble in general population. ?????? At the end of the rainbow, rainbow ?????? ?????? at the end of the rainbow, they tell him to go, ?????? ?????? tell him to go, listen, the day I cherish like now ?????? ?????? I'm trying to get back focused to fight trail ?????? 

[00:43:38]


>> though striking gold in the music industry is a long-shot under the best of circumstances, that doesn't stop inmates at the louisville metro department of corrections jail from displaying their talents. ?????? But one day, you know they say, at the end of the rainbow ?????? ?????? yeah, rainbow, at the end of the rainbow, they tell him it's gold, tell him it's gold ?????? 
>> over the years, you see talent from singing to rapping to artistry to general, I mean, just about every field you can think of. If given the rht path at an earlier stage, you know, could have been very successful at whatever they had done, but for whatever reason, it's turned out, you know, they've made choices that's landed them in here. Never too late to utilize that talent, but for some people, it becomes harder and harder when you're caught up in the system for someone to give you a chance. 
>> When brian sauer came to jail, he knew he had talent as a singer. ?????? Look at me now, I've lost some hair, watched my heart grow cold ?????? ?????? the tears inside, what I don't I can't let go, look at me now ?????? 
>> but in the time he's been at louisville metro, he's discovered a new talent. 
>> Got one here says "louisville." Gotta represent louisville, kentucky, where we're from. That's a pretty popular one throughout the jail. And I make -- these are smaller ones, actually. These are for, like, the girls. 
>> Sauer makes rings using a number of items he scrapes together in his dorm. He starts with a plastic deodorant bottle, some string pulled from his mattress. 
>> I'll take three of these strings here and braid them together, makes this right here. 
>> He uses the string to slice off the small, ring-shaped neck of the plastic bottle. 
>> Cut that off. 
>> Three for a dollar! 
>> I've got to pop that ball out of there. The ball's the hardest thing. I so pop that ball out, take the ring, file the ring down on the ground. 

[00:45:49]


>> Sauer uses plastic bags for the ring's outer coating. 
>> Take a strip of the garbage bag, take a couple bar of soap, tie it around there, put it on there. Spin it around. Then I stretch it. This is the string used to make the white. 
>> For lettering, he uses cellophane wrap from jail-issued sandwiches, and he creates dye by rubbing colored pencils on the floor and adding water. 
>> This one's green, could be light green. The less color you put, you could make them lighter colors, but you know, there's a certain way you weave it in there. It's a pretty tedious process, but you know, in jails, in prisons, we don't got nothing but time. 
>> It takes sauer about two hours to make one ring. 
>> It's a great time-passer. 
>> And a hustle, huh? 
>> And a hustle. Yeah, so, I sell them. Sometimes I'll sell them for $2, but sometimes I'll just sell them just for a noodle or a shot, you know what I'm saying? 
>> Inmates typically refer to the trades they do for snacks and favors as hustles and sauer is not new to having one. 
>> Another relationship. Another trip. 
>> Angela griffin's is foreign-telling. 
>> Whoo, there's some money on top of love. You've got some money coming with love, girl. Actually, they used to call me gypsy lady, like a long time ago. 
>> Griffin's latest customer, patricia smith, is awaiting transfer to prison for drug possession. No surprise to griffin. 

[00:47:59]


>> You're about to travel. Hopefully sooner than you want to. Here's your alternate love card. And then you have worry. 
>> Of course, all that worry. 
>> You're always worried. There's money on that journey, for some reason. There's that strong relationship. That's like the fourth -- 
>> oh, my god, that's crazy. 
>> That's like the fourth time it's popped up. Look. 
>> And marriage. 
>> And marriage, with a man who's worried about you. 
>> Jason, of course. 
>> Michael draper has a hustle as well. His involves the creative use of soap. 
>> I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is for real 
>> draper was recently returned to general population, where he has been busy making soap sculptures that he trades for commissary items or favors. 
>> Did this last night. This is soap. The brown stuff is coffee. The gray for the hairs and all that is strands of blanket. And the black stuff right here is like the soot and stuff in the windows, the black, sticky stuff. All this other material is just bars of soap, broken little pieces and stuff. 
>> In the short time he's been back in population, draper has traded his sculptures for envelopes to mail motions he's written to his judge. And since he has no money in his inmate account, he talked another inmate into making a phone call to his mother to check on her health. 
>> They called and said she said she was all right and she was doing okay now, but I didn't get to talk to her, but they said she's all right. 
>> Using jail-issued items for purposes other than for what they were intended is technically a rule violation, but when draper's confronted about it, he has a ready-made alibi. 
>> I'm ready to get in the shower right now, then. I'm going to go jump in the shower right now. 
>>> Coming up -- while one inmate leaves the jail behind, another returns to his home away from home. 
>> Left ad seg and went back to the dorm. Now he's back. It's a revolving cycle for draper. ???????????? Cccccc 

[00:53:03]


>>> an inmate's stay at the louisville metro department of corrections jail can range from mere hours to years, depending on the complexity of the charges. Some will leave here only to serve their sentences in state prison, but for many others, their last day on the inside is their first day of renewed freedom on the outside. Today is that day for farrah burleson. 
>> I'm going home. 
>> After how long? 
>> A long time, 543 days. Yes. Whoo! 
>> Yay! 
>> Oh. 
>> Aww. 
>> After violating probation and spending nearly two years in jail for stealing scrap metal to fund a drug habit, burleson now has a second chance. 
>> I have five years probation, which is going to be really hard because it's going to keep my nose to the grind. I'm going to finish college and go see my babies. I'm so excited. 
>> Yay. 
>> Among the dormmates burleson will leave behind is patricia smith. After a recent visit with her 7-month-old daughter, smith will soon leave the jail as well, but for a different reason. She's due to transfer to state prison any day now and copes the best she can. 
>> I like to sleep away my time because it seems like it makes the days go by a lot faster. I usually wake up around dinner time, which is about 4:00 or 4:30 and then eat, and then when I get done eating dinner, I'll try to call jason and talk to him, and then I'll come back here and put in my earplugs and just try to sleep. When I sleep, I'll have dreams, and sometimes nightmares about this place and about my girls, and that's probably the worst part about trying to sleep. To sleep is to try not to think about what's going on on the outside world because there's nothing I can do it. 
>> Others at louisville metro find their own ways to deep with that emptiness. For brian sauer and a few friends, it includes finding new ways to play old games. 

[00:55:11]


>> What are these? 
>> These are dominos made out of shower shoes. You've got to be innovative. 
>> This is what we made them out of. What we take a shower with. 
>> Tell me what do you do? 
>> You just take a little something and you cut little blocks out. You see how they are? 
>> You have to take a string out of a mattress. 
>> Yeah, because we ain't got no knives. 
>> There goes our board made out of a shower shoe. 
>> Who's going without shoes now, though? 
>> We try not to let people go without shoes, because it's nasty in that shower. 
>> While sauer enjoys dominos -- 
>> what I call a dominologist. 
>> It provides just an escape from more pressing concerns on his mind. He's facing charges of burglary and fleeing or evading police. 
>> The prosecutor made an offer of ten-year sentence in exchange for a guilty plea, but i declined his offer. 
>> Because he has two prior felony convictions for drug possession and theft, he could be looking at as much as 25 to life if convicted on his current charges. He is scheduled to go to trial in just days. 
>> I mean, I'm nervous about it, you know what I'm saying, even though I've been in these situations a thousand times over, but when you're leak at that amount of time, you're thinking 25 to life, not knowing what the outcome of, what the case is going to be, it's just, I guess it's just in the hands of god and -- 
>> the jury. 
>> The jury, actually, yeah. 
>> Even though he's faced with an uncertain four, sauer says there's one thought that keeps him going. 
>> I keep my mind fixated on the day that I get out, because i mean, there's nothing like the day you walk out of these doors, you know what I'm saying, and stepping back into society. It's just like a feeling of euphoria. You feel elated. It's like, weird, because life still evolves out there. You know what I'm saying. Two or three years, your k were 12 and 13 years old, when you get out, they're 16 and 17 years old with their own kids. It's like, damn, I have nieces and nephews that I've never seen in my life. So, it's like a trip for us to get readjusted back to society. 
>> That's a challenge michael draper would gladly take, but he's found it difficult to readjust to general population. 
>> What'd you do? 
>> He's now back in segregation. Draper would gladly take, but he's found it difficult to readjust to general population. 

[00:57:21]


>> What'd you do? 
>> He's now back in segregation. 
>> You can't remember this time? That much, huh? 
>> Disruptive behavior. 
>> Oh, disruptive behavior? What, beating -- 
>> yeah. 
>> I've known draper for -- he's been here 19 months. He doesn't follow rules very well. He was just in administrative seg not a month ago, and now he's back -- he left ad seg and went to a dorm, apparently, and got in trouble in a dorm and now he's back in disciplinary, and it's just a revolving cycle for draper. 
>> Can't deal with all the people in there. I like the peace. 
>> Uh huh. It's jail, man, come on. There's always somebody. 
>> Huh? 
>> There's always somebody. All right, well, good luck to you. Are you going back to court soon? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Are you getting out this time? 
>> I hope so. 
>> Uh huh, right. 
>> Draper has been working on his case most of the time he's been at louisville metro, and he's feeling pretty good about his chances. 
>> Said I might really beat this case. No witnesses showing up. I'm ready to go home, hopefully. 
>> And how is it you're going to beat it? 
>> Because there ain't no witnesses showing up. Can't find the witnesses, so. I'm going to go back. If you don't have the star witnesses, then you don't have nothing. It's basically your word against whoever else, and if there ain't nobody there, you can't cross examine nobody, so there's no case. 
>> Am I going to see you again? 
>> No. 
>> Right. 
>> Going to hand to me like that is this. 
>> No. 
>> I'm going see you again, but I'm going to see you at walmart. 
>> Walmart? 
>> Yeah, all right. 
>> Take it easy. 
>> See you, draper. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Even if he gets out, I'll see him again. A lot of these guy, I don't mean anything negative about it, but this is what they know. They come to jail, they get out, come to jail, they get out. Very rarely will they do something the right path, i guess you could say. It's just a lifestyle choice that they make.

>>> Due to mature subject matter, viewer discretion is advised. 
>> Why did you hit an officer? 
>> We have now been dispatched.

>> How many times did you shoot him? 
>> Ten, 12 times, you know, it is horrible, I is very traumatic. 
>> An eighteen-year-old shoots her father to death. 
>> When she walks in, she was scared, shaken, I took care of her, showed her the ropes. 
>> You're just going to have to take my word for it. 
>> Somebody has threatened to flood the walk. 
>> Another inmate, not normally known for trouble, issues a vile threat. And two other inmates provide a cautionary tale for fathers and sons everywhere. 
>> I was out when you were seven. 
>> You called another man daddy, so I'm saying who was supposed to be getting mad? 
>>> In downtown louisville, kentucky, two adjoining victims serve as the criminal justice center, housing both the courts and the just system. On any given day, about 100 men are incarcerated here. Most have been only accused of crimes and are waiting for trials, for tresolution. It can be a tense time. 

[00:02:15]


>> Here in this facility you're looking at a couple of officer assaults a month. That is jail-wide. You try to train your people to be prepared to deal with any type of situation that comes up. Any day you come to work, you put yourself at risk. 
>> Today is one of those notice. 
>> We have had an officer get assaulted up on the fourth floor. They had the inmate under control and placing him in a chair. 
>> Officer used pepper spray to secure him, he will remain strapped into the restraint chair for up to two hours until officers feel it is safe to return him to his cell. 
>> It is the second assault in a week on that floor. Inmate to officer. 
>> So that dorm has a lot of young and aggressive inmates. 
>> You all right? 
>> I'm good. I was putting two guys coming back from gym in there, soon as head. 
>> It's good now, my knee, but other than that I'm fine. 
>> What is going on with you and the officer? 
>> Nothing. 
>> Well, why did you hit an officer? 
>> Just walked through y'all's dorm, and everything seemed to be going fine. And then the officer goes through the dorm, and as soon as the door opens up you hit one, I'm trying to figure out why. 
>> What is that -- 
>> just left. 
>> It is part of the job. 

[00:04:16]


>> During the assault, several inmates in white storm try to rush the door, which staff view as an escape attempt. 
>> The dorm on camera was observed, several of them covering their faces, picking up what could be a weapon possibly. So we have activated the team. 
>> It is the special operation's response team. 
>> Wait for the phone call. 
>> All right. 
>> Every situation is different, the biggest concerns and threats right now is we don't know who was involved, we don't know what they have. This is just too many involved. So we were going to use whatever manpower we have, this has to be done fast and safe. They're going to get in their full gear, body armor, guest. In this going to take the m-k nine oc container, for crowd control. We'll take cuffs, due to the number of them. The taser shield. 
>> Because of the potential to lose control of the floor, it is a very dangerous situation. 
>> Stand by. 
>> What we're going to do is go in, identify who we can from the dvr. We're going to go in, order them all on the ground, anybody that doesn't want to comply with the orders we know that that is where our attention needs to be focused at. 
>> Due to safety concerns, the sort team would not permit us to enter the door, but we were able to shoot the control of the raid monitors. 
>> They're flexi cuffing all the inmates on the ground. They're searching them all, until they're face down on to ground. They will stay in that area until they complete the search of the dorm. 

[00:06:27]


>> With the air secured, our crew is allowed back inside. 
>> We are going to look at the dvr, make sure that the main perpetrators -- 
>> once they shake down the entire door, they're going to make sure the ring leaders of the cell, they will be returned to administrative segregation, and not be allowed to return to that dorm. 
>> Now they got us laid out -- 
>> it ain't right, for real. 
>> That is how I feel. 
>> These inmates are obviously still agitated, but as of right now everything has gone the way we planned it. 
>> Officers have removed a number of inmates they suspect have rushed the door, to isolate them in the prison cells in administrative segregation for further questioning. The inmates remaining in the dorm are placed on 24-hour lockdown. Among them is brian edmond, sr. 
>> I just had a rough life, my whole thirty-six years of living. I was doing good in school, i PLAYED BASKETBALL, As AND Bs, And chose the wrong route. This is where it landed me. 
>> Mr. Brian edmond sr., assisting a felony. 
>> Having been sentenced, edmonds now awaits transfer to prison, a place he is familiar with. He has been there on three separate occasions, serving a total of 14 years. 
>> Tired of being in this jail. Can't wait to get away from her. Go to my next phase so you can get ready, get my appeal done. 

[00:08:31]


>> Although no stranger to prison, he does find himself in unusual circumstances here. Housed in a cell on another floor at the jail is his eighteen-year-old son, brian edmonds, jr. 
>> He don't have a close relationship, because I have been locked up on and off. So I have never been there through him growing up. He knows I love him, he loves me. But we ain't really had no father and son relationship. It was more like a friendship. And if they was to convict him of it, the blame would be on me. Because I ain't never been there. You know what I'm saying? I would take his charge if they were to let me. I would do his time, because i don't want to see him go through nothing like this. 
>> Coming up. 
>> So then you were following in your father's foot steps? 
>> I don't even know him to follow his footsteps, I get a fended when people say that.

[00:12:58]


>>> At the louisville metro department of corrections jail, every staff person is aware that violence can break out any time. And sometimes it will be directed at them. The latest assault occurred when markel white punched an officer as he entered the housing unit. 
>> He basically sucker punched an officer as he came in the door, which resulted in other disturbances in the dorm. 
>> White, who is currently there waiting for trial for murder, has been put in a segregation cell, and put on high status, the highest destination for a cell. He will be locked up for now, 24 hours a day, lose all of his privileges and have little more to do than sleep. 
>> What did you do to the officer? 
>> I hit him. I hit him. At the end of the day I came out -- 
[ bleep ] up. What is that called? Restraints. 
>> Let me talk to you real quick, all right? What is going on, white? I want to talk to you a little bit about what happened last night. 
>> I just got fed up. 
>> So what are you feeling like today? 
>> I'm feeling good. 
>> You know your discipline officer will see you in a couple of days. And because of that, I'll be by to see you and we'll be reviewing you, depending on your actions for two or three weeks, depending on the sort status, all right, well, I'll be talking to you. 
>> All right. 
>> White says he lashed out at the officer because he felt disrespected. 
>> I hate getting handled like a little boy. And I hate being disrespected. 
>> How do you feel you were disrespected? 

[00:15:03]


>> For them to just talk to me any kind of way, but I showed them the utmost respect. I talk to them in a mannerable way, and they don't talk to me -- it is just a lot of little things and I just got fed up with it. 
>> Could you ever foresee doing that again? 
>> No one knows what the future holds. 
>> The future is cloudy for edmonds, as well. 
>> I try to calm down from fighting as much. But a lot of times your hands get forced. You got too many chiefs, not enough indians, if you know what I mean. I need a different environment. That is why I am always fighting, and people always want that drama with me. 
>> It is the kind of drama the jail doesn't want. Staff has compiled a list of keep-froms, or inmates that must be kept away from edmonds jr. This list of potential enemies makes it hard for the jail to house him. 
>> Brian edmonds, he was recently put on ad-minseg. 
>> It is junior. 
>> Once a month, they continue to conduct a meeting to discuss the inmates housed throughout the jail. 
>> The purpose of this meeting is to make sure we have the right people in the single cells. Single cells is a premium up item in the department. 
>> Edmonds has continual behavior issues. 
>> Do we need to get him evaluated, from a mental health standpoint? 
>> You can, but he is more behavioral. 
>> Well, do it anyway, see what you come up with. 

[00:17:03]


>> Edmonds junior says his thoughts are mostly what brought him here. He is charged with two counts of murder, to which he has pled not guilty. 
>> I am just going to say, I'm facing the death penalty, fighting for my life. I am nothing but eighteen, they're trying to take my life. And I done had a rough life. You know, growing up in projects. I ain't really had a stable home for real, bouncing all over the city. The streets raised me. They say experience is life's greatest teacher, and that is what I had to learn from. I ain't really had no role models, nobody to actually try to guide me the opposite way. And now I'm in here, caged in. 
>> There is no telling if the presence of a role model could have prevented edmonds ending up in jail for his current charges. But his father in jail ends up an open wound, one made more painful where his father resides. 
>> My daddy is upstairs on the fourth floor. He just got thirty years. He been in the penitentiary all my life. 
>> So then you're following in your father's footsteps? 
>> I don't even know him to follow in his footsteps, I get offended when people say that. I got to know him, meet him. I was already out running in the projects. I don't deal with him. It is too late to turn back. Ain't nothing he can do to change my circumstances, but stay the hell out of my face. I take full responsibility, i don't say my daddy would have raised me different because it is what it is. I am going to take responsibility for any position that I put myself in. I feel like in order for me to better myself I got to look at it like it is my fault. And I feel like that is going to help me develop into a man, you know, not just no man by age, but -- a man. 
>> Coming up. 

[00:19:04]


>> Ain't got to go through this. 
>> I don't give a -- 
>> the edmonds, struggle to reconcile the past and what could be the final meeting of their lives. But first, a vulnerable young inmate encounters a surrogate mom. 
>> I just show her what to look for, I mean there is lesbian activity that goes on. 

[00:22:24]


>>> At the louisville metro department of corrections, it is rarely quiet. The new from all over the city and county are brought here for booking. While most will bond out, many others will be detained in jail, indefinitely, until their charges are met. Hours earlier, eighteen-year-old dale karmak became one of the youngest inmates. Her original conviction was second degree manslaughter. Two years earlier, she killed her father. 
>> I just remember you know, grabbing the gun. And I just pointed it. Aimed it right at his head. You know, yes, my intentions were to kill him. So at that moment, I shot him multiple times in the back of the head. I know it is hard for some people to grasp, but when you're in fear for your life, up against the wall, there is no telling what you would do. 
>> Karmak lived alone with her father, according to reporting, there was abuse in the home. >>Couple of nights earlier, we get in an argument, he blacks my face, bloodies my eyes, blacks my nose, finally, I'm shaking. 
>> Karmak says when the abuse continued the next morning, she picked up the gun, shot him in the head as he sat on the couch. 
>> How many times did you shoot him? 
>> Ten or 12 times, it is horrifying, very traumatic. It is something I dream about. I have to live with it for the rest of my life. 
>> Karmak says not all memories are negative. 
>> My dad would take me out to ples, go to movies. He took me to concerts. Because that is one thing we did get along about. Ac-dc is our band. He introduced me to it. I have been listening to it the day I was born. He used to bounce me around on my mom's stomach, with the radio turned up. I loved him, he was my father, that is who he is, and I'll always love him and miss him. 

[00:24:48]


>> Several hours after the shooting karmak turned herself into police, originally charged with murder she eventually pled to second degree manslaughter and was sentenced to eight years in prison. She spent the years in a detention facility and was released to the halfway house. Karmak violated her probation because she did medication. 
>> I told my probation officer i stopped taking the medication, because it wasn't helping. The probation officer put the cuffs on me. It is not that I refused to take the medication, I would have taken my medication if I knew all of this was going to happen. 
>> The judge will eventually review the matter and could send karmak to an adult prison to serve the sentence. Louisville metro marks her first time in an adult facility. 
>> What are you reading? 
>> A handbook. 
>> A fact that has not been lost on sherry, who is helping karmak adjust on her first day in jail. 
>> When she walked in, she was shaken, so I just immediately grabbed her and stayed up with her last night. I've been staying up with her, showing her the ropes. 
>> And my case right now, I need to trust somebody. Because I feel like I got nobody, I just got myself. And I know in jail, it is not the ideal place to trust somebody, because they're out for themselves. That is where I met sherry. 
>> She is serving one year for failure to pay child support and is waiting for trial on a variety of drug-related charges to which she has pled not guilty. 
>> You hit one five times. You wait, there will be a pause, it will tell you what to do. Okay? You can find out your comissary information. 

[00:26:49]


>> I have been in jail numerous times. Unfortunately, I know the ropes. That is not something I'm proud of. 
>> We'll have to get you a new brass. 
>> Come on. 
>> I'm going to need to talk to you. 
>> They could charge you with escape. You don't want to go to the hole, honey. She needs a new bracelet. Hers tore, and she is having to carry it around and I don't want to get her in trouble. 
>> Okay, I'll take care of it. 
>> Thank you, I got six girls, five boys, I can imagine him walking in here, he would have the same look probably as she did. 
>> Oh, I know it. Today is -- I wanted to show her immediately what to look for. I mean, there is lesbian activity that goes on. The more experienced women taking advantage of a naive girl. 
>> I am going to be the devil's advocate, how do we know that you're not going to prey on a young girl? 
>> You just have to take my word for it. I am not going to prey upon the young and naive, trying to help her. I think god put it in my heart to. Now, whatever you do, don't take this off for anything. Because you can get in a lot of trouble. Let's get you ready for a shower. 
>> Coming up. 
>> There are a lot of people hating on you, they say you need to chill out. 
>> New tensions threaten the relationship between sherry. 
>> I don't know if I can continue to trust her or not, because of all that was said. 
>> Threatening to throw urine on us.

>>> Here is what is happening, a fire broke out at a state department in washington today, leaving three people seriously hurt. Crews were apparently working in the building at the time. 
>>> In store sales for black friday were down 1.8% for last year, but on-line sales were up more than 20%. 
>>> And oregon firefighters had to save a man after he crashed his truck through a guard rail. The vehicle was left hanging over the rail, police believe that alcohol was a factor. Back to "lock-up". 
>> Due to mature subject, viewer discretion is advised. 
>> On any given day, staff at the louisville corrections department know that any day can see disturbance to warrant a response. Today it is in the segregation unit. 
>> Somebody has threatened to flood the wall because he didn't get an additional tray at chow, even though he is not medically ordered to have one. He is threatening to throw urine on us. 
>> When officers arrive at his cell, the inmate complies with orders. 
>> There you go. Roll the door. 
>> So we're going to move him to a quieter location, he will be in there by myself, he won't have any access to throw urine or whatever on the officers. 
>> This is why we're doing this. There is a cup of urine right there. 
>> The officer came in, and he said I got something for you. Filled up a full cup of urine, he said I'm going to throw it on you. 
>> Is that unusual that he actually warned the officer he would throw the urine on him? 
>> No, but the problem can be when the warning is not taken seriously. You got the option of them saying well, I told you I was going to do it. Proactively on this one worked out better for everyone. 

[00:33:55]


>> The inmate who made the threats, anthony kimbley, had made the threats two weeks earlier as the inmate launched the assault. Kimbley was reported to be among the inmates, up until then he was regarded to be a model inmate. 
>> He never caused problems. Just chilled out. 
>> He is going through some personal issues, he says. So he said he is going to be quiet the rest of the night for you. 
>> Good, that is what we need. 
>> We'll see. 
>> Kimbley is currently in jail waiting for trial for murder, and has pled not guilty. But lately he has been dealing with another death. 
>> I am dealing with a loss right now. You know, my daddy died. I feel like everything is ending. 
>> How did your father die? 
>> He got smoked, he got smoked, man, but it was last wednesday. And my dad didn't have a serious relationship, like a real bond. He had other kids he took care of. You know, he ain't never been able to take care of me. But at the same time I ain't holding that against him. I still got love for him. He ain't nothing but thirty-eight, nine years old. I got nothing against him. 
>> But staff can take that into consideration before making the decision. Markel white was given 60 days in segregation, he lost all privileges including gym and visitation. He is on day fourteen of his stay. 
>> How has it been going in here? 
>> It is all right, man, all right sometimes. Sometimes it is all right. It is stressful, not being out there, you know what I mean. What I really learned is I need to get out there to my son. That is the only thing that is really stressing me out. Because I want to seriously be a father figure. Because I know what it feels like not 206 -- to have a father, I don't want to send him through the same thing. 

[00:36:07]


>> You didn't have a father? 
>> I had one, but in and out. Right now I'm following in his foot steps. 
>> When is the last time you actually got to touch your child? 
>> I ain't. 
>> You never touched your child? 
>> Huh-uh, so I am tying to stay sean, trying to calm down. 
>> It has been several months since brian edmonds has touched or spoken to his son, brian jr., who is incarcerated a floor below him. 
>> When he first got locked up, we used to come out and visit together. But we had an argument, and they put keep-aways on us. So I just want him to know that I'm sorry that I ain't ever been there, because I know that is the reason why he is going through what he is going through. So I'm basically apologizing for not being there. 
>> The two men may not have much time to reconcile. Edmonds jr. Is about to leave the jail to serve a 30-year sentence. Edmonds jr. Could get the death penalty if found guilty. When told of his faer's apology, he was surprised. 
>> It is just something hard for me to believe. I will be nineteen this year, that is the most mature part i ever heard my daddy said. I ain't never heard him take responsibility. That is unbelievable, that is a major move in his life. Making me feel like he do kind of give a darn right now. I would just love to hear him say man, I blame myself for what you're going through. I don't know, I guess it wouldn't change -- wouldn't change how I look at things. I would really make me get rid of a bunch of h -- hatred that I have in my heart. 
>> And coming up, a different sort of parentual relationshipto. Only citi price rewind automatically searches for the lowest price. And if it finds one, you get refunded the difference. Just use your citi card and register your purchase online. Have a super sparkly day! Ok.

>>> Jail ladies, make sure you have those arm bands, please. 
>> The louisville metro department of corrections jail is the first adult facility that eighteen-year-old danielle karmak has ever faced. She is charged with murder, killing her father. She is in jail now for a parole violation and has come to rely on sherry lechte for guidance. 
>> They're going to bring you another sandwich, but you can start on this. 
>> I'm good, you can eat this. 
>> I'm good. 
>> You're starving. 
>> But recently, the relationship is strained. Lechte believes that karmak is making a mistake by revealing details to other inmates. 
>> Which we need to discuss that, danielle, I told you you need to stop talking about your charges, I got up, eating, you were still talking about your charges. 
>> I feel like it is kind of my business. And I'm grown. Like I'm eighteen, I mean, i know it is still young. I kind of see you're trying to look out for me. But -- 
>> I'm going to tell you right now there is a lot of people in here, and I'm talking about a lot of people that are hating on me, and your case. And they're saying they're tired of hearing about it. They're saying you're changing your story, I mean, this is not the place. When I -- I'm telling you, you know, you need to -- realize that. This ain't little kid juvenile place. This is big girls. It is time you grew up. They will use this stuff against you, trust me. 
>> It happens in here, so -- people are not going to like the fact that you killed your father. 
>> They don't understand. 
>> You know what I'm saying? It is between you and god. I'm just an inmate, you don't have to convince me and you don't have to convince anybody in here. 

[00:43:38]


>> Like I told you, I am not my charge -- you have to get to know me, it is like saying judge me and I'll prove you wrong. Because I am not my charge, by no means at all. 
>> Well, I can see that. But I'm not everybody in here. 
>> I know. 
>> There is a lot of people hating on you, saying you need to chill out, okay? 
>> Okay? 
>> Eat. I think mainly what it is, is people are not liking the fact that she killed her father, and finding it -- don't get me wrong, danielle, because i love you with all of my heart. She is finding it easy to talk about. If I shot my dad ten times in my head and there is more to it than she has told me, if it is true, I couldn't sit here calmly and talk to you or anybody else. Couldn't do it. But, she is -- I'm not her. I didn't experience it. And I hope to god I never do. But that is why they're hating on her, trying to figure out how she can sit here and talk about it over and over. And I don't bother her. 
>> Anything that was said today, like questionable if I can continue to trust her or not, because of all that was said. It caught me by surprise, like i went expecting anybody to start talking like that, before i started talking about . 
>> Are you okay? 
>> I think I'll just keep to myself before I leave. Stay out of the way, stay out of trouble, avoid people, everything. 
>> I think I'm just trying to toughen you up in case you do go the prison. Because when you do go to prison it is going to be a lot harder, and there isn't going to be somebody who takes you in and looks out for you. You need to prepare yourself. You seem very, very upset with me. 
>> No, I'm just eating, and i just woke up. 
>> The next time we checked in with karmac, she informed us she no longer wished to speak on camera. And while her relationship with lechte seemed frayed, anthony wanted to change his opinion. He was recently moved to a more secure cell after threatening to throw a cup of urine at an officer. 

[00:46:06]


>> Normally mr. Kimbley never gives me a problem. I was actually surprised to find out he was kicking the door and threatening to throw urine. 
>> Kimbley says he has been upset over the recent death of his father. 
>> I understand you have been upset over some personal issues. 
>> I just needed somebody to come sit down and talk to, i couldn't just talk to anybody. 
>> Right, it is a very stressful time, especially when you lose somebody. And you can't leave to go do anything about it. And you can't leave to comfort your family. It is hard on you. I just feel like putting you in here is giving you some peace and quiet. 
>> I just feel like -- 
>> punch them out if you need to, because you're not going to hurt your hands or feet doing that. Not like you would kicking this steel door. You know, one thing that I could suggest that you do is you need to get paper ready. You sit down and write all of your stuff down on paper. It helps a lot, trust me, it does. Because it helps you really get it out. Put it on paper and you can actually go back and read it. 
>> I never thought about that. 
>> Yeah, try doing that. Your thoughts, everything you feel. 
>> That is like writing a story. 
>> Yeah, like a story, it is a nice way to put down the feelings that you have. 
>> And you will come and read it? 
>> Yeah, I'll come and read it. 
>> Appreciate you coming to me. 
>> You're welcome, thank you mr. Kimbley for at being all disruptive for me, and everything else. I figured I would just give you some peace and quiet, and figured that is what you needed. And I'll come back and talk to you, okay? Thank you. 
>> With most of the inmates that don't cause any problems, I will go out of my way to spend more time talking to them. He was all excited about writing things down and showing it to me. That kind of boosted my attitude. He was a little happier. I don't think we'll have any problem with him kicking the door. 

[00:48:20]


>> You act like I never tried, even when I lived with you. 
>> We fought almost every day. 
>> You didn't mind your mother -- 
>> did you expect anything different? 
>> From inside the walls of jail, a father and son provide a lesson for all parents. Maybe new buildings? What about updated equipment? They can help, but recent research shows... ... nothing transforms schools like investing in advanced teacher education. Let's build a strong foundation. Let's invest in our teachers so they can inspire our students. Let's solve this. smartphones bonus card? That's right. So it's like I won. Sure. Oh my gosh I won!!! I won!!!

>>> on any given day more than 2,000 men and women are incarcerated at the louisville metro department of corrections jail. Most are working on their cases, hoping to clear their names and go free. Today, however, two inmates, brian edmonds jr., And his father, brian sr., Will attempt to clear long-lingering emotional wounds. Edmonds jr., Who could be sentenced to death if he's found guilty, asked jail officials to allow him a final visit with his father, who will soon transfer to state prison to start a 30-year sentence. The request was approved. 
>> It really might be the last time I get to see him for a while. 
>> What's up, baby? 
>> What's happening? Hug. What's going on? What's going on with you? 
>> Well, let me tell you something before we start the conversation. I already told them from the get-go, I don't blame you for nothing. I chose the path I took. I chose to do what I wanted to do. But at the same time I just want to know, you know what I'm saying, if you could do anything different what could you have done? What you thought you could have done different. 
>> There would have been a whole lot different. I would have chose a different route so you wouldn't end up in the situation that you was in. First steps is me and your uncle. I'm tired of every time I look up you're in the hole. I'm sick of the fighting. I mean, that bothers me. I'm saying I know you're going to handle your own. But I mean, never knowing when something serious is going to happen to you. I'm saying that's frustrating. That's very frustrating. 
>> I mean, it's frustrating to me that you just got 30 years. You know? And then, you know, we always had a friendship, but we ain't have a father-son relationship. And it's like, you know what I'm saying, when you're locked up you talk a whole lot of sense. You don't want this, you don't want that. T you ain't never demonstrated that. If we was both to get out today, what do you feel you could do to help me? Even if you don't ever get out. You got 30 years. They offered me 30 years not too long ago. What would you do to help me to be the man you never was or you that wanted to be. Let's say I'm willing to listen or learn -- 

[00:54:06]


>> you act like I ain't never tried, though. I'm saying -- 
>> explain to me. 
>> Even when I lived with you. 
>> We fought almost every day. 
>> If I whoop you, what was you doing? You try to make it seem like i was just off the muscle fighting you. No. I'm saying you weren't minding period. You didn't mind nobody but your mother. So what am I supposed to do? 
>> Did you expect anything different? 
>> No. I never expected anything different from not being there. 
>> I ain't never really been loved. Like I remember the first christmas we had together. You remember that? 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> You started crying. 
>> It wasn't the first christmas but -- 
>> the first christmas. The first time we really spent christmas together. 
>> Yeah. 
>> I feel like I -- I ain't never talked about I was a kid, I was probably about 12, that was the first time I ever thought you really loved me. Other than that I ain't never had -- I don't know what the hell love is. I rather not have shoes, clothes, all that materialistic 
[ bleep ] and just have my mom and my dad. That's just how I feel. I wish I would have had my mom and my dad. And I feel like I would have been all right. I would have had some morals and some principles. You know what I'm saying? That's why I'm so angry. Because of stuff I never had. 
>> Moments later edmonds jr. Brings up his father's recent relationship with another woman and her young daughter. 
>> And you on the phone telling her you love her -- 
>> I wasn't even talking to her. 
>> You love her and her child. 
>> I write you every day -- hold, hold. 
>> I'm trying to finish. ? No, no. Because you ain't going to go through all that. I write you every day through the work days. And every letter I write you i tell you I love you. There's not one letter you wrote me telling me you love me. Not one. Don't try to make it seem like i told a little girl I love her and -- 
>> that's the thing. You told her, period. 
>> I'm saying what do a child got to do with it? 
>> That ain't your child. 
>> It don't matter. 
>> You weren't there for me when I was 6 and 7. 
>> I was there. You were out when you were 7. You called another man daddy. So I'm saying who's supposed to be getting mad? 
>> Who was with my mama when you went to penitentiary? Who was with my mama when you went to penitentiary? 

[00:56:12]


>> Look, I only did this interview because they said you want to do it. I'm saying for real, bro, we ain't got to go through this. 
>> I ain't give a [ bleep ] about this interview. 
>> He's trying to make it seem like it's just his -- 
>> brian sr., He's angry. 
>> He's supposed to be. I mean, I get frustrated when i think about it because I already know that the majority of the situation got something to do with me not being there. It's hard knowing that he could possibly end up with the death penalty. It's hard to even think about it. I always wanted to be there to help him. But I mean, which is sad to say, I let his mama basically run me away. And for a long time I had a grudge against her because she had another baby. So when I did get out, that's what was really stopping me from any -- you know what I'm saying. Even being around him. Because of that. And I should never have done it. But I felt like that was the only way for me to get even with her. And then when I got out and he was calling him daddy, it was real touching. 
>> Did you blame me for that? 
>> No. I blamed your mama. I mean, I'm sorry that I was never a father figure, you know what I'm saying, and just being your friend. I wanted it so bad because like, you know what I'm saying, honestly in my heart I didn't want you to end up here with me. I mean, you might think that I'm just saying this for the cameras. For real, [ bleep ] these cameras. I only did the interview for you. You feel me? I only did it so I can have this conversation. You know what I'm saying? This is affecting me way more than it's affected you. Because I know that the majority of this is only because I wasn't there. 
>> That's all I wanted to hear. That little bitty piece right there. This whole conversation, that was the only piece I wanted to hear. The only piece I wanted to hear. I'm no longer mad at him. At all. I swear to god, I'm not. Now that we've realized this is -- you know what I'm saying, we can get over this bridge, you know what I'm saying. Some father-son stuff. If it's from jail cell to jail cell, it's still possible. You can still -- if I was to get out and you had to stay in you could still make an impression from jail. I don't know exactly how. But you know what I'm saying, ain't nothing impossible. You owe me to try. That's the only thing I'm going to say you owe me. I don't blame you for nothing else. You owe me enough at least to put in an effort. I don't care how stubborn I am. You owe me that. And that's all I ask. 

[00:58:51]


>> Let's wrap it up. 
>> Yeah. 
>> I love you. 
>> I love you too. 
>> I don't know really what to say. I'm satisfied, though. Honestly in my heart, you know what I'm saying, I ain't mad at him. Ain't no hard feelingu. Ain't no none of it. I feel like he was sincere about it. That part of being a man he didn't know how to do. So I know he know he's wrong. And that's all that matters. I don't care if nobody else in the world knows. We really know. I'm cool with that. 
>> All right.

=======================================================

Think they're some kind of gods or something. 
>> An up-and-coming gang takes on the old guard and pits two friends against each other in an act of blood-sport. 
>> If me and him didn't fight they were going to stab both of us. 
>> He struck me several times in the left side of my face. As he was striking me I was trying to deploy my taser. 
>> An inmate assault on an officer gets him in trouble with not only the law but the mexican law. 
>> Brotherhood of texas, baby. 
>> And a white supremacist finds conflict with the jail, his gang, and his girlfriend. 
>> Just -- 
>> [ bleep ] you. 
>> No, baby, stop -- 
>> bye. Bye. 
>> No. Don't go. ???????????? 
>>> san antonio, texas is synonymous with the 1836 battle of the alamo. The mission turned fort still stands at the heart of downtown as a symbol of honor and bravery. Today, however, a very different war rages in san antonio, as two rival gangs shed blood in a power struggle to control a wide range of criminal activity, including drugs, prostitution, and human trafficking. And this turf war has expanded from the streets to inside the walls of san antonio's bear county jail. 
>> Traditionally the mexican mafia, an outgrowth of a prison gang, had been a controlling gang here in san antonio, but here lately because members of the mexican mafia are getting older and some younger groups have come in and it's creating a lot of problems for us here at the bexar county jail. 

[00:02:01]


>> The capacity for 4,500 men and women, bexar county jail is larger than many state prisons. Most of the inmates here are pretrial detainees, meaning they have only been charged with crimes and are awaiting the resolution of their cases. But that doesn't stop violence. 
>> Code 2! 
>> Code 2. An inmate has just assaulted an officer. A jail special emergency response team, or s.E.R.T., answers the call. 
>> Put your head to the wall. 
>> What's your name? 
>> Juan rubio. 766399. 
>> Injuries. 
>> Right there to the nose. 
>> Redness -- 
>> redness around the ear. It's all good. 
>> I don't have a statement. 
>> The report will read that juan rubio, currently in jail on charges including aggravated robbery, to which he has pled not guilty, was on his way to the recreation yd when he stopped for a drink of water. Corporal odegaard then instructed him to hurry along. 
>> He turned, threw the water at me, struck me several times in the left side of my face. As he was striking me and I was defending myself, I was trying to deploy my taser. My second officer came running out here to assist. The whole thing lasted three to four seconds. 
>> Three to four seconds that will have lasting repercussions for rubio. 
>> Put your hands on top of your head. You understand? If you resist, rubio, you will be tased. Do you understand me? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> By assaulting an officer, rubio has not only broken the law. He has also violated a bylaw of the mexican mafia, the gang to which prison officials say he belongs. 
>> The mexican mafia has a code. They don't assault the officers. 
>> They don't want any attention brought upon them. If one of their members assaults staff, they already know that now staff is going to start watching them more closely, which is what they don't want. 

[00:04:07]


>> Because inmate rubio broke that code, he's going to have to pay a penalty. That penalty could be as severe as a beating. It could be anything beyond that. 
>> Rubio, however, denies being a member of the gang. 
>> They say I affiliate with the mexican mafia. And I don't. 
>> He's being deceptive. Rubio has signed a gang acknowledgment form identifying himself as a member of the mexican mafia. It's not uncommon for these guys to deny it to people who he thinks doesn't know his history. But in the end we do have all of our paperwork intact. 
>> Officer rodriguez, part of the jail's gang intelligence division, heads to rubio's cell to discuss the situation. If rubio is willing to refute the mexican mafia, he cane placed in a protective custody housing unit for ex-gang members. 
>> If he decides to defect, or go x, we're going to go ahead and let him do so. If he decides to go with the actives, we're going to discuss the possible consequences of going with the actives. At this point we don't really know exactly which way we're going to send rubio. It kind of depends on what he has to say. 
>> It doesn't take long for rubio to make it clear. He wants to remain in his unit, which only houses confirmed mexican mafia members. 
>> I mean, how do I know that the mafia's not going to discipline you for all this? 
>> They won't. I don't know. 
>> They won't? 
>> I'm good. I can house with anybody. 
>> But do you understand that you violated one of your reglas. 
>> I didn't violate nothing. 
>> Nothing? 
>> Nothing. 
>> So nothing's going to happen to you if I put you back with your people? 
>> Nothing will happen to me. 
>> Convinced rubio will be attacked if they return him to his housing unit, officials discuss transferring him to another mexican mafia unit. 
>> Can we put him with the other actives? 
>> We have active's in a..A and b.A. We could try him in b.A. I'll go back and visit him. Rubio. I discussed your situation with the captain. He's approved you to go back but in unit b.A. So are you okay with that? 

[00:06:13]


>> I'll go anywhere. 
>> You don't think you're going to get assaulted -- 
>> I don't care anymore. We'll find out when we get there. You can house me wherever. Whatever happens happens. ???????????? 
>> for years the mexican mafia has been the largest and most powerful gang at bexar county. But now a new gang has emerged. Born in san antonio and rapidly spreading both on the streets and in prisons and jails. They are called the tango orojons. 
>> At one point they were all together and then as the years progressed they eventually broke away and now they're at odds with each other. The orojons began as foot soldiers of the mexican mafia BUT IN THE LATE 1990s THEY SIT Off to form their own gang, which today rejects the mafia's strict rules and structure. 
>> [ Bleep ]. 
>> They're very loose. There's no constitution. There's no real process on getting in. You can literally be an orojon tomorrow if you want to be one. Orojons recruit on a daily basis. You send one orojon to population, within 24 hours he's going to have three people with him. What started as a few members of orojons quickly grew into hundreds of members. And we went from having a small problem to having a large problem. 
>> Orejone, baby! 
>> We eventually had to get all the orejones we confirmed and basically corral them to one living area, to four units. You send the mafia over here, the orejone over there, and you close the door to keep them away from each other. 
>> Coming up, juan rubio gets his wish. But it comes with a price. 
>> If I hadn't been there to stop the fight when I did, there would have been some serious bodily injury done to him. 
>> And -- 
>> throwing knees, elos at each other. Banging each other's head on the wall, the door. 
>> The orejones pit two friends against each other. 
>> It's just like when they put two animals in a cage to fight. They have teachers... ...with a deeper knowledge of their subjects. As a result, their students achieve at a higher level. Let's develop more stars in education. Let's invest in our teachers... ...so they can inspire our students.

>>> Inside the general population units of san antonio's bexar county jail, long periods of monotony can be shattered by sudden violce. On a saturday morning inmates pass time in the day room when a fight breaks out in the second floor cell. 
>> Code 2. 
>> The jail's special emergency response team races to the unit and orders all inmates to the ground. Within moments it's all over. One of the participants is a member of the white supremacist gang the aryan brotherhood, adam verlander, who's here on charges of car theft and evading arrest, to which he has pled not guilty. 
>> Aryan brotherhood of texas, baby. 
>> The other inmate is dimitric gonzalez, who is awaiting trial for assault and drug possession and has also pled not guilty. 
>> So what was this about, verlander? 
>> Bloody towels being left where we put our drinks. 
>> It's a misunderstanding. I had come from the hospital. They thought because I had just came from going to the hospital I had laid a gauze that had blood on it on the windowsill. 
>> Towels with blood on them. Supposedly he left it oent window and he didn't like it. 
>> The men are split up and taken to separate units to cool down. For verlander the closest available cell is in one of the mexican mafia units. 
>> They may want him out of there because all the mexican mafia wants to be together. 
>> Once they are locked in their cooldown cells, verlander and gonzalez share their accounts of what happened. 
>> The black individual left some bloody gauze pads sitting on one of the tables and was kind of disrespectful, you know. So I went up there and said something to him. 
>> I don't like losing my temper. I tried to get him to leave me alone. Just get the hell away from me. 
>> I'm not one for playing. So I swung off on him. 
>> I said dude, are you serious? You want to fight? So he tried it again. So one-handed I beat the 

[00:13:22]


[ bleep ] out of him. 
>> The mafia may have no choice but to have verlander as a temporary resident of their unit. But they let him know they don't approve of his interview. 
>> Stop talking to the [ bleep ] camera, man. 
>> Yeah. Well, I guess the interview's over. 
>> [ Bleep ] I'll kill you, bro. 
>> Have a nice day. 
>> It's a lesson that most inmates at bexar county jail learn quickly. Don't get on the wrong side of the mexican mafia. Every member of the gang is literally on the same page. 
>> The mexican mafia has a very detailed constitution. All prospective members have to handwrite this and memorize the constitution. It outlines what will happen if you violate any rules within it. And it starts with just some minor discipline all the way to death. 
>> Alleged mexican mafia member juan rubio violated one of those rules when he assaulted an officer. Although jail officials feared he might face a reprisal prt gang if he was returned to his unit, rubio refused their offer to put him in protective custody. 
>> So nothing's going to happen if I put you back with your people? 
>> Nothing will happen to me. 
>> Come on. We'll go to cell 2. 
>> So officials decided to move him to a different mexican mafia unit in another wing of the jail in the hope of protecting his safety. But the plan didn't work. 
>> After rubio was escorted into my unit we let him out of the cell for the day room hour. At that time he was assaulted by two other inmates. If I hadn't been there to stop the fight when I did, there would have been some serious bodily injury done to him. 
>> Now that the mexican mafia has punished rubio, officer rodriguez must determine where rubio's mafia status stands. If gang leaders will not accept him back, then keeping rubio in a mafia unit could put his life in danger. 
>> I spoke to one of the assaulters, who is active mafia. 
>> So I understand that you must have got permission to do it. 
>> Rubio was crossed out. He was removed from the gang by other members. 
>> Rubio. 

[00:15:22]


>> Officer rodriguez knows they must now remove rubio from the mafia unit. 
>> I have to move you. 
>> I'm not going. They're going to have to take me WITH SERTs. 
>> I'm going to have to clair you as an x. 
>> I told him -- 
>> I cannot put you with the actives. 
>> I'm not going in there, man. 
>> Rubio's refusal to defect complicates the situation. 
>> He probably wants to stay in the mexican mafia active tank because he feels that maybe he's not x'ed out, he doesn't want to lose his standing with the mexican mafia. 
>> I CAN'T PUT YOU WITH THE Xs Because you're telling me you're active. I can't put you with the actives because the actives don't want you. 
>> We'll let him cool off and talk to him again. To f. For some reason he still insists on going back with the actives we'll have to make an executive decision and either PLACE HIM WITH THE Xs OR JUST Isolate him by himself. 
>> While sorting out what to do with him rubio is put in a temporary segregation cell away from both active and ex-mexican mafia members. But rubio has accepted his punishment from the mafia and is ready to rejoin them. 
>> We're good. I respect what they did. They respect that I went in there. I don't run from it. 
>> According to jail officials, the mexican mafia runs with military-like control and discipline. But in the units run by their rivals, the orejones, things are different. 
>> What's up? 
>> The screaming and the pounding and everything, for them it actually is quite normal. 210, baby. What's up? 
>> They have nothing better to do. And they think they're some kind of gods or something. 
>> And orejone leaders have just taken their wrath out on two young cellmates who were recently classified as orejone recruits and placed in their housing unit. Now separated the two inmates are christopher pinueles and jerry sanchez. Both are in jail on drug possession charges and have pled not guilty. 

[00:17:23]


>> They were approached by an unidentified inmate, who told them through the door that they had to fight. They had to fight to prove their heart in the gang. 
>> The winner would gain acceptance into the gang. The loser would be kicked out. Refusing to fight was not an option. 
>> They had told us if me and him didn't fight that they were going to stab both of us. Me and chris were scared. Chris started crying. I didn't want to fight with him. But in this place you don't know what's going to happen. So I looked at chris and chris looked at me and chris started crying. And chris was just like what do you want to do? I said I don't want to fight with you. You know what I'm saying? 
>> Me and him are talking about it and talking about it and we just finally came to it and said 
[ bleep ] it, we'll box each other. We've got to do what we've got to do to survive. We just started hitting each other. That's it. We were just closed fists and everything, throwing knees, elbows at each other. Banging each other's head on the wall, the door. It didn't matter to us. It's just like when they put two animals in a cage to fight. 
>> But for sanchez the odds in this contest were stacked against him. Sanchez comes from a neighborhood with mexican mafia ties. And even though he had requested to be housed with the orejones, he has tattoos that symbolize the mafia. 
>> Inmate sanchez, either way, if he would have won the fight or not, was no longer going to be allowed to be in there because his tattoos were too consistent with those worn by the mexican mafia. And penuelez on the other hand had an opportunity to stay in the unit if he won the fight. And apparently he didn't win the fight. 
>> I was already bleeding from my mouth, and I didn't want to fight him anymore. So I just stayed on the floor. 
>> They took us to medical. Chris hugged me. And chris was crying and he told me he forgave me. He said he would have never voted against me. 
>> Both of these inmates were x'ed out of the gang. And we went ahead and moved them into the protective custody unit. 
>> After the fight we were still cool and we still stuck together, no matter what, because we knew where our hearts were. I knew where my heart was and i knew where my head was. I knew where I was standing. And basically, we both said you know, what we're still young, we don't need this right now. 

[00:19:42]


>> But the two friends would not be together long. Though sanchez is waiting to go to trial on a drug possession charge, his judge has approved him for a work release program. 
>> Sanchez? 
>> During the day sanchez will be released from the jail to go to work. 
>> Do you need employment or do you have a job? 
>> I have a job. Wood floors. 
>> Today you cano pick up all your clothes, whatever you need. 
>> Each evening sanchez will be required to return to the jail. 
>> Be back at 7:00. 7:00? 
>> Report to the annex, though. 
>> Okay. All right. 
>> All right. 
>> Coming up -- 
>> the number we have called has temporarily been disconnected. 
>> Jerry sanchez becomes a fugitive. 
>> If he's ever stopped by any law enforpsment officer, they're going to arrest him and bring him in. 
>> Everybody's spun out. 
>> Adam verlander finds gang life isn't what it used to be. ???????????? 

[00:23:41]


>>> at the bexar county jail in san antonio some inmates charged with non-violent crimes are given the opportunity by the courts to participate in a work release program. They can leave jail to work during the day but must return at night. 
>> Today you can go. 
>> Jerry sanchez was granted work release. But on his first day out he did not return. 
>> I don't know what his motive was as to why he didn't return. Obviously we don't know what happened when he left the facility, if he was around family or what have you. 
>> This one contact, which is his sister, and the number we have called has temporarily been disconnected. Now the only option we have at this point is to ask the warrant officers to go actively seek him AT HIS RESIdENCE. 
>> There's an active warrant for his arrest. And if he's ever pulled over or stopped by any law enforcement officer, they're going to arrest him. 
>> Having served a prior four-year prison sentence for assault and robbery and now if convicted facing the potential of a longer sentence for car theft and leading a police on a high-speed chase, adam verlander an unlikely candidate for work release. 
>> I put out a tense vibe. I'm a very tense person. I'm very intense. So people kind of get wary, i guess. They think, well, he might snap at somebody, he might do something. 
>> Verlander recently did snap, when he took offense to inmate dimitric gonzales leaving bloody gauze in a common area of their housing unit. He admits to starting a fight. And it wasn't his first at bexar county. 
>> My enemy list here in bexar county is four pages long. One page, two page, three page, four page, and you're like dang, how do you all these enemies? 
>> For starting the fight verlander may receive time in segregation. But despite his membership in the white supremacist gang the aryan brotherhood he insists race played no role in the fight. 

[00:25:50]


>> I'm not a racist person. I don't believe in racial ideology. I believe that races should be separated amongst themselves, in which case they are in our society. I don't hate nobody. If I hate then I'm probably going to try to kill you. And there's probably a pretty 
[ bleep ] good reason why I'm trying to killverlander was placed in a temporary cooldown cell for 24 hours. Now he is back in his own cell with his cellmate, shawn osborne. ?????? I know that you've been feeling me all this time ?????? ?????? we know it's all been okay but today we're going to say whatever is on our mind ?????? 
>> he pops off. He's got lyrics that just come out of his head that just flow. ???????????? A little saxophone. 
>> You know what I mean? 
>> See, we're not allowed to have this either. 
>> Verlander's high energy level hasn't gotten to osborne, but verlander has gotten word that his actions -- 
>> [ bleep ]. 
>> -- Might be getting on the nerves of his gang. 
>> I'm a meth addict and we're not supposed to do drugs. A.B. Is not supposed to do drugs. We are not supposed to be breaking the law. We're supposed to be trying to get jobs as regular citizens and keeping the heat off of us. What the hell? I was a criminal when I got in. I'm supposed to be a criminal now. Other gangs are laughing at us. They're like what are they doing? They're piss testing their broz? Everybody's spun out. But they want us to be on top of everything. Some people are saying they're going to x me, they might x me. It would be for all the wrong reasons because I've bled for this family and that's all i wanted to be, was -- since I was a kid. And if they're going to take it from me they'd better go ahead and cut the heart out of my chest. Because that's what they'll be doing. They're cutting the heart out of my chest. 
>> If verlander is x'ed, or expelled from his gang, he isn't sure whether there would be further consequences or not. 
>> When I was growing up, man, you got x'ed, boy, they found you floating in a river. That's when you knew you were x'ed, when you were dead and you didn't have no head or hands. Because they cut them off. I'm still a.B. I'm still aryan brotherhood. I'm still going to be what I am. They ain't going to take that from me.

>> Adam verlander finds more trouble.

>> The special emergency response team of san antonio's bexar county jail has just broken up a fight. And one of the combatants is no stranger to staff. 

[00:32:33]


>> Verlander. 7204721, sir. 
>> For adam verlander it's the latest in a string of jail fights. This time it was with a member of los zetos, the mexican drug cartel. The fight erupted over a deal between the two inmates. The cartel member had asked verlander, a talented artist, to create a tattoo sketch for him in exchange for some commissary snacks. 
>> Was a picture of la santa muerte, the angel of death. 
>> But the inmate had become incensed after discovering verlander had included a hidden image in the drawing. The two lightning bolts that are the nazi symbol. 
>> I put a bolt in there. I ain't going to lie. You see it on everything. I've got lightning bolts on my cub. On the lid of my cup. It's a white thing. This is a bad-ass picture. I put a lot of time into that picture. I liked it. He didn't. 
>> Verlander's latest fight comes while he is still waiting to meet with the disciplinary board, who will most likely sanction him for his earlier fight with inmate dimtric gonzales. 
>> I love jail. I don't know who wouldn't. 
>> One inmate who clearly does not like jail is jerry sanchez. After four davis of being awol from the jail's work release program, sanchez was rearrested. 
>> Come on. We'll take care of you, man. Come on. 
>> Now he's not only back in custody, he's on suicide watch. Required to wear a tamper-proof gown to prevent hanging. 
>> Take you down and talk to the psychiatrist. 
>> Before going awol sanchez was forced by the orejone gang to fight his cellmate. Then he was kicked out of the gang and sent to a protective custody unit. When sanchez was rearrested, he mistakenly believed he was returning to an orejone housing unit. So he threatened suicide. 

[00:34:34]


>> We don't want to put you anywhere where you're going to be assaulted or an officer's going to get hurt. Come on. Make a right up here. 
>> When he came back in for his booking he was told he was going into unit b.A. Well, the last time he was here that particular unit was an active gang unit. So he did think he was going to go back to an active unit. 
>> Go ahead and have a seat here on the blue couch. 
>> But since he's been gone some things have changed. 
>> Housing unit b.A. No longer houses active orejones. Ly newly arrived arrestees pending asimultaneous to house units. 
>> He panicked a little because he was afraid. And he admitted to nap. 
>> Because I was so scared i didn't know what's going to happen to me the only thing that came to my mind was kill yourself. I don't have the heart to kill myself, sir. I don't. 
>> All right. Come on. 
>> Before sanchez can be taken off suicide watch he must also convince staff psychiatrist dr. Garcia that he's not suicidal. 
>> Have a seat. 
>> So I got scared. And the only thing that came to my mind is if I tell them that I'm suicidal. 
>> So basically, you said you were suicidal for safety concerns. 
>> That's pretty much it. 
>> Okay. You're really not suicidal? 
>> Never came to my mind. Never crossed my mind. I don't have the heart to. I have a 2-year-old son. 
>> Are they going to put you in a safe place? 
>> He said he's going to see what he could do for me. I pray that he does put me back where I'm supposed to in the -- 
>> otherwise, you're going to say you're suicidal again and we'll start all over? 
>> I'm scared, sir. 
>> I understand. 
>> I'm scared. 
>> Your safety comes first. 
>> Dr. Garcia releases sanchez from suicide watch. So he can now change back into a regular jail uniform and return to protective custody. Sanchez says that on the day he was released he had every intention of returning to the jail but when he got home things changed. 
>> As soon as I walked out the work release doors and as soon as I touched that sidewalk, and as I kind of walked away from the jail, I felt like I just never wanted to look back. Freedom never felt as good. Just to feel that breeze on my skin, just to feel that wind, like I felt like I was in here for years and I was only in here going on two months. I was crying. I told my mom, I can't go back. She was like, what are you going to do? I don't want you to run. I don't want you to go back. I was like it's not that easy. It's not easy to go back. I never imagined jail was this hard. I just want to do my time and go home to my family and just do good. Like it's not worth getting in trouble anymore. I'm not a gangster. I'm not a gangster. Before I came here I thought i was. But I'm not. I'm just me. I'm jerry. 

[00:37:25]


>> Juan rubio continues to bide his time in a segregation cell. Eager to return to a mexican mafia housing unit, despite being expelled from the gang. 
>> What do you do while you're in there? 
>> I read. Work out. Think. 
>> What do you think about? 
>> My life. How I'm going to fix my life. I get out and I do the same mistakes over and over. I've been doing it all my life. But I'm going to get out. I'm going to get out, and I'm going to change that. 
>> Rubio's latest troubles arrived after he broke one of the mexican mafia's most important codes. He attacked a jail officer. Now eight days later -- 
>> all right, mr. Rubio, I'm going to have you have a seat in this chair here. 
>> -- Rubio must face the disciplinary board, who will decide whether or no to give him further sanctions for the assault. 
>> Mr. Rubio, how do you plead? 
>> No contest. 
>> You do not wish to plead your case whatsoever? 
>> I didn't do it. That's it. Can you tell me who wrote that report, what officers were in there? 
>> Officer martinez wrote the report. Captain barabas also followed up on it. 
>> So he went and saw this? 
>> Are you going to let me finish what I said? 
>> Go ahead. 
>> As the hearing continues, rubio asks several technical questions about the report and questions the credibility of the disciplinary board itself. 
>> Okay. What other -- 
>> I'm going to conclude what you're saying because you're just running around in circles right now. 
>> [ Bleep ]. 
>> Do you have any questions or concerns -- 
>> [ bleep ] your hearing. That's what I feel like. Go ahead and give me the 30 days lockdown. 
>> Go ahead. We're done. Well, you know what? We're done. So go ahead and stand up. 
>> [ Bleep ]. 
[ Bleep ]. You know you all are [ bleep ] anyway. 
>> I mean, he has the right to have his process. And that's why we do that. And when they become violence then we just say we're done, we're not going to speak to you anymore, and you're going to be removed. That's it. We found the inmate guilty and assessed him 25 days disciplinary detention. 

[00:39:25]


>> For rubio it means another 25 days in solitude. More time to ponder his precarious future. Coming up -- 
>> I tried to call one time with my boy on the phone and he said -- and this little punk hangs up on me? I'm smashing him when I get out, skye. 
>> Adam verlander's visit turns into an emotional roller coaster. 
>> I've got a poem I wrote and I'd like to read it. Because this is how I feel about you, skye. Only citi price rewind automatically searches for the lowest price.

>>> after spending more than two weeks in segregation for two different fights, bexar county inmate adam verlander, an aryan brotherhood gang member whose nickname is smash is back in general population, doing what he does best. 
>> Hey, bro. You got that envelope? 
>> Trading artwork for commissary. 
>> What you think, dog? 
>> That's bad-ass. You can do portraits? 
>> Yeah. But you ain't got enough money for me to do a portrait, dog. I'd be sitting here for hours. I ain't going to be sitting here no hours for nobody. It ain't going to happen. I won't do a portrait for my girl, I ain't going to do one for you. 
>> Verlander's girlfriend holds a special place in his life. Her name is skye starbuck. 
>> This is one I wrote for my girl, skye. Every second without you is like a drop of water in this vast seat sea of time that seems to stand between us. Trapped as I am in my own despair only the word can describe the lengths to which love will last. If I don't get out I may never see her. 
>> And today skye has come for a visit. 
>> What's his last name? 
>> Adam verlander. 
>> Verlander? 
>> Yes. 
>> Like verlander skye has struggled with drug adistribution and is currently living with friends. This is her first visit with verlander in six weeks. 
>> I don't know how he still feels about me. If he's still going to be in love with me the same way he was before he got locked up. I'm going to start crying. 
>> It's been 45 days since I've seen my girl. Kind of rough. 
>> How do you feel? 
>> A little apprehensive. 
>> Verlander's apprehension stems from suspicions. When he recently tried to call skye, someone else answered. 
>> I said I'm looking for skye, and he said, huh? And I said I said I'm looking for skye. And some guy hangs up my phone. So I'm a little curious to find out who the hell that was. I guess we'll see here in a minute. It could go good or it could go bad. I don't know. I can be a sweetheart. But I'm also a demon whenever I'm provoked. 

[00:45:16]


>> Hey, baby. 
>> Hey, baby. 
>> Verlander wastes little time before confronting skye. 
>> Where are you at? 
>> I'm in -- 
>> with who? 
>> With [ bleep ]. He's just helping me. 
>> [ Bleep ] you. 
>> No, baby. 
>> Bye. Bye. 
>> Oh, no. Don't. Please. Don't. Don't do this to me. This is not the person I know. This is not -- 
>> no, skye, it is. You know what? 
>> You're acting like I don't even know. 
>> I don't know what the 
[ bleep ] I'm supposed to do. Why did he hang up on me? 
>> Because we were in the car together and the cops were driving by and my phone -- 
>> you're lying to me. 
>> I've never lied to you. If this is the visit why did i come all the way here. His truck broke down on the side of the highway and I came to see -- 
>> I try to call my boy and this punk hangs up on me? I'm smashing him when I get out, skye. 
>> I can't do this. I can't even pay for myself to survive. I don't know what to do without you. 
>> I got a poem that I want to read you and I would love for you to hear it because this is how I feel about you, skye. There's poetry in the way you move. Seemingly without effort. You move me deep into my core with your bright curious smiles and your mysterious shadows. Our kisses are filled with things for which there are no words. Because our love can only be defined within each moment that we share together. Without you life is so bleak. It's colorless and gray. I'm only content when you're safe in my arms. Your sweet love is all that sustains me in this time and these darkest hours. Is it not enough to simply say that I love you? 

[00:47:19]


>> I can't live without you. I can't breathe without you. I don't know what to do. I'm so lost. Everybody's given up on me and everybody thinks -- 
>> verlander believes there is one way the two can be together again. Things can work out if skye finds the money to post his bail. 
>> Baby, if you can get $900, I'll be out tomorrow. 
>> Where am I supposed to get $900? What do you want me to do? I mean, you know what I'd have to do to get that kind of money. And you will never forgive me. But I need you out here because I'm dying. I can't -- 
>> get me out of here, skye. 
>> I can't do this. I'm telling you right now. If you don't get out, I don't think I can do this. Do you still think I'm beautiful? 
>> You're gorgeous. Look at you. You're absolutely gorgeous. 
>> I've been sober. 
>> Have you? I'm proud of you. Thank you. 
>> You're proud of me? 
>> I am. You did good, baby. 
>> But you remember what I said. 
>> Look at every pod I've been on. I've been smashing people on every pod I go to, I smash somebody. I love you. 
>> I love you. You have no idea what I would do. I'd go to the end of the earth for you. 
>> I know you would. 
>> After 20 minutes the phone shuts off automatically and the two are cut off. 
>> [ Bleep ]. 
>> I'm going to break this window. 
>> I'll write you. I can't -- don't walk away. 
[ Crying ] 
>> I have to get him out. I just don't have any other choices right now. I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders. That's how he made me feel. Like I have to get him out. 
>> Somebody's giving me what skye's given me. We fight real bad. We do. Especially when there is drugs involved and regardless of that. I have tried to replace her and move on. And there is a big, huge, empty hole that yearns for sky. Nobody is ever going to take that spot. I'm going to marry that girl. That is all I can do. 

[00:49:47]


>> Coming up, adam gets a dear john letter. 
>> Said that I wasn't following the rules. 
>> And juan appears to have had a change of heart. We still run into problems. Namely, other humans. Which is why, at liberty mutual insurance, auto policies come with new car replacement and accident forgiveness if you qualify. See what else comes standard at libertymutual.Com. Liberty mutual insurance. Responsibility. What'syour policy? foods that make kids happy. And even fewer that make moms happy too.

>>> At san antonio's bear county jail, there is a third group. Those that find themselves xed out. Jerry sanchez and christopher penueles were kicked out. One or losing a fight and the other for his mexican style tattoos. 
>> We knew where our hearts were. 
>> The two friends are now living in separate cells in the special housing unit for exgang members. While sanchez awaits trial, the other has plead guilty to possession and evading arrest are. Instead the court sentenced him to 60 days to a boot camp rehab program. 
>> They don't want me to go around gangs. 
>> Sanchez says he has seen a disturbing change in penjueles. 
>> Before he was being sent to boot camp, he thought he was go going home. And now that he got sentenced to boot camp, he has a different attitude because he has to stay. He is cussing, talking about to the guards. 
>> After I thought I was going to go home, and I didn't go home, so, I just been getting on my door, punching my door and stuff like that. Although he is no longer in the gang, on the outside, he belongs to the roosevelt park kings. 
>> Boot camp is not going to change me. My gang it always going to be there for them. I'm going to sell drugs and that is the only way I'm going to make money. N rubio, held out hope that he would be reinstated so he refused to be housed in the exgang unit. But now it appears that he has reconsidered that decision. He has come forward and said i don't want to house with these guys. 

[00:55:59]


>> The jail officials fear he may be plotting something. 
>> We received information that he is no longer active with the gang. But we received information that if we assault an exmobe they don't have the chance of ever coming back. He has a chance, we can't afford him the housing opportunity that he is requesting which is housing with other exmembers. We are going to go ahead and watch. 
>> Until then, rubio will remain in a single man cell away from active and exmembers of the mexican mafia. Adam verlander claims allegiance to the arian brotherhood. But his behavior has put his tat tus with the gang in jeopardy. He's received a letter that he has been exed out of the brotherhood. Saying I was breaking by laws. I was doing dope and crimes and things that I shouldn't have been doing. But I was on the run. Am I supposed to hold down a 9:00 to 5:00 job? 
>> What does that mean you have been exed out? 
>> I don't know. I honestly don't know. 
>> Meanwhile, he has been counting on his girlfriend sky starbuck to get him out of jail. 
>> Baby, if you can get $900 i can be out tomorrow. 
>> I feel like the weight of the world is on my shoulders. Like I have to get him out. 
>> But now he has heard from a friend that sky is also gone. 
>> Sky is in rehab. Right you now. She is in rehab I have no idea where she is at. I don't get letters from her. 

[00:58:09]


>> As he sits in jail his only comfort sky's bittersweet promises. You lay down and die and I'll let you go. My love is like the wind. You can't see it but you know it is there and you feel it is all around you. That is the only letter I've gotten since I've been locked up. 
>> I do feel alone.

Advised. 
>>> Msnbc takes you behind the walls of america's most notorious prisons, into a world of chaos and danger. Now, the scenes you've never seen. "Lockup raw." To their victims, they were the epitome of terror. 
>> I throw my hooks and snapped his neck. You can feel it right against here. Pop. 
>> The face of their nightmares. 
>> He was crying, begging for me to stop. 
>> Started sawing away, tried to cut his head off. 
>> They have robbed, murdered, and kidnapped. 
>> I used to kidnap college kids and hold them for ransom. 
>> When they told the jury, all rise, I thought that was my opportunity and stabbed him in the chest. 
>> Now, five of the most notorious inmates to ever appear on "lockup" -- 
>> I'm trigger happy -- 
>> reveal insights into their shocking brands of predatory behavior. 
>> I enjoy hurting people. 
>>> At the top of every "lockup" episode, we run a warning for viewers about the subject matter. That warning is relevant to what we're about to show you. We put together a collection of some of the most disturbing and dangerous inmates in "lockup" history. Viewer discretion is definitely advised. 
>> Inside america's maximum security prisons is an assortment of predators. The interviews our producers conduct with such inmates are always graphic and often revealing. We heard three of the most shocking stories of predatory behavior at the same prison. California state prison. Corcoran. When we interviewed these men, our crew was required to wear stab-proof vests. One of the corcoran inmates we san down with was christian knighten. Nobody describes the daily pressures, the ups and downs of being a predator, like he does. 

[00:02:01]


>> It's seductive, you know what I mean? You can love the game, but the game loves nobody. You know what I mean? You could sit there and give it your all and think everyone's supporting you, and before you know it, just like that. Get your throat cut. Seen it, done it. 
>> Knighten was serving time for murder and attempted murder. Crimes he committed at the los angeles county jail while awaiting trial on an outside murder/robbery charge that he was convinced would send him to prison for life. But when he went on trial for that original murder charge, something completely unexpected happened. 
>> They find me not guilty, and it righteously blew my mind. I had to laugh. The irony of it it was classic. 
>> Knighten should have walked away as a free man, instead, he remained incarcerated until he was tried for his jailhouse murder. This time, he was found guilty and given 79 years in prison. But that murder was no random killing or crime of passion. Assuming he was headed toward a life in prison anyway, he killed out of ambition. To join an organization he'd admired since childhood, the mexican mafia. 
>> So when you're a kid, you want to shoot for the stars. I want to be that. I want to be that guy. Out on the streets, someone may want to be a ceo or own their own company, to be their own boss. You're back here, regardless, it's still power. And because of the power behind them, that being the mob, mexican mafia. 
>> Christian knighten is probably one of the most engaging inmates I've ever encountered doing "lockup," he's very articulate, well read, well spoken and quite proud of his career as a criminal. 
>> I gave my "a" game. I would do it to the extreme violence wise, selling dope wise. 
>> In the "lockup extended" episode, he gave shocking details into extreme violence. In describing his los angeles county jail murder. We warn you, the following is very graphic. 

[00:04:11]


>> And I walk up to him, hook his leg, and put him in a bare naked choke hold, bring him down, I throw in my hooks and choke him out and snap his neck. When his neck snapped, you feel it right against here, pop it snapped. I pulled out my piece, stabbed him in the neck, let him have it in the chest, and he started making noises, and I pulled out a pipe and bashed his head in until pieces of his skull, you know, came out. So the blood was, I mean it was everywhere, it was about this thick. 
>> Sitting there listening to him relay these very graphic, violent, brutal acts, I have to remain somewhat detached to keep him talking. And it was almost like he was just discussing another day at the office. 
>> By this time we were hungry. So, it's kind of funky, but it t- IS WHAT IT IS. We usually stack up trays and put a -- you can take a piece of blanket, rip off a strip, you light it and gives you a good blue flame. I just took the bomb with it, set it on top of his body and cooked grilled cheese sandwiches on top of -- using his body as a stand. So I'm eating and that's where this rumor throughout the state of california. Yeah, he was burning this fool and this. They never found his eyeballs. They're like, yeah, they ate his eyeball in some type of weird ritual. It got righteously out of proportion. 
>> Where were his eyeballs? 
>> No, one eyeball -- we don't know. I have no clue. 
>> As a made man in the mexican mafia, knighten strove to become a well-rounded leader of the organization when he arrived in prison.Know, just put holes in people, anyone can do that. To educate yourself, that's where you want to go. 

[00:06:14]


>> He studied the art of war from historic practitioners. 
>> We had some way out cats, they were cool, but you'd pick up game -- righteous game. I'm an avid reader and student of ancient japanese philosophy, I love it. The whole warrior culture. The knowledge of power, bushito code, you go all the way down as far as from all different cultures, they're all war manuals and philosophies. So what I mean studying, that's exactly what I mean by studying. 
>> To become a better -- 
>> warrior. Yeah, to be a -- whatever you want to call them. Yeah. But to be better at my job, which would be, I guess I could say prison criminal. 
>> Knighten's education would come in handy when a power shift in his gang put him on the wrong side of the new regime. And the predator had become prey. 
>> Now, I find out I'm on the list. That's a death sentence. My heart broke. I'll be honest with you. I was like, you've got to be 
[ bleep ] me. Spotless career and I'm on the list? He said, yeah, they put you in the hat. I'm not going nowhere, stubborn, you know what I mean? So it was odd. And I'll be honest with you, if I sat here and tell you i wasn't, you know, scared -- terrified. However, you know, that's basically what defines a man, you know? How he confronts his fears. I'm heading them face on. I got hit, sliced. I have to go in for my throat and they thought I was going to slit. And went down to my cell, cleaned it up, coffee, packed it full of coffee. And went ahead and didn't go to the doctors because they would have took me off the tier. Took me 28 days later, the individual that did it, I got him from his back throat to his throat. He was gone. 

[00:08:24]


>> After nine years, knighten made a shocking career move. He retired. Through a process called debriefing he shared his gang secrets with authorities and was transferred to the prison's protective custody program. Knighten will most likely spend the rest of his prison term in protective custody, knowing he will always have a target on his back. So now, the once dedicated warrior tries to focus his energy on spirituality. 
>> That's one thing that i struggle with now. I understand how hypocrisy works, speaking to you now. You know it's wrong. Yeah, hey, I got some atonement I guess you could say to make up for it. Things are looking rough I could say if I do believe in afterlife. 
>> Would you kill someone today? 
>> Oh, yeah. Sure. 
>> You didn't even hesitate, christian. 
>> You want me to lie? 
>> No. 
>> Pretend? You know what I mean? 
>>> Next on "lockup raw" -- 
>> I slashed his throat repeatedly. Blood was everywhere. 
>> A predator targets his cellmate. 
>> I like that. That was one of my favorite ones right there. Maybe new buildings? What about updated equipment? They can help, but recent research shows... ... nothing transforms schools like investing in advanced teacher education. Let's build a strong foundation. Let's invest in our teachers so they can inspire our students. Let's solve this. smartphones bonus card? That's right. So it's like I won. Sure. Oh my gosh I won!!! I won!!!

[ Male Announcer ] AND IT'S NOT JUST THESE Owners giving the volt high praise. Volt received the j.D. Power and associates appeal award two years in a row. ?????? ?????? younger, admit disease. I wanted to fit in, I wanted to be a normal kid. Because of my diabetes, I lost the sight in my left eye. Misconceptions continue to surround this monster public health issue. But the simple truth is, diabetes can often be prevented and complications avoided. I think if I had just been open and honest about what my challenges were, I think it would have been easier for me to take better care of myself. If you don't take care of yourself when you're younger, with this condition, it will catch up to you later on. You're going to find the courage to manage this disease for the rest of your life by reaching out for help. Reach out to people who care about you. Reach out to people who know how to help you with this disease. You're not alone. Understand the realities of diabetes and know that you can manage it and lead a full, active life. 
>>> It still surprises me at times hearing some of these inmates' accounts of their extreme violent behavior. I'm often curious as to why or how they became this way. But I also think it's a part of the human condition. And I think it's important that people understand that. Part of it, I think, is created at birth, but also a big part of it is how one survives in prison. More often than not, a lot of these stories of violence have occurred in the prison setting. In order to survive in such a violent world, most of these people feel they have to be violent. 
>> In 1992, robert glenn was sentenced to three years for auto theft. When we met him 15 years later at california state prison corcoran, he was still in prison. And two of his former cellmates were six feet under. Glenn murdered the first one while he was still in county jail. 

[00:13:34]


>> I slashed his throat repeatedly. Blood was everywhere. And then another inmate passed me a shank. Probably about that long with a handle on it. I just started stabbing him. Stabbed him about over 100 times, in the back, sides, neck. He was crying, telling me to stop. Begging for me to stop. He was still alive through all of it. 
>> You're smiling. 
>> I like that. That was one of my favorite ones right there. 
>> He surprised me in that he had a gleefulness about him as he was discussing the violence he had committed in prison. He had this proud little smile as he was telling us these very disturbing and violent acts. 
>> After murdering his cellmate in jail, glenn came to prison where his predatory behavior escalated. 
>> While I was there for about a year, I got about 14 assault on inmates. 
>> Why? 
>> I was a young kid, 20 years old. >>Ting people up? 
>> Beating people up for the slightest infraction. A lot of my violence I've had, people don't clean up after themselves and don't wipe the sink out after they use it or they pass gas right next to me. They don't go to the door. There's no courtesy being in a cell situation that you have to have. And you know, little things like that just piss me off and once I'm pissed off, that's it, i beat the hell out of you. That's how prison is. Makes you violent. What else can we do right here but have fun? You know? I know it's kind of twisted to say it, but I enjoy it. 
>> You enjoy what? 
>> I enjoy hurting people. 
>> Glenn killed his second cellmate in 2005 while at another california state prison. He told us he did so because the cellie was a child molester. 

[00:15:38]


>> I went and told the c.O. To move me. She told me to deal with it. So a couple days later, I dealt with it. Waited one night, I picked a fight with him. I told him to turn his tv off and go to sleep and he didn't like that too much. So I got up out of my bunk to turn his tv off. He got up. Once he stood up, I put him in a little choke hold and choked him out, killed him. Shoved his head in the concrete while I was doing it. I was kind of upset that I told that c.O. That I wanted that cell move and she told me to deal with it, so I wanted to give her a little present. I tried to cut his head off. My whole plan was the next morning to open the doors for chow, I was going to toss her my cellmate's head. 
>> Contrary to glenn's claims, his cellmate was not convicted of a sex crime but of robbery. Detectives investigating the murder say glenn did it in order to coerce the prison into letting him cell by himself. 
>> After we did the interview with robert glenn, we went back to his cell and he freely demonstrated what it was like when he was committing his crime. And he demonstrated with the string how he attempted to decapitate his victim. 
>> What I do is I make a little slip knot on either end, something like that. The string has to be a lot stronger because you don't want him getting out of it. Roll up a piece of sock. Just took it like that. 
>> Glenn is currently serving 98 years for the 2 murders he committed behind bars, but he left us with the impression that his predatory behavior may have extended beyond just these two. 
>> How many people have you killed? 
>> I've been convicted of two. I won't talk about anything i haven't been convicted of. 
>> Why is that? 
>> I haven't been convicted of them yet. I don't want to talk about any crimes that I've done because right now I have a life sentence. So I'm here. If I'm convicted of any more crimes, they're going to give me the death penalty. That's not really -- I don't really want the death penalty at this moment in my life. Eventually, later down the line, who knows. 

[00:18:03]


>>> Cominu up -- 
>> I used to, you know, kidnap people and hold them for ransom. 
>> A parent's worst nightmare.

>>> When it comes to the predators we've met inside america's prisons, no one looked the part more than robert galvin. At california state prison corcoran. And with his menacing appearance came a violent streak that earned him a nickname "phantom." 
>> They say I'm fast, hurting people, getting people. And they'll have holes in them and I'll be gone, you know. Like a ghost. 
>> When I first saw robert galvin, he carried himself in this very tough way, kind of walked like a wrestler, covered in tattoos, odd kind of hairstyle, shaved his head and had this little flap of hair in the back. And very much cultivated this tough demeanor. Tell me about that. 
>> We consider it like a tail, a bulldog tail. It's considered a mongolia which means warrior. There's warriors and there's gangsters or whatever. We don't have to be told what to do, a warrior knows what to do. 
>> Galvin made it clear that knowing what to do inside corcoran meant stabbing his enemies. 
>> I was on the yard and i stabbed a white guy like 17 times or whatever. From there, they took me to ad seg, and yeah, I stabbed another white guy. And that's what got me here. 

[00:22:38]


>> Galvin's violent ways in prison landed him in corcoran's secured housing unit, the shu, a 24-hour lockdown, reserved for only the most dangerous inmates. But galvin told us that his predatory ways began on the streets of fresno. 
>> I used to kidnap people and hold them for ransom. Like, you know, you've got the college kids out there, you know they've got money, they're in college. So you know, you just take one of them. 
>> How? 
>> By force. 
>> How? 
>> Just grab them by the neck and put them in the car, you know? Have them call their parents and have them wire money to an account. You know, that's about it. After that you let them go, if they put the money in the bank. 
>> If they don't? 
>> That's a different story, you know? 
>> How does that story end? 
>> Bad. I'm in here for kidnapping, ransom, and murder. So that kind of bad, you know? 
>> Galvin's last kidnapping ended beyond that. Even before it got to the ransom stage, one of his victims managed to call his parents and give his location. 
>> When I was in the car with these two kids -- well, they weren't kids, they were over 18. I don't mess with, you know, kids under 18, you know. They called their parents. And the cops ended up following us, and the helicopter. So, you know, it ended kind of bad. That's how I got caught, you know. 
>> Well, what happened? 
>> Well, I cut the guy's neck. And the cops surrounded the car and pulled me out, you know what I mean? 
>> Did he die? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Ironically, robert galvin is both a predator and a parent. He has four kids ranging from 8 to 16 years old. 

[00:24:49]


>> I let them know about the mistakes I made so they don't repeat them and don't end up in here. I do what I can for them money wise. You know, send them money and, you know, put it in the bank. Hopefully, you know, college, you know. That's what I want. I want them to accomplh things that I wish I had. I want my sons to be a better person than me, you know. 
>> How are you sending them money? 
>> I can't tell you that. 
>> Galvin also asserts that supporting his family motivated his crimes on the outside. 
>> I robbed every pizza place in fresno, practically, just for money for, like, christmas, but I never did rob on the streets just out of spite, just to hurt people. I've never done that. You know, I've done it for money. Everything I've done out there was for money. 
>> But I'm going to beg to differ. The man, the homicide that put you in here, you knew you weren't going to make any money. You knew you were caught. 
>> You're right. 
>> Why did you kill him? 
>> That right there, I had no reason to do that. I guess I'm just a bad guy. 
>> It disturbed me. He on one hand was talking about his own children and how much he loved them and how much he wanted to provide for them but couldn't make the connection that he had killed some other people's child. And just didn't seem to be able to relate the two accounts. And it was important for me to try to get him to see that connection. 

[00:27:03]


>> It's in everybody's nature to protect their young. That's just like the animal kingdom. You know, the lion ain't going to let their kids get hurt. 
>> Robert, how old was the young man you killed? 
>> Huh? 
>> How old was the man you killed? The kid you killed on the street? 
>> Which one? 
>> The one that put you in prison. 
>> Oh. HE WAS ABOUT IN HIS 20s, EARLY 20s. 
>> That's young. 
>> Yeah. 
>> That's somebody's child. 
>> Exactly, yeah. 
>> You guys don't make a lot of sense sometimes to me. 
>> Yeah, I know, some of the things we do don't make sense. A lot of people do things for nothing. Just to try to get noticed. To try to become somebody. That guy right there, he's strong. You know, he'll beat you up or he'll stab you, just to get a name. 
>> And then live in a box. 
>> Yeah. Unfortunately, things happen and there's no way for me to get out. This is me. I'm going to die in here. 
>>> Next on "lockup raw" -- 
>> I come from a nice family, a good family compared to a lot of the families I hear about in here. 
>> An inmate who grew up on the right side of the tracks commits a shocking crime in front of dozens of witnesses. They have teachers... ...with a deeper knowledge of their subjects. As a result, their students achieve at a higher level. Let's develop more stars in education. Let's invest in our teachers... ...so they can inspire our students. Let's solve this. again.

>>> Here is what is happening, at least 40 homes were condemned in springfield, massachusetts, after a massive fire levelled the homes, more than 40 firefighters were injured. 
>>> And larry hagman has died, the actor was 81, and in minutes, somebody could be holding the largest jackpot in the game's history. Good luck. Back to lockup. 

[00:32:19]


>>> Most of the violent inmates that fill up our prisons across america have had a difficult childhood. They've either been born on the wrong side of the tracks or had abusive, uncaring families. But we found an inmate inside the penitentiary of new mexico who grew up with all of life's advantages. And yet still became a violent predator. 
>> I come from a nice family. A good family compared to a lot of the families I hear about in here. My dad's a retired naval officer. He retired from the navy and joined the national guard, retired from the national guard and then started going to the county for the job. He retired as the county jail administrator. My mom, she's a secretary. She's very educated, very knowledgeable and wealthy. She quit her job to stay home with me so that I would have someone there for when I got home from school. Do my homework, make sure I do what I had to do. 
>> But that didn't keep him out of trouble. 
>> I never had to face consequences, so I figured I was pretty much untouchable. And I rebelled against them being so straight and I went crooked bad. 
>> Steele's rebellion culminated in a 60-year sentence for residential burglaries, armed robbery and false imprisonment. 
>> I was robbing a house, boom, someone came home, I laid in wait and they came to the garage door, and I told them to sit on the couch, I finished robbing the house and left and that was it. 
>> We had numerous off-camera conversations, but everything switched when it became an on-camera interview. There's a convict code that many of these guys have to live by. And part of that code is to not reveal too much information. The most challenging part of interviewing alejandro steele was when I started asking him out his most visible crime. 
>> That crime occurred while steele was serving his original sentence and got him an additional 23 years. It was an assault that he carried out literally in front of a jury of his peers. 
>> I saw basically the whites of his eyes and I saw him coming at me. I didn't see his hands, but he moved relatively quickly on me and I feel -- I feel a punch in my chest. 

[00:34:24]


>> In 2001, steele was in court acting as his own attorney for allegedly throwing urine on a correctional officer. During a lunch break, steele extracted a plastic shank from his anal cavity. When he returned to the courtroom, he attacked chief deputy district attorney a.J. Salazar. 
>> I remember I was wearing a white shirt, my tie was off to the side, and I looked and there was a hole in my shirt and I was bleeding. 
>> The stab wound, itself, was not considered serious. The bigger problem was the risk of infection. 
>> I went to the hospital, I was at the emergency room, I went through a series of shots, they cleaned out the wound. It took several blood tests and I remember picking up the blood result and looked and looked for hiv. And hepatitis negative, hiv negative. So I was like, well, all right, I'll go ahead and take that. 
>> We asked steele for his version of the story. And in spite of all of the witnesses, he claimed absolute innocence. 
>> They're saying I stabbed him in court in front of judge, jury, and executioner. 
>> What are you saying? 
>> I'm saying I had nothing to do with it. 
>> Were you there? 
>> Nope. 
>> Really? 
>> How many different ways you want me to answer that same question? 
>> So you're denying this whole thing ever took place? 
>> I'm denying I had anything to do with it. 
>> Was this d.A. Stabbed? 
>> According to court documents and papers. 
>> What was the evidence against you? 
>> I don't know. That I was in the courtroom, that I witnessed it from the jury, the transport officers, my own lawyer, and the witnesses in the case all pointed the finger at me and said I did it. 

[00:36:25]


>> And you're saying? 
>> I had nothing to do with it. 
>> Where were you? 
>> I was in my cell. 
>> All right. Alejandro, how on earth do you really say that? You're a smart guy. You physically know where you were, everybody saw where you were, right? 
>> No. I had nothing to do with it. 
>> What do you admit here? 
>> I admit to being prison number 508507 and admit to my mistakes I made to come to prison. 
>> Steele was convicted of attempted murder in the assault on salazar. He was also found guilty of the charge that brought him to court that day, throwing urine on a correctional officer. And it wasn't the first time he had assaulted an officer. 
>> Allegedly they say I've slipped my cuffs. And when they opened my door i started swinging and I made the c.O. Jump off the tier and run out of the pod. Left me on the chair by myself, went back to my cell and that was that. 
>> Why assault on staff? 
>> About 90% of the staff they get working here are the people who got picked on in school. They come over here and now it's payback time. They think that badge gives them power, that badge is only an illusion of power. That power can be stripped and taken away in a moment's notice. 
>> And you help them see? 
>> No, allegedly. 
>> Yes, alejandro was playing a cat and mouse game, absolutely. Part of it it could have been the convict code not to reveal too much information, and part of it could very have been the fact that he was kind of delighted to be out of his cell and able to have this exchange and kind of get people going. 
>> But eventually, steele came clean about the attack on the d.A. 
>> Couple months before -- a month before, I knew he was the one that was going to. When they told the jury all rise, I saw that that was my opportunity and I stabbed him in the cht. 

[00:38:28]


>> Steele's candor was short-lived. 
>> In terms of what you did, what was your goal? Honestly, you're not going anywhere. What was -- 
>> stop him from breathing. 
>> So you were going to kill him? 
>>> Coming up -- 
>> when I got incarcerated, i declared war on the state of indiana. That gave me the excessive sentence as a result of my crime. Well, I'm giving you excessive violence as a result of my anger. So I decided to just rage. smartphones bonus card? That's right. So it's like I won. Sure. Oh my gosh I won!!! I won!!!

>>> How long do you expect me to be on msnbc with this camcorder in my hand in a night cell doing night vision recording and talking to your guys? I wasn't expecting any of that. But that's how life is. Life is full of surprises. Life is full of change, abrupt changes, you know, unexpected changes. 
>> Unexpected changes would come to describe our relationship with darren bailey. An inmate we met at the indiana state prison. One of a handful of inmates allowed to use a personal camera supplied by our crew used to record intimate thoughts in the privacy of his cell. He even shared some thoughts about the crew, themselves. 
>> You got susan, you got alex in wonderland, and all those other guys, you know, I don't know their names, but they're cool. And they're all from california. Can you believe that? 
>> When we first started working with darren bailey, we heard he had this very violent past. That he was not only violent on the streets, but once he got into prison, had a very erratic and impulsive and violent nature. So when we encountered him, he was already in a process of going through therapy and trying to make himself a better inmate. 
>> I have never given myself a chance. And because I'm giving myself a chance to do better for myself, I have a supporting cast that are saying, yeah, we believe in you. Yeah, he's showing progress. Yeah, he's no longer the person that has held him hostage for years. 
>> But when it came to talking about the convictions that gave him a 147-year prison sentence, which included two murders, battery and criminal confinement, bailey was only open to a point. 
>> Man, it was kind of gruesome, man. Bodies all found and everything like that, so -- I was off balance and everything like that. So -- for this area, man, it's not really easy to talk through. We're not having a typical conversation now. Now we're dealing with something more personal. And it touches me in different ways because the people that were getting executed, you know, it was not something that i really deal with like that anymore. As much as I try to move on, i feel haunted by that past. 

[00:44:49]


>> Darren bailey was an inmate i remained constantly vigilant around. His moods would shift instantaneously during a conversation. He could go from sweet, even flirtatious to rage-filled and defensive in a heartbeat. Was there a personal relationship? 
>> Not nothing like that. It was just that a situation I'm not -- I can't just give you all this, man. You're not under the gun like i am. This is an interview to you, it's not an interview to me. I have to be meticulous in my thought process about what i expose about my case because my case is under scrutiny. 
>> That's fine. 
>> You keep saying that's fine -- 
>> that's fine, I'm just curious. There's not a jury in the world who is not going to convict without there was a reason for convicting 
>> the state said the reason i killed these people because I'm trigger happy. The state said the reason i killed these people is because i have absolutely no control over my violent behavior. The state said I killed these people because this is the nature of who I am. 
>> Bailey did nothing to dispel that notion when he arrived in prison. 
>> When I got in incarcerated, i declared war on the state of indiana. That gave me the excessive sentce as a result of my crime, well, I'm giving you excessive violence as a result of my anger. So I decided to just rage. 
>> Bailey had only recently been released from the indiana segregation unit where he had spent five months for violent acts committed in prison. Now he was finding new ways to quell his impulsive behavior, including meditation. 
>> The truth is, man's greatest challenge is to conquer himself. So I'm working on conquering myself right now. I don't want to deal with the violence because the violence has been dealing with me for way too long. 
>> Your legs, your arms, your hands, everywhere, just relax. The main thing is to stay relaxed. 
>> I sought mental health, mental health didn't come to me, I went to them. And I told them I would like to be helped. I would like for you guys to talk to me and provide some type of program I can gradually work my way through this step by step. 

[00:46:58]


>> After several months of clear conduct, bailey was accepted into the residential treatment unit or rtu, for ongoing counseling. The prison's lead psychologist dr. Reggie matias, felt he was capable of doing something few predators are capable of, changing their ways. 
>> Let's try to figure out a different way to do his time in prison. And so he talked with me when he was up on the segregation unit and said I really want a chance at the rtu unit. I want to start making changes in my life. You know, we're pretty particular about who we take in. The bottom line on this is there can be no violence. 
>> I think this unit is the vehicle that I've been waiting for. I think that I'm ready for it because now that my system is beginning to settle, this will be the best time to tackle right at this moment. 
>> Remember, you're trying to change your past. You've been going down a certain road for many years and you're trying to walk a different road. Do your time a little differently than you have in the last eight or nine years? You're going to be one of our starters. I know that, I know that. 
>> I can come up here and I can get my stuff together. So I don't have to relapse into a condition that forbids me from being this free again. There is that form of freedom up here. So I come out here and play basketball by myself, about half hour to an hour as long as it takes me to vent that frustration, vent that rage, just push it all out. 
>> On his personal inmate camera, bailey also indicated that he enjoyed interacting with our crew. 
>> Susan, she's very, very nice and she's kind of, like, she's cool. Cool person et along with. Kind of persistent and relentless, you know. But at the same time, she's a nice person. So she asked me to do this for her. So you can't say no to a lady, especially a lady like her. 

[00:49:04]


>> How would you define yourself? 
>> Cordial, affable, charming, easy to get along with, but there's that side to all of us when we don't want to be bothered, when our tolerance becomes zero. T's the one thing about darren was one day he would be completely energetic and just all off the wall, you know, all over the place, and real hard to contain. And then another day he would be very standoffish and wouldn't want to talk much or would get very upset out of nowhere. So with him, you never knew how you'd have to adjust. 
>> Coming out. Come on, it's all right, we've got to talk. 
>> I don't want to deal with the camera. 
>> You were fine yesterday. 
>> Well, 24 hours has passed since then. Interview the cameraman sometime. 
>> You don't want to talk to me? 
>> I'll talk to you, to hell with that camera. 
>> What's the problem? You did last time. 
>> You know how I get. You know how I get. 
>> All right. 
>> As I told you, I said I'm following you today. 
>> Right. 
>> We're stopping here, going to other places. 
>> You told me that. And I'm down with that. Okay, but I'm not [ bleep ] with that today. So if it disappoints somebody, i don't know what to say. 
>> All right. He's just doing his thing. 
>>> Coming up, bailey sends shock waves through the residential treatment community. And all across the nation they're getting ready for their day. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses are preparing for november 24, a day to open doors, and welcome the millions of customers who will turn out to shop small. Small business saturday. Visit shopsmall.Com and get ready. Because your day is coming. If we want to improve our schools... ... what should we invest in? Maybe new buildings? What about updated equipment? They can help, but recent research shows... ... nothing transforms schools like investing in advanced teacher education. Let's build a strong foundation. Let's invest in our teachers so they can inspire our students. Let's solve this. 

[00:53:50]


>>> During our extended stay at indiana state prison, darren bailey, an inmate with a violent past, seemed determined to start a new life and asked prison officials for a fresh start in a program designed to help troubled inmates. 
>> We were pretty much wrapped up with darren bailey's story, he was succeeding in rtu, so we started filming other inmates in other parts of the prison and then we got word and realized we were far from over with darren. 
>> Bailey had been accused of a brutally violent assault on another inmate. 
>> Well, what I know is that he sort of sneak attacked this guy and came up behind him and hit him with a ringer. Apparently he stabbed him with something. He has a puncture wound on his shoulder and no one's really sure how that happened. He also has a very big bruise on his neck where apparently mr. Bailey stomped his head. And he hit the offender with the mop bucket, he fell down and then his head was on the bucket and then according to the offender, he thinks that mr. Bailey steed on his head while his head was on the bucket. 
>> We spotted bailey on his way back to the prison segregation unit. 
>> You ain't ran professional. I'm about to change the format up in this, [ bleep ] you. 
>> A few days later, bailey told us prison officials had the wrong man. 
>> The guy got hurt pretty bad, and they figured because of my history and my reputation and my presence there that I would have to be somehow involved in that. I was never involved in anything. They just snatched me up as a result of my reputation before me 
>> bailey claimed he was not only innocent of the assault but had actually tried to help the victim. 
>> First thing I did is say, hey, you guys, this guy is in here on the floor spitting up blood. I did that, and as a result, this is the thanks I get? All because of my reputation being, he's this monster when that violence is unleashed. That's not right, man. I didn't do that mess in there. 

[00:56:13]


>> Our crew later joined dr. Matisa during his first meeting with bailey following the assault. 
>> Mr. Bailey -- 
>> what's up, man? 
>> Not much. Took me about a week to gather my thoughts before I could come back and see you. 
>> Yeah, but you already did everything else. Kicked me out of the program, threw me under the bus. 
[ Bleep ] I'm not going to bother with him anymore. You kick me out of the [ bleep ] program. But them other guys -- 
>> you think I can keep you in the program when you almost killed the guy? 
>> He ain't dead. We don't subscribe to -- some others are up there, they were up there fighting, they didn't get cast away. 
>> That's the most brutal assault I've seen there in two years. 
>> Are you saying I did that? 
>> You and I know that you did it. 
>> Nah, can't put words in my mouth. 
>> Whatever they do with this, that's up to them. You're not going back on that unit. 
>> I'm not trying to go back on that unit. My objective was reached 
>> that's the thing that really pisses me off and you really 
[ bleep ] on that. 
>> I had not planned that. How would that benefit me? Listen, my reputation proceeds me. I'm going to bring [ bleep ] today and give it to him and start fresh the gift of life. I didn't do that. I didn't do that. 
>> We heard off camera from various inmates who were present during the assault what had happened. Nobody would go on camera, though, and discuss it because then they'd be labeled a snitch. And I was privy to the photographs of darren's victim. And it probably was the worst assault I'd ever seen. I was shocked that man lived. 
>> Some day we'll talk about this and it'll make sense to both of us. Right now it just doesn't fit all together, but that's okay. Take care of yourself. 
>> You too, mr. Matias. 
>> Man, I didn't think I was going to get that heated, man. I didn't think I was going to get that heated. I almost went there. 
>> Later, with the personal camera our producer let him use, bailey told a different story. 
>> Things look different to me now. Want to call it. I dropped the ball. I don't like it. I disappointed myself and i disappointed my supporters. And I have a lot of people that are in my corner, but because i somewhat relapsed, if you want to call it, that's kind of -- these people have been something that no one given me during the course of my incarceration. Which would be a simple chance. 

[00:58:46]


>> Indiana was the first prison to allow inmates to use these little personal cameras that we left the and it turned out that the inmates would actually reveal a lot more intimate details using these personal cameras than they would when we were present. And in darren's case, he pretty much admitted to committing this assault. 
>> Susan just popped up, and she wants her property back. See, I told you it was borrowed time, man. So -- so it was nice doing this for susan & company. So I have to return to where i started from, the blackout. So you guys have a nice day. Thank you for listening to me. Good-bye.

(male announcer) Previously on masterchef... Oh, my god. (announcer) Felix won the mystery box and took control oh, my god. (announcer) Of the elimination challenge. And with only one goal... Monti's going home. Sorry, felix, but she did nail it. Better luck next time. (announcer) But in the end, tali was sunk. It's masterchef, not masturbate. (announcer) Tonight... [mooing] The contestants kick up their spurs and rustle up grub for a posse of cowboys. Oh, my god. That's a lot of freakin' cowboys. (announcer) Egos clash... If this fails, it's on her. They are big-time bitches. (announcer) And christine's station... Fire! (announcer) Goes up in flames. Can you help me? [bleep]. Oh, my god. (announcer) In the end, it's a pressure test that's heartbreaking... Wow. (announcer) As one more masterchefhopeful ends their journey. Your time is done. [crying] [bird squawking] (announcer) 60 miles east of the masterchefkitchen, the remaining eight home cooks have been brought to norco, horsetown usa, where they'll face off in a team challenge of epic proportions. I don't know where we are. But there is an intense smell of cow manure. [mooing] O.M.G. Here comes gordon and joe, riding up all smooth and suave on two horses. Oh, they're so cute. Chef ramsay looks really sexy on a horse. [cheers and applause] Yeah! Come on, big boy. [laughter and cheering] Whoa. Whoa. [laughs] [cheers and applause] Howdy. all: HOWDY, CHEF. In 1 1/2 hours from now, 101 hungry cowboys will be galloping up here, 

[00:04:02]


and your job is to feed them. Oh, my god. I can tell you what cowboys like to eat: Beef. Yeah. (Graham) In those wagons, you'll find amazing usda choice new york strip and rib eye steaks, as well as fresh produce, all from walmart. You'll be split into two teams. Each team will cook 101 thick steaks, plus two sides. Each cowboy will eat some grub from the red team and the blue team. Then they'll hang a horseshoe for the team that served them their favorite meal. The first team to 51 votes will win. The losing team will face the dreaded masterchef pressure test. Frank and monti, the two of you had the best dishes in the last elimination test. So, obviously you'll be team captains today. Time to pick your posses. I'm gonna be the best team captain masterchefhas ever seen. Frank, you had the best dish of the elimination challenge, so you get to pick first. Well, the first person, she's my biggest competition. So I like to have that on my team, becky. (Gordon) Becky, wow. Come over. Excellent. Monti. (Monti) I want a team of underdogs. I relate to the underdogs. I am an underdog. And I feel like underdogs have fight. I admire this person's creativity in the kitchen. I'd like to choose stacey. (Gordon) Stacey, wow. Wow. The next person is gonna be josh. Whoo. (Gordon) Josh, wow. Monti, next pick. David martinez. Wow. Wow. Look at you. Frank, I mean, this pick, you're picking for both teams. Yeah. (Christine) I'm not surprised that I'm near the bottom pick. Obviously since I'm blind, it's difficult for me to get around, and that's definitely frustrating for me. Uh, I have to come down to one, it's just becaus I've worked with her on a team before. 

[00:06:03]


It's gotta be felix. (Gordon) Felix. Christine? Yes, chef? Last pick again. Yes. On a personal front, you, for flavor profile, would be my first pick. Thank you, chef. At this point, I want to prove myself to the entire team that I'm more than capable of being out in the field and-- and cooking alongside the rest of them. (Gordon) Blue team, captained by monti. Red team, captained by frank. (Frank) My team is literally the dream team today. They are people that are able to share ideas and work together as a team. Since the very beginning, we told you that masterchefwould be full of twists and turns, and here comes another one. In the real world, great chefs have to adapt and focus on delivering great dishes, even when they're working with people they don't necessarily have confidence in. Frank and monti, both of you, please take a step forward. Take off your aprons. Ugh. Aww. Now switch them. Oh, my god. I knew it. And go and join your new teams. Wow. Aww. GET THE [bleep] OUT OF HERE Right now, man. I just picked the best team, and he's switching it off. All right. Whoo! I think my new team probably just hates the fact they got stuck with me as a team captain. You've got 90 minutes to prep. And then one hour to serve 101 cowboys. Treat these gorgeous steaks with the respect they deserve. Your time starts... Now. Good luck. (announcer) Both teams have just 90 minutes before 101 cowboys arrive. The red team has decided to cook a rib eye steak. But now they need to agree on their two sides. I have a sweet potato that I would like to mash. (Josh) Monti said she wants to cook sweet potatoes. And I'm thinking, "no, it just too much time 

[00:08:05]


"having to peel, chop, and cook all those damn potatoes for 101 people." And then I need ideas for the other side. I think baked beans would be good. I wanna do barbecue baked beans. I can make a huge pot of it, we can put it on the heat and that's good. That's easily 100 portions. We don't have to overthink it, and it'll be really great with steak. No, is there green beans? Nah, no salad. Yeah, there's green beans. Let's good look. We got green beans right here too. Let's do green beans, in a spicy sauce, in a hot sauce. We can use maybe the chilis. I just don't think this reads cowboy enough. (announcer) Despite concerns from her teammates, monti has decided that the red team will be serving their rib eye steak with sweet potato mash and spicy green beans. (Becky) She has chosen this menu. If this fails, it's on her. (announcer) While not everyone on captain monti's red team likes her vision for their dish, over on the blue team, frank is taking a more collaborative approach. Who knows how to make a sauce? I can make a delicious barbecue sauce. Okay, you're good. I can make an awesome garlic mash. (Frank) Okay, now vegetables, what do we think? (Stacey) I'm thinking corn. Awesome. Sounds good. (announcer) The blue team has decided on a new york strip stk with garlic mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and stacey's barbecue sauce. So a key to the good barbecue sauce that I make is that it's sweet, smoky, and hot. (Graham) So when you're looking at a steak, what exactly are you looking for? Oh, when I looked athose steaks, they were perfect. That ruby red intense color, e marbling. They were perfectly thick. These are some real, real, primo steaks. (Gordon) Those steaks are 16 ounce thick. So, you know, they've gotta be cooked properly. You give a cowboy a rare, almost raw steak, then they're gonna kick up a stink. Made a dry rub, and I'm rubbing down these steaks. They're gonna be nice and savory and spicy. I really wanna make those cowboys come down to their knees when they bite into this. [horse neighing] (announcer) The cowboys are just one hour away. On the blue team, captain frank has begun the task of pre-searing the steaks. But on the red team, captain monti has delegated this crucial task to becky. 

[00:10:07]


Becky? Yes? What's going on? Uh-- did you just take control? Did you take monti's job as captain? No, absolutely not. You're manning the grill. You're front and center. She's back there cutting beans. Looks like that's what happened. She chose me to man the grill. I asked her if she wanted to do it. She wanted me to do it. So I said, "you know, whatever you want." But you agree that, you know, manning the grill is like pole position, right? That's what I thought. That's her choice. If she wants to cut vegetables and then put one of her team members on the most important station on the entire freakin' challenge, then by all means. (announcer) As becky sears off the steaks for the red team, frank has assigned blind cook christine to grill the corn. But she's left the dry outer husks on. The grill is on fire, guys. I don't know why it's on fire. There's fire. Fire! Can someone turn this corn, please? (Gordon) Come on then, don't stand there. You guys gotta move a little bit. (Christine) Can you help me? [bleep]. If we lose because of this, it's totally coming down on me. [bleep]. vegetarian! Yeah, I might have ears like a rabbit... but I want to eat meat! [ Male Announcer ] Iams knows dogs love meat. ...but most dry foods add plant protein, like gluten Iams never adds gluten. Iams adds 50% more animal protein, [ dog 2 ] Look at me! I'm a lean, mean flying machine [ dog 1 ] I am too! Woo hoo! [ Male Announcer ] Iams. With 50% more animal protein. [ dog 2 ] I'm an Iams dog for life. Not a rabbit. Woof! 

[00:12:30]


cream gone... But what about your wrinkles? Neutrogena???? rapid wrinkle repair visibly reduces fine lines and wrinkles in just one week. Why wait if you don't have to. Neutrogena????. [horse neighing] The grill is on fire, guys. (David) I got it. I got it. I'm helping you out, christine. (announcer) With just 50 minutes remaining before the cowboys arrive for their masterchefcookout, the blue team is scrambling to put out the fire from christine's corn. 

[00:14:30]


(David) I put the blind girl on the grill. I can't believe I did that. (Christine) I didn't know the grill was so damn hot. (Frank) It's kind of a bump in the road, but we're getting over it. (Christine) Sorry, guys. Fire's out. Fire's out. (Christine) Thanks. (Gordon) Guys, 45 minutes to go. (announcer) As the blue team tries to salvage christine's corn, over on the red team, becky is struggling to man the grill. What are you going for here? These are already medium. I'm not trying to get 'em to medium. These are medium, though. I can tell you that right now. Monti, these steaks are all overcooked. They're all already medium to medium-well. (Monti) I don't know what the misunderstanding is, but becky starts cooking the steaks, not just searing them. (Joe) All overcooked. Josh, I need you to get on the grill, please. We're only given 105 steaks. 1/4 of our steaks are overdone. WE'RE [bleep]. (Joe) Big problem on the red team. All the steaks are overcooked. Monti's called josh over, but it might be too late, I don't know what kind of damage becky did over here. (Gordon) By the time they've rested, they'll be well-done. They're well-done. And then, heated up again. (Gordon) Like you don't want to eat a well-done steak, which is crazy. (Joe) Look at the rhythm of the blue team compared to the red team. I think frank's leadership is really coming to bear. David. He's in control. And they're taking a cue from his confidence and his cool. And it's permeating the whole team. Amazing. (Gordon) 60 minutes gone. 30 minutes to go. You see, this is gonna be your problem. Quick, take these out. Look what's on the bottom. (announcer) While joe has just praised frank's leadership, he's suddenly concerned with the way the blue team is resting their steaks. You can't stack up steaks-- I mean, look at this. Those steaks on the bottom are, like, submerged in, like, an aquarium of blood. See the heat coming off? Yeah. They're basically poaching. They're, like, going from medium-rare to medium. Yeah, all the juices are just coming out. I mean, look at this. Yeah. I just--i don't know where else to put it, joe. You know what I mean? You gotta spread 'em out. Look what the red team's doing. They got steaks all over the place. What was before was crispy and caramelized is now kinda gooey, dude. You gotta really be careful with this. (announcer) As frank tries to rescue his steaks, on the red team, monti is concerned they won't have enough of one of their side dishes. 

[00:16:32]


Well, this is not 100 servings. (Becky) Do you see how small that plate is and how huge our steak is? Trust me, I was serving last time for that military challenge. We need more potatoes. It's gonna be tough getting the potatoes done, but I know that we can do it. [horses galloping] [neighing] Frank? Yes? (Gordon) Have a look at the hill. There you go. That's a lot of freakin' cowboys. Oh, my god. (Gordon) Those cowboys will be arriving any minute now, guys. Careful, chef, top of the left one's super hot.

(Becky) Looks like a picturesque western scene. But it's also very daunting. Like, "oh, that's a lot of people to feed." Throw on some more steaks. Coming in. (Gordon) Okay, red team, blue team, your one hour service begins. Let's go. both: HOWDY. How we doing? How are you? (announcer) The cowboy cookout has begun. Good to see you.

(announcer) The blue team is serving a new york strip steak with stacey's sweet and smoky barbecue sauce, garlic mashed potatoes, and grilled corn on the cob. How you doing, cowboys? You have a good ride in? Oh, yeah. Red team or blue team? At the moment, I'm gonna have to go with the steak on the, uh, red team. For you? So far, I think I'm going blue team. Here you go, enjoy. Thank you. These steaks are so tender. I can't believe you can get things like this at walmart. The blue plate, the steak is incredible. I love it. The sauce is awesome. Is killer. I'm a sweet potato girl. I love sweet potatoes. And these are really good. More potatoes, please. More sweet potato. Where are the sweet potatoes? That's all we got. (Gordon) Are they cooked? Are they cooked? No, they are not cooked. AH, [bleep]. Here we go. (announcer) It's less than five minutes into service and despite making two batches of sweet potato mash, the red team is about to run out. We need more sweet potatoes, please. (Monti) How do you go through a whole hotel pan of potatoes in five minutes? I'M [bleep]. We need more sweet potatoes immediately. [bleep]. Oh, my god. My dream of being the greatest team leader alive is plummeting quicker than I CAN SAY, "HOLY [bleep]." This is not possible. amazing. Let's test it. [ whirring ] CHEESE ME. [ beeps ] [ beeps ] Ohh!

[00:23:55]


(Monti) We are out of sweet potatoes for right now, ladies. Oh, my god. This is not possible. (announcer) For this team challenge, the red and blue teams are each serving steaks with two side dishes for 101 cowboys. It's five minutes into service, and already the red team has run out of sweet potato mash. Red team, come here. Come here, come here, come here. Yeah, that means you as well, becky. Come here. We've served 25 cowboys. We've run out of sweet potatoes. I just find it embarrassing. 'Cause we all look SO [bleep] STUPID. None of you know what's going on. We're gonna make it work. Whatever sweet potatoes we can get, we're gonna get out, immediately. Monti's main job from the very beginning was sweet potatoes. That was the job that she set for herself. What the hell happened? Please explain to them, becky and felix, that we have no starch. We have no starch right now. We ran out of our sweet potatoes. No sweet potato? No, I'm so sorry. Guys, 45 minutes to go. (announcer) As the red team scrambles to make more sweet potato mash, the judges check in on the cowboys and girls to see whose food they're liking better so far. So, ladies, you like the blue team or the red team's? I like the blue with the sauce. (Joe) The barbecue sauce you liked? Blue or red? I pick this one. (Graham) Really, red? Yeah,mm-hmm. Blue, blue? This sauce is amazing. (Joe) What is about the blue sauce? Everyone's talking about the blue sauce. I wanted to put it on both steaks. Oh, right on. Thank you, man. I'd say one out of three of those cowboys asked me for my recipe. They wanna buy it. They wanted more. California girls know how to make barbecue sauce. [horse neighing] (announcer) It's halfway through service, and the red team is still frantically working on a new batch of sweet potato mash, as the 101 cowboys begin casting their votes. The first team to 51 votes wins. Just pick up a horseshoe and please come up and vote. Is it the red team or the blue team? Go blue! Go blue! Go blue! 

[00:25:58]


Red! (Gordon) Start at number one. Excellent. One vote to the blue. (Frank) All right, blue! Whoo! (Gordon) Number two. Wow, that's two. Whoo-hoo! We ran out of our starch today, but hopefully our steak will win you over. I'm going blue. (Gordon) Ananand lucky number three. Blue on the way. Please, please, please. [sighs] Blue again! That's what I'm talking about. (Becky) People are just going up and it's, like, blue, blue, blue. And every single time, it's just like a shot to my heart. (Gordon) Eight to the blue. Zero to the red. Where are you going? You're crankin' the red. One to the red, finally. God bless you. (Gordon) Another one for the blue. Blue team! (Monti) I don't know what the blue team is serving. Apparently it came with a side of gold, because the cowboys loved it. Come on, red team, do not give up. Oh, red, fantastic. Whoo! That's it. (Gordon) Blue again. (David) Is this really happening, man? Are we really this far ahead? 12, 29. Yes! What happened over there? WHAT THE [bleep] Did they cook? I'm so sorry that we ran out of our sweet potato puree, you guys. Comin' with the potatoes. Coming in. (Becky) Whoo, love it. (announcer) With plenty of cowboys left the serve, the red team finally has more sweet potato mash while on the blue team, joe discovers their popularity is slipping. 'Cause blue may be a little bit too overcooked, yeah. The blue plate, you know, I like it to be less cooked. That's how I like it, so-- here you go. There you go. Thank you so much. Funny enough frank, the only complaint I'm getting is on your station. The steaks are overcooked. I'M lOING THE BEST I can, joe. (Joe) Well, you better do better. Not happy people. I've never cooked so many steaks in my life. It's overwhelming to sit there in front of a grill and have 40 steaks going at once. So now I'm a little bit worried about that. Nobody likes an overcooked steak, man. If I ruin the steaks, I [bleep] US. What are you feeling? Reds versus blues. This just really hits home, and the green beans are fabulous too. So all three at this table are going red? 

[00:27:59]


Yeah. Beautiful. Yeah! Let's go, baby. (Gordon) Another for the red team. Yeah, ank you! I'm gonna go with the red plate. Whoa, red again, yes! Damn it. We're at 40 and then, red starts getting a comeback. They're, like 20, 25, 30. WHAT THE [bleep] Is going on? Comeback! We're the comeback kids! (announcer) It's the final minutes of the cowboy cookout, and all plates are out. Now both teams wait anxiously for the final votes. It's still up for grabs, guys. Let's . So service ends, and it's kind of like blue, blue, blue, blue, red, red, blue, blue, blue, red, red. They have a significant lead on us, but I'm absolutely not giving up. (Gordon) 36 for the red team, and 49 for the blue team. Come on, two more, two more. (announcer) The blue team needs just two more votes to win the team challenge. Can the red team make one last dramatic comeback? Cowboy, where are we going? Blue! Blue! Blue! Go, blue team! Blue! [cheering] One more vote for the blue team, and frank will have led his team to victory. Where you going, sir? [cheering] Go, red! [cheering] Another one for the red team. Thank you, sir. (Gordon) Here w cowgirl, if you vote blue team, the red team will be facing a pressure test where one of them will be leaving masterchef. Come on. Please, please, please. Red team or blue team? Oh! 

[00:30:00]


[cheering] Blue team, congratulations. [exclamations] (David) I really couldn't do it without the team. Everybody brought their "a" game. Everybody made something that they have passion for. That's the reason why we won. Red team, unfortunately you must face the dreaded pressure test. (Josh) I think we would've won if frank was the leader, because frank clearly had the better idea. His menu was ten times better than monti's. Yeah, a one in four chance of going home and that-- ugh, god. It makes my stomach hurt even thinking about it. [horse neighing] story. Of course, some stories are bigger than others. Okay guys, here we go. Everybody say, 'cheeeeeeeee-eeeeeese'. Got it. 

[00:34:35]


(announcer) After winning the team challenge, the home cooks from the blue team take to the balcony, while the losing red team awaits a pssure test where one contestant will be sent home. (Monti) Going into the pressure test, I feel like I deserve it. I have absolutely put together the worst performance of leadership in the history of masterchef. (Gordon) Come down and stand in front, please. Thank you. We lost, but I busted my ass. I did not question my leader. I'm not at fault, you know? (Joe) It's now time for you to compete in another pressure test. And when it's done, at least one of you will be eliminated frommasterchef. There are four of you. But only three of you will be fighting out in the pressure test. The choice of who gets immunity is up to you four. [whispering] Oh, my god. The four of you are gonna head into the wine room now. And you're gonna come out here with one name, the one person that you feel that does not deserve to face this intense pressure test. Got it? Got it, chef. Let's go. So immediately, I'm taking myself out of the equation. I feel like felix performed the best yesterday, and I would like her to have safety. (Josh) I disagree. Felix, what did you actually do? I rubbed down the steaks. I peeled and cut potatoes. Okay, I had my hands in everythin I started the butter for the butter sauce. I seasoned, I tasted. I asked what needed to be done. She really did try to fill in the gaps. I think we all did a little bit though. You guys, I feel responsible for this. I think all of us made mistakes yesterday, but I think felix made the least. I disagree. Felix isn't really saying much, because she knows deep down in her heart 

[00:36:37]


THAT SHE DIDN'T DO [bleep] And shshouldn't have that immunity. Becky, who do you think should have immunity? I'm gonna say myself, just because I think that I did everything that I could. Becky, you cooked off 25 steaks well-done. You didn't temp them, and I had to switch you out with josh because you couldn't handle it. I don't think we switched out because I couldn't handle it. We switched out because it was 100 steaks. Let's go. We need a name. Okay. Would the person you have all agreed that should be safe please step forward? Okay, felix, you are safe. Please join the gallery. I'm sorry, you guys. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, josh. It's all good. I feel like I was the workhorse of the group and I really helped keep the team together. Felix, she wasn't a critical part of our team. Under this cloche will be one of your undoing-- the simplest of ingredients. (Gordon) That's right. We're giving you each six amazing, delicious eggs. And you're gonna give us one perfect soft-boiled egg, one impeccable sunny-side up fried egg, one stunning, perfect poached egg, and then one absolutely phenomenal three-egg omelet. Got it? Yes. Yes, chef. Cooking a perfect egg is culinary school 101. Cooking six in four different preparations, all timed to perfection? 

[00:38:38]


That's the kind of skill that's required of a masterchef. Take a deep breath and head back to your stations. Here's the thing about eggs. They are big-time bitches. You can overcook an egg in five seconds. You have to time it to the second, or you are going home. In just over 20 minutes, one of you will be leaving the masterchefkitchen. Six eggs, no extras, no backups. Your time starts... Now. (announcer) All three home cooks now just have 20 minutes to prepare one sunny-side up egg, one poached egg, one soft-boiled egg, and a three-egg omelet. This is a tough one. This really is tough. 20 minutes, six eggs, no room for error. Every day I come into this kitchen, I gotta put everything I have. And that's what I'm gonna do today. I don't believe I deserve to be in this pressure test, but it is what it is. You gotta do what you gotta do. (Gordon) Who do you think's gonna be the most competent here? I think, you know, josh. I just imagine, you know, yeah, that he's got some breakfast skills. I think that becky has the inherent skill, but she's very angry. If she lets that anger control her cooking technique, it might be jeopardy. All right, josh, how are you feeling? Feeling great, chef. Which egg are you most worried about? The poached egg. I've never poached an egg. I love my eggs sunny-side up, so-- (Gordon) You sound down, deflated. Come on, keep it up, yeah? Yes, chef. Okay. Just coming up to five minutes gone. Come on, monti. Hello. How are you? I'm doing okay. I'm a little nervous. I don't usually eat sunny-side up eggs. I just like over easy eggs. Who do you want to go home? Monti, becse I think she's my biggest competition right now. 

[00:40:38]


Good luck. (Joe) You just put that in? Yes, sir. Which egg are you most worried about? I'm worried about my soft-boil. Think you could be going home? No, sir, I'm not going home today, no, sir. Last ten minutes. Here we go. The perfect poached egg-- you get the water, you season it lightly, a touch of vinegar in there. Crack the egg into a ramekin, and then drop the egg into the water. As it rolls around, it forms almost like a sort of mozzarella ball. Becky, trimming it up. Gentle, gentle, gentle. Good lookin' egg, josh. She just put the egg in boiling water. You gotta start those cold. (Gordon) Just coming up to five minutes to go. The risk for a home cook is, like, look around, see who's got the flames up the highest. That's gonna be the person who's gonna lose, because the loser in this game is high heat. Monti's got all her burners on full blast. (Gordon) The last two minutes. Two minutes to go. (Monti) The time is going by so fast. I still don't have any eggs cooked. (Gordon) 90 seconds to go. I'm not going home on an egg, dude. I'm not going home on an egg. sunshine,

(announcer) In this pressure test, three of the four home cooks from the losing team are cooking six eggs four different ways in just 20 minutes to see who stays and who leaves the masterchefkitchen. 30 seconds to go. Looks good, becky. Come on, monti. She should be taking the egg out of the pan now. What's monti doing? Monti. (Gordon) Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, and stop. Hands in the air. (David) Good job, guys. And bring your eggs to the front bench, please. I know I have two beautiful eggs, one disgusting looking omelet, and one beautiful looking sunny-side up egg with raw egg whites on it. Salmonella. That's what I wanna give the judges today. Okay. Monti? Yes, sir? So the sunny-side up, let's start with that one, shall we? It's got this rawness to the top. How come it's still raw? It didn't cook long enough. It's a shame, tastes nice. But you've got some unwanted goo, all right? Yes, sir. Yes, man, please. I hope everything else is just as raw as that one. Omelet-- that looks very flat. It looks more like a sort of crepe from here. Tastes nice. It's just a little bit too flat. Poached egg, how long'd you poach it for? (Monti) Three minutes. Mm-hmm. So I'm expecting that to sort of just open up and almost spill. I hope so, sir. 

[00:48:06]


(Gordon) It's beautiful. Yep, nicely seasoned. Runny. Tastes nice. Good. Soft-boiled egg. Ohh. Beautiful. Perfectly executed, and timed to perfection. Good job. Thank you, sir. Interesting. The, uh, poached was done beautifully. The soft-boiled egg, that was perfect. Hi, becky. So, the sunny-side up, the fried egg. The first thing I'm looking at is the yolk. Sunny-side up, right? I mean, it should look like a beautiful sunny day. And, you know, it looks like a cloudy day. It's absolutely fried. The egg is shrunk up. You know, the whites have seized. Great flavor, but definitely chewy due to the cook. The omelet looks like it would come out of any four-star kitchen. It's beautiful. Yeah, that's--that's like sex on a plate. That creamy texture, it's wonderful. Beautiful omelet. All right, so the poached. Should be able to pierce it and see it explode. That's got a definite wow factor. [exhales] Awesome. You can almost take the egg and-- 

[00:50:14]


it's a great poached egg. The soft-boiled, it all rests on this now. I think that the worst thing would be is if I served them a hard-boiled egg instead of a soft-boiled egg. That soft-boiled egg, that could be what keeps me here or sends me home. It really could. It's such a wild card. It's almost an unboiled egg, not a soft-boiled egg. That's a shame. Jeez. [chuckles] That's earrassing. The omelet was incredible. Yes, and even if you don't eat soft-boiled eggs, at this point, you need to know how to cook one. (Graham) You need to know. Okay, josh, which of the eggs are you most proud of? I would have to say the omelet. What do you think of your fried egg? I'm pretty satisfied with it. (Joe) How often do you make fried eggs? Pretty often. Do you think the yolk will be completely runny in the middle when I cut it? Yes. (Joe) And right you are. That is a perfectly cooked sunny-side egg. It's delicious. The omelet. Think we're gonna fluffiness in the middle, or am I gonna see, like, a dense custardy omelet? It will be fluffy. Ooh. That's a fluffy omelet. This is fried custard. And it tastes like fried custard. Damn, man. I hope these other two eggs are cooked just right. Right now, it's anybody's game. So when I cut through the poached, I should see runny yolk and then the white should be soft, but not like a hard-boiled egg. Exactly. I'd love to have a little bit more delicacy. 

[00:52:16]


The egg white here looks pretty violently boiled. For me, the whole process is basically 30 to 45 seconds gone too far. Okay, to the boiled. We've had one pet soft-boiled, one raw soft-boil. I'm feeling nervous. I'm just hoping the soft-boiled egg is cooked through, because that's probably my only saving grace right now. What's happening inside this egg could determine who wins $1/4 million. (Becky) I'm petrified. If that egg is bad, I think I might have a chance. But if his egg is perfect, I'm gonna be going home.

(announcer) The judges have tasted all the eggs but one in this pressure test. Josh's soft boiled egg could decide which contestant is sent home. What's happening inside this egg will determine who wins $1/4 million. [suspenseful music] 
??????   ??????
the yolk is raw cold. The white is not even cooked at all. If you like cold egg yolks and undercooked egg whites, maybe. But for the rest of us, it's raw. Difficult. Sunnyside was very nice. My only solace right now is that maybe josh screwed up his eggs worse than I did. Highs and lows. I'm nowhere near ready to go home, but this last egg may have just been my ticket home. Monti, step forward, please. Those last 20 minutes in that pressure test showed us great flair, great composure. Monti... Go... Upstairs to the balcony. Well done. Thank you. Great job. Good job.

>>> This morning, my question -- why is it easier for a turkey to get a pardon than a person? 
>>> Plus the other second term. How the first lady will use her fex four years. 
>>> And the castle bribe lynn built. First, it's thank giving weekend. We're talking about the american family in all its many shades of gray. 
>>> Good morning. Thanks for joining us. The holidays, lots of food, shopping and family. How we welcome them when they visit and how we love to wave exhaustedly as they part. Family is a small by powerful world that defines an increasingly diversion array of relationship. The definition has gone through a revolution, so be careful ABOUT RHO MANT SIZING THAT 1950s "Leave it to beaver" family, yes. 
>> Translator: Families that consist of one man and one woman happily married to each other action never been married to anyone else, rearing only their biological children, born without any protective technology and born after the two adults were legally married. Yeah, that's a great kind of family, but there are many, many other fantastically loving, wonderful, creative, fulfilling and healthy way toss make family. Even jesus was born to an unwe had mom and raised by a doting stepfather. These days or film and television culture is finally keeping up with the variety that is family.

>>> with family it's about more than individual choices or cultural practices. It's also about policy. During slavery, men and women had deep bonds of love, attachment and mutual economiment, but those bonds were not protected by law. Because slaves were considered property, they did not have the right to legally married in any american colony or escape, because children blond to the slavers, men and women were only parents as long as iterved the purposes and timetable of the slaveholder. For most of american history, free white women could marry, but not anywherate divorce, couldn't own property or enter into contracts. But slavery is over and it's all equal at the altar of family now, right? Well, not exact. The policy of altar is still a defines framework. Married couples enjoin medicine, death, housing, not to mention social esteem. What if your family is a same-sex union? They only have rights in nine states. That leaves family in 41 states without access to the economic ben fizz? Since 1970, marriage rates have dropped more than 15% and divorce rates have climbed. Fewer people who can marry are choosing to do so. More people who do marry are choosing to exit. Last year the number of unmarried people in the united states was 44%, including single parents, those who are widowed and people happily choosing single life. It does not mean you are without family, about you law is often blind to these families and to those where kids being raised what if your kids are really your nephews or neighborhoods or grandkids. Narrow definitions are family can make anything that much harder and it can make adoption for lbgt families or single women tough if they're banned from marrying or if policy treats them as though their households are unstable. Can we even begin to talk about the quirky combinations of love, commitment and attachment when a family is made across lines of raids, geography, religion, how about those of us for whom means partners and work colleagues. Life partner or next of kin is not just about a piece of paper. Family is more varied and beautiful as it's ever been. At the table, marsha garrison professor at brooklyn law school and coed tore of "marriage at the crossroads, law, policy and the brave new world." Msnbc anchor and newly wed, thomas roberts. Webb, he and his wife have five kids. And aisha and director at the center for american progress. Her wife was recently honored as part of the root 100 for her work on environmental justice. Thank you all for being here. I greatly appreciate it. Marsha, what do you mean when you say the american family is at a crossroads? 

[00:06:05]


>> It's in many respects. We have an increasing rainbow of families no longer does the typical family look like the OZZIE AND HEART YESTERDAY '50s Family, but what we also see today is an increasing class divide in family formation, one that we can't celebrate, because it means that many of our families are increasingly stressed and unable to care for their children adequately. 
>> But part of it we need to be concerned are the economic circumstances nrch faemds find themselves. 
>> I tease you about the idea about who has five kids? 
>> Just me. 
>> Right. Because in part of the -- I'm the youngest of five, but it's a different economic circumstances that families are facing. 
>> My oldest now is in college, so you think about the wide range of costs we have to cover, I remember my parents paid for my college tuition through grants and, you know now it's tremendous stress for us to basically take care of all the bills we have to take care of and on top of that pay college tuition. 
>> So you have the full range of parenting and you are a two-parent household yell, the other piece -- it isn't just you make aot of money or you don't. Policy can influence and impact the quality of life that our families experience. 
>> Absolutely. You know, you just said that you have the luxury of a two-parent household. For families headed by same-sex partners having two parents in the household doesn't always provide the economic benefit, support and stability that one would expect, because in most states in our country, one of those partners may not be recognized as having a legal relation ship to those children, so they may not be able to carry them on insurance plans or do the things we take for granted, even things like pick them up from daycare or make medical decisions, because our laws are so ant dayed they're not recognizing the two duties it also also happen ift's the grandmother doing the care or ways in which we haven't fully expanded our economic or legal policies to fit the realities of our family. Thomas, we were having a great type in preparation for you coming, in terms of looking at your wedding photos, just the enjoyment of the idea -- 

[00:09:00]


>> good stuff, right?

>> it's great. There's my family, the roberts family, my mom and dad, these are all our nieces and nephews, under the banner of american family that's our youngest, braxton. There he is. The ainge ranges, we go up to 20, which is dylan our nephew, all the way down to braxton, who's about 4 this was a really big deal for us. Our families were there. Friends from first grade all the way up to our boss, phil. If you can imagine how great this is, and gavin newsom, lt. Governor of california, he flew in to marry us, testifies epic, so special. The best night of ourselves. 
>> I highly recommend it. Marry whoever you want to marry. In certain states, if you're part of the lesbian and gale community, you have that option to do that. It was so fulfilling. I grew up pretending a lot to fit in, pretending to be straight, and I find now, and you can probably speak to this as well. When you find your voice, you do not want to shut up about it. I have found my voice. Patrick and I were together 12 years up to the point where we got married, and we deserved that opportunity. 
>> I file like there's something, the 4-year-old on up, the fact -- it's not just you two making this choice, right? It's your whole families are participating in a way that contribute to an expanding definition of family for the 4-year-old all the way up. Given that we're looking at communities where people will have these expanded social understandings, how does that translate for us into policy? 

[00:11:05]


>> Well, it translates sever ways, first no question that weddings are joyous. 
>> It's good stuff. 
>> Good stuff for everyone, but as you noted earlier, americans are increasingly not marrying. What we're seeing is a growing class divide. Those who are college educated marry, and their divorce rates are actually no higher today THAN THEY WERE IN THE 1960s. These families are increasingly stable, increasingly able to offer this kind of joyous family opportunity and experience to their children. Couples at the low end of the economic spectrum increasingly are forgoing marriage, not because they don't want to marry, not because they don't value it, but because they feel they can't afford to. At the leading problem that these couples cite to why they're not marrying, is because they just don't have the money. They want that wedding of the sort that -- 
>> it ain't cheap. 
>> It ain't cheap. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> but these couples are still having children. That's why our nonmarital birthrate is so high and they couples at the low end of the socioeconomic spectrum have much higher rates of american dissolution. 
>> It's not exactly these questions, because we saw the issue of single parenting emerge as a political issue. Stay right there. We're going to come back and talk more about family life. Is it private or public? you? I heard you guys can ship ground for less than the ups store. That's right. I've learned the only way to get a holiday deal is to camp out.

But whether he's climbing everest, scuba diving the great barrier reef with sharks, or jumping into the market, he goes with people he trusts, which is why he trades with a company that doesn't nickel and dime him with hidden fees. So he can worry about other things, like what the market is doing and being ready, no matter what happens, which isn't rocket science. It's just common sense, from td ameritrade. From maine to maui, thousands of high school students across the country are getting in on the action by volunteering in their community. It's great, helping others, and it feels good, too.

>>> During this election season there were two kinds of family that came up for scrutiny. Same-sex couples wanting to married and single moms raising children. 2012 reminded us just how public some of our families are. Aisha, I don't think I will forget the mom in the dough bait when it sounded like mr. Romney was suggesting that gun violence is directly caused by single parents. 
>> When he said that I thought of columbine, kids with two couple -- presumably the typically healthy american family. This idea that the only families that can produce healthy children are those that have a mother and a father is really problematic. We have defied that over time. We've had single mothers raising wonderl children, a study came out recent that showed of less means and gale couples just as heady if not more resilient. This is a 2010 study. So, I mean, we can have whatever emotions we want to have have about it, but these are the new demographic. 
>> Lesbian couples of colors are just as likely toe raising children as straight women of color. The conversation we used to have about the double come no kids and gale couple just don't parent is completely untrue. Kids who are raised by same-sex parents are twice as likely to be living in poverty. That's something interesting that we need to talk about. When we talk about our policies and that are morn families, the new normal, we have to talk about the 2 million children being raised by parents in same-sex relationships. In part there's this enthusiasm about equality as it grows. I also worried about that piece that michael warner gave us. Not only do we sort of limit the opportunities for lbgt couples not living in states where they can matter is there a way to push for equality and say that -- 

[00:19:12]


>> aisha brings up the camp of specifically from an lbgt perspective and kids growing up. The big dream is to grow up get a good job and -- there's still discrimination. You still can't start your own families. So the american dream, there's a lot of pretending that goes on you don't have an example leading the way. It's a great question how we get outside of that. But there's a lot of work that stilled needs to be done there are states that are on the precipice those states are bordering where these step out. So it would be this election, to see four ballot initiatives go through on a popular vote is amazing. But to not get too excited about that win, it doesn't necessarily mean that other states will follow sued. 
>> I want to give you just one last word on this very briefly. If there was one policy, an economic policy that would support different sorts of families, what would be the one thing we would want to say? The expansion of marriage rights? A change in how we do health insurance? What would be the one thing? 

[00:21:14]


>> I don't think we can reduce it to one thing. Certain we need equality in marriage rights. That's an important paramount issue. For other families, certainly for all families we need more economic initiatives to help parentses raise their children in the way we would like. We need more tax benefits. We need higher child allowances, publicly funded daycare, an array -- 
>> I want to say that again -- we need publicly funded daycare. That 0 to 5.

>>> We're back. Now on our panel amy butler. You cut you off at the end action aisha. 
>> I just wanted to throw two things out there. We also should think about how we equal our adoption lines across the board. We have children in our country who are being raised by people who are not their biological parents. I was raised by my grandparents, and be it perhaps a parent that is a same-sex partner that doesn't have a legal to that child. If we could equalize our adoption laws to make sure that to make sure that gale partners or unmarried partners can adopt, that would cover the ability to safeguard children. 

[00:26:15]


>> We were looking, also adoptive family members. You look at unmarried couples only at the 2% rate. It includes heterosexual couples, but also smex couples. Obvious hear this -- if you choose not to do abortion, you always have adoption. Adoption is a loving option, which it is. It's also not equally available to all racial categories. I think there are so many narratives what families are supposed to look like. Plaque women can't find a man or the church says you have to make a family a particular way. How does that aspect of who we are fluent. 
>> That's just not true. If you decide to adopt, the first thing people say is couldn't you have just waited? I just had one of our graduate students in the program, she had a baby, and she wasn't married, SHE'S ALSO HAS A Ph.D.. She got flack from even people within the institution. 
>> A single reverend doctor. 
>> And she's a great mom, and she finished her program in five years. She was able to do it. 
>> She's also apparently superhuman. 
>> Well, yes, kind of. These are the things what family is about. Religious institutions put a lot of pressure. When I was in the church I got that same pressure. I can't do it. I can't way in the ways they think about it. My situation is not a perfect situation that I'm going to walk down the aisle with some guy, because none of these guys are what I need to begin with. 

[00:28:22]


>> But it doesn't mean you're family-less? 
>> Not at all. I had extended family. I have a great family, but when you're away and you need people to help us, there has to be people you can designate until your other family gets there. How can we designate someone to stand in that place. Definitions of family are just too narrow. They really are. 
>> Like if you don't have kids, who will help you in your old age. Part of this the -- if these things were human rights, one would not ned to form a particular family to make it happen. 
>> I've been trying to wrestle around this for a while, not just bay I have a family. I have these arguments a lot. It's normal for us to have a husband, wife and kids, we look askance at people that don't fit that. It's like what we have to do somehow is have to fight for a politics that takes into account kids and parents no matter how they're muched. If we don't, we'll have kids with poor consequences, a we'll continue to pit -- the one thing I push is we have these ideals of families that are working and these poor families that are not, when the reality is none of them are working. Right? They're all broken form the thing is we don't have the politics to publicize our private stresses, right?

>>> The whole affair inspired my her this week to one lucky bird. Dear cobbler, it's me, melissa congrats on of first nonhuman to receive a letter, and congratulations on spending the rest of the days at mt. Vernon. A good deal. Even though you didn't really need a pardon, as peta pointedous it's not as if you're guilty of anything. There are some who need presidential attention if they are going to have a second chance. Your beany of sent partner in chief has been reluctant to use pardoning power for, well, humans. Being a turkey, you may not know the details of american jurisprudence, but presidents have the power to commute sentences and pardo crimes. Pardon wipes up the conviction. Both offer a second chance. Now, an executive undoiedly should be jewel dish, but recent numbers from the depend of injures show that president obama has pardoned only 22 individuals while denies 1,019, just 2% of all requests processed. President reagan found 1 in 3 worthy of official forgive nim. George h.W. Bush was 1 in 16, bill clinton's 1 in 8, george w. Bush, a mere 3%. Compare that to more than half of the turkeys whose pardons he has granted now, according to legend, president abe ray ham lincoln pardoned a turkey back IN THE 1860s WHEN HIS SON TAD Beg for mercy on into of of the turkey, but lincoln biographer writes that he regularly and liberally used the pardon, because he believed government, quote, should avoid planting and cultivating too many thorns in the boss many of society. Despite his adoration, president obama has not followed this example. The result mae be that he's allowing resolvable injustices to persist. Though she's had no further legal transcription, is now married and working at the same company, she can't vote, can't travel out of the country, and is bar fred adopting a child. Cobbler, you got your problem, but katy 'request was denied. Luckily the white house has reviewed the case of aaron. 9 cobbler, you probably didn't catch our earlier segments on aaron's case. Now that you've been pardoned, maybe you can catch up on the mhp shows that you've missed or scratch out a her to the white house, asking the president to show as much mercy to humans in his second term as he's shown to poultry in his first.

>>> Okay. Does this happen to anyone? You're buttering a roll catching up with your cousin suddenly uncle fred says I just can't believe they reelected president obama. What in the world are those people thinking? It's like in the moment when the movie stops? Family and politics, happy ant acids, don't assume he's a right-wing tea party member. He might be your liberal uncle, the one with a subscription to "the nation" pays hi union dues -- why? Because despite the many differences, the left carried p.M. Many p to election. Many now see it as a time to take him to task. A recent article said we dodged the bullet of a mitt romney white house, so let's get back to reality. So the politics of family is not just about your dinner table. We will witness how all the cousins in the democratic party's electric terror family cope with the big daddy in the white house. You can't just stamp your foot and get your way, but the position most legislation still begins in the house. They need pressure to move their -- and congress has to believe that they will be punished political if they don't follow president obama's lead, which means he needs robust support. In a second tern, this is the left's best opportunity to shift the discourse and challenge the president to create meaningful -- folks, this is family and politics at its best. Back to my panel. All right, lester. What are folks going to be holding the president accountable for? 
>> I think there's an opportunity to create more push-back on the foreclosure issue action and I think there's an opportunity, the one thing the president really has that he hasn't used effectively is the bully pulpit. I think there's a tremendous opportunity for him to peel back that argument and actually carve out a new set of politics that allow for leftists to fight, right? I'm talking about foreclosure issue, student dead, talking about making it -- creating nick -- 

[00:44:13]


>> the positive issue is one that the president has had particular pushback. Not only do we need better unemployment rates, but living wages. 
>> Before we even get to the wages, I think we need to see what happens with the fills dale cliff showdown. This is an opportunity to say we are going to make that we are caring for poor people. We need to make sure the people at the top are paying their fair share, to support the folks at the bottom. How this conversation turns out, how he fights for really the people in the very bottom will be telling about how they works will we see that -- or will we see it say together. 
>> If you can get the, you know, upper echelon to pay their fair share, that would be a good shatter. He who cares the least has the most power. It's the used car definition of bargaining. So now as the president is thinking, and rightfully so about legacy with john boehner showing up, to say well, now, right after that going after repeal, it's wait a minute, we have lived through this and need to move on. They know they are in trouble, because they are losing voters, they're losing their messaging. They need this four years, especially the first two, if they want to keep the house, but they need this four years to turn it offer. That is no way to tack back the white house. This is a problem, and then we're going to yell at him. We can't say these kinds of things that does not maybe anybody change. What does make change is for people to be consistent. One example, souls to the poles. Let's get souls to the white house to talk about poverty, the issues in the african-american community right now of higher unemployment than everyone else, foreclosures, all these things, I think this is the time for these coalitions to come forth. This is the issue, not to be mean or anything, but every other coalition has something out of the president except the african-american community. Is this going to be -- 

[00:47:31]


>> the environmentalists. Exactly. But undoubtedly there's been clear irritation, but what i want to touch on there is how do you -- you're right, you don't just say you need to do better mr. President. What part of it could be about the legacy concern. Souls to the polls work, because you can vote somebody out of the office. What was mind -- blowing is what -- you're talking about california getting a super majority, a number of other states that happens, what can we do at the state level to begin organized people both in cities and in institution where we're already consequence gaiting. That's the thing. 
>> Which in many ways was the model of the civil rights movement. 
>> Even if you go to the model of montgomery, birmingham, you enup with local policy fights that end up leading to that -- not because king went and made a speech to johnson and said you need to do that, but because -- 
>> it rose up from underneath. 
>> That's exactly what you're talking about. Completely correct.

>>> We are not going to have a supreme court that will overturn roe versus wade, we're not going to repeal health reform.. We are not going to amend the . 
>>> We're back, talking about the politics. All right, lester. Glue we have to create more space, so in a ste lie maryland, it's $104 million jail for youth charged as an adult. We know what that means. It was a coalition of black youth and white left and occupied baltimore that actually stopped that, or at least kept it from taking place. So it's like that type of organizing is the type of things we have to create. Then that creates a moral incentive for the president and other legislators to do it. That's the only way we can actually win this. That's the only way. 

[00:53:28]


>> It's political pressure, too, right? If we're talking about organizing from the ground, we have to remember the president still has to deal with the house. 
>> Who will keep saying he's not compromising. 
>> This idea of negotiating and compromising is nothing that's working, because it's the president bumping heads, with that groundswell you're talking about, with the pressure on the sittings members of the house, that's the only thing that's helping the president to get things done. 
>> What I love about that is that it says it isn't yelling at the president, but the accountable is in part about say mr. Boehner, last week unfortunate aca was the law of the land. This week you're putting it on the table? No, we need health care in this country, so it's -- there is -- on the one hand there is an accountability on the president, but on the do mistic policy size, it could just be presidential. 
>> If we look at the success that the will. Bgt movement had, the immigration movement had in the first presidential term, you have to understand it wasn't president obama deciding he was going to wave a wand. It was the communities organizing on the ground trying to move policy working from the ground up that then created an environment and a climate where the president could move the ball down the road. I think that for other issues, we're talking about climate change, economic justice, otherwise it has to come from the ground up. 
>> Even on those two fronts action and what still needs to be done, there's still a long way to go. President obama did have this inclusion, a majority of minorities that came together, and everybody on this second term does expect to see some type of movement for them.

>>> Inauguration day, president obama will officially begin the second term, but also the start of the second term for the person right behis side and way ahead of him in approval numbers, first lady michelle obama. I've been watching her every move for the last four years, whether it was planting the white house garden or teaching us how to dougie. We have become well versed it didn't follow the hillary clinton model, putting her ivy league -- but it also didn't follow the completely traditional model of first ladies who, let's face it, have tended not to move around so much. No, michelle obama has carved out a unique way of being first laidly. Remember her official white house photo. What you might most recall about it is there are two things unlike any portrayed of any first lady, her left and right arms. Welcome to the gun show, america,ut look closer, something more remarkable. Right there in the room with her, looking out over her well-toned left shoulder is president thomas jefferson. By picking this backdrop, the first lady brought into the room another part of white house history, where women like her were treated like property instead of people yesterday, there she stands on the other end of the timeline, a living rebuke to that history. Possessed by no one herself. More than any of the women who held the title, michelle obama made herself the actual embodiment. As the most visible proponent, to tackle childhood obesity, she didn't talk the talk, she walks the walk or more accurately she runs. Over the last four years we've seen her racing barefoot, we've been shamed into stepping up our gym game after watching her drove and give us 20. And we've discovered she is not the one to play around with in a hula hoop context. As she was jumping double dutch just like it was yesterday on the south side of chicago, we listened to the way she ways the first lady. We noticed her way of being wife to the president. By judging that the fact this photo was the most retweeted message in twitter history. With me at the table. An theeia -- msnbc anchor thomas roberts. Lester spence, associate professor, and joining us is katy McCormick, levelle. Form, and how much of the michelle obama do we see that's an intention at portrayal.

>>> I actually thing it's 100% per. You know what we wanted to do was put her in these venues where she could be herself and relate to people on a level of shared experiences when you see her giving hugs, playing around with kids, she is is mom in chief. That is no joke. She's a warm, provenable, successful person. I know there was some sort of critique that emerged that said, you can't say mom in chief and i kept saying no, no, no, when an african-american woman says my family is more important than anything else, that's almost politically subversive in its political power. 
>> To give them credit, you know, you have to understand with african-american women where things have said about is being mothers and we're not good enough mothers or not paying attention, I think it was important for first lady obama to say this, first of all, and second, it's important to see her with the girls, two young african-american women being raised in the white house outside of the public eye on the one hand, but having this mother hovering around them. 
>> And the grandmother. 
>> I mean, that's that blended family again I think the second piece is to see her move, not be this figure that is static, with the imaging that came from conservatives on the right, with awful pictures and things they do. It's amazing she continues to go forwd and does what she does without reservation and hesitation. 
>> I had such mixed feelings about the hug picture. On the one hand I loved it, because I've been reelected and the most important thing I do is to hug my wife. But there's also this backbone of the community things that happens. In the sense we don't see her face. Am I way overreading that? 

[01:05:23]


>> I think you are. 
>> I obvious do that. 
>> For me I'm now an outsider, but it showed the power of their strength hand partnership. But when he first got to the white house, mrs. Obama made it clear she did not want -- she wanted to make sure whatever we are going to work on would have a strategic and impactively impact on people's lives, but she doesn't do a thing until she knew her girls were good. We met the different government departments, whether career or staff or new to the teams, because they were hear, we're the new game in town, and we were doing our home work, but it was not under those girls said we're good, soccer is good, friends are good, school is good, then we started, you'll see let's move took off a couple months after that. She's a political animal for sure. She's become the president's best weapon. I mean she is a force, because she's so likable, certainly to men and women alike. She'll show up, you know, with this $17 j. Crew sweater that you find in the back of the store, like you find a deal on the sweater. 
>> If you ask what did she accomplish? The answer is she was part of the team that got the president reelected. Talking before about first terms and second terms, that's the -- she's the wife of barack obama, but she is part of the team of president obama. In her role as team member, she effectively helped. In 2007 we called her the closer. There was so much about your story, whether a working woman, a daughter, a wife, that there's an opportunity for shared experience and relation-building and trust building. 
>> It's fascinate that it did. The discourse was somehow michelle obama would be the looblt to her husband, but by the end of the first term, she's the closer. 

[01:07:34]


>> What I remember is charles ogle tree, harvard law professor. He taught both of them. What he said was that michelle was the dope one -- I'm sorry, I'm using the academy -- michelle was the star. At no point in time did I ever not believe that she's actually the power in that power couple. It's just a matter of translating that to wider audiences. 
>> But there's danger in that, particularly in black communities, where the notion of this overwhelming black woman, like when you say that, I think like she's navigating both being powerful and also somehow not appearing to be emasculating. 
>> Yes, she has to of navigate that, and in that way she becomes a hillary clinton 2.0 there are constraints around what they could go, but with that said, I don't think she has to navigate that hurdle. In fact I think what she did, her presence -- her presence made it such that the only people who asked if barack obama was really black was stanley crouch and debra dickinson. Nobody else asked that question, because she was there, and because they saw how bad she was -- 
>> by which you mean -- 
>> I'm sorry, good. 
>> My first time on the show. 
>> When we come back, we'll talk about the first lady's second term and how it came to be that america fell in love with the first lady. When you give a child a toy, it has to work. ??????

[ Female Announcer ] People who choose more whole grain tend to weigh less than those who don't. Multigrain Cheerios right. 
Woman: My first symptoms were... 
Man: Constant tingling in my toes. 
Woman: My leg sometimes will go numb. 
Woman: I had double vision. 
Woman: They said, "you have multiple sclerosis." 
Woman: Well, the beginning is the hardest time. 
Man: I kind of had to get a grasp on reality. 
Man: I had to adapt and change very rapidly. 
Woman: I had to learn how to drive with my hands -- yeah, that was interesting. 
Woman: I was a dancer. I don't see walking the way I walk any different than doing a dance. It just looks different -- it's a different dance. 
Woman: You see me have an off day. It doesn't take away from who I am. 
Man: A symptom may cause you not to be able to do that anymore, and at one point, I was able to do any of those. 
Woman: Get out, exercise every day. 
Man: Since I've been cycling, it's definitely helped my walking. 
Man: I make a lot of changes in my life and just adapt to it. 
Woman: I'm going to acknowledge its presence, I'm not going to discount it, but at the same time, I'm going to try my best to not let it stop me. Woman: It's a fantastic opportunity to be working together with a common goal of curing ms, and sharing is the key. 
>>> New january 2009 after months of being mischaracteredized as angry, radical and unpatriotic, america fell in love with her. That's 25 percentage points higher than at the same time in 2008. At the peak at 72%, the first lady's approval numbers dropped only slightly. She had a 65% favor and, and she spoke at the democratic national committee convention in september. So it raises the question. In the next four years, how does she plan to spend that capital? Not -- to more than just sort of kids and family, but we should address environmental injustice. 

[01:13:34]


>> Yeah, I think she might be more effective without doing it in a policy ways. One of the things I wish she would push forward is the idea of everybody having a garden. To get kids out working in gardens is a great thing. The other thing I way thinks is how might she be able to think in a different ways of things historically, or what we see as a nation in the future. She has a different way and place to say that. To set the stage. For what happens after those four years. To say this is what I hope for our kids in the future, this is what I hope looks like for military families in the future. This is what I hoe we do vis-a-vis certain policy issues. 
>> I would say, following up on that, our families are becoming we er queerer, in a way. I think she can do an excellent job of transitioning us. She is has a strong rhetorical role to play. But her oldest is going to be college age, so I'm thinking about this student debt issue. You realize I have five tuitions I'm responsible for, and student debt is becoming -- most of the kids I'm teaching, you know, their parents are going into siifant debt to put them through school. Rhetorically she may start to create a spa to discuss. 
>> He's always been up-front that they both just paid off that you are student loans. Katy, you brought up about the environments mrs. Obama was placed in where she could truly shine and people could fall in love with her because of that. In first person exampling. You know, bei ability to talk about that, just like she's done with let's move. The other thing that's been amazing I think is the fact that she and dr. Jill biden have been very out front on vets' issues. 

[01:16:02]


>> Particularly hiring vets. 
>> And the other thing we had heard that I don't think we've ever heard from in any administration so vocally is about community college kids and they have been up front about praising community colleges and two-year degrees, and drawing attention to people who have been kind of shooed aside as if a two-year degree, well, that's just a two-year degree, but it's been exalted. 
>> We would say where policy and people intersect. She's getting out into the community and ensuring what the president and his team are working on are in line with what people really need. That's why when you look at let's move, it has the multifaceted -- kids are yanking carrots out of the ground, parents, doctors getting more involved. So we have another 25 years to this fight. 
>> Giving the fact that the last democratic first lady now secretary of the state there's an impulse to add whether or not michelle obama, still a very young woman when the terms are over, whether or not she is going to seek public office and public life? I have never seen anything in what she says or self-represents that suggests she wants to be abofficeholder, but I do imagine like an eleanor roosevelt sort of role for her when she becomes the moral conscience of the party, and becoming a rainmaker for legislative candidates over the years. 
>> Well, she gets that question a lot, will you run for president when your husband is out of office. E says absolutely not, no thank you. There are a lot of different ways you can effect change as she did. Public allying in chicago, she started that in 1993, the youth leadership programs lifting up young people. Once you've reached a goal, lifting up the people behind you. There's a lot you can do outside of elected office. 

[01:18:07]


>> Certainly the most diverse elected congress coming into session, while she might not be able to inject and helm policy, she can certainly throw her weight behind certainly elected leaders that are doing so. 
>> With 66% approval rating, there is political capital to be used there. Lester, thank you so much. I greatly appreciate it. When we come back, we're going to talk about this youth question. You're going to give up your seat to a young person. Remember that when they entered the white house, they were little girls. Now they'll leave at teens. Well to talk about the impact of sasha and malia obama, next.

[01:22:27]


>>> When the president first vowed to bring change to america, a few of us could have imagined at the time how applicable that would be to the two little girls to join him and the first lady in the white house. Malia and sasha have been one of the most visible reminders of the four years that passed. We've watched them grow from chubby-cheeked little girls to poised, statuesque young ladies, who are giving their mother a run for her money for style icons. By the time he leaves office, malia will be old enough to cast a vote. 
>>> Joining us is a member of that panel and one of our nerdland favorite people. 18-year-old emily carpenter, a youth organizer and senior at new york's school for the future. Nice to see you. 
>> Nice to see you, too. 
>> Realizing that malia obama will be of voting age when her father leaves office made us want to talk to someone who is part of this malia generation. What difference if at all, or if any, has made you to have the obama daughters in the white house. 
>> Good question. I feel like so when I was -- i believe I was 14 when his first term started. I was really excited, but I was really young, I didn't know what that was going to mean for me to have the obama family in the white house. Over the past four years, seeing someone who kind of looks like me has been even more influential, and for my little cousins to see people in position of power and positions that mean -- so to see mostly the people younger than me to see sasha, malia, michelle, and president obama is really important. 
>> On the one hand you get this amazing -- my daughter was just a little girl when they were elected. They would really grow up with them. But we have the realities of urban youth and how tough it still is for kids to be symbols. Do younger people talk about the politics and economics, student loans, jobs? 

[01:24:49]


>> They do. They do talk about those things. I feel like -- I'm sorry -- they do talk the things like paying for college. That's the biggest topic right now, how are we going to pay? Who is going to pay? I don't want to be overwhelm with loans just for undergrad. That's everyone in my classes stressed about that right now. 
>> Is there a space -- if this is where politics and people meet, emily is a person dealing with the politics and policy, is there any space for the first lady to have a particular role in this sort of discourse? 
>> I would imagine she and her team are working hard to figure out how he can most strategically help the next four years, but this is certainly a major issue for them, but getting back to the girls for one second, one thing that's particularly important is the role their grandmother has played. Having privacy for those girls so they can be teenagers, grow you know, be real people, not get caught up in this, I think keeping them whole and grounded has been a real achievement, everyone respecting their privacy is a very big deal so they can remain just normal people. 
>> Is that something new or typically how press has dealt with sort of first daughters and first sons in the white house to provide to sheltering? 
>> I think because of the way we have developed as a media and the way that social media has also develops, certainly they would like to keep them in a protective bubble. They didn't choose to go into elected life. I think chelsea clinton growing up was an example with another child in the white house. The bush twins, they needed their privacy to grow up, flourish, go to college and do crazy, wild things. Hopefully they'll get toffee their crazy wild college times, talking about the eldest daughter about to go to college by the time that -- in the next couple years. Of course, hopefully, and emily will have some wild times, too. 

[01:27:01]


>> No wild ones for emily. 
>> But you saw you were young when president obama -- I was young, too. I was 36, and it was good, while we have an example of this family in office, I'll never get over that we've had an example of a leader who relates to more people on more levels, and not just by the fact that he's a good family man. 
>> As much as the girls are off-limits, they're also -- he draws them in when he talks about policy. He will say things like I'm supporting this policy, because it's good for the girls. Or when I look at my girls, i think this. So at least there's a way that the girls are part of a narrative about policy. 
>> And it makes him very empathetic to women's issues, reproductive rights and all these other issues. You can't help but think about what it means for your daughters to access the same kind of health. Granted they're in the white house, right? 
>> But the challenge is most daughters are not the first daughters. 
>> I think it does -- the thing I was going to tie in about the grandmother being there. I think it makes for this interesting thing about a blended family, but also seeing the younger girls with their grandmother. I think this is an important symbol. There's a lot of grandparents raising kids right now, you know, either the parents are busy, or they have no care for them. That's another way for -- 
>> I think for sasha and malia just growing up in this environment, we're seeing them be normal. Because people really -- you probably don't remember this, but people really picked on amy carter and chelsea as well. The way they have protected their two daughters has been amazing and great. Able to see them blossom and grow because of it. 
>> And they realize of course our goal is policy-making to extend that protection to all emilys and sasha and malias in the world. Thank you, thomas roberts. 

[01:29:02]


>> I love that, nerdland is one of my favorite places to be. 
>> Thank you, emily, for coming in.

>>> If I love outside, you may not have heard of i.S.318. 70% of the students live below the poverty line, 70%. And yet the school has won more national chess championships than any other junior high in the country. More than 30 and counting, a new documentacy "brooklyn castle" follows five children. 
>> I had the goal of becoming master and first african-american female master when I was in eighth grade when I realized I was so close to 2000, I thought I can't really do this. 
>> I know I can do it, but it's harder now. I believe in my dream less now. 
>> Yet dream is becoming more of a reality number michelle joins me with her assistant principal and chess coach john galvin. Listen, you have won four national championships, you are at this moment kind of waiting on college acceptance letters what is chess for you? 
>> Chess is my life. That's what chess is. When I was in third grade, it taught me to be humble. My grandmother would always beat me. When I beat other people, it taught me not to brag about it now at the high school senior, chess has taught me to strategize and comprehension action and it's just chess revolves around mire life. So strategy, all those things, that sounds like what school should be doing, yes, sir I was pulling my hair out, because you kept having issues with budget cuts and take exactly that did all of this away. For most public schools it hits every single year, the fiscal cliff. It's been a struggle, but that was a basic bargain we made. Students who are best in the country shouldn't have to worry about will they have the opportunity? My job is to make sure they can play. 

[01:35:27]


>> Ike we to struckle to keep the best program alive, and i think why should that be? You've shown the accomplishment shown you can do thi. 
>> If I could show this person -- I know the election is over, but when mitt romney made comments about the 47% as people who struggle economically, that somehow they are entitled to certain things. 
>> I would love him to see this movie. The teachers in our building that work so hard to empower the kids I think that people that have ideas about entitlement need to this film and understand the struggles that people go through are real. 
>> Rachelle, one of the things that struck me was the team nature. On the one hand it's you and that competition, but it's also you as the team. What happens to the team part of the chess that's been important to you? 
>> My chess team is sort of like my second family. We had chess has a class, after school. I saw them more often than I say mu I mao own family. We became closer that way. 
>> You said you almost are always playing against boys, right? This is not track and field. Does that make any difference for you as a young woman. I like beating boys. 
>> You find it a particular accomplishment to beat the boys? 
>> Especially the cocky ones who think they're automatically going to win because I'm a girl. In general they're all people beating -- 

[01:37:32]


>> so there's a bit of the language of proving that I hear from both of you about proving -- what the school can do. There is so much evidence here of what you can do. What is -- sort of as you are passing this along, what does it mean to have proven this? What's the sort of big end game it's kind of I'm happy that i get to inspire young girls who are trying to be a part of chess and who don't think they could do it, because it's such a male-dominated field. So that's why I'm happy I'm doing this, but also in the fact that what chess can give you as a young woman. As I'm trying to get into college, what chess has given me through the years. 
>> Very good. We're going to stay on this topic. We'll have a couple more voices back to the table. She is a professor at the university that you most hope to get an acceptance letter from.

>>> We need to do something with raising money. We talked about a walkathon. That's something we're going to do. 
>> I'm the school president. As you know, the state has been hit hard by the budget cuts. People have disagreed with a bunch of cuts that's affected the new york city school system. 
>> You guys are going to write to lendl, and you guys are going to write to lopez. This is your opportunity to have your voice heard. 
>> Stronger coursework, increased attendance in class and better behavior. These are just some of the benefits associated with quality after-school programs. One study that shows that students who participate are 50% less likely to initiate drug use than their peers, but the sense of prchl pride, like the one featured in the documentary "brooklyn castle" can't even be quantified. We're back with assistant principal john galvin, and chess champ rachelle ballentine. Back with us an theeia butler and emily butler from girls for gender equity. This question of needing to go raise the money to do the work they're doing on the one hand show us how dedicated they are, and shows us how much we're failing these students. If you're a student of this quality, you ought to be able to get on the bus, get on the plane and fly to the chess championships. How do we change the policy? 

[01:43:43]


>> One of the things we have to realize is we can't just gut policies. Kids like michelle need to be able to go wherever she needs to to do this and realize weft to invest in kids, and we're undercutting people who are ly very smart, and are not going to be able to do the kind of education they need to do later if we don't invest in them at this level when they're in high school, junior high, everything else. So cutting programs, like the opportunities for field trips, all these other things, it's just ridiculous. We must stop the cuts. 
>> And if it's all just taking courses for the test, emily, the kind of after-schoolwork you do is political organizing. Part of what I saw was write the her to your political leaders. Would you -- when you think about who you are and what you've accomplished, how important was girls for gender equity as part of that? 
>> So important. It gave me a place where I knew I would be safe, where I could take what I learned in school and apply it to my real life, meeting kids from all over the city, and I feel like that -- that space was so vital to me growing up and being who I am today. 
>> Richelle, you talk about the idea of being a nerd or a geek. We like to say emily is one of our favorite teenage, and we use it to say if you're socially awkward or not the most popular girl in school, that's what we want to celebrate and love are the accomplishments. I heard you say I might be a nerd in one way and totally not in others. What do you do with that title of nerd or geek? 
>> I don't like titles. I consider myself smart, my grades show that, and I play chess, and chess is deemed as a geeky sport. And I'm completely okay with that, because as long as I have my friends who support me and all my decisions which iwise and my family who are proud of me, that's all I can ask for. 

[01:45:45]


>> I love this sense that in a certain way an accomplishment in a field that's nontraditional in certain ways provides a bit of, as wall said in the film, a little swagger about what you can accomplish. 
>> When I walk through my buildings all the chess trophies are not hidden away. We celebrate the success of our smart kids. We tnk being smart is really cool. We have banners, the chess hall of fame, so we try to celebrate the intellectual achievements. Zoo football and basketball is good, too, but these amazing accomplishments need to be celebrated. Both of you young ladies are waiting over the course of the next week early acceptance. Wang part of chess for you? 
>> In elementary school, i wanted to be a lawyer. They were there but I didn't think I would get it. Chess boosted my confidence. My mom always told me, michelle, you're good enough. But like chess has taught me like, I'm good enough, and i deserve to play with the big boys and I can beat the big boys and can go to college with the big boys, so applying to the ivy leagues was a decision I made. I was like, hey, why not? I'm good enough to get in, i deserve a chance to be at one of the best schools in the country, so why not? 
>> How about you, emily? Ivities well, when I was in elementary school I can'ted to be an actress. I was going to act. That's what I was going to do, but I feel like my after-school programs really did, like rachelle, taught me that I was worth it, that I could compete, go to a competitive school, working with girls, doing self-defense, something that else is male-dominated has helped me see I can apply for a stop school, I can go for what i want. Definitely the after-school programs have helped me the most. 

[01:48:09]


>> What does it say about us that I am this inspired by young women under 20? There is something kind of both fabulous and also appalling at what they have accomplished. 
>> I was sort of thinking looking at both of you, you both have a lot of confidence, because you're doing they events in school. It was part of, whether it was after school playing chess or youth organizing, all that. So many kids don't have a way to jump into something and feel like they own it, you know? That piece of ownership that you know that you did something that's really great, putting up the trophies and everything. Growing up in high school is really hard. This is a moment when people pick at you for all sorts of things. If you can have this one thing you're really good at. It's amazing. It's very difficult to be the smart kid, because nobody wants to talk to you, you gut shunned, or just as though you shun people who may not be -- but i do think what is happening now is a way in which we must invest in our educational system, so that kids did have a chance. Now everybody will have a great family, not everybody will have that kind of enforcement at home, and I think it does something for parents, too, and makes they see you can be involved in your child's educational process as well and not let this go amp. There are ways to get around these things and fight for our kids' education. Our nation won't just go down the tubes. 
>> Emily and richelle, please promise us you will let us know as soon as you have heard from your universities. and everything that you're diagnose. But also again, thank you for being the kind of coach and educator that helps sort of -- the brilliance but the emotional maturity that is part of this, and for being an advocate, not only for your students at is, but more broadly.

>>> We've been talking a lot about family on the show today. I want to turn now to one family that has been particularly touching this year. Our news league robin roberts over at abc remains on leave from her job to undergo cancer treatment. It was robin's sister, saly ann who donated the bone marrow crucial to robin's recovery. The act of family at its best. With 11 million americans living with cancer, hardly unfamily is touched by the disease's brutality. And our foot soldier this week recognizes that as a society we have to have a broader definition of family if we're going to fight back against cancer. Her name is whitney christy, and she is a junior at southeastern louisiana university. Whitney's family has also been touched by cancer. Her father was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, and his life was saved when whitney's aunt donated marrow. Inspired by what she saw on the robins family and her own, whitney decided to spearhead an effort to donate more bone marrow throughout her community. Through that program, whitney formed a partnership with be the match, the national marrow donor program. Be the match is the nonprofit organization that recruits bone marrow donors and watches them with cancer patients and those with other life threatening blood diseases. So whitney's partnership even has a catchy name, #swabbing for robin. The group organizes drives at university sporting events where students can get their cheek swabbed to have their dna enter into a national database for bone marrow donors. So far 253 people have been added to the national registry, and whitney says a crucial goal is getting more minorities to be part of the registry. African-americans are genetically diverse, more genetically diverse than those of over heritages. So it's more difficult to find a donor match. And while the registry has more than nine million potential donors in the database, only about 7% of those are of african-american heritage. Only 66% of african-american patients ever find a donor match. In fact, the database needs more representation from all minorities. Whitney goes on at great lengths to demystify the process of being a marrow donor. She says 80% of the time the entire procedure is as simple as donating blood. And each donor like the 253 that whitney has added to the roles is potentially saving a life. For showing how a large disparate society can behave just a little bit more like a family in the way that we care for one another, whitney christy is our foot soldier of the week.

The big hits, the album cuts, the forgotten 45s, All those great motown favorites, things that should have been bigger hits, things that are hits in our personal heart. I'm talking about songs like "the best things in life are free," "money" and barrett strong the mighty miracles and "shop around," of course, "deliver the letter, the sooner the better"-- "mr. Postman." How about mary wells, that calypso beat? And "the one who really loves you," the contours with their gyration in "do you love me?" Continue with the mary wells sound and "two lovers," the miracles, "don't like you but I love you, seems that I'm always thinking of you, though you treat me badly, I love you madly, you've really got a hold on me." Incredible! Now, these are all the best sources we could find-- mostly stereo. 132 tracks on here. Incredible clarity when you hear things like "beechwood 4-5789," the marvelettes, and one of the records I just love by these ladies, "too strong to be strung along." It's so great. Marvin gaye doing the "hitch hike," "fingertips." Everybody say "yeah" for motown on pbs. The mighty miracles doing "micky's monkey," "whenever you're with her, something inside..." That's, of course, martha and the vandellas, "heat wave." And "quicksand." Great song by the miracles-- "gather 'round, swingers and friends, help me forget my hurt within." Of course, "i've gotta dance to keep from crying." "The girl's alright with me," the tempting temptations. Love that with eddie on lead, a little "contract on love," stevie wonder. This is just the first disc we're talking about. How about eddie holland and "leaving here"? What a great dance sound. These are all motown classic songs that we heard on the radio, songs that, when you got the 45, you always flipped it over, classic album tracks, classic cuts that will come your way when you call right now, or at the $150 level, you can choose the 3 dvd set, great motown, the complete show we're watching tonight, PLUS 2 EXTRA DVDs.

[00:23:58]


Denise: Well, if you're a music lover like me, a generous pledge to this network is an investment in your music knowledge and enjoyment. Public television lenged by growing costs and resource cut-backs, and that's why this network needs your financial support now more than ever before. The dollars you donate will preserve the treasury of our musical heritage. So please, call the number on your screen now with your pledge of support at any level that makes you feel comfortable. 
Smokey Robinson: The impact of motown around the world is so incredible to me, because when we started out-- and berry and I talk about this all the time. On the day that he started motown, he sat us down-- there were five people there. And he sat us down and he said, "you know, I'm going to start this record company and we're going to make great music. We're going to make music for everybody. We're not just going to make black music. We're going to make music for everybody and we're gonna make music with some great beats and some great stories and we're always going to make quality music." This is what he said, you know. And he and I talk about it... In his wildest dreams, or any of our wildest dreams who were sitting there at that moment, we had no idea what it was going to become. We had no idea. 
Tj: Pbs fosters great ideas for our children's learning, history, education, balanced news, great dramas, science, and the arts. Your contribution to the station at $150 helps support that mission, and we've got a great way to say thanks with a pbs exclusive 6 cd set. 
And this all-new "motown: Big hits and more" collection will come your way when you make your pledge by calling the number on the screen or joining on-line right now. ?????? It's a good, good feeling ?????? ?????? it's a good, good feeling, don't you know now? ?????? ?????? oh, but if you feel like loving me ?????? ?????? if you've got the notion ?????? ?????? I second that emotion ?????? ?????? don't you know I was made to love her? ?????? ?????? built my world all around her ?????? ?????? yeah, hey, hey, hey ?????? ??????

tj: So, please, call pbs right now with your pledge. "Motown: Big hits and more." I'm sure you've heard the question, why do we need public television with so many cable channels available and even more on the way? Public television will remain the one place on your dial committed to public service. That means service to you, the viewer. Throughout its history, pbs has consistently demonstrated this commitment through a wide variety of quality programs for you and your family. There's no one else finding and bringing back so many of our favorite motown groups-- many that have been retired for years, but that still have so much to contribute. Let their music play on. And that happens ery time you call and give whatever you can to this station with your pledge. 
Tj: Who could believe we are in a world where you can't walk to your favorite record store on the corner and buy your favorite motown, tambla or soul 45? Well, the neighborhood here on pbs allows us to keep that tradition, keep that heritage proudly presented, preserved. We look at that and we say, "wow! Pbs." The culture, the history, the education. As we're presenting the history of motown records, a dream that started from one little house in detroit, michigan, and so many great songs that came from this dream that affected our lives, whether it was "please, mr. Postman" from the marvelettes, or "you've really got a hold on me" from the miracles, come and get these memories. Martha and the vandellas, one of their great sounds-- "here's your old teddy bear, here's your old friendship ring." Well, dial that number. It may not be "beechwood 4-5789," but dial that number right now on your screen and allow the future to stay strong here on pbs. How 'bout "shake me, wake me when it's over," the four tops? "Quicksand," martha reeves and the vandellas, is on here, great tunes like "since I lost my baby" with the tempting temptations, "going to a go go, na-na-na-na, yeah, yeah" from the miracles, "the girl's alright with me," an early stevie wonder classic called "contract on love," "my guy" from mary wells, "i like it like that" from the miracles. Great tune-- ?????? that's where it's at, that's where it's at ?????? pbs is where it's at, and we like it like that. So please, baby, we need your lovin' right now. Pick up your phone and support your pbs station. 150--you will find this nowhere else. An exclusive 6 cd set made only for members of pbs. The comeback member, rejoin if you've given in the past.

tj: That's the four tops move. See that? Right? That's because they'll tell you they weren't great dancers, but they were incredible singers when they started out as the four aims. Welcome to our motown celebration tonight here on pbs. I'm tj lubinsky, denise richardson, and we're trying to get together with that cholly atkins choreography and just have some fun. 
Denise: I thought we were doing pretty good, aually. 
Tj: I think of those songs, seeing levi and the guys with the great wonderful performance of "baby I need your lovin'," the big break-out song for them, marvin gaye's version of "i heard it through the grapevine," and what could be more inspirational, uplifting than "ain't no mountain high enough" or seeing little stevie wonder doing "uptight"? This is the best music, and we're asking you right now, if you appreciate what's going on, what's happening here on television tonight, experiencing these great moments again on pbs, go to your phone, make your pledge of support right now. 150--we've got something fantastic. We've put together a brand-new 6 cd set. This includes many extended versions, stereo...The best stereo sources we could find, and we actually ended up even mixing some special versions that you'll find unique to this collection. It's only available on pbs. 150 when you call right now. 6 CDs. Wait till you hear the version of "don't mess with bill," that great marvelettes song by, of course, william smokey robinson. Incredible stuff. "The hunter gets captured by the game," another lyric that only smoky could bring us. It's just incredible when you see this stuff. We're asking you, pick up your phone. Great cd set, you're gonna love this. We also have a dvd collection for you. You can choose that with great original performances. That is $150, or $250-- we'll put it all together. Ultimately, we need you to support the culture, the heritage, the history, and the breakthrough sound that, of course, is motown. 
Denise: And we don't just bring you motown, folks. Through great performances, we bring you andre rieu and we bring you tony bennett, and for your kids, we have curious george, and we have, yes, big bird. 
Tj: So what we're asking you to do right now is take one simple action: Pick up the phone wherever you are and say "man, this is my music. I love motown!" Call us and make your pledge. 

[00:49:29]


Denise: Now. ?????? 'Cause there's something about you, baby ?????? ?????? that makes me keep lovin' you ?????? 
tj: There's something about motown and something about pbs. Where else can you find great quality music, except for right here on public television? Consider the $150 pledge level, and we'll say thanks with an all-new exclusive 6 cd set 
of "motown: Big hits and more." ?????? I'll be there ?????? ?????? with a love that will see you through ?????? ?????? ain't that peculiar, baby? ?????? ?????? peculiar as can be ?????? ?????? oh ?????? ?????? well, I'll be doggone if I wouldn't work all day ?????? ?????? baby ?????? ?????? ooh, this old heart of mine been broke a thousand times ?????? ?????? each time you break away I think you're gone to stay ?????? ?????? reflections of the way life used to be ?????? ?????? reflections of the love you took from me ?????? ?????? if you can want, you can need ?????? ?????? and if you can need, you can care ?????? ?????? if you can care, you can love ?????? ?????? so when you want me, I'll be there ?????? ?????? whenever you wa me, I'll be there ?????? ?????? bernadette, people are searching for ?????? ?????? the kind of love that we possessed ?????? ?????? oh, jimmy mack, you better hurry back ?????? ?????? need your loving ?????? ?????? jimmy mack ?????? ?????? so get ready, so get ready ?????? ?????? I'm gonna try to make you love me, too ?????? ?????? so get ready, so get ready, 'cause here I come ?????? ?????? get ready 'cause here I come, I'm on my way ?????? 
tj : And it's on your way when you make your contribution to pbs right now. 150 and the my music motown 6 cd set is yours. It's so incredible to have the opportunity to go inside the motown vaults and bring you the best stereo sources we could on this entire collection. All but three songs are in real stereo, lots of special mixes on here, too, but when you hear songs like "i want a love I can see," one of the most requested tunes we've gotten over the years from the tempting temptations, "the way you do the things you do"--those are in stereo. Wonderful one with marvin gaye. And "in my lonely room." Forget candy and the kisses. No no, we're talking about the original with martha and the vandellas. Brenda, "every little bit hurts." And of course, "nothing you could say can tear me away from my guy." That's mary wells. Another sound that could be, to me, the follow-up record to "my guy" is kim weston, "looking for the right guy." Another smokey robinson composition. Great tune by the miracles, "call and shout" kinda thing with "i like it like that." Martha and the vandellas, "callin' out around the world," are you ready for the pbs motown beat? Yes. "Dancing in the street." "Baby, I need your lovin'" with the fabulous four tops, and, yes, the song I married my wife, three children to, down the aisle with the miracles and ould I love you," a radio classic as you've never heard it before. It is, to me, the best miracles song that ever was, anywhere. But let me tell you, it's incredible, "needle in a haystack"-- fun sound from the velvelettes. "Girl, girl, girl, why you wanna make me blue"? And speaking of girls, supremes, "ask any girl" with all those strings on there. Melancholy sounds like the four tops, "without the one you love," and you know, "the sun is shining, there's plenty of life, a new day is dawning... Since I've lost my baby, it's not there." Yeah, what? David ruffin. That's what we're talking about. $150--6 CDs. Exclusive pbs collection. Mary wells, "you lost the sweetest boy that time, yes, you did." How about a dance sound by the spinners? One of their great records called "sweet thing." Supremes, "baby love," and of course, "my girl" with the tempting temptations. That is just cd 2. That will come your way when you pick up the phone, support the station right now. So many great motown sounds, so many great memories are here because of you and your pport of pbs. So, please, dial that number right now on the screen and make sure motown stays strong in your town, right here on your hometown station, pbs. I'd like to talk to you for just a moment about our public broadcasting community and why being a member not only benefits pbs, but you and your family as well.

Duke Kakir: It is so amazing. It's hard to put it... It's hard to put that kind of dimension of living, coming from nothing, just coming from ten years of really struggling and rehearsing every day and going across country to pick up a couple hundred dollars and then riding all the way back in a raggedy car, you know, and not having anything except what you all share among each other to having a lot of those things and being in the nation's eyes and across the world's eyes. It was such a wondrous experience that we had. I mean, we were probably the happiest... I mean, it was a dream come true right then, BACK IN THE '60s. The songs really helped sustain all that. People loved that music, they loved the song. Motown was a major part of most people's lives at that time, which I'm very glad of, and they've carried it right through their life, and they keep saying, "i want more. I want my songs. Give me my music. Come on, give it up." ?????? Ooh, that feeling, feeling ?????? ?????? got me rockin' and a reelin' ?????? ?????? ooh, I'm crazy 'bout your love, buttercup ?????? ?????? your kind of love, can't get enough ?????? if you're a music lover like me,

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my music series host jerry butler and series creator t.J. Lubinsky. 
[Applause] and that is the music of the mighty miracles, tracks of my tears. My goodness, yes. And I'm telling you, that is one of the all-time great songs by one of the all-time great songwriters, and it just wipes me away. Well, you know what, jerry, you have been a part of all of our music specials here on pbs, and one of the greatest things we can do because of your support is bring back the respect of the artists that we love, and you know, I live for the miracles. They are my number one group of all time. 
Jerry: Well, I'm sorry you said that, because I think the impressions were pretty good myself. 
Tj: Well, they're pretty good, too. 
Jerry: Well, alright, then. Since it's your show, you can have the miracles tonight only. 
Tj: When we started... 
[Laughter] say amen to that. I'm so proud. When we started these great shows, jerry, we had a great opportunity, and that was to bring one of motown's greatest voices out of the shadows, and this of course is the great claudette robinson, who's heard on every one of their records. 
Jerry: Yes. 
Tj: Every one of their records, you hear her voice right there with smokey and bobby and pete and ronnie, but she really didn't perform too much on television. She had kind of retired from touring at that time. We were able to put claudette back together with bobby rodgers, the miracles, and right now, the mighty miracles! 
Jerry: And they've never looked any better! ?????? if you remember this, feel free to join in! It's your show! ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? na-na-na-na, yeah-hey ?????? ?????? well, there's a brand new place I found-a ?????? ?????? where people go from miles around-a ?????? ?????? they come from everywhere ?????? ?????? and if you'll drop in there ?????? ?????? you might see anyone in town-a ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? ooh, wee hee ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? baby, come on, now ?????? ?????? don't you wanna go? ?????? ?????? yeah ?????? ?????? alright ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? hoo-hoo-wee-eee ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? baby, come on now ?????? ?????? it doesn't matter where you are-a ?????? ?????? a go-go can be found ?????? ?????? you'll see the people from your block ?????? ?????? and don't be shocked ?????? ?????? if you see your favorite star-a ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? everybody ?????? ?????? goin' to a go-go ?????? ?????? oh, come on now-ow ?????? ?????? don't you wanna go? ?????? ?????? yeah! ?????? ?????? say one more time, yeah ?????? ?????? ?????? na-na-na-na-na yeah-hey ?????? ?????? hooooo ?????? ?????? tell me ?????? ?????? don't you wanna go? ?????? ?????? yeah! ?????? ?????? say one more time, yeah ?????? ??????

It is so fantastic we've got you with us and the mighty miracles ending this segment. So great we could see them early on-- smokey robinson, bobby rogers, pete moore, and of course the late ronny white, always in the background on these records. You heard the sweet voice of claudette robinson. And then to see the current line-up of the miracles, claudette coming out of retirement and bobby rogers, who we love so much. "Going to a go go." What a fun record, isn't it? 

[01:18:47]


Denise: Absolutely a fun record, but look at the audience and look at the way the audience connects not only with the music but seeing the performers that they've come to know and love. It is a miracle, so to speak, to have that opportunity. 
Tj: And then earlier in this segment, when you see some of the performances from, for example, jimmy ruffin, doing "what becomes of the brokenhearted." 
Denise: This is an opportunity you won't get every day. You can't run down to the store anymore to just buy... There are no record stores anymore. 
Tj: There's no record stores anymore. Can you imagine that? 
Denise: You cannot possibly turn on the radio and hear this music, and so we really... This is the place. This is the happening place for where you can see it and hear it and enjoy it and get a history lesson, because there's a real history lesson here that you all are sharing with us. 
Tj: So pick up your phone right now and join us. Become the latest member or renew your membership to pbs, and we will keep the music playing for you. 
Denise: Absolutely. 
Tj: And we have absolutely a fantastic way to say thank you for supporting pbs. 150. Make your pledge of support, and we'll send you the all-new pbs exclusive 
my music "motown: Big hits and more" collection. ?????? Oh, I need more and more and more of your love ?????? ??????

Denise: If you're enjoying "motown: Big hits and more," remember that it's the dollars raised during these pledge breaks that makes it possible. Well, that's because the dollars raised now will be used to pay for more my music specials. Pbs consistently brings you programs you won't see anywhere else. Your pledge protects an environment where alternate programming-- that's television really worth watching-- can survive and flourish. Keep this great programming going. Call now with your pledge of support. Motown really was-- and smokey's lyrics were amazing. "Tracks of my tears," "ooh, baby, baby," "my girl has gone." And then, on the upswing, "goin' to a go go," "mickey's monkey." You go with the temptations, man, "beauty is only skin deep," you go with "my girl." I mean, this was music that young people and young america today, at any age, can relate to. Holland, dozier, and holland, in my opinion, were the greatest writers for dance music. "Come see about me." The things they did for martha reeves and the vandellas, the things they did for the isley brothers and the supremes. Amazing! When you do anything by the supremes, you're gonna do a cha-cha. When you do a song called "leaving here" by eddie holland, you're gonna do a stomp. When you do a line dance to "goin' to a go go," you're going to do a line dance. You're going to do a line dance to "all I need" by the temptations. So that rhythm beat affects you, man, and you just move, you just dance. 
Tj: The greatest dance music around--motown. And it's yours in an all-new 6 cd "motown: Big hits and more" collection. For supporting pbs, we'll say thanks with all your favorite motown dance floor favorites. ?????? Callin' out around the world ?????? ?????? are you ready for a brand-new beat? ?????? ?????? summer's here and the time is right ?????? ?????? for dancing in the street ?????? ?????? nowhere to run to, baby ?????? ?????? nowhere to hide ?????? ?????? got nowhere to run to, baby ????? ?????? nowhere to hide ?????? ?????? ooh, sugar pie, honeybunch ?????? ?????? you know that I love you ?????? ?????? I can't help myself ?????? ?????? I love you and nobody else ?????? ?????? all, all I need ?????? ?????? is just to hear you say you forgive me ?????? ?????? forgive me, baby ?????? ?????? keep on loving me ?????? ?????? you got to keep on loving me ?????? ?????? ooh ?????? ?????? it's a good, good feeling ?????? ?????? it's a good, good feeling ?????? ?????? don't you know now ?????? ?????? yes, it is ??????

Love these ladies so much. "Needle in a haystack," "doo da lang, doo da lang," and marvelettes singing a classic performance with gladys and wanda and kat with "please, mr. Postman." And of course you see the supremes on bumper cars, "stop in the name of love," and I love "you can't hurry love." That is just one of the greatest dance songs of all time.

tj: "Motown: Big hits and more" will come your way. Your wonderful one, marvin gaye, marvelous marvin on here. "Sugar pie, honeybunch, can't help myself." Love this! Can't help ourselves to the motown sound, and you--you make it all possible with your pledge. Any pledge matters here. The most important thing is that you pick up and you join this action. All of us that feel that same vibration for this music and feel that same beat, that same feel from the tambourine or the funky bass line... Whatever it is that drives you to motown, we share that feeling, that vibration, and where have we shared it? We've shared it here on pbs. So, please, allow us to share this feeling for future generations, and some pretty cool thank-you gifts will come your way. So, please, call us right now. From out of this little old two-story house in detroit, michigan, renamed, without a number, it said, "hitsville, u.S.A." All the hits are here, all the feelings, all the emotion, all the energy of something we called motown, hitsville, u.S.A. What is it? What was the discovery here? Well, berry gordy, jr. And his people around him discovered that music does not have to be specific to a racial group. No. Music is universal. If it's presented properly and it tells a story that you are aware of, your lives, it will reach every audience. 
Harvey Holiday: I interviewed smokey robinson once, and he told me--and I haven't heard this anywhere else-- in 1959, he and berry gordy were driving on a snowy day to get a pressing at the pressing plant outside detroit of a marv johnson record. It was one of the first artists they produced before motown. And that they skidded on the ice and the car turned over. And I said, "smokey, can you imagine that if in 1959 you and berry gordy had died?" There'd be no "my girl." Would there be the supremes, the temps? It just shows you how life could have been so different if, god forbid, that would have happened. The motown era is something that will never be duplicated. It was a once-in-a-lifetime thing. When you talk about the songwriters, when you talk about the musicians, the incredible voices of smokey robinson, martha and the vandellas, diana ross. Nobody could bake like marvin gaye, levi stubbs. You can argue all day who the best singer was, who was the best female singer-- martha reeves, diana ross, gladys horton from the marvelettes, who's a special favorite of mine who doesn't get the credit that she deserves. It just captured-- real music that is popular captures what's going on in the world at that time with the greatest singers and the greatest arrangers and the musicians, of course. Just top-notch. Every one was a million-dollar production. 

[01:51:08]


Tj: We've got some incredible liner notes that were written by bill dahl for this. ALSO, SURVEYS FROM SOME OF OUR FAVORITE DJs-- Cousin brucie and his favorite motown hits and should-have-been hits. And bobby jay. Love these guys who introduced to this motown sound. The geator with the heater. These were the sounds that the geator would play at all of his dance parties, and of course harvey holiday introduced me to this on his motown show. 7talk about classics here, one of the songs that the new york guys really love is "dance party" by martha and the vandellas. "Third finger, left hand," that's where you know how to place the wedding band. "Forever," marvin gaye's version. And love the marvelettes-- an incredible feeling. But you'll get that same feeling when you hear marvin do this. Absolutely awesome. "Impossible dream." Now, this is a timeless thought. You think of pbs and broadway, and you think about that song "the impossible dream" from "man of la mancha," of course. And now you hear david ruffin do it. There is one song I picked on here that had to be on here. It's a dance club classic. Chances are you may not have heard it before, but when you hear it, you'll want to hear it over and over and over again. That, of course, is a lady by the name of frances nero and the song, "keep on loving me." When you hear, "it's easy to fall in love with a guy like you" and when you hear the vulnerability that is in martha's voice in this particular track, it's beautiful. It's gonna make you cry. Just like "what's so good about goodbye" with the miracles. You know, "if leaving causes grieving and to part can break your heart. Then tell me what's so good about it? I could have done without it. What's so good about goodbye?" "It's a good, good feeling"-- a great dance record, a line dance record from the miracles off their 1967 "make it happen" album. Love that as well. You're gonna love it, too, and it's a great feeling when you call your pbs station right now, make your pledge.150-- cd set will come your way, and all the great things pbs does for you, for your children, for your grandchildren, and your community. Please, call right now. Your contribution at any level here at pbs counts. Why not think about the $60 pledge level and we'll say thanks with a live soundtrack of recordings from tonight's concert. 150, and the motown sound is yours. Take this final opportunity during the program to join us. AS OUR THANK YOU, WE'LL SEND YOU 6 CDs,

>> Stella: Under clothes or on its own, whether it's with your at the gym, or in the evening, my cami shaper will make you look up to 10 pounds slimmer and up to two sizes smaller instantly and comfortably. Did you hear that? Comfortably! 
>> It's more comfortable than half of the tank tops that I own. 
>> I forget that it's on. Like, I walk around the house, I lounge on the sofa, I'm reading a book or I'm watching tv, and I don't even remember that I'm wearing the cami shaper. 
>> I put the cami shaper on and I looked in the mirror and instantly I feel like I look 10 pounds thinner. 
>> I feel like finally I found something that shapes my body... But comfortably. 
>> My boyfriend thinks I've lost weight. He says, "oh, you've been going to the gym!" Yep, I sure have. 
>> Announcer: Now it's time for you to get a firsthand look at the slimming benefits of the amazing 3-in-1 revolutionary new cami shaper by genie.

[Cheering and applause...] 
>> o.K., This is my new cami shaper, ladies! 
>> Terri: Oh, it's beautiful! 
>> It's the best of the genie bra and then we've added all of the tight and tone control zones so that you're gonna look flatter in the tummy and you're gonna be smoother. So let me show you how this moves with you 'cause this... It's all in the construction, and it's one-piece, you noticed, right? And I want to show you this, o.K., Terri, grab that. >> O.K. 
>> We'll give it as much stretch as possible... >> O.K. 
>> Don't let go. 
>> All right, o.K. 
[Audience reacts, applauds] whoa! Really? 
>> Wait a minute, it gets better! The weave we stretch this way. Give it the buffet stretch. 
>> Oh, the buffet stretch! 

[00:04:11]


[Laughs] 
>> but watch-- you saw what we did, you saw how we stretched it? 
>> Look at that. It bounces right back. 
>> Bounces right back. 
>> I love that. 
[Applause] 
>> you have the best of the genie bra... Again, you get the support, it's all in the weave, it's one-piece construction and then you have that tight and tone control zone. It's gentle compression, but it's breathable. So if you're getting the gentle compression in the side area where you need it, there is no muffin that can come over the top of anything. And in the back I want you to see that you're also eliminating back fat, you're smoothing everything out all the way down, and look how nice this looks. If it looks this good on a mannequin, ladies, it's gonna hug the road for you. I even finished it off, terri, with the bottom right in here in a special design so that it doesn't roll, it's flared, because I recognize we do like to sit down. 
[Laughter] so would you like to see what the cami shaper can do for you? 
>> Absolutely! 
[Cheering and applause] 
>> Announcer: There was no shortage of volunteers from our all-ladies studio audience who wanted to see exactly what stella's new cami shaper could do for them. Remember, these are real women just like you. 
[Applause, ??????...] 
>> caitlin just had babies... Three... Triplets! 
>> Stella: Wow! 
>> Two months ago. What are your concerns right now? 
>> Caitlin: My concerns are just right here, it still looks like I have one more baby to go right here... [Laughter] I want to get back to my pre-baby body. 
>> I want to go ahead and give you one of my cami shapers, and you will love the tight and tone control zones, you're gonna love the way it smooths your back and I want you to go try that on. 
>> Wait-- you know what? How do you put those on? 
>> Let me tell you what you do, o.K.? You step in, you pull up, and you slim down. You can handle that, right? 
>> Terri: That's easy! 
>> All right, caitlin, go back there, please. 

[00:06:14]


>> We have another gal I want 
you to meet: Patricia. Patricia, come on out. 
[Applause] hi, patricia, meet stella. 
>> Hi, nice to meet you. 
>> Come around here, honey. How are you? 
>> I'm pretty good, thank you. 
>> Excellent. Now, listen, o.K., This is an outfit that you normally wear out, right? 
>> Yes. I love wearing jeans, and unfortunately I do get this muffin top no matter what. In the summertime do a lot of layering just... To cover up, which I want to get away from that. 
>> And then you get overheated. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Well, we don't want you to cover it up, so if I told you, it's a cami, it's shapewear and a bra. That eliminates all these layers, it eliminates the heat, it just makes you look hot. 
[Laughter and applause] 
>> Patricia: Wonderful. Thank you, thank you. 
>> Announcer: Remember new mom of triplets, caitlin? Look at her before the cami shaper. Even in silhouette you can see her saggy and lumpy problem. But after the cami shaper caitlin is now lifted, slimmer and smoother and standing taller. Just look at how her posture has improved, instantly! 
[Applause, ??????...] 
>> Terri: Look at you! 
[Loud cheering] did you see the way she walked out? 
[Laughter] uh-huh, uh-huh. How do you feel? 
>> I feel great. I feel even better than I did before I had the kids. 
>> Caitlin had the tummy naturally from having triplets-- three babies-- but the tight and tone control zones on my cami shaper really zoned in and pulled her in. Your waist is tiny now. Your tummy is flat. 
>> Wow! 
[Applause] have you seen yourself? 
>> I have not. 
>> You haven't seen yourself. 
>> I have not. 
>> All right, let's do a side-by-side. Let's see caitlin before and after. 
[Audience reacts] 
[laughter and applause] you look beautiful, caitlin. 
>> Thanks. 
>> You go tell your husband you need a date tonight... >> Yeah! 
>> O.K., Find a baby-sitter for all those babies. 
[Laughter] 
>> Announcer: See how patricia's silhouette shows her tummy tightened and toned, and she has a whole new sleek, slim figure. 

[00:08:14]


[Loud cheering and applause] 
>> Terri: Ohh, smokin'! Girl... You don't even know how hot you look right now, do you? 
>> Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
>> See, here's the thing: Before, she had all the bra straps going and all the layers that were happening, and then she needed this a little bit smooth, but mostly right in here. I mean, you've got some curves and now they're dangerous curves, they're beautiful. And that, again, is the tight and tone control zone... 
>> Right. 
>> It just cinched you in, but you can breathe, right? You're comfortable? 
>> Oh, it's so comfortable, it's amazing. 
>> All right, let's take a look at your before and after, side by side. I want you to look and tell me what you think.

>> Terri: Amazing! 
[Applause...]

>> You look beautiful. 
>> All right, go work it, 
GO WORK IT. >> Stella: Work it! 
>> She looks fabulous. 
>> The cami shaper is very comfortable.

>> I feel like finally I found something that shapes my body, but comfortably.

>> you all look great. Welcome to our third resurgence show. How many of you had ever heard of hormonally aging skin? Like, three people? We all face hormonal aging, every single woman in the world. But you know what? It doesn't have to show on your face. But what exactly is hormonal aging? Healthy skin cells are like plump, juicy grapes. As we age, our estrogen levels decrease, causing healthy cells to lose moisture, becoming dry and flaky. Murad resurgence lifts and removes dry skin cell build-up, infusing moisture into the skin and helps stimulate collagen production, resulting in soft, hydrated, healthy-looking skin. And with resurgence, you can reveal your beauty, not necessarily your age. 
>> I'm a stay-at-home mom and i have two teenage boys and all the stuff that comes with that, which is spending your life carpooling and sports and sitting on sidelines, and I have tried just about everything out there, and with resurgence, you'll see results, you'll feel the results and I guarantee you, your friends will notice too. 
>> You see all these products in the store-- you're not really sure how to take care of your skin, you read the magazines and they're blasting everything at you at once. Murad resurgence is totally taking the confusion out of my process.

THEY SAY THAT YOUR 40s ARE Supposed to be your best years, and getting a little help from resurgence actually made it true. 
>> Female announcer: Murad resurgence-- just three simple steps for a more radiant you. 
>> Step one is the renewg cleansing cream. This is so luxurious, you're going to love this, and this just lathers up beautifully, all over your entire face.

[Water splashing] and I just love the way my skin feels after I've used this cleanser. It doesn't feel dry or tight. It just feels healthy and hydrated. All right, so step two is the age-diffusing serum. You really only need a pea-sized amount. And it's amazing, as soon as you get it on, right away your skin will feel instantly firmer, so it's a great feeling once you have it on. And then, the final step, is step three, the age balancing night cream and this is just so rich and luxurious, and again, it too is highly concentrated and when you put it on, you are going to immediately see how luxurious it feels, and it makes your skin feel incredibly hydrated. So that's it! Resurgence is just three simple steps, and it's great for all skin types, even sensitive skin. I consider my skin kind of sensitive.

[00:12:56]


[??????...] 
>> Joan: Most of us would never leave the house without makeup, let alone appear on national tv without even a drop of concealer. But this group of daring women did just that as they bared all for our cameras and for murad's state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment. The women had their skin analyzed and measured for wrinkles, skin texture and hydration before and after 30 days of using resurgence. 
>> I can see that my lines are not as deep. I can feel my skin is smoother. But the computer also tells me that and the computer gives me numbers that are incredibly different from 30 days ago. 
>> What happens with hormonal aging is there's less estrogen in your body and therefore less in your skin. 
>> When you first came in, it was quite a bit and now look after 30 days, the difference. 
>> I kind of felt like the fine lines were going away around my eyes and I kind of felt like my moisture content was better, but when we came in and actually tested it, I could actually see the results, it was really amazing to see how far they had actually changed. 
>> Joan: After just 30 days, an astonishing 93.9% of participants saw a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. 96% reported firmer skin and an incredible 100% experienced improvement in overall skin hydration. 
>> I have used many, many products over the years and this is the one that I have felt, by far, I've seen the most dramatic difference in my skin. 
>> I will never put anything else on my skin other than resurgence for the rest of my life. And I can't believe I'm saying that on national tv with no makeup, but it's true. 
>> O.K., It's time now to meet the man behind the science. He is considered one of the world's foremost authorities on skin care and skin health. Please welcome dr. Howard murad. 
[Cheering and applause, ??????...] 
>> so wonderful to see you! 
>> Now, it's been a little while since I've actually seen you, doctor, right? 

[00:14:58]


>> It has, and I have to tell you something. This is from my heart. You absolutely look fabulous. 
>> Well, thank you. I mean, I have nothing else that I'm doing any different than just using my murad every morning and every night. I have not missed a day since i met you five years ago. 
>> What people don't quite understand is your skin is connected to every organ in your body. And when your hormones begin to diminish, you begin to have drier skin, more lines, pores begin to enlarge. And you just don't have that glow that you used to have. Unfortunately, most of the things that are out there that are being used just focus on one thing, but the whole system has to be addressed. 
>> And I think one of my main complaints to you when we first met was lack of hydration. 
>> And the moisture is a very critical part. The one thing that happens to us when we age is we become drier, all over the body, including the skin. The real issue is hormonal aging. As we encourage your skin to soak in some of the nutrients that I've developed in the products, the results are amazing. 
>> All right, so, we have some ladies in the audience and they'd like to ask you some questions. 
>> Oh, I'd love to hear some. 
>> All right, what's your name and what's your question? 
>> Hi, my name is betty and all the products I use make me break out or are irritating. Can I use resurgence on my sensitive skin? 
>> Absolutely. We have ingredients like avocado, wild yams, soy extracts... Many agents that soothe the skin and make it feel wonderful. So it really works well for somebody who has sensitive skin as well as hormonal aging. 
>> All right, we've got another question out there. What's your name? 
>> I'm davina, thank you joan and dr. Murad. I see a lot of the skin care infomercials and I'm wondering what makes resurgence better than the other products that are available on the market today? 
>> O.K., Wait a second. May I step in on this one? 
>> O.K. [Laughter] 
>> o.K., Because it really matters to me. It is based on one thing only: Results. 
>> Dr. Murad: And really, it's not typical of infomercials, because it's based on years of research, years of actually looking at patients and seeing the results and looking at all the different attributes of the formula, making sure it was something that was perfect for what hormonal aging is. 

[00:17:08]


>> When I heard about hormonal aging, I really didn't know that much about it and it was great to learn more about it and i thought, "well, I'm 39, could i really have hormonal aging, is this what's going on?" And it was great to find a product that actually helps fight hormonal aging. 
>> At 48 years old, I was gonna give up. My skin was dry, dull, spotty and I started looking like my mother. Sorry, mom. I thought, well, maybe this is what I'm supposed to be, I mean, there wasn't a whole lot I could do. But since I started using the resurgence product, I look younger, I feel better, I feel better about myself. I know that I'm gonna use this product for the rest of my life. 
>> The wrinkles have disappeared and the suppleness has returned. My husband actually cupped my face in his hands and said, "girl, you've never looked better." 
>> Female announcer: Now it's your turn to get skin this beautiful with murad resurgence. Resurgence is the only comprehensive skin care line specifically designed to target all the signs of hormonally aging skin.

[??????...] 
>> one of my main jobs as a stuntwoman is doubling an 18-year-old. I've doubled for a lot of actually kids' shows and teen shows. My skin takes a beating on a regular basis. Doubling young people is my bread and butter, and resurgence is really gonna help me to continue to look young, and I like to take very good care of my skin because I'm still a woman at the end of the day, even though I do stunts. 
>> My a-ha moment when I knew resurgence was something special was when my "spa girlfriend", the one who's tried every expensive product under the sun, after I'd only been using the product one week, came up to me and went, "what are you doing? What are you on? What have you done? What have you had done?" And I go, "oh, it's the new resurgence line that I'm using." 
>> There's a certain point where you think, I'm just getting older, there's nothing I can do. But it's so wonderful to find something that makes it softer, that makes it easier, there issomething I can do. I'm not going to look 30, I don't expect to look 30, I don't even want to-- but to look young for my age is great. Thank you, dr. Murad, for caring about women of all ages. 
>> Now, doctor, I know that you and your team at murad get thousands of letters from women, but they shared one with me that I want to take a moment and just share it with all of you today. "Being a four-time breast cancer survivor, I honestly can say, I'm very careful what I put on my skin and murad resurgence is the only thing I will use for the rest of my life. I love it and thanks again for creating such an amazing product. Yours truly, carolyn." Let us all welcome carolyn. 
[Cheering and applause] so glad to have you here. 

[00:21:18]


>> Dr. Murad: Thank you for that letter... Amazing! 
>> You really are the essence of what it means to take care of yourself. 
>> I've been through a lot. Four-time cancer survivor, but i can honestly say, dr. Murad, I cannot thank you enough because the product is amazing. Sick as I was, I brought all my resurgence products and I would climb out of my hospital bed and put the resurgence on. And the nurses would come in and they'd say, "you'd never know what you've been through because you look so healthy. What are you using on your skin?" So I said, "well, let me tell you about it." 
[Laughter] 
>> it's so powerful when you get up in the morning and you look in that mirror-- 
>> that's right. 
>> And that woman looking back at you just has that glow. 
>> I've never felt so good. I feel 10 years younger and i cannot believe-- you're right, when I look in the mirror, I look... "Wow, I look like i did maybe even 15 or 20 years ago." I said, "jeez, I feel good!" 
>> Seriously, it created your own little personal resurgence. 
>> Absolutely. I really watch what I put on my skin. When I read all the ingredients that was in resurgence, I thought, this is the product for me. 
>> Being a pharmacist, the r.X. Stands for recipe, so my recipe of adding all of these things together and have the perfect blend that makes such a unique difference in everybody's skin. And you're like the poster child. You're the one that looks like-- 
>> Joan: You are like the poster child. 
>> In just one night, I noticed a difference. It makes you feel great. So I'd like to get it and have a whole bath in it. 
[Laughter] 
[cheering and applause] 
>> Joan: Most of us would never leave the house without makeup, let alone appear on national tv without even a drop of concealer.

>> It's just this healthy, hydrated look and I love that. 
>> I feel younger, I look younger-- I love how my skin looks! 
>> I'm 52 and I have a nine-year-old daughter, I'm an older mom, so when I go to the school to pick up, I'm probably with around 30- to 32-year-olds. I have seen dramatic results in less than 30 days. A lot of the moms have come up to me and said, "josie, what are you doing to yourself?" It's just, it's been exciting and my daughter marissa is like, "my mom's doing something really different!" It is the best product I've ever seen.

Three tools in one. A superior blower... 
[??????...] a powerful outdoor vacuum... 
[??????...] a heavy-duty mulcher... 
[??????...] 
the worx trivac: The premiere outdoor clean-up tool. 
>> HI EVERYONE, I'M paul DiMeo. 
>> And I'm robin hartl. 
>> Robin and I have hosted home improvement shows for years. We've worked with some of the best outdoor tools on the market and today, we want to show you one of the most exciting tools we've ever worked with: The worx trivac. 
>> With the worx trivac, outdoor clean-up is faster, easier and there's no more aching backs or dirty hands. 
>> The worx trivac is a three-in-one tool. It's a powerful blower, it's a heavy-duty mulcher and it's a vacuum. 
>> Coming up, we'll show you how you can get your very own worx trivac. 
[Trivac whirs...] 
>> Announcer: Tired of raking leaves? Tired of sweeping walkways? Tired of scooping leaves into trash bags by hand? Introducing the three-in-one worx trivac. The worx trivac is a superior blower, a powerful outdoor vac and a heavy-duty mulcher, all in one tool. In the past, raking up leaves was a time-consuming hassle. With the worx trivac, you can now clean up your leaves faster and easier than ever before. There's no more raking, no more piles, no more bending, no more scooping, no more hauling bag after bag to the curb. The worx trivac eliminates all of that. With the convenient, easy-to-use worx trivac, you simply blow the leaves together, flip the switch, then suck them up. It's fast and it's easy. There's no changing tubes or reconfiguring hose other machines. The three-in-one worx trivac changes from a blower to a yard vac with the simple flip of a switch. The powerful blade mulches leaves down to just one-tenth their original size. This means that the amount of leaves it used to take to fill 10 garbage bags will now fit in just one. The rugged collector bag holds up to 10 gallons of mulched leaves. This means you can vacuum up nearly 100 gallons of leaves before emptying the bag. Imagine the time savings. The finely ground leaves also make the perfect mulch for your garden, shrubs or compost pile. The three-in-one worx trivac is so versatile, you'll use it year-round for all your outdoor clean-up. Every time you mow and trim the lawn your worx trivac will save you time and hassle. The trivac lets you clean up unsightly grass clippings in just a fraction of the time it takes to sweep. Flip the switch and now you can vacuum up all your hedge trimmings, your garden messes or any trash you may find. Just flip the switch back and now you can blow off your porch, your patio or your deck. You can easily get into all the cracks, grooves and crevices where even the broom can't reach. You can also clean up your garage messes. The powerful worx trivac easily picks up sawdust, metal shavings or anything else. And the best part is you did all this without ever bending over or getting your hands dirty. With the worx trivac, you get no-touch, no-hassle yard clean-up all year round. 

[00:03:28]


[Trivac whirs...] 
>> is the worx trivac powerful enough to clean up youryard? Absolutely. Watch this, robin. 
[Trivac whirring...] 
>> the worx trivac's large 12-amp motor produces enough suction to vacuum up all these leaves in just seconds. It can handle this and just about any other debris that you can throw at it. Not only is the trivac a powerful yard vacuum and a great leaf blower... 
>> But with its mulching feature, it takes leaves and brings them down to one-tenth their size. Check that out, robin. Isn't that the coolest thing? 
>> Wow... >> And then right from there into the garden. 
>> [Laughs] amazing, isn't it? 
>> What I'm really liking about the worx trivac is the three-in-one function. It's three tools in one place. So now you're not dealing with attachments. It feels good in my hand. It's well-balanced and a well-balanced tool is usually a signifier of good design and good craftsmanship. I've looked inside it. It's made out of tough, durable parts. Outside, also tough and durable, but the pieces go together easily. It operates easily, it makes perfect sense to use-- all that combines to make a high-quality, well-designed tool that's going to make your home improvement and home project life much, much easier. 
>> Now, everybody can relate to 
this: I've just finished cutting my lawn. [Trivac whirring...] with the worx trivac, I can blow away all those clippings on the sidewalk and the driveway. So with the flick of a switch, I can suck up those clumps of grass that my lawnmower left behind. 
>> Wow, look at that! It's fast, it's easy and it makes your yard look great. 
>> [Turns off trivac] 
>> whoo! Look at that. 
>> Now I get to use the worx trivac, I have the vacuum function and it just makes it so much easier because it sucks everything up. It gets underneath the bushes. It doesn't leave anything left behind, so it's great. 
>> This is what sold me on it more than anything, was the vacuuming, because I can come out here on the deck or around the pool and vacuum the leaves and I can just walk around and it sucks up all the debris.

[00:10:59]


>> Folks, this is the best. My favorite feature of the worx trivac is the fact that on the fly I can change from a blower to a vacuum, just like that-- instantaneously from a blower to a vacuum-- show 'em, robin. 
>> I'd be happy to. You just blow the leaves into a pile... [Trivac whirring...] and at 210 miles per hour-- I mean, look at that power! Isn't that amazing? This is so powerful. It's so easy to use, it's so lightweight and on the fly, once again, I just flip this right over and now I just start vacuuming. And those leaves just wanna jump right in. It just sucks 'em right up. 
[Trivac whirring...] I'm just not worki at all. One-handed, I can easily just get my yard cleaned up in no time at all. 
[Trivac whirring...] now let me get these leaves... There we go! >> Nice work! 
>> You like that? >> Nice work! 
>> Thank you very much. 
>> So, as you were vacuuming up those leaves, they were all getting mulched. 
>> Exactly-- you can turn mounds of dry leaves into mulch in minutes-- perfect for compost piles or ground cover. 
>> Look at this, right here in the flower bed-- how 'bout that? 
>> That's incredible! 
>> And what do we mean by a 10-to-one ratio? We mean 10 bags of leaves down to one bag of mulch. 10 to one! 
>> You got the bag on your hip, so as soon as you're done, the's no dumping in the barrel, there's no having to bag it. You can take the bag right over to your garden and dump it in, clean and easy. 
>> I'm nancy szerlag and I am a master gardener and I'm a garden writer, and I've been writing a weekly column for the detroit newsfor more than 15 years, and I take a lot of time going to tradeshows, looking for new products. That's one of the things that i specialize in and I specialize in tools. I'm here today because I have found a blower vac, the worx blower vac, that I think is a really special tool. It's got some features you aren't gonna find on any other blower vac on the market today. 

[00:13:02]


[Trivac whirs...] 
>> the worx trivac is also perfect for cleaning up all of your hedge trimmings. Look at that. How clean is that? And then, on the fly, I just switch it over to the blower feature, and it's powerful enough to clean up all of these wet leaves. Wow, 210 miles per hour-- look at that! 
>> And then, with our air flow regulator here, you can dial in just how much air you need. You wanna be careful in your flower beds, so you just dial it that way. 
>> Speaking of year-round outdoor clean-up, who hasn't had a family barbecue where some trash was left behind in the yard, especially if the wind was blowing. 
>> What a mess we have here, and in the past, you used to have to walk all around the house, all around the yard, bending over, picking this up, bending over picking that up-- not anymore. 
>> No. 
[Trivacs whirring...] with the trivac, you can now have the yard clean in just minutes without the hassle of bending over. You can get all that trash up without ever having to touch it. 
[??????..., Trivacs whirring...] remember when you got stuff underneath the chair, and now with the angled head, I can get up underneath patio furniture. In the past, in order to sweep up under there, I had to move the chairs. I don't have to move anything, I don't have to move it back. Not with the worx trivac. Boy, wasn't that easy? 
>> That sure was easy. We can invite your family back again. >> Well, thank you. 
>> All right. >> [Laughs] 
[trivac whirs...] 
>> the trivac is also lightweight. At 8.3 pounds, it weighs less than a gallon of milk. Anyone can use this machine. 
>> In fact, this is the only yard vac specifically designed to be used with just one hand. 
>> It's lightweight, it looks good, it feels food. And it's ergonomically designed so that when I hold it, I can leave my arm just in a natural position. I don't have to have a second handle on it. 

[00:15:07]


>> What that'll do is I can stand straight up without having to bend over and vacuum up my leaves and it grinds them up and I can just get rid of them that way, without putting stress on my back. 
>> It really does save your back. It saves you from any of the pain and in your arms from having to rake 'em all up, put 'em in a bag, take them to the curb. Here, I go where the leaves are, suck them up, put the mulch where I need it. 
>> I used to clean my porch off with a broom, and it never works because we've got all these little corners and the dirt gets stuck in the corners and it's impossible with a broom to get it out. So now I've got this blower and I can do it in just a few seconds and it's absolutely simple. You know, the nice thing about this is it really cuts my time in half, if not more. 
>> It's quicker than a broom because when you use a broom, it takes a while to get all the spots and in between all the crevices. You can use this tool and it will get in between all the cracks and you're done in about three minutes because it just blows it and you're done. 
>> Ask yourself, do you want to keep sweeping? No. You want to get the worx trivac, you want to save all that time and effort. 
>> It's convenient, it's portable, I can carry it around on my back, it's easy access to unload. I can just unzip the bag, dump it around my trees and keep it moving.

>> the worx trivac is the premiere outdoor year-round clean-up tool that gives you that no-touch clean-up every time.

Senators john McCAIN AND LINDSAY GRAHAM, JOHN Bolton, pat buchanan, state department official, liz cheney and former secretary of state henry kissinger are all here. This is a special edition of on the record. 
>> Four years later almost after the noble peace prize has been awarded where do we stand. In case you haven't heard, bin laden is dead but that is not a foreign policy. There is no coherent foreign policy when we need one. 
>> We hope something is going to change. 
>> One of the ramifications of obama presidency the defense is not going to grow. 
>> The coordinated preplanned against the consulate on september 11th is an outrage. 
>> It appears to many americans that this administration failed to adequately protect u.S. Personnel. 
>> The president has been skipping his daily intelligence briefings. 
>> With respect to iran I want to see a diplomatic resolution to the problem. 
>> The president's iran policy lacks credibility. The question is whether or not is whether the defense budget is big enough to deal with the major crisis and potential challenges around the world. 
>> As far as the middle east is concerned, his national policy has been abysmal failure. 
>> The arrogance and dishonesty is breathtaking. 
>> There is a circle the wagon operation around barack obama that nobody is going to penetrate. 
>> Very close con tackle with countries like turkey and jordan that immediately border syria and obviously israel which is having already grave concerns as we do about movements of chemical weapons that might occur in such a chaotic atmosphere. 

[00:02:02]


>> Are we better off in the middle east now than we were four years ago? Absolutely not. Why? Because the policies of the administration and the way its been handling itself. 
>> When a president of the united states apologizes to religious fanatics while killing young americans, this is profoundly wrong. 
>> We would like to hold obama accountable for an absolute disastrous foreign policy. 
>> Greta: President obama starting off the second term with a foreign policy crisis. Four americans murdered in libya. The obama administration being hammered for the handling of the terror attack in benghazi. For weeks the administration claiming that the september 11th attacks were a response to a youtube video, same video that sparked violent protests around the world including outside the embassy in cairo. Since the arab spring we have seen big changes in the volatile region. How will he handle foreign policy in the next four years? We asked our experts. 
>> I know it's a complicated issue, but is there a way to describe our current foreign policy? 
>> It's a very complex situation because we have a number of foreign policy problems. Iran, syria. Evolution of the arab spring and we have number of fundamental changes that is going on in the distribution of the economy and china, conditions in russia. There are a number of problems anew environment. We have not developed a coherent approach because in the first term you learn your job. That is the chaenge that the administration is facing. 

[00:04:05]


>> People look to the united states for leadership. They look to us because we have for so long been in a position where we've been able because of our resources and military strength, because of our values, we've been able to keep the peace. We have been able to make sure that enemies feared us and make sure allies could count on us. With we step back as we did during president obama's first term and I'm afraid we're going to do the next term ease back and you see when there a vacuum. People that don't share our interests diving into that vacuum. 
>> I traveled all over the middle east. Every leader I talked to believe the united states is weak in leaving. They are having to accommodate to that eventuality. Whether it be the saudis or you name the country they are accommodating to american weakness and withdrawal. That means that they accommodate then to some of these terrorist outfits such as al-qaeda and others that they are going to have to live witness because there is not any way to get rid of them. 
>> I see the mideast deteriorating. I think the last four years has been a failure by the obama administration to realistically to assess the threat that growing. Arab spring we didn't see coming but after that the administration had a hands off policy. When they were trying to pull khadafy out libya came for a killing zone. If it weren't for secretary clinton and ambassador rice pushing obama, it would have been worse. We need to be training a libyan army to replace the militias. I went in september of last year WITH MARCO RUBIO AND john McCain and myself went to libya. We came back and said the biggest threat to libya making it is these militias. We need to help the libyans train a national army. They were willing to pay for it. In egypt we really led from behind. This idea of having a hands off policy toward syria is about to blochb the whole region up. The war is coming to israel. It's affecting turkey and other places. So I believe that if they don't lead from the front that syria and iran are going to coming together and we're going to have a major conflict in the mideast. 

[00:06:48]


>> What was the best thing we got out the arab spring so far? 
>> The fact is authoritarian regimes have been overthrown the likelihood they will simply be replaced by other authoritarian regimes or some in some cases, yemen and libya qualify here the countries will descend into anarchy. Parts will be controlled by al-qaeda and quote, unquote, success of the government controls very little territory. I think overall the arab spring has not brought democracy and light to middle east. It has brought a deterioration of the security situation and deterioration of the american interests and those of our friends and allies like israel and arab states. 
>> Greta: There is such a division when it comes to domestic policy. On the foreign platform, when you go the foreign policy there is a lot of things and it's hard to distinction? 
>> There are big differences between this president and many democratic predecessors. This is president that does not believe, say that not because i think it, he said it himself, he doesn't believe an america ascending in the world. He went to the united nations in 2009 and said any world order elevates one nation among the other won't survive. He really I think came into office believing the world is safe fer america is less powerful. 
>> Greta: But what was done. This administrations nts are in a position where they try to maintain or manage. You can't really correct any of these crisis in the world? 
>> He is not doing a very good job of maintaining or managing. To the extent he has success, whether it was the killing of osama bin laden, the drone program, that is building on programs that were started under the bush administration. At every turn whether you are talking about not leading any kind of stay behind force in iraq or announcing a date certain for our withdrawal from afghanistan, not supporting the people in iran when they rose up in 2009 in the green revolution, walking away from what solid support of democracy in the bush administration treating the war on terror like law enforcement officer but determining that we're going to bring terrorists on american soil. 

[00:09:35]


>> Greta: It didn't happen. 
>> It didn't happen because people rose out. 
>> Greta: How about this question. Do we have more influence in the world now or do we have less influence? 
>> We had more influence, but the present world has a greater need of being reshaped because we operated with the structure. The president has to change the structure. If you look at the middle east we are used to thinking of states because that is what we have learned all our lives. In the middle east states created only around 1920. They were result of world war one and built by european countries and had their own rivalries. So countries like syria, iraq, jordan, those states had no existence before that and some more recent. So when the revolution occurs there what you see you may have she'ites and sunnis in one state and then sunnis in other state and then you may have a tendency of uniting the religious groups across borders so that not only do the states have revolutions but the whole system is in upheaval there. 
>> Greta: How do you describe the president's policy as it relates to syria, iran, egypt that area of the world? 
>> I think president obama is agrees with me. He is none interventionist. He want to stay out of the syrian war. With regard to iran you I think the president and pentagon do not want war with iran, but there are people in this country certain lynette net and his allies in the united states on the threat to build nuclear weapons by iran, I think the president doesn't want to fight another war. I think he is right in. That we have to engage in nation building at home, she right in tune with the american people. 

[00:12:16]


>> I think it's very clear the weak american leadership sent a signal to the middle east that we don't want to lead. Iraq, one of more tragic aspects we lost over 4,000 brave young americans. We intended to leave a residual force. President didn't want to see it happen. We see iraq unrafblg. We see a dramatic increase to violence. They just condemned their vice president to death. Al-qaeda is now set up training camps in western iraq. Iranian airplanes are flying iraq from syria and our failure to intervene in any way and establishing a safe zone, al-qaeda is coming in there in droves. When this thing ends and all conflicts do end, we're going to have one heck of a time with the al-qaeda elements that have moved in to syria and it it's going to be very difficult. Iranians continue on path to nuclear weapons. Afghanistan is also unraveling to the degree that everybody thinks that the suns leaving because that is what the president has said. They are accommodating to that eventually quality. 
>> North america, northern mali has been taken over by al-qaeda. Weak leadership has led to enormous, I say long term challenges and chaos and frankly difficulties that we will be facing for a long time. 
>> Which. 
>> Which country would keep you more up at night, egypt or syria? 
>> Probably syria. Egypt is very concerning also but syria is much more near term problem in terms of the upheaval that is under way in syria in relation to iran. We know the north koreans built a nuclear power plant in syria. If syria falls apart and if the extremists take over in this situation, you have a real potential for a spillover. I think one of the places we should have acted sooner was in syria to move in there, to provide support, to provide assistance and tell people, look we will support those that are fighting for their freedom. We are the good guys. Situation where the iranians are working so hard to help ensure that those that have an extremist ideology prevail. Working so hard to assure that assad stays in power, you have to say to yourself why do the iranians care so deeply about syria. I would be more concerned about syria given its history. Frankly, across the arab world you've got regions and countries you've got people that are in power who do not support or see the world we do. 

[00:15:22]


>> Greta: Everybody is grateful that osama bin laden is gone but is there anything about the obama foreign policy that you think has been smart or something that you think you would have done, as well? 
>> I have to give them credit initially for perceiving the relationship between what happens in afghanistan and what happens in pakistan, but unfortunately the approach they took having emphasized that linkage was to believe that we quo withdraw militarily from afghanistan and negotiate with the taliban. The taliban take that as a sign of weakness and unfortunately the linkage with a tha we tried to understand and prevent pakistan from falling as well, now I think is going to borne out if taliban retakes afghanistan, the odds of radicals taking over the government in pakistan goes up. 
>> Greta: Straight ahead, as the u.S. Troop withdrawal from afghanistan approaches, president obama has big decisions to make. What kind of policy toward afghanistan will we see in his second term? Hour experts answer that question next. Time is running out. Iran is poised to double the out put of enriched uranium. How is israel and u.S. Planning to stop iran? That is coming up. holidays Verizon. Hurry in this Saturday and Sunday for great deals. Likehe Lucid by LG, Free. Or the Galaxy Nexus by Samsung, Free. This weekend, get the best deals on the best devices on the best network. Exclusively at Verizon. ???????????????????????????????????????????????????? >>>. 

[00:20:06]


>> Greta:2014, that is when the u.S. Plans to end the combat role in afghanistan ending the longest war in our nation's history. How many troops will remain in afghanistan after that is still unclear. The obama administration has lots of decisions to make. How are the president's policies unfolding in the second term. Once again our foreign policy experts. 
>> When afghanistan ends, it needs to end well. We need to bring most of our troops home. If you left 15,000 or 20,000 forces that would be the end of the taliban and they would have a chance. If we leave afghanistan like we did iraq it will fall apart. He had a lot of problems to deal with iraq. Not leaving any american forces in iraq and 10,000 or 12,000 would have done it has let the country deteriorate. Iran has more influence than iraq now than ever. They are overflying iraq to reinforce syria. It breaks my heart we were so close to winning in iraq and obama administration dropped the ball. If they talked about leaving afghanistan rather than getting it right that will harm us for decades. When it comes to iran, why should the iranians believe that the obama administration is serious about stopping their nuclear program when all we talk about is leaving the region? If you are going to allow a side to kill 32,000 of their own citizens and do nothing about it because you have a hands off approach to syria, what kind of signal is that to iran. 
>> Greta: Afghanistan, as you look at afghanistan where is that country headed? 
>> When you make a list, like we are doing here, you can see in anyone would want to be a president. Its problematic country. You have all the other countries and we say that by that time the government will be able to stand on its own feet. I think that is very problematic assumption. I think that government will be under horrendous pressure from the taliban and many from other surrounding countries because historically afghanistan has been sort of the transit area for the forces that emerge in that area. I have understand that desire to withdraw, but I've been urging tt we try to engage the other surrounding countries in some agreement as to permissible actions inside afghanistan so it doesn't turn into a terror center and it doesn't become through neglect the place where all the countries begin to fight their own battles. This is in the context of what i said earlier. We cannot do everything ourselves, but I don't think we should leave afghanistan without a political framework that prevents its being turned again into a terrist center. 

[00:23:52]


>> Greta: Six years from now, we're talking about afghanistan what would be the conversation? 
>> It depends who follows barack obama. If we continue down the path we are on and we end up with massive troop draw downs like it looks as we are on the path to, you could have an afghanistan where the taliban and allies in control where al-qaeda has found a foothold. All the sacrifice we have made we end up with situation we saw IN THE 1990s WHERE WE WALKED Away from it. Again terrorists that want to kill americans that threaten our security gain a foothold. I hope that is not what we see but I don't have a lot of confidence from this president tha we will lead in afghanistan that we can ensure that our enemies don't take control again. 
>> Greta: Four years from now talking about afghanistan what will the conversation be? 
>> It would be about how the new taliban government has repressed women's freedom almost entirely, how afghanistan is once more a base for al-qaeda international terrorism. Quite possibly how pakistani taliban has taken over that country and supply of nuclear weapons. The obama administration policy of withdrawing americans from afghanistan is going to bring taliban back to power. The only question is when. With will it be 2014 or 2013. This is more bad news. 
>> Greta: Coming up, the clock is ticking. Iran racing to build nuclear weapons and israeli trying to stop them before the time runs out. Israeli leaders and president obama have had their differences over iran. Will that change in the next four years? That is coming up next. wildberry is the same frequent heartburn treatment as plosec otc. Now with a fancy coating that gives you a burst of wildberry flavor. Now why make a flavored heartburn pill?

[00:28:59]


>> Greta: The race is on. Iran working to build nuclear weapons and israel hoping to stop them before it's too late. Benjamin netanyahu urging the world to stop iran in its tracks but so far president obama has resisted. Using sanctions to try to stop iran. Now, the question, will president obama change his tactics in his second term. 
>> What is our relationship with israel right now? 
>> Fractured. Not nearly trustworthy as it used to be. President obama says the right things but actions speak louder than words. When you put israel under the bus to talking about '67 borders and you talk about israeli settlements and you don't talk about rockets coming coming into israel. You send the wrong message. When you leak stories to "new york times" that israel may attack on iran it makes it sound like israel is problem. If I was one of the ayatollahs in iran I would think americans talk a lot but don't do much. Let me tell you if they get a nuclear weapon. Every sunni state is going to want one and iranian leaders will share it with terrorist groups. Reason that thousands of died on war on terror and not millions. If iranians get a nuclear weapon it won't be long that terrorists will get it. 
>> Greta: How do the iranians view the united states government and americans? 
>> I think they see a clear path to achieving their long sought objective of getting deliverable nuclear weapons. Sanctions is causing some economic pain. They would like to find a way to get rid of them. They have no fear that they ultimately use force against them. Only cloud is what israel might do. Absent an israeli attack is most likely iran gets nuclear weapons and very soon. 

[00:31:24]


>> Greta: That description sort of suggests that americans looks feckless and week and may be no moment if they do go after a nuclear weapon and they see it's an economic hardship in the short run? 
>> I think they have concluded that despite president obama's rhetoric he is not really serious when he says all options are on the table. I think they have discerned the real administration policy despite its denials they think they can contain and deter a nuclear iran. I think that is delusional policy. In any event it doesn't stop with iran. Saudi arabia, egypt and turkey get nuclear weapons as well but from iran's point of view they don't see united states as an obstacle. 
>> Greta: Is there any indication that the sanctions are working and I don't mean difficult for the iran people but working in terms of putting the brakes on their nuclear weapons program? 
>> No. There is no evidence it is put allege brake on the nuclear weapons program. There is evidence they are working in the sense one gets that iranians might be willing to consider negotiations. As a veteran of some of these negotiations on other matters one enters negotiations like this, one has to know how to bring it to a conclusion. Otherwise, when it get dragged on into a series of endless technicalities in which the outcome is always kept inside but always out of reach. It has not yet affected anything that resign is doing with their nuclear program. 

[00:33:25]


>> Greta: Our relationship with israel is what? 
>> Tenuous. This president, again, I think he has made it very clear, he said he wanted to put distance and space between the united states and israel. We are facing a threat of an iranian nuclear weapon very different intelligence assessment about what the timing is. I point out the israelis if you look back at history have been more than than right. I mentioned the case the north koreans building the react they are the syrian desert and israelis found that and not us. They clearly face a direct threat. 
>> Greta: What would you do if you were president on this? 
>> The president has to consider many different aspects. Wh I would probably do is try to put forward a proposal of which we understand by an end of iranian military nuclear capability. Their statements up to now have been varied and opposed to nuclear weapons. Let's say they are opposed to nuclear military capability. Let's talk about the enrichment program. There is shade of meaning because if you say weapon, that might imply that you are indifferent to the agent of principal material but if you let the principal material run loose there will be so much available. In 2007 there was a c.I.A. Report that had been published that predicted that iran, by 2015, could have up to seven nuclear weapons. That is reality that could happen. If that happens we will live in a different world. I would have my staff, if I were president and technically come up with an adequate proposal that prevents that from happening and then see one can incorprate that as a first step into some negotiations. Recognize if that fls, we have to two choices, either step up the pressure or to acquiesce. I would be in favor of stepping up theressure.

>> Live from america's news headquarters, I'm marianne rafferty. Larry hagman, the star of the POPULAR 80s TELEVISION DRAMA, "Dallas," has died. He passed awayo friday. He played j.R. Ewing, a conniving oil man, died of complications from throat cancer. He had also earlier battled liver cancer. He began his career in 1965 on "i dream of genie. " he was 81 years old. A massive gas explosion, rocking downtown springfield, massachusetts. The blast injuring more than a dozen people and destroying two buildings. Firefighters and gas company workers who were investigating a gas leak are among those injured. The explosion shattering glass in a three-mile radius. Witnesses say bricks and glass were flying everywhere. I'm marianne rafferty. Now back to "on the record." For your latest headline, go to foxnews.com.T TOPS $16 Trillion, largest foreign owner of our debt is china. Now, early in the first term, the president says we can't keep just borrowing from china what will the president say in a second term? Here is what experts expect to hear. 

[00:41:18]


>> It's a great power rival and competitor of the united states. And I think we may be on a collision course with china over the east china sea, which china claims and japan has claimed for a number of years and one problem here is that japanese are saying that the security treaty we have with them obliges us to send air and naval power in their behalf in case there is a clash with china over these islands so I think that is a problem area, china being tough in the south china sea, claiming those territories they understand tie waun straits stay out of the yellow sea. I think we're headed for collisions with china but neither country has interest whatever in any kind of war with each other. It's going to be a tough relationship. We're going to be bumping up against them for decades. 
>> How do you describe our current relationship with china? 
>> Chinese have become more assertive and chinese have now got an aircraft carrier which is a statement to project power, they've been very hand fistednd have united other countries in the region in the south china sea. I think that the chinese have been a great disappointment from our expectations in making a gradual transition towards democracy which has been seeing a latest exchange of power by a group of men that, none of us know their names. I'm cnvinced chinese are going to have huge problem was a group of people, 1.3 billion people who have accessed a chumpx communications, social networking and they're going to want more than that they're getting from their government now of the an up heaveal, i predict serious problems with domestic disturbances because they're just not going to sit still for that. 

[00:43:20]


>> Greta: What do you think the chinese think about us? 
>> I would imagine they think that, you know, it's hard to believe they see anything from this administration that leads them to told us with esteem or respect. You know? They watch how we react with other leaders around the world. And when they see the president of the united states bowing to other world leaders and thomasing flexibility to the russians, none that have is a sign of strength. When they see the united states has to cut the size of the nuclear arsen yil yal if we want to convince north koreans to do the same? That is the joke to them, not the real world. This isn't a president they respect. 
>> Is there a occurrencey war with them that impacts our economy? That we need to worry? 
>> I think the treaty have taken place and chinese have won. We lost six million manufacturing jobs in the first decade of the 21 century. 50,000 factories have been moved to china. They kbraixly sucked factories all out of the united states, then, they started producing goods they got the technology, investment. They started sending jobs, not the jobs, goods back to the united states. That is why we've had trillions of dollars in trade deficits with china. Managers of the trade policy with china, democrats and republicans, I think are guilty of real political malpractice on a large scale. 
>> Greta: What is the chinese viewpoint of what they're doing vis-a-vis north korea? 
>> Almost any country, chinese goes back than our memory. Because of the great war, many of the invasions of china have come by bypassing the great wall, along north korea. And... Also, the japanese intend to conquer asiana started in korea. So china, korea is an extremely sensitive point. What I think the chinese would like best is an outcome would be a nonnuclear, peaceful, north korea. They would not want a unified korea because it would seem that the high-tech korea and yellow ribbon with modern weapons would resurrect his storeal cal threats in their minds. Also for them, the korean war as the image they thought as a symbolic significance. They took on the united states when they were very weak and came out from their point of view, achieving their effectiveness. 

[00:46:46]

[00:50:44]


>> greta: Another big foreign policy problem for the u.S.. Nonorth korea leaders warning hostile u.S. Policy could spark a nuclear war n april after north korea launched a long range rocket, the u.S. Led the push for broader sanctions against north korea. Then, the obama administration cancel aid deal so how will president obama deal with this volatile nation in the second term? Is north korea contained in the sense they haven't done anything provocative recently. We don't hear much from them there. Is no sort of discussion about them, are they sort of on hold and quiet now? So there isn't a lot of attention ton them? 
>> I don't think so. I think the fact the obama administration didn't engage in concessions to the north koreans the way the bush administration did, has been a small plus but that doesn't mean that the north korea nuclear weapons program hasn't been proceeding deep within the mountains of north korea. I think the united states actually lost a big opportunity which kim jong-il died and north koreans had to go through succession, that was a period of vulnerability we might have been able to take advantage of to see the collapse of the north korean state and reunification of the peninsula. If the new ruler is able to consolidate power then we're going to see this unhappy movie continue and north korea, which tried to build nuclear reactors in syria until israelies destroyed it in september, 2007, and which will sell anything to anyone with hard occurrencey will remain a nuclear proliferation threat around the world. 
>> This is still the most brutal dictatorship on earth. They have brutalizing 250,000 people who they starve and beat to death. And I don't know what is going to happen to north korea. But the key to it again is china. Chinese should without the chinese support, the economy of north korea could collapse. Just as china is playing a role in the un in regards to syria. 

[00:53:01]


>> When I think about north korea I think about a particularly in the context of nuclear proliferation. And if you look at one of the greatest threats the nation faces, the president faces it's that threat. How are we going to enjoy -- ensure we're doing everything to protect ourselves against nuclear weapons? 
>> Take the north korean situation. Chinese would persuade north koreans not to go you'll out and build a large arsenal. We have to tell them if north korea continues to build or test nuclear weapons, we will take off from south korea the pro hibation we have of south korea buildings and in which case I don't think chinese would like it much. I think unless you're willing to make statements to these folks you don't get much cooperation. China looks upon north korea rightly. They would be unhappy if the north korea regime were overthrown they see capitolist democracy, marching right up to their border right on the border. 
>> What about north korea? How do you describe what the president has done? 
>> The obama administration is like the bush administration, let it get out of hand. You give them food sh they promise to stop stepz development. They continue to build bombs. 
>> Tafsh them to death? 
>> No. Ice yol yait the regime, try to bring out the best in the people. But ice yol yait them. At the end of the day, they're starving their people. 
>> They are isolated already. I mean, people are starving to death there. 
>> You go there a lot and represent the best of o country. But the japanese and koreans are not getting nuclear weapons because they know we're in the region. Chinese have a lot of leverage over north korea. If you want to it change have the chinese help you. The chinese are making this a joke. And russians are running over us in the un and feeling no threat. Very a tougher policy with china.

>> Five years ago, I was 270 pounds. I had the gastric bypass surgery and gave away 130-something pounds and was stuck with a lot of extra skin. My main concern is that I'm getting this marionette look. This skin is just... You know, I've lost a lot of elasticity from the weight over the years. So, this here, my little friend is going, I'll say good-bye to, and I want to get rid of this edge here. I want to get rid of this kind of look. And I had seen a friend who had had the lifestyle lift. Then I saw these results and i said, "you know, let me go and see what this is about."

[00:04:18]


>> I am amazed at the difference a lifestyle lift makes. Let me now introduce you to someone else who recently had her lifestyle lift. Let's roll linda's before video. 
>> The reason I want to have the lifestyle lift is... My neck... Is sagging and I don't like the way it makes me look. I feel older and tired. I would like to have a firmer jaw line and then this part, um, firmed up too as well. 
>> And now let's welcome linda to the show. Wow, you look beautiful. 
>> Thank you! 
>> Linda, why did you want to get a lifestyle lift? 
>> I didn't like my neck. My neck was aging very fast and I didn't like the way I was looking at all and I would cover it up all the time and I wanted to get a lifestyle lift. 
>> Describe to us how you feel about how you look now. 
>> I love the way I look now. I feel more confident. I smile more. >> Oh... Did you have concerns before you did this lifestyle lift and do you feel differently about that now? 
>> Yeah, my main concern about having any kind of procedure was that it wouldn't look natural, but it looks fabulous. 
>> It sure does. What has your spouse or your friends said to you since you had your lifestyle lift? 
>> Well, my husband thinks he's going out with a younger woman, which is me. 
>> Ooh! [Both laugh] what would you say to other women out there who are not quite happy about how they look and maybe they're thinking about doing something like this? 
>> I would definitely recommend the lifestyle lift.

[00:06:45]


>> It's the first thing people look at, they look at your face. When I looked at my face before I had jowls and my neck looked awful. Now I feel more confident, so I'm very, very happy that i had the lifestyle lift done. 
>> Announcer: Call the number you see on your screen right now to receive your free information kit. The call is confidential, the information is free and there's absolutely no obligation. You deserve a lifestyle lift. Call right now. 
>> I'm here with facial plastic surgeon dr. David kent. He's a member of the prestigious american academy of facial, plastic and reconstructive surgery and the founder of lifestyle lift. Dr. Kent, more than 150,000 people have already had a lifestyle lift. Why is it so popular? 
>> There's a lot of reasons why lifestyle lift is so popular. One of the number one reasons is is that people these days are much healthier, they feel young, u know, they're much more active than previous generations. And they kinda want their outsides to match their insides. They don't like looking older when they feel so young. Other reasons that lifestyle lift is so popular is because our doctors are experts at doing this. They focus exclusively on the face and they do more of these types of procedures than pretty much any doctor in the country. So they become very, very good and they know how to treat every individual depending on their various characteristics to get the best possible results. 
>> What are some of the things that people are afraid of? 
>> I think the biggest risk with having a procedure to make yourself look younger is with the anesthesia and at lifestyle lift we've really completely removed the serious risks of i.V. And general anesthesia and it's much safer that way. 
>> I'm in show business, so i have seen a lot of people who have had a lot of different kinds of procedures and I am kind of astounded how natural the people look who've had a lifestyle lift. 
>> We strive for that natural appearance, that natural result. Lifestyle lift doesn't change you. It simply makes you look the same way you did years ago. 

[00:08:50]


>> What I'm hoping for is for the skin to be just tightened up in this area, you know, just to look firmer and just a better profile in general. Because I just don't like when i turn to the side especially. I just feel like it's just not as distinct as it used to be. When I'd see a picture of myself or I'd walk by a mirror, I would actually stop, especially if the mirror was on the side and just take a double glance and just couldn't believe the change in just a few years, you know, and I was unaware how it just kind of crept up on me. When I saw the before pictures, I had no idea that it was as bad as I thought. You know, you walk around every day and I was aware that i didn't like my profile and i hadn't liked it for a long time. But I can't believe that I had that kind of change. Again, literally it was just overnight. As soon as it was over, within 24 hours, my husband looked for the first time and said you could immediately see a difference and change. I mean, drastically. 
>> Joining us now is dr. Judi bloom, a licensed marriage and family therapist in california who has a degree in clinical psychology and she's also a well-known radio personality. Dr. Bloom, what would you say are the psychological benefits of looking younger? 
>> You know, I think there are great psychological benefits in looking younger. For a lot of people, it helps them feel like their insides and their outsides match again, because they actually felt younger inside than the world was treating them. And they find that the world starts to respond differently when they look different and that enhances people's sense of self, their self-esteem, their self-confidence. 
>> And dr. Kent, who would you say are your typical patients? 
>> Well, my typical patient is somebody who really wants to do something for themselves... Has probably raised children, taking care of spouses, worked their whole life and really never did anything for themselves. And they kind of look in the mirror and they say, "i'm gonna do something for myself this time." 
>> I did this lifestyle lift for myself. I've spent the last nine years taking care of my mom and my mother passed away about a year ago and I decided it's time for me to start doing good things for myself. And I saw that I was starting to look a little droopy around the edges with my chin and I heard about lifestyle lift and I got excited and went in and spoke to them and made the decision that this is something that I would like to do for myself. Now that my neck is gone and I've had the procedure done, my friends tell me that I look younger to them and some of my friends are 15 years younger than me and it makes me feel good about myself. Now I don't have to hide my profile or feel bad about my profile anymore. 

[00:11:32]


>> Now let's meet eloise. Here's a video of her before her lifestyle lift. 
>> When I look in the mirror, I see these fat pouches that hang, lots of wrinkles around my mouth, and then I also see a sagging neck. So, um, it looks old and it looks tired and, um, very unattractive, I think. 
>> And now here's eloise today. Wow! You look amazing. 
>> Thank you so much. 
>> How do you think your lifestyle lift turned out? 
>> Oh, I loved it at the very beginning and I'm just now amazed because it's actually smoother, tighter, the jowls, my chin. It's great and perfect and it's three years later. 
>> Three years later. 
>> So I couldn't be happier. 
>> [Laughs] would you say that getting a lifestyle lift boosted your confidence? 
>> Oh, I've always been actually a pretty confident person. The thing that I really noticed since I've had it done, is that everyone responds to me with more confidence in me. >> Wow. 
>> They don't treat me as if I'm an older person that is getting out of touch with current things and with life as it is. So that's been a benefit that i never would have expected. 
>> Dr. Kent, eloise looks amazing. Is this kind of physical transformation what all of your patients can expect? 
>> Well, everybody's different, but we certainly can make everybody look better and she's a great example of what we can do with the lifestyle lift. 
>> She sure is. Procedures like this have been thought of as something that only the very wealthy can afford. Is this now something that anybody could afford? 
>> Well, I would say in the past, before lifestyle lift, procedures like this and the ability to look younger were really reserved for wealthy people, movie stars. We have made it affordable now for almost everybody to look younger. 

[00:13:43]


>> Eloise, would you say that this was worth the investment you made in yourself? 
>> Absolutely. My husband would concur as well and one of the things he told me he feels very proud of is that I've continued to take care of myself. A lot of the pressure off of him. He thinks I'm gonna live longer and healthier and it's a good thing to have your husband admire you. 
>> Ooh, it certainly is. Do you mind telling us your age when you had the lifestyle lift and your age now? 
>> Absolutely not. I'm really very proud to say that I had this done when I was 69 years old and that was three years ago and now I'm 72. 
>> [Laughs] I think that's amazing! 
>> Thank you. Thank you and it feels great. It feels great to be 72.

>> I'd like to now introduce someone who knows a lot about looking good. Michelle bouse is a licensed esthetician and celebrity make-up artist whose clients include some of hollywood's biggest stars. Now, michelle, you work with a lot of people who really want to look younger. Tell us about the many skin treatments and things that you would use to offer a quick but minor fix. 
>> Well, a lot of what I do with celebrities and the average person are special events and red carpet events. So what they're looking for is a quick fix for maybe one day. They want to look great, they want to look firm, they want to look tight and they want their make-up to be beautiful and flawless. So a lot of what I'm doing lasts about a day, maybe a day and a half if it's a topical cream, but once they wipe their face off, the make-up is gone, my magic is gone and then once they wait a few days, the topical creams have worn down and their skin goes back to the way it was before I did the event. 
>> What do you think about the lifestyle lift and the natural results people have? 
>> There has been a need for this treatment for a long time. This is a very difficult area to treat for me as an esthetician and as a make-up artist. There's only so much I can do in the nec area. 
>> So, for some of these clients who have asked you now, with what you've seen, what would you say to them? 
>> I think a lot of people are intimidated to try something and have a procedure done because they're afraid it's not going to look natural, that it's going to be overdone. You see everybody on tv... 
>> What have they done? 
>> They looked so good before. What happened? And it wasn't necessarily something that enhanced the way they lked, and I think everybody still wants to look like themselves, they just want to look like they did when they were younger. But they still want to look like themselves-- they don't want to look totally different. 
>> So now let me introduce you to maggie. Let's roll maggie's before video. This is how she looked before lifestyle lift. 
>> It's not that I don't like my appearance, I just feel that there's always room for improvement. I actually saw the lifestyle lift commercial and I was saying, "gee, those women look just like me," the before shots. And I said, "i want to look like those after shots." 

[00:17:49]


>> Now here she is after. Let's welcome maggie. What an astonishing difference. 
>> Thanks, debby. 
>> Now tell me, why did you get the lifestyle lift? 
>> Well, I'm a pretty happy person and whenever I would look in the mirror, I always saw these frown lines. I never looked like I was smiling and that's just not who maggie is. 
>> Well, how has your life changed? 
>> Well, I walk a little taller. I've taken better care of myself-- I wear sunscreen now. [Debby chuckles] and, um, I put accessories on that I didn't-- wouldn't have normally done. I was basically a mascara/lipstick person. 
>> Well, michelle, are you impressed with maggie's results? Just tell us what you see. 
>> Definitely, maggie. You've had some great before and after results. You should be so happy. You look like you really got a great lift on your neck area as well as your jowls have disappeared and your deep frown lines around your mouth. I see a little bit of a lift even on the lower cheek/jaw line. It looks beautiful. 
>> Thank you so much. 
>> Great results and so natural. 
>> Would you say you're happier today after having had the lifestyle lift? 
>> I do like the results. I'm very pleased.

>> Thank you! I feel fantastic. Thank you very much. 
>> Tell me, colleen, why did you decide to go ahead and do a lifestyle lift? 
>> My face was really showing signs of aging. At a younger age, I had jowls. I had too much skin. I felt the chicken neck coming up. 
>> What about positive changes in your life since you had the lifestyle lift? 
>> I think the most is that i was pretty much giving up on trying to look good. I wouldn't do my hair. I wouldn't dress up. I'd, you know, put on the jogging pants or the overalls and not put on make-up, because it never looked good enough. It's like I didn't feel like i looked pretty anymore, so now i have inspiration to want to do that. 
>> So tell me, what kind of responses have you been getting from maybe friends or family? 
>> Oh, they're all amazed. I've had so many friends go out and get consultations. Quite a few have gotten it done for themselves and my boyfriend, he actually went and got his done, so... >> Really? 
>> Yeah, he's 10 years older than me and he's like, he's in the business, the music business, and so he sings on stage and so it was real important for him. 
>> What would you say to someone who's maybe considering having a procedure like this done? 
>> I say run, do not walk, and go get it done. [Both laugh] really, it will make all the difference because it's natural, you don't feel fake, you don't feel like, "oh my god, I'm one of those people that, you know, who are you?" It's me and they don't know really what I did. They just know I look great.

>> I don't think anyone can understand how it feels to look at yourself in the mirror one day and the next day look so naturally younger, refreshed and just feel great. Look at the before and after pictures. These are not touched up. I looked old and now I look healthy, young. I never looked this good. You've got to do it. 
>> About two weeks after I had the procedure, I was going to the pharmacy and I was in the drive-through window and i rolled down my window and the pharmacist said, "you look amazing! What did you do? What's happened to you?" And I couldn't wait to share my experience and tell him about my procedure. 
>> After I had the procedure, i looked, I felt I looked great. When I looked in the mirror, that was the look I wanted. You know, it was natural. There's no doubt there's been a change. I feel better about myself, I'm confident. I don't even think about the way I used to look-- tired, old and, you know, unhealthy-looking. Now, you kno I'm vibrant and i have a lot going for me. 
>> I'm a firm believer that if there's something you can do to make yourself feel better about yourself, then absolutely go do it. I always said, "i'll fight aging every step of the way," and I'll do it. And this was my first step and it was the best one ever.

=======================================================

>>> Okay, stand by, piers. 
>> Things have got pretty wild with some of my guests but nothing quite like this. What the hell's that? My studio's turned into a jungle. Whoa! Jack, am I going to die here? Oh, my god, what's this? Tonight, the one and only jack hanna and a few of his closest friends. 
>> He defecates on his legs to keep them cool. 
>> You know what, jack, too much information. 
>> If he bites you, it won't hurt bad. 
>> You know what? 
>> You won't believe this. This is the only one in the world to carry leprosy. 
>> Now you tell me. Never quite know what will happen next when jack hanna's in the house. He's got my notes. 
>> I'm sorry. That your notes? 
>> This is a very dangerous edition of "piers morgan tonight." Good evening. Welcome to a special "piers morgan tonight." As you can see, the studio looks a little different tonight. Trust me, so will my guests that will be here over the course of the hour. We're talking cheetahs, foxes, owls, komodo dragons. I'm here with jack hanna, where anything can happen. Jack hanna is director of the columbus zoo and aquarium and also the host of the emmy award winning jack hanna's into the wild and a new show called wild countdown. His tigers are literally eating my studio. We better get on with this. Jack, welcome. Jack, am I going to die here? 
>> You shouldn't die, but if you were going to die, these would be the animals that would do it. 
>> These are baby tigers? How old are they? 
>> Siberian tigers, 13 weeks. 
>> At what age can they kill a man? 
>> About another 22 months. 
>> Right. 
>> Because at about 22 months, these animals weigh over 600 pounds. 
>> Really? 
>> This is one of the rarest cats in the world, piers. There are less than some people say 400. There could be less than 200 left in that part of the world. They were hunted for their coats but the problem today, you can imagine this animal at 600 pounds. 
>> They look strong already. 
>> Oh, they're very strong. They could literally put a hole through your arm right now. 
>> Right. Looks like he wants to. Can they bite at this age? 
>> Oh, yeah. They learn from each other. These species survival plan. What they are, they have chips in them. This animal, it could be another three to six months, could go to a zoo in europe, australia, wherever it might be that's an to know exactly what the breeding program will be for the creature. 

[00:02:20]


>> Why are you not remotely scared of them? 
>> It's not a manner of -- you know, that's a good question. People ask me about scared. If I find myself afraid or scared, that means I'm doing the wrong thing. These guys know about the animals from the columbus zoo, where they were born, but they you do that much. You see how he's licking me? If that were a full grown tiger, pieran ten minutes, he could lick me and just lick my arm to the bone. That's how rough that tongue becomes. 
>> Rlly? 
>> Like sandpaper beyond you have ever seen. 
>> When they get to the full size, how many of these are there left in the world? 
>> Maybe 200 to 400. That's all. 
>> That's all there is? 
>> All there is. 
>> These are literally two of the last remaining siberian tigers. 
>> In the zoo world we do quite well with them. Remember, when a tiger takes down like -- like in india, the bengal tiger, I've seen them take down a water buffalo in less than ten seconds. It's like a bomb going off. Beyond anything like a grenade going off inside something. They are also one of the only cats in the world that when they can eat up to 30, 40 pounds at one sitting, even their stomachs can explode so not eat ied meat. 
>> What do you feed them with? 
>> This is a special diet we have for the cats. You heard that little growling? You hear that in the wild, your pants won't be dry. 
>> My pants aren't very dry at the moment, jack. I can tell you that. They may be small but when they're this close they are quite big. 
>> You appreciate now, see, that's what being here with you means a lot to us because now, because of millions of people you reach, you now are seeing one of the rarest creatures in the world, you can see the power we're talking about. You also can see the beauty of the animal. It would be a tragedy to see this animal go into extinction. There are several tiger species that have gone into extinction. That's not what we want to have happen. 
>> It would be a tragedy but a bigger tragedy would be if one of them ate me live on air. Let's get a move on quite swiftly. 
>> We'll do it. 
>> Nice to meet the tiger cubs. 
>> They were born at the columbus zoo about 13 weeks ago. Bad. 

[00:04:34]


>> You know what, you just hang on to the animals for now. 
>> If you have ever been to egypt, in the tombs, the pyramids -- 
>> like a sphinx face. 
>> That's right. Pharaohs used to domesticate this animal. You saw how big the tigers were? It won't get that thick. You see how thin it is. Look at the ears of this cat. See why -- they didn't worship the animal but the animal represented royalty back then. I'm sure a lot of people lost their hands trying to domesticate this creature. What's unique, this is one of the only cats in the world that can jump ten feet in the air and catch a bird flying. They get in the grass, I have seen this twice in wild, they blend in so well, they live in the plains of kenya, tanzania, that part of the world, and they don't exist hardly up in egypt anymore. They lay down in there, watch for a bird and go popping up like that because their back legs -- 
>> ten feet is-- 
>> it's amazing. They can grab the bird flying by. It's a caracle cat. That gives him away, the ears. 
>> Okay. What's next? We've got the -- what are these? 
>> This is amazing. This is a servile cat. This cat also is a cat -- this cat also's a cat that is from africa. This cat has the front legs and hind legs are different. He's one of the few cats in the world to catch a bird in free flight. This animal has, if you look at the back of the ears, you'll notice spots on the back of his ears. Ow. You see that? Those are called eye spots. See the spots? 
>> He wants to eat your hand. 
>> If this cat is sitting there eating something, a hyena comes up, they think he's looking backwards. Hence they call them eye spots. 
>> How tame are these by comparison to a purely wild version? 
>> Right now, as far as tame, this animal won't become a tame animal. We raise the animals, a lot of times the mothers don't raise them or whoever it might be, we raise them and they are still wild animals. People have to -- I had a famous trainer tell me once you can usually train a wild animal but never tame a wild animal. They are always going to be wild. 

[00:06:43]


>> This is a vulture? 
>> This is an egyptian vulture. Come here, buddy. 
>> You are actually feeding the vulture raw meat. 
>> Oh, yeah. 
>> So they really do eat raw meat. 
>> Oh, yes, they do. 
>> Can you smell him? 
>> I can smell him, yes. Stinks. 
>> What he does, he defecates on his legs to keep him cool. 
>> You know what, jack? Too much information. Certain things I don't have to know about. I was quite liking this vulture until you told me that. 
>> That's why they spell. Plus their head is bald -- 
>> they're ugly, they stink, they eat raw meat. Tell me one good thing about the vulture. 
>> One good thing is -- 
>> useful contribution to society other than the defecation, the feeding on carcasses and the terrible smell. 
>> They clean up all the mess other animals don't eat. But guess what this animal does, though. 
>> Kind of like a vacuum cleaner. 
>> He also takes a rock, he can take a rock and one of the few birds in the world can take the rock and open the ostrich egg. 
>> Extraordinary. Oh, my god. What's this? 
>> You remember you did a story with me -- 
>> I do. About alligators killing people, yes. All right, mate. Yes, thank you. 
>> No. They can -- 
>> no, no, no. 
>> You're smart doing that. Know why I say that? 
>> It's going to eat me. 
>> Because on the ground they can jump four feet and outrun any man on earth for 20 yards. 
>> You're serious. 
>> Yes. They're fast. This is a nice one. 
>> A nice one. 
>> If you look, they have two eyelids. 
>> How do you say a nice alligator. 
>> I don't mean nice. That's not fair. 
>> This could kill me, right? 
>> Yes. But he's not going to right now. 
>> How do you know? 
>> I don't know that for sure but I don't think he should. I want to show you something. Not many people can do this. Grant here does a great job with this alligator. He will show you -- have you ever seen down alligators' throats? 

[00:08:45]


>> Not lately, no. 
>> It's hard to do this. The power. If the cameras can see this. Look down the throat there. You see that? You can't see down his throat ke most animals. They're flat back there. That allows the alligator to go under water, open his mouth without choking on water. If a fish comes around, oh, that's a cave, let's go in there, bam. It's quick, they don't -- remember in the interview, they don't chew. They tear. 
>> I do remember that. 
>> He has sensors on the side of his head there. 
>> Let's try to humanize him. What's his name? 
>> Curly. 
>> How old do they live to be? 75, 100 years old. 
>> Are alligators natural predators? Would they attack if they're not challenged or scared? 
>> Yes. No, not scared. But if you go around an alligator with youngsters -- they lay eggses, by the way. If you get next to an alligator nest and the eggs are in the ground, they don't sit in a nest, they're over here. If you get near it, it's one of the most aggressive animals in nature. You are gone if you get near an alligator nest. They lay 20, 30 eggs and the sex of the alligator is determined by the heat of the nest. I'm not sure if the male is hot. What is it? 
>> Male is hot. 
>> A real hot nest, the eggs will be males. The gator also, we found, did research, we found boards, cans, tubes, everything inside these creatures because when they get hungry they will take apart anything. 
>> Ever found human remains inside of curly? 
>> No. But I've done shows in malaysia where you wouldn't believe -- the crocodiles get to be 21, 22, 23, 24 feet long, over 2,000 pounds. You're talking about something much bigger than your stage here. 
>> I think we should go quickly to commercial break. 
>> You want to hold it? 
>> I don't want to hold curly, no. No. I think we're into a no touching zone on this show. When we come back, you will show us happy feet penguins, jack, and one of the oldest animals in the world. First, here's one of jack's top five animal close encounters. 
>> What are you doing? 
>> I'm demonstrating how the eyes are fixed on movement. And how they don't want to hurt anyone. They can't see you. They can smell you. But you don't classify as food so you're not on the menu and pretty safe. ?????? ??????

>>> I'm back with the closest thing to a living dr. Doolittle, it is jack hanna. He is introducing some of his friends to us tonight. Bit of a ridiculous description given that we've had crocodiles and tigers. Anyway, let's pretend they're furry friends. This is a friendly looking penguin. 
>> Yes. This is a black-footed penguin. Sometimes -- if you're ever on a game show and somebody asks how many species of penguins, you say 17. Only five of the 17 live in cold weather. All the rest live in warm weather. 
>> Really? 
>> Yeah. People don't realize that. This is from south africa, it's a black-footed penguin or jackass penguin because it brays like a donkey. This one, by the way, is put on the endangered species list last july. 
>> How many penguins are left in the world? 
>> Quite a few. Except this one in south africa is listed as endangered about a year ago. It's an animal -- they don't really eat the penguin, by the way. They collect the eggs and feathers off the penguin but the animals also -- there are a lot of problems there. They have more feathers per square inch than any bird in the world, the penguins do. 
>> What's your favorite animal? 
>> My wife. That's pretty funny. She's not here. 
>> If I could say you live the rest of your life on a desert island with one animal, what would it be? 
>> Having raised animals all my life, 50-something years, i would say I'm fascinated by cats, all kind of cats. The elephant -- I think the elephant -- we will soon find out the elephant is one of the most intelligent animals in the world, more than primates. 
>> If you could have one, what would you have? 
>> One. 
>> You would have a few of them. 
>> I would have to say an elephant is fascinating. 
>> A herd of elephants. 
>> When you see a herd of elephants in africa it's phenomenal. It's the second largest land mammal in the world. In 1978 there were about 1.4 million. Today less than 375,000. So it's a major drop. 
>> Nice to meet you, penguin. Let's bring out the next animal, which is a gigantic tortoise. What's his name? 
>> Jimmy. Oh, I'm sorry. The tortoise. This is slowpoke. This animal is the kind of tortoise from the seychelles in northern africa. He gets to be 150 pounds. 

[00:16:50]


>> He's magnificent. 
>> They really are. That's what's wrong. Turtle shell, we know what happens there, jewelry, all sorts of thing. This animal is a protected species. 
>> Wow. What's this? 
>> Put that one up there. Good lord. No wonder you have to hold -- how did you even pick that thing up? This is the second largest tortoise in the world, up to 500 pounds. 
>> Who would win if they had a fight? 
>> This one here. He's much bigger. These things can live, what is it, 200 years? 200 years old? 
>> Yes. Yes. THE SAILORS IN THE 1500s, 1600s, 1700s, WOULD PUT THEM IN THE Hulls of their ship because they could last a year without food, water, nothing. They live that long. Tell you what, the ship must have stunk. But these animals are a neat creature. 
>> He's heavy, right? 
>> Yeah. This one here's a male. I think this is a male, too. Bottom of the shell is flat. 
>> Amazing animals. Really amazing. 
>> The tortoise and the hare. They're not that slow. Some people think they're that slow, but they're not. 
>> How long could they move if he wanted to? 
>> Well, in the hotel room -- 
>> you had them in the hotel room? Jack, you may not have the full ticket here, all the animals in a hotel room? 
>> Who's this? 
>> Make him do it. I don't know why I love this. I get the biggest kick out of it. My wife and I sit at home sometimes and -- 
>> what is this? 

[00:18:51]


>> Laughing cuke aburrow. 
>> Make him laugh again. 
>> Doesn't that crack you up? That's hilarious. 
>> When you're out there in the bushes, my first time in australia, this goes off about 2:00 in morning you jump out of your sleeping bag. What the heck is that thing. This is a laughing kookaburra. A lot of people have them. 
>> Does he like jokes? 
>> This is like -- 
>> check into the hotel room. Back to the wallaby, this is one of the smallest mar soupial. There are 30 different types of wallaby. Big kangaroos, they stand five, six feeall. What do you call a big group of kangaroos? 
>> A mob, I think. 
>> That's right. 
>> So they eat grass and are a neat theater. 
>> He seems quite calm compared to the rest of these nut cases. 
>> I love that bird, though. 
>> This is one of the most prehistoric animals on earth, this one right here. Got the batteries in it? 
>> What is this? 
>> This right here is a three-banded armadillo. 
>> You say batteries in it? 
>> That was a joke. You see there, one, two, three. 
>> What is this? 
>> Three banded armadillo. There are seven banded, nine bands, 11 banded. People eat armadillos in this country as well. In south america they're one of e most endangereanimals because the people cook it like a taco. He's also the only armadillo in the world that can close up so tight, not even an ant can penetrate that. Only man and a jaguar can kill it. This is the only animal that carries leprosy. 

[00:21:01]


>> Now you tell me! 
>> You think I'm joking about that. Look it up when you go back to your room. Not your room. 
>> I believe you. I just rather you tell me before I touched it. 
>> I usually tell people before they touch it. Go ahead, buddy. 
>> We need to take a break while I have a leprosy test.

>>> back now with jack hanna, the director emeritus of the columbus universe zoo. As you can see, he has brought some more company. A snow leopard. Frisky one. 
>> For me -- you asked about the elephant. This will get about four times this size. They live in the himalayas. They live at altitude. 
>> When there's so few of them, how do they find another to mate with? 
>> That's just it. Good point. They're solitary cats. When she cycles, there's not enough of them to even find the other cat. 
>> Can they mix-mate with other breeds? 
>> No, not up there. That's been done before, lion and tiger, but not any other cats that I know of. This tail, you can touch the tail if you want to. The tail gets much bigger, like this thick. Up there it's 40, 50 below zero, whatever. Wow, that was cool, wasn't it? 
>> That's very cool. Yeah. 
>> I'm sorry you don't have a hand there. I don't know who your cameraman is. Please don't sue me. This animal takes his tail and wraps it around him, all the way around him like a jacket to keep his face warm, and the ears are very short because they would obviously freeze up there. Th cat has also fur on the bottom of their feet. They can jump 30, 40 feet -- a lot up there. 
>> He likes to operate in the cold, right? 
>> Colder the better, this cat. 
>> How does he deal with being in new york? 
>> We always keep them in air conditioning wherever the cat goes. 
>> Where do you keep him at night? 
>> In the hotel room. 
>> Are you serious? 
>> Dead serious, yeah. I wouldn't lie about something like that. 
>> Do you sleep? 
>> Not much during the night. They don't sleep at all. They put me in another room. 
>> You ever get scared? No? Not at all? 
>> The sad thing about this, on the black market this coat right now, if you can even find one, a guy got caught in europe last year, $80,000. 
>> For this coat. 
>> This coat right here. 
>> That's the tragedy, isn't it? 
>> It really is. Today it is. Back in the old days is one thing. This animal -- 

[00:27:39]


>> so beautiful. 
>> It's absolutely beyond any animal that I have worked with. The snow leopard is absolutely magnificent. It represents really what endangered species are all about. 
>> Utterly beautiful. What a shame -- 
>> it really is. 
>> In a few years it could be all over. 
>> He also has a chip in him so he'll go in the ssp with the american zoo association. 
>> This is the slightly uglier end of the market. 
>> Now, this is an animal right here that has been used by our settlers and pioneers years ago. The beaver. 
>> This is the beaver that bit your hand. 
>> This isn't the same beaver but this is like the one that did it. Exactly like this. Have you ever touched a beaver? 
>> No. Is it wise given that you had your -- 
>> back here you can touch him. I just picked him up the wrong way is all I did. Anyway -- 
>> bit rougher. 
>> Right. But the beaver's a unique animal. See his tail? This tail is -- when people hear the beaver, they talk about the beaver slapping the water. 
>> Like an alligator. Is he happy with that apple? 
>> He wants more to eat. 
>> Just don't put your hand near him. 
>> Do they eat meat? 
>> No. He won't know your hand. He'll think your hand's an apple or something. 
>> That's really comforting. 
>> This tail slaps the water and that warns other animals in the area. 
>> He stinks too, jack. 
>> How do you know? Can you smell him? 
>> I can smell him. He absolutely stinks. 
>> Did he go to the bathroom? 
>> No. That's me. 
>> They usually don't smell -- they go to the bathroom, it smells. 
>> This animal bit your thumb, right? Is that the worst I've been sat on by an elephant but 99% of the time there's an accident, it's the person's fault. Not the animal's fault. If you can see the back foot, i don't know if he'll let you do that, it's a webbed foot like a duck almost. It's a webbed foot. That back foot. That's how they swim. Also, beaver -- do you have beavers in england? 

[00:29:41]


>> I think so, yeah. All right, calm down. 
>> Get another look at him. What have we got here? 
>> I have never done this on any show before. There are all kinds of foxes, red, gray. This is the smallest one in the world from the sahara desert. It has big ears not just to hear with. They have blood vessels in their ears to keep them cool in the desert like a dog has a tongue, your temperature is 98.6. The elephant has big ears to keep it cool. This animal can go his whole life in the desert without drinking water. Scorpions, snakes, lizards. 
>> Without ever drinking water? 
>> Water comes from what he eats. 
>> It eats insects and spiders that have water in them? 
>> Yes. Big black scorpions? That's what he loves to eat. This is the smallest fox in the world. This fox here, this is -- which is that one? Both these, right? Okay. The swift fox which is one of the rarest, very endangered in our country. It goes 30 to 40 miles an hour, the fastest fox in the world. Full grown, this one rig here. They're a very social creature. They take care of the sick, the old and the young first. When you say cunning like a fox, these things are bright. Swift foxes in this country, very few people get to see. Smallest fox in the world. Beautiful animals. This right here, though, this is the largest owl in the world. The eurasian eagle owl. 
>> The biggest owl in the world. >> 
>> if you're ever asked a question on a game show, what animal is found on every continent except antarctica. He isn't even full grown yet. You want to hold him? You can hold him. 
>> I will let your guy hold him. 
>> One thing you want to do is have a glove. You see the talons? A bald eagle has 1,000 pounds of pressure per square inch. If that was a bald eagle, it would go through his skin, into the muscle, break his bone in a split second. That's how powerful the talons are. See how he turns his head like a corkscrew. The reason is his eyes are so big, they cannot move in the eye socket. If you see a pretty girl go by, you go like this without your wife seeing you. Well, he can't do that. His eyes are so big he has to move his whole head around. He can't turn it all the way around or his head would fall off, but he can go almost all the way around. Also, they're the bird of silent flight. If I were to fly him one inch over your head you would never hear anything. A parrot or goose or -- 

[00:32:11]


>> really? Completely silent? 
>> Silent flight. One last thing. They call them a wise old owl not because they have a big brain. It's because their senses of hearing and eyesight, this animal's ears are over here on the side of his head like a soup bowl like this. The echo location he picks up, he can hunt in total darkness. 
>> Amazing creatures. 
-. 
>> A lot of people don't get to see an owl like this. 
>> Actually very dangerous in their own way. 
>> They can be, yes. But also, they are good at controlling rodents. A barn owl can take out 30 mice in an hour in a barn. They are protected species in our country, the owl. 
>> When we come back, the fastest animal on the planet. First, another of jack's top five closest animal encounters. 
>> If you look up now, look up there, all the bird nests. 
>> Those are bats up there. 
>> Bats and birds. Both. 
>> Let's keep moving. Folks who save hundreds of dollars switching to GEICO sure are happy. How happy, Ronny? Happier than Gallagher at a Farmers' Market. Get happy. Get GEICO. ??????

>>> usain bolt is hands-down the fastest human the world has ever known but I wonder how he would fare against the animal jack hanna has just brought out. We seem to have a large fully formed cheetah. 
>> This animal goes 70 miles an hour. If you're in the car going 65 miles an hour -- we clocked him at 70. His eyesight is impeccable. Two miles away he can spot his prey. Look at the eyes, you notice the dark marks under his eyes like a football player, baseball player, when you look at direct light like I am right now? Mother nature invented that because cheetah is the only cat to hunt in the middle of the day. 110 degrees outside. They've got to. The only cat in the world, this is an amazing shot, with non-retractible claws. Every cat in the world can retract their claws but a cheetah. It's like a dog foot that allows him to run even faster. When they do make a hit, 50, 60 miles an hour, 60% of the time the animal gets away. I'm here, don't worry. Maybe you should worry. Anyway -- 
>> this is the first time i really felt quite intimidated. Close up, this is a big beast. 
>> See why in the wild, I tell you we film in the comfort zone of me and the animal. This animal is still a wild animal but he was born in one the most fantastic places out of the zoo. 
>> How would this kill? 
>> This would kill basically in the wild, it has to grab the throat and do the choke hold. Once they do that, they sit there for five to ten minutes. The sad thing is, what happens, if they move in to kill, buzzards and vultures circle over. The hyenas and lions are sleeping. They go the cheetah made the kill and sometimes the lion will eat the cheetah. This animal has a tough time in nature. 
>> The lion will kill the cheetah and eat it. 
>> Yes. That's not a very common thing but they will do that. 

[00:39:02]


>> Can a lion kill anything, basically? 
>> The king of beasts. It can kill just about anything. Be a tough time with the elephants. Egyptians we know also -- 
>> so they prefer to be alone. 
>> Yes. Oh, yeah. Unless she has her cubs which stay with her three to four years. The egyptians also, this is another cat the egyptians actually tried to domesticate. Now it exists nowhere in northern africa. Where the equator goes through kenya, that's where you start finding the cheetah. 
>> How can your trainers be so relaxed? 
>> Because these folks -- the cheetah on her first birth much cubs she'll eat them or destroy them or let them go. We knew that, but they were born four weeks early. This is one of four. We've saved two of them. Right now, we breed 10 or 12 cheetahs a year. It's 10,000 acres we have next to the columbus zoo. It's a beautiful creature. Hear that noise there? That's purring. 
>> Over 100 meters, if it was this cheetah against usain bolt, who would win? 
>> You or me? 
>> Usain bolt, the sprinter from the olympics. Who would win? 
>> This guy here. 
>> He wouldn't get ten feet. When we film it's three cameras. We can't take one. Three cameras can't even film the cheetah kill. It's like this and the cat t at 50 miles an hour like that, hits its prey, it's like a cloud of dust. 
>> There is no faster animal in the world? 
>> The peregrine falcon, that's 220 miles an hour. 
>> In terms of land -- 
>> that's the fastest in the world. 
>> It's an amazing, amazing creature. 
>> Again, for you to see that, piers, means a lot to us because now you see the fastest animal in the world, a cheetah. 
>> I've never been this close to an animal where you feel the power. This isn't really one of the big cats but I can feel the surging power and aggression. 
>> Next time I come, I'll bring a full-grown tiger. 

[00:41:03]


>> What makes you believe there will be a next time? It 
>> you see the tail? The tail is like a sail on a sailboat. Going 60 miles an hour, that tail will help him turn. 
>> Absolutely amazing. Indisputably probably the ugliest, the wart hog. Here he comes. 
>> Some people say the wildebeast was all the leftover parts. 
>> It is a very ugly animal, isn't it? I know you love animals. You must agree this is a particularly ugly specimen. 
>> He's something. The wart hog, see the warts on his face? Those warts when this -- turn his face that way. When he gets full grown, the warts get all over his face. They protect him when they fight sometimes. Plus, his teeth, like ivory, come out of his mouth like two knives. Those things are very important for him to help protect himsf if a lion were to attack. The wart hog is the main source of food for these animals because the wart hog spends 60% of his life on his knees. Usually the wart hog is on his knees eating grasses and that kind of stuff. But the wart hog also is an important animal for other animals -- 
>> how much milk do they drink a day? 
>> He's weaned now. 
>> Look at the tail. See that little tail? That tail will stick up like this. When you go to africa, if that animal does this, it starts running, all the other animals, giraffes, any animals around, they will see this and take off because they know the wart hog has sensed something. They're very bright animals. They know when something bad is coming around. He is eaten by a lot of animals. He digs holes in the ground. So the hyena comes in and takes over their holes. People don't think are bright but the hog or pig is an intelligent creature. 
>> Extraordinary. 
>> Next, a couple of the cutest little critters you will ever see. But first, another of his animal close encounters with a malaysian cobra. 
>> And the movement. And see how they strike. 
>> The end of this snake show was just as amazing.

>>> Back with jack hanna, who started turning my studio into a slice of madagascar. We have been joined by this vast bear-like creature. What is this? 
>> This is a bearcat. I don't know if you can kneel, only because of the camera. They can get a better shot. That's great. This animal is what I call a wolverine. We have a wolverine in this country which is pound for pound the most fearless animals in our country. But this has been around from malaysia. This tail right here is a prehensile tail. If that tail gets around your neck he can do you in in 30, 60 seconds. That's how powerful it is. He would not do that, but he has big teeth, his whiskers are there. He's nocturnal, lives in the incredible jungles there. He feels with whiskers in total darkness to move around. He can't see. He smells like popcorn, he smells -- 
>> he smells exactly like popcorn. We get so hungry in the truck when we're driving around with him. Because he smells like popcorn. Those claws can tear apart anything. Plus, do you remember seeing the cobra there? 
>> Do you guys never get bitten? 
>> Yeah, but again, they raise the animals. They know these are wild animals. For educational purposes, we want to bring them on, especially the honor of coming to your show tonight, to teach people about these creatures. Some people shoot the animal because he might eat chickens or something. But the good lord created creatures for a certain reason. This is one of the most spectacular. They call him bearcat because he feels like a bear. You ever touch a bear? 
>> No. 
>> That's stupid. 
>> No. It's sensible. 
>> It looks part bear/part cat. Not many people have ever seen a bearcat. 
>> Amazing creature. Thank you very much. Next we have I think -- 
>> I hope you remember -- all I remember about the palm civet is its droppings are used to fertilize coffee. 
>> He eats the coffee bean, goes in his stomach, through his intestines, on the ground with a film coating. They take it, bake it, sell it for $500 a pound, coffee. Imagine that? Supposed to be medicinal. This animal here, you remember about ten years ago, sars killed people? This is the animal caused the sars disease. Not this animal, this species. It's a delicacy in asia, sells for $200 at a restaurant. They also use the fur and use underneath the armpits for PERFUME IN THE EARLY 1940s AND '50s. But the animal also loves, as i told you before, like the other one loves to eat cobras as well. This little creature could eat a king cobra. How does he do that? When a cobra strikes at you he goes like this. Not like a rattlesnake. He goes like this. You can predict it. This animal comes down on the ground starts walking around the cobra. So the cobra is like this trying to get him. All of a sudden this little creature runs around the cobra like this and the cobra is the cobra gets so dizzy he falls over and bites the cobra's head off. It's funny. 

[00:50:01]


>> Unbelievable. 
>> That's how he kills it! Makes him go round and round till he's dizzy. 
>> This animal here is one you've heard about. This is the siberian lynx. 
>> Easy, mate. 
>> Just holding him a bit loose for my liking in case he decides to -- 
>> jump on him. This animal here, sorry to say, some species animals was declared extinct in the wild about a year ago. You don't see that very often. The siberian lynx is doing pretty good in the zoos. He was hunted for his coat. He sees himself in that monitor right there. He sees something there. 
>> Seeing me at the moment. A look of hunger in its eyes. 
>> If you guys can focus on his back foot here a second, right in here, you see how flat that back foot is, perfect, this foot right in here. You see that foot there? This animal runs on the whole back part, not on the pad, the whole thing here. This is what he runs on. The whole back thing. It's like a snowshoe. 
>> Amazing. 
>> It's like a snowshoe. 
>> Runs flat almost. 
>> Exactly. This animal would sink in the snow. But this animal was hunted for their coats. That's no longer the case. It's a beautiful -- 
>> now we have the -- 
>> he can jump on you if you want him to. 
>> To every question, it's no. 
>> The lemur is a presimien. Look at the hands there. Just like your hand. Isn't that amazing? You can imagine -- it's only from madagascar. That's where they live. 

[00:52:16]


>> They are human hands? 
>> Exactly. 
>> He's got my notes. 
>> Those are your notes? I'm sorry. But he's also marking your notes. He has little glands on here that he marks his territory with. He can't hang by this tail but it weighs less than -- 
>> all right. 
>> We call him larry the lemur. 
>> Jack hanna's number one top five close encounters.

>> What he's doing, he's feeling -- he feels your body temperature. That's -- 

[00:57:02]


>> is he feeling that I'm hot? 
>> That's exactly right. 
>> He feels your warm blood. 
>> He picks up the particles -- 
>> what's the tongue doing? 
>> Feeling the warm particles coming off that tongue. These animals, the bite is usually lethal. Not venomous but the bacteria in their mouth. The bacteria in these animals is deadly. This one lives in water. They have little teeth up in there -- I don't know why he's picking up on you and not me. You must be hotter than me. That's one of the biggest lizards in the world. 
>> Remarkable creature. Oh, my god. What's this? Whoa. 
>> You remember we talked about the anaconda? 
>> You saw the one that almost bit me -- 
>> you've got an anaconda wrapped around your neck. Are you mad? 
>> This snake here, if it were to bite you -- remember this in case it happens to you -- it bites you like this, it cannot let go. It takes him 30 minutes to relax his jaw muscle. If you're hiking somewhere and a constrictor bites you, you sit there -- 
>> not now, jack. 
>> He's not going to do anything right now. 
>> What is he doing right now? 
>> He's smelling you. 
>> For the kill or what? 
>> No. What he does, remember this, this snake gets to be about 25 to 30 feet long. 
>> The anaconda constricts like the -- 
>> yes. 
>> Why is it around his neck? 
>> This thing knows he can't kill this guy. 
>> It knows it can't kill him. 
>> Yeah, this animal knows -- he doesn't know he's a human. He's an animal he's too big to eat. 

[00:59:02]


>> How much does this come down to trust? 
>> Trust? You don't trust -- as far as trust, this guy here has to know what his animals are. 
>> Can you ever trust his wild animals? In the end, they will do what comes naturally.

>> Announcer: When you turn on your cooktop, do you really know what the temperature is? No-- you're just guessing. Are you too busy to watch what you're cooking? Tired of all that burnt food going to waste? Worried about your kids getting burned or a loved one starting a fire in the kitchen? Well, those problems are a thing of the past. Introducing the revolutionary precision induction cooktop from nuwave, the leader in portable induction cooking technology. The nuwave heats up twice as fast, uses up to 70% less energy and is safer than any cooktop. Best of all, the nuwave is the only portable cooktop that gives you precise temperature control with the simple press of a button. Professional chefs create great-tasting meals by maintaining the precise temperature for the perfect amount of time. Well, now you can get professional results too, with the nuwave precision induction cooktop. 
>> The key to great food is knowing how to control the temperatures of what you're cooking. 
>> Now the p.I.C. Is allowing people at home to cook like you can in a restaurant. 
>> I know that when I turn it on that temperature, it's going to be that temperature. There's no guessing. 
>> Announcer: Not only does the nuwave give you precise temperature control, it heats up twice as fast as an electric cooktop. 
>> I put the water in the pan and turned around and the next thing I knew, it was boiling. 
>> What amazes me about p.I.C. Is how quickly it will heat up. Induction technology is just unbelievable. 
>> Announcer: And because there's no flame to catch fire, no hot coils to burn you, the nuwave precision induction cooktop is the safest cooktop ever invented. Look what happens with this egg: The pan is hot, but the cooktop is not. That's the magic of induction cooking. Make pasta in half the time. Melt butter with no chance of it burning. Melt chocolate to creamy perfection. Make sauces with perfect temperature control. 
>> It's small, it's efficient, it's clean and it's safe. 
>> Announcer: And because it's portable, you can take it anywhere, so it's perfect for buffets and outdoor parties. To tell you more, let's join bob warden and jenny repko at the nuwave test kitchen in chicago. 

[00:02:03]


>> Let me ask you, do you hate boil-overs and the mess they make in the kitchen? Do you hate burnt grilled cheese sandwiches or shriveled-up bacon? 
>> What about over-fried chicken that's all greasy, or dried-out oatmeal, overdone pork chops or charred steak? 
>> Well, what if I was to tell you that instead, you could now have perfect grilled cheese sandwiches, perfectly browned evenly every single time? 
>> All that cheese is melted in there, so delicious. 
>> Perfectly melted. And I could have perfectly grilled steaks set at 350 degrees that give me a perfect medium rare steak or however you like it and it's never going to burn. Perfect pork chops, and not only pork chops... 
>> Right, salmon, grilled vegetables, sausage, perfect every time. 
>> What if I told you, when you fried your chicken, it was going to be fried at the perfect temperature of 375, gently, perfectly, crispy, never soaking up too much oil. 
>> That's hard to do. 
>> In fact, that's the problem with the old stovetops, whether it's gas or electric-- you can turn it up and down, but because you don't have precise control, you're going to get boil-overs. Because you don't have precise control, you're going to burn the cereal on the bottom from time to time. And because you don't have precise temperature control, you can't help but burn a steak or a pork chop on your stove. You see, you're not the bad cook in the kitchen. The stovetop is the bad cook in the kitchen. 
>> That's right, and those days of bad cooking are over, thanks to the fine folks here at nuwave, makers of the number-one-selling countertop oven in the world. 
>> Well, they've done it again. You're looking at the new wave in stovetop cooking. Now, this ingenious invention will make your life a whole lot easier in the kitchen and a whole lot shorter and a lot more fun. We're going to show you how and why every meal-- breakfast, snacks, lunch, dinner, grilled steaks, fondues and buffets-- will be made perfectly every time. Because now, for the first time, you can precisely control the cooking temperature. 
>> Announcer: Now you can live well for less with the nuwave precision induction cooktop. It's the most energy-efficient way to cook. The nuwave p.I.C. Uses induction technology. The secret is an internal series of copper coils. These coils generate a magnetic field within your metal pots and pans. The magnetic field causes invisible molecules to begin vibrating rapidly, creating heat, so the cookware itself heats the food. 

[00:04:26]


>> One of my passions are butter sauces. And one of the challenges of cooking a butter sauce is that if you get it too hot, you know, over 135 degrees, it breaks down. If you get it too cool, it congeals. The beauty of the nuwave p.I.C. Is that I can control the temperature exactly and keep the sauce for an extended period of time. That's such an added bonus for a professional cook and a home cook. 
>> Let me show you this unusual pan. Bob, what did we do here? 
>> Well, we actually cut a pan and cut a section out, because in here you can see we have cereal rapidly boiling, right? >> Boiling away. 
>> I can put my hand right there. 
>> It's amazing. Move your hand. I'm going to put an ice cube right there. It's not melting. 
>> Because all of the energy is going into cooking your food. There's nothing wasted anywhere outside of the pan, so this is perfectly cool. So wipe that ice cube off there. 
>> O.K., I've got a cloth right here. Watch this, I'll take this ice cube, wipe it up. I'm using a paper towel on a burner. There's no fire, there's no flame, so it's so safe. 
>> And the minute you put the pan back on it starts boiling right again. >> Wow. 
>> Now, because we're cooking without fire, jenny, I'm going to take a sheet of play money and put it between the p.I.C. And the pan. Instantly it starts boiling again. 
>> Have you ever seen anything like that? Cooking through paper? 
>> So now we're cooking far more efficiently, we're saving 40- to 50% of the energy. >> Right. 
>> Isn't that amazing? 
>> Announcer: Seeing is believing. Look what happened when the nuwave p.I.C. Was put to the test on the streets of san francisco. 
>> All right, this is gonna blow your mind. This is the precision induction cooktop, and it is portable, eco-friendly and it saves you a lot of money, saves you a lot of time. >> Wow. 
>> Cooking time is cut in half. You see that the water's boiling now? >> Yeah. 
>> The great thing about induction cooking is it only heats the part of the pot that is magnetic, so everything else stays cool, so watch this. Ah! 
[Group exclaims] okay, everybody, put your hands on it. >> Isn't it hot? 
>> No, it just heats the magnetic part of the pot. This is at 110. You can leave it at 110 and it won't get gloppy, it won't get stale, it won't harden. 

[00:06:33]


>> And you don't have to be a big chef to cook. Like, I don't have time to cook. This would be great. 
>> Exactly-- this makes you look like an actual good chef. It's temperature-controlled, so I pop my fried chicken right in there and I know exactly what temperature it's at, and you know if you go down one, 10 degrees, boom, drops just like that. Can you do that on a gas range? 
>> Absolutely not. >> No. 
>> Not at all. >> This is temperature-controlled so you don't overcook it, you don't undercook it. 
>> I love the temperature control-- that can cook meat without drying it out. 
>> Man: Mmm! >> That's amazing! 
>> What do you think? 
>> Nice and crispy. 
>> You can fry, you can simmer, you can steam, you can fondue, you can do everything with this-- I love it. 
>> It's amazing-- I've never seen anything like it. 
>> I love that if you take the top... The pot off of the top, it stops and that the handles were cool. That's really amazing. 
>> And you know what the great thing is, you guys? It's portable. You can take this whole thing over to the table, plop it down and it will stay at 110 right in the middle of your guests and you can dip all day. Dip, dip, dip, everybody dip. And the best part about it? You can grill on the table. 
>> Man: Oh... 
>> What do you think about that? 
>> Mmm... 
>> So it's raining outside, it's the middle of winter, you still get grilled food. Will it change the way you cook 
AT HOME? >> Group: Yes. 
>> The p.I.C. Makes everything so simple. >> It looks like you ordered it from a restaurant. 
>> It does look like I ordered it from a restaurant. That's because I'm a good cook now with the p.I.C. [Laughter] 
>> Announcer: Introducing the revolutionary precision induction cooktop from nuwave, the leader in portable induction cooking technology.

[??????...] 
>> one of my most popular dessert dishes is called the chocolate three ways. It's made with a triple chocolate brownie, done with a chocolate espresso sauce that I do, and also white chocolate gelato with a little bit of rock salt and olive oil, and the p.I.C. Induction burner, I can keep it warm and adjust it in 10-degree increments and spoon the sauce right on-- it's perfect temperature all night long... Opposed to my double boiler that I had before, risking to get water in the chocolate-- would actually make it separate. So I love the p.I.C. When it comes down to keeping things warm, and that chocolate sauce can get out fast and I can move that dish out of the kitchen quick. Now the p.I.C. Is allowing people at home to cook like you can in a restaurant. 
>> Well, so far we've been showing you what you can do when you can precisely control low temperatures, like for perfectly melting chocolate or for simmering cereal. 
>> But, everybody loves a great steak and everyone hates it when their steak does not come out just the way they like it. But with the nuwave p.I.C., because it comes with precision temperature control, you won't ever undercook or overcook that steak. 
>> For grilling, use this great cast iron barbecue grill pan that can come with your p.I.C. Now, if you like your steak rare, check this out. It's going to be red and juicy on the inside, but perfectly brown on the outside. If you like it well done, it's not going to be burned on the outside, but it's going to be perfectly well done on the inside. How? Because the p.I.C. Gives you perfect temperature control. Look at this, first I seared it to 575, now I've reduced the p.I.C. To 375 and check out this laser thermometer-- exactly 375 degrees. 

[00:13:32]


>> Check out how 375 degrees gives us those great grill marks without burning or charring. 
>> And you know what I like with my steak? >> I know. 
>> A perfectly baked potato, which I can do right here in my nuwave oven in minutes. 
>> Or if you like my favorite thing, sweet potato fries. Whatever you make in the nuwave, it comes out perfect every time. [Chuckles] 
>> Announcer: According to the u.S. Department of energy, 50 cents of every dollar you spend heating up your gas or electric stove is wasted. But not so with your nuwave p.I.C., Because it uses induction technology. This infrared camera shows how a traditional cooktop heats the area all around the pot. But look how the nuwave p.I.C. Heats up only the pot. This means no more wasted energy. 
>> I love that I'm saving energy, that I'm only heating up the bottom surface of the pot where I need the heat to be, and I really think we're seeing a difference in our electric bills and I love that. 
>> I feel really good when I'm using the p.I.C. 'Cause I'm using less energy to cook whatever it is I'm cooking, and I feel like in my little way I'm doing something for the planet. 
>> One of the best things about the nuwave precision induction cooktop is it's portable. I can take it anywhere, I don't have to leave it in the kitchen. So I'll take it into my dining room and I'll set up my own egg station, so when I have visitors-- especially my family-- I can cook my own omelets, they can cook their own omelets, they can cook their eggs, they can cook pancakes and it's just this simple because I've got precise temperature control. And look how beautifull?? non-stick this is. All I have to do to make the omelet is tip it, the omelet runs back. I tip it again, it runs back. I'm going to be able to fill this up. So everybody can have whatever filling they like. I always like to have some mushrooms, some cheese, some peppers... >> And you know I like the healthy spinach, bob. 
>> Ohh... >> I just ruined his omelet. >> [Laughs] well, with the perfect green fry pan, we just simply fold that over, it's going to continue to cook while it's in the pan. I fold that out and look at 
this: My pan is clean, I'm ready to cook another omelet again. 

[00:15:35]


>> The heating is consistent, so I can set up a buffet with four or five of these and have different temperatures that are going to maintain. I think one of the biggest complaints is that sometimes the last people that go through the buffet, they get the cold food, and with the p.I.C., the food stays warm through the entire event and the guests really appreciate that, as does the host and hostess. 
>> My husband loves the nuwave p.I.C. Because he can grill indoors instead of having to go outside. He can actually join us as a family and we can all be together and cook. 
>> Announcer: Introducing the revolutionary precision induction cooktop from nuwave, the leader in portable induction cooking technology. The nuwave heats up twice as fast, uses up to 70% less energy and is safer than any cooktop. Best of all, the nuwave is the only portable cooktop that gives you precise temperature control with the simple press of a button. 
>> I love the temperature control. >> As you press the buttons, you can see exactly what the temperature is-- you can watch the water boil change. 
>> Mm-hmm. >> That's incredible. 
>> Anything you boil water for... [Snaps fingers] it's that quick. 
>> Announcer: Make pasta in half the time. Melt butter with no chance of it burning. Melt chocolate to creamy perfection. Make sauces with perfect temperature control. Gas and electric stoves have hot coils and open flames which can burn you. The nuwave p.I.C. Transfers heat only to your cookware, so it's 100% safe. Look what happens with this 
egg: The pan is hot, but the cooktop is not. That's the magic o induction cooking. 
>> Group: Wow! 
>> Woman: It's not even hot. 
>> Will it change the way you

It's your portable indoor grill, temperature-controlled deep fryer, festive fondue maker, timed rice cooker, healthy vegetable steamer, programmable slow cooker. 
>> If I had this, I would fry all day, every day. [Laughter] 
>> so I can steam my vegetables on top, I've got my couscous, my rice, my pasta underneath, everything is done, you come home from a hard day at work, 10 minutes, you got food for the whole family.

[00:20:12]


[??????...] 
>> Announcer: The nuwave precision induction cooktop is the most convenient and efficient way to cook. You get the convenience of traditional stovetop settings plus the flexibility to control the temperature in 10-degree increments. Sear a steak to perfection or melt chocolate or butter without a double boiler. You can do it all with the nuwave p.I.C. The smart sensors inside ensure you'll create delicious meals every time by maintaining the constant correct temperature. It's like having a professional chef cooking for you. 
The result: No more mistakes, no more burning. 
>> It takes the human error out of cooking. There's no more guesswork in what temperature you're cooking at. It's very easy to just set the temperature at the touch of your fingertips. You can go up 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees. In a matter of seconds, you're at that temperature. It's going to be perfect every time. 
>> Now we'd like to talk about the perfect temperature to fry chicken. Now, up to now we've been talking about what you can do when you have precise temperature control on low temperatures, like with chocolate, right? Look at that, jenny. That's been in there for hours, it's still not sticking, it's still the perfect, perfect creamy texture. 
>> Did you taste it? 
>> I know, it's almost unbelievable, isn't it? 
>> Delicious. Oh, and then we went to high-temperature searing. So with the push of a button, we got this to 575 degrees, seared the steaks, then we brought it down to 350 and we have beautiful grilled sausages, pork chops, salmon, even those grilled vegetables-- they were good too. 
>> Well, frying temperature is 375 degrees, especially when you're using vegetable oil. We want to hold that perfect temperature, so lookit here. We have a probe in here, we set this to 375 degrees. It says 375 degrees. Our chicken is fryg gently, it's not going to burn. 
>> Here on my burner-- it's a typical electric coil under here... 
>> I can see jenny's been cooking over here. 
>> This is what happens. It's not safe. And not only is it not safe, I have no idea what the temperature is-- I'm just guessing. 

[00:22:17]


>> When you get that really good fried chicken at one of those fast food chicken places, it's because they have a very expensive deep fryer, they've set it at 375 degrees, they can use that oil all day long without it burning. Well, now you have that precise control at home with the precision induction cooker. Let me give you an example. In the test kitchen, we cooked over 200 pieces of chicken, and this is what the oil looked like. >> It looks like it just came out of the bottle. 
>> And this is breaded chicken, right? Here we cooked just 20 pieces of chicken on a gas stove, same results would have been on an electric stove-- you'd guess. You set it someplace between medium and medium-high, you don't know. The minute it smokes, it's gone, it's ruined. That's typically what happens. You have to throw the oil away. 
>> Yeah. Well, that gets expensive. 
>> Announcer: Third-party analysis shows the advantage ofave's precise temperature control versus conventional stove tops. Oil cooked with an electric stove contained 45% more saturated fat. Oil cooked with a gas stove contained 10 times more transfatty acids. Oil cooked with an electric stove contained over 90% more cholesterol than oil cooked with the precision induction cooktop. Now some of your favorite foods can be healthier with the nuwave precision induction cooktop. 
>> When you're cooking with frying foods, you're, um, you're trying to keep that temperature high so the grease doesn't get in the food, where you're not ending up with greasy chicken or greasy fish. And with the precision induction cooktop, I was able to master frying that chicken perfectly. 
>> Announcer: The nuwave p.I.C. Has been tested and recommended by the cooking club of ameri and is the safest cooktop ever invented. Did you know that every 85 seconds, a fire strikes a home in america? And most often, that fire starts in the kitchen. 
>> My very, very first fire was a 16-year-old kid who was cooking french fries on the stove and he forgot about them and he burned his parents' entire house down. 
>> Announcer: Well, that will never happen with the nuwave p.I.C. There is no open flame, no red-hot electric coil to catch fire and as soon as a pot is removed frothe nuwave, the conduction of heat stops. 

[00:24:19]


>> The safety features of the p.I.C. Impressed me so much that I'm going to send one to my mother. She's getting a bit elderly and forgetful and I'm always a bit worried that she might start a fire and the p.I.C.'S going to eliminate that problem. It's a great thing for the elderly to have and it's going to be a nice present. 
>> During our show, we've showed you what a difference the nuwave precision induction cooktop can make in your cooking. Whether you're cooking breakfast or snacks. 
>> Lunch, dinner, hors d'oeuvres. 
>> Whether you're grilling or griddling, when you have precise temperature control, it can make all the difference. 
>> Whether you're searing at high temperatures... 
>> Or whether you're having precise temperature control at only 110 or 20 degrees for perfect chocolate, you have got it. In 10 degrees intervals you can go from 120 to 130 to 140, all the way up to 575 degrees, which you can never get with your stovetop-- you're always just guessing. So to sum it up, what do you get with the nuwave precision cooktop? You get, first of all, speed-- it heats up really fast. 
>> And safety. There's no red-hot coil or open flame. 
>> And you get precise temperature control that you can never get with your old electric burner or gas stove. 
AND YOU SAVE... >> Both: Money.

I am lying about the video just like the obama administration did. And finally is it people magazine always picks a white guy for the sexiest man of the year? Some say no. I don't like the new studio. 
>> You don't like the new studio? 
>> No. I want to go back to the old be permanent at least from now on. 
>> I like everything. Everything is backwards and confusing. You should go back to the other one. Whatever, don't like the studio. 
>> The studio doesn't like you. Let's welcome our guests. She's so hot she is mistaken for a welding iron. I am here with brooke goldstein the children's rights institute and director of the law fare object. Good for you. And he is so is considered a snowball, it is bill schulz. And if hilarity was a speed limit I would violate him on a highway. Sitting next to me, gavin McBEGIN TEE. He is writing for talking mag.Com. 
>> A block. The lede. That's the first story. 
>> I guess I didn't get done with the intros fast enough. If you voted for the one, your shopping days are done. He took out a full page ad telling obamatay away from his shop. Cope reynolds, if that is his real name placed the ad in the white mountain indep it reads, "if you voted for barack obama your business is not welcome at shout west shooting authority. You have broofn -- proven you are not responsible enough to own a firearm. Reynolds tells the phoenix times that this is more of a political statement more than anything else saying, quote, of course it is impossible to enforce. If they don't say anything you will never know. But he maintains if they own up to it, we will not serve them. This goes way beyond gun control which many think is why we did this. Meanwhile, the door remains open to all at the red panda house. 

[00:02:44]


>> They should have kept the door shut. Why shouldn't a business owner tell customers they are not welcome if they are voting for a guy whose policies are agait his best interest? 
>> I am I supposed to disagree with this? I am glad he is doing that. There is an assumption that obama was a great union president who will bring us altogether. He is not like those other decisive politicians. We don't like you. We shouldn't have to be your friend. Screw these idiots who voted for this guy. 
>> You are bitter, aren't you? 
>> My melt down is only simmering now. 
>> At least we don't have to be your friend anymore, you fool. 
>> We had your dad on and i was worried about you. 
>> I think he presented some of that to me and I couldn't help. 
>> You said in the green room this guy is your new hero. 
>> Absolutely. This is such an inspiring pro democracy message. I am going to punish you for exercising your right to vote by trying to impede your second amendment ability to bear arms. He put up a sign saying no hispanics. 
>> It is private property. He doesn't want people there. 
>> He doesn't want ethnic people there. 
>> You are making the assumption he is talking about race when he is talking about belief. I think it is okay to seg great you gate on belief -- to segregate on belief. But it is wrong everything else. 
>> And look at the stuff. Look who voted for obama, people who just don't care about their second amendment right. It is totally use -- useless. 
>> You were being sarcastic in the green room. By the way, is this legal? 
>> Yes. 
>> He is discriminating against belief. Have I never heard that before. 
>> The left does this all the time. The same people who are wailing and nashing their teeth about this are the same people who were boycotting chill fill a because they have -- chill fill a who were 

[00:04:44]


-- because they had positions they don't like. Do I think this is smart business? No. Is it within his right to do so? Heck ya. I remember pen jaw let was on the show. And pen jaw let said I will never have you over to my house for dinner because you believe in god. That is really no different. Right? They are just believing in a different god. 
>> Is there anything wrong with that? 
>> I don't think so. I think it is bad business. At least this is more honest than working at a restaurant and spiting in somebody's food. Right now he is saying don't come into my restaurant. 
>> That's true. And thank god the spiting on the food thing is hard to prove. 
>> You didn't even work at the restaurant you were spiting food. 
>> No, I just wait. They walk by and then it was like the third gunman just spiting at food as he went by. People allowed to boycott or man cot as I prefer the term. And people are allowed to say they don't want to get -- people are allowed to be d-bags. He doesn't have to give it that. There are 730 people in the town that did vote for obama. It sounds like not that big of a town. He is shooting himself in the foot as far as bad business is concerned. But he can do it. 
>> Nicely done the way he worked the little gun thing in there. 
>> I think you are taking politics too seriously when you do something like this. You disagree. I disagree with you, and i can't remember your name because you are three different people. Gavin, I was going to call uh mixture of your dad and your other brother, simon? Miles. 
>> That's the problem with the multiple personalities. 
>> I think it is like now you are taking something too seriously. I guess it feels good, but it is better to discriminate on ideas. 
>> Didn't you love that libertarian guy who said I am never speaking to a democrat ever again? 
>> I thought it was funny. 
>> He was an idiot. 

[00:06:48]


>> By the way -- 
>> and that's an attention whore. Look at me look at me. The interview was like, who he save somebody who was drowning that was a democrat? Talk about a d-bag. 
>> But the answers were funny. I think he was being funny. 
>> But I think it was a way of saying here is a taste of your own medicine. 
>> It is also a great assumption that people would want to hang around with him. I don't think they were lining up. 
>> I want to move on, but that's actually the biggest point here. These people are just giving a dose of the intolerant message you get from the left. 
>> The left's assumption was after they elect the messiah we will all come together in worship of him. A lot of companies have said if you elect him, it is not that we have beef. We can't afford to pay for this. We can't afford to pay for his medicare. We will have to lay people off. They get these boycotts. Not only do you have to vote for him, but if you don't vote for him, even after the election, if you go bankrupt you are a racist. 
>> All right, whatever. From guns to arrows. He went on for awhile there. I zoned out. I was thinking about chicken and tear -- teriaki. Does your perfect fit have to love mitt? They are matching singles paced on parton ship. It allows social issues to foreign policy and then shop for significant others accordingly. Sayu the 27-year-old founder, quote, while it is not a make or break issue at the beginning, it can evolve into one if you hide your political values into later on in the relationship. The status quo is to avoid politics on the first date, but politics will come up and politics defines a lot about our values. Neither side is my type. I go for this. 

[00:08:56]


>> Just imagine that on your back. It is fan it is a snik. On -- it is fantastic. Or on your front. Chris, you only date -- if you onto dated gay republicans you would not be dating, period. 
>> I think this was dumb. Honestly there was not a lot of lines I would cross. 
>> This is politics. It is over politicization. It has permeated all of our culture. You can't even go on a date unless you have pre screened people in advance to make sure that they voted for all of the same candidates you did. 
>> It is like you have to say that before you have herpes. That's how dangerous. 
>> You do have to say that? 
>> And you don't say that, is that bad? 
>> I am still looking into the legal ramifications of that. One in five people, and there are five people here have herpes. 
>> It is time to go to commercial. 
>> I thought it was a given if we were over 30 we have it. 
>> One it is 20% and for two it is -- two it is 20% and one it is 60%. 
>> So you are saying you have it and I have it. 
>> I think we all have it except brooke. 
>> I have had few sexual partners. Do you only have relationships with white wingers? 
>> Absolutely. I mean, I stopped dating liberals when I realized I was fighting over the muslim brotherhood infiltration of the white house is not as erotic as I thought it would be. It is a great idea to further divide this country under the guys of -- guise of bringing people together. We heard of this before. It is out of the obama campaign book. This is brilliant. 
>> You are brilliant. 
>> I think the obama campaign gave decisiveness a bad name. 
>> I don't want them buying my guns. 

[00:10:58]


>> You have a gun store. 
>> It is right here, buddy. There is your gun store. 
>> You find your girlfriends on drug state.Com. 
>> I think is ridiculous. My last girlfriend was republican and it always made for good conversations around the dinner table. But we also did not break up because we had differences. She broke up with me because she said I look like a monkey and she doesn't like monkeys, but it had nothing to do with politics.O through? I don't have a real opinion on this. What I did was I went out of the culture and married a russian who thinks all politics are stupid because all they want to do is achieve. They spent their whole lives under somebody's thumb. 
>> It shows how affluent we are if we can start nit-picking like this and say I only want this particular view. In my heyday you had to take them to shore. 
>> By the way, can you imagine the losers who are going to use this site? 
>> Brooke is raising her hand. 
>> No you would not. 
>> I would, I swear. 
>> By the way, just like a million people just signed up for this. 
>> Yes, just for you. 
>> You are not getting people who look like her by the way. 
>> From dating sites to nudist rights. Should their buns never see the sun? On tuesday the lawmakers are voting on whether to ban public nudity, the culmination between stitch less strutters and a public official. Under scott wiener's proposal, I know, I know, bear be heinz would be fined -- behinds would be fined with a third offense with possible jail time. Said one crusader, I don't think guys hanging out with their clothes off is what san francisco is about. Speak for yourself, mr. Puritan pants. They say the ordinance goes too far in under mining a tradition. It keeps san francisco weird. So I bet are you wondering what does sleepy cat think of all of this. 

[00:13:14]


>> Must have been watching cnn. I got you. 
>> In your cnn face. 
>> Who ever you are. 
>> A bunch of people filed lawsuits arguing the ban infringes on your free speech rights. Is exposing your general tills -- genitals an explanation of free speech? 
>> It is, however this is not a new case. And it is very well established that a government can restrict free speech, especially obscenity and especially when there is a government interest to do so. And there is not only a substantial government interest, but a health interest in putting cloth between you and public seating so they don't have a chance. 
>> I don't want what is between your cheeks on my cheeks. If I go to court there will be a well hung jury. You know about the whole thing. Is san francisco like the town in "the breakfast club" the band dancing. 
>> I don't think it is anything like that. I mean, look, as a libertarian, I am one of those people who is like you are free to do what you want to do as long as it doesn't infringe on somebody else's right. I'm pretty sure this is crossing the line of somebody else's right. If you want to be naked and run around your apartment, that's fine. You feel compelled to do it in front of other people, probably not a right. 
>> I like how you jeptly do that. 
>> You are often very nude. And you are against the wishes of people. I have seen you nude. 
>> With eyeballs. 
>> This is the question. Are practioiners talking about -- practitioners talking about a lifestyle that makes you feel good exposing yourself which is like a guy in a subway exposing himself does. You are a pervert. It is not a lifestyle. 
>> The funny thing about living in america and being pro liberty is every time you come up with a parameter they blow your mind. I think nity should be allowed. I have no problem with the human body. I am nude at home all the time. My wife is trying to curb that. I don't know. We went to the hospital store and we said you are not allowed to have chunk food in the lobby of hospitals. You said that is ridiculous. And then you see how many obese people they have to deal with and you say maybe you have to push a little too far. Have I been to san francisco during gay pride. I said look, it is the body god gave them. Enjoy yourself. And then you are walking out and see and you say, oh my god. Wow. Maybe no. That's a bit rich. 

[00:16:07]


>> Don't do that. 
>> But you were actually walking by bill's party. 
>> I had to convince my son that pirates usually wear two eye patches. 
>> Bill, last word. 
>> I mean, I'm certainly of the mind that if you are not hurting anybody, go ahead and do it. But this is -- you are hurting our eyes. They are traumatizing half the population. Unless you get some sort of skin disease where cloth against skin is physically painful to you. I am talking to you psoriasis holders. It is disgusting and you are getting off and offending our eyes. 
>> And there are no hot nudists. 
>> You know what that is? That's the proof of capitalism. An attractive person's innate knowledge that they have something that is worth while that should be paid for, and they will not show it off. Whereas a homely person doesn't have that feeling and therefore shows the body off, and it is always a homely hideous person. 
>> The guy is wondering around in the locker room with no towel on is always the fat, ugly guy. It is never the hot, ripped guy. I have been waiting for that. 
>> As a gay man if you just landed here not as a gay man and went, oh may general tale yaw -- eon, male jenna -- general tale yaw, female general tale yaw, that's weird, that looks good. 
>> I am as straight as they come, and even I know the penis is beautiful. 
>> How did we get to this horrible place? I have to move on. Stop. Stop with the genital talk. Will smith is gay -- ning weight as a fat person. And he went from filling or physicians t-- orfices to offices. Should he retire because of 

[00:21:24]


>>> did the stach reveal his past? The district attorney has come clean about staring in porn. IN THE 1970s, A WEEK AFTER Being re-elected to office on friday, mark subin, if that is his real name, actually it is, fessed up to his on camera for gnaw indicating in a press conference. 
>> Recently materials have been circulated alleging I was involved in the adult film industry about 40 years ago in new york. Those allegations are true. I was an actor in adult films for a short period in the EARLY MEAN 70s. IN THE EARLY 1970s. A few weeks ago when asked i denied this to members of the press. I regret that. I apologize for it. 
>> Rumors were started by an anonymous tipster who failed to get a by the from gus THOMAS FROM THE 1970s. He was in deep throat part two. Here is a clip of him in my favorite "bedroom bedlam." 
>> Is that was a basset and or ron jeremy. Here is the real movie. 
>> I love girls. I love big girls, little girls , fat girls, skinny girls, i love them all. And they all love me. 
>> There is nothing sexier than a man talking about sex while he is eating. THE 70s PEOPLE MUST HAVE Been blind. IF YOU LOOK AT THE 70s Pornography, not an attractive person in the bunch except marilyn chambers and look what happened to her, brooke. She died. Anyway don't answer that. To you, chris because you have a mustache that is porno-like, but that was for a cause. If he shaved his mustache he never would have been caught. They caught him by the mustache. 

[00:23:36]


>> I think that 1 stachist. You are clearly making assumptions on him based so what was a perfectly fine looking upstanding muss stash. 
>> That's a terrible mustache. 
>> I would like to come clean IN THE 70s I WAS IN A SERIES Of movies also. 
>> You were not even born in THE 70s. 
>> I do believe you did porn. 
>> Your path is filled with s many horrible things that there is no way you will be able to run for public office. , But should this guy have come clean in the beginning or was it smart to lie and keep the job? 
>> Who cares? The most interesting thing about the story is we proved once again that pornography is the same as politics. It is hollywood for ugly people. 
>> They love attention. You know what is interesting about new york back then, everyone was on speed. So let's do some more digging. This guy has a lot of an feta means. 
>> -- Anphetamines. 
>> Sounds like a fungi. Do you think -- sounds like a fun guy. 
>> I just don't understand how someone thinks they can get away with lying about being a porn star. Being a porn star means that people take pictures of you naked, and they take videos of you naked. There is evidence. It will be unearthed. 
>> What is that word? Extrinsic? I like it when you use new words. 
>> It was sexy. 
>> It was sexy. 
>> Bill, you did he maphrodidic porn and we still hired you. 
>> Not a big niche. The guy in the press conference was not only wearing a turtle neck, he was wearing a turtle neck with a tweed jacket. 

[00:25:39]


>> He wanted to be discovered. 
>> Is that was the point. He was waiting for somebody to say your guy -- you are guy stevens. He could have gone way far away from that persona. I have to say, back then -- that guy was a -- that's the thing -- 
>> the reason he was made to look like old porn it is so you can see his pea nuss. Look at -- 
>> I think we are throwing around the phrase porn starlightly. I am not sure this guy was a porn star. 
>> We kicked this show into the groin three times. Do you have a comment on the show? E-mail us. And do you have a video of your animal doing something? It is something clean and wholesome. Go to fox news.Com/red eye and click on submit a video. We might use it. Still to come, the half time report from tv's andy levy. He did some adult stuff. 
>> Tonight's half time report is brought to you by break dancing. The dancing that involves spinning on the ground. Thanks, break dancing. 

[00:30:24]


>>> Let's see if we got anything wrong so far. 
>> Don't like the new stat man. 
>> It has taken us some getting used to. The fans are going to love it. 
>> I enjoy the fact that bill is not looking into a camera when the camera -- when he is talking. >>- q. I if you notice, andy, -- 
>> if you notice, we are in reverse order. That is reverse bill. 
>> It is like bizarro "red eye." 
>> Exactly. Gavin, you said were you in favor of this and screw those who voted for obama. Just to make sure, you would be fine if a democratic business leader told republicans to stay out of the store? 
>> That's your right as a store owner. 
>> You can even have a religious -- you can say no christians in here. That's the deal. People should make up any moves they want. 
>> Legally I don't think you can do the christian thing. 
>> That's a stupid law. If it is your private property like your home you can come up with any rules you want. 
>> Expru a catholic? 
>> I am indeed. 
>> No lutherans. 
>> I like that singer and I am sad he is gone. 
>> Force him out. Brooke I don't think it is fair to make this about race. The guy said it is not about race. 
>> I was just joking. I think it is fair to joke about it. I retract my statement. 
>> That's the affect of the ban. 
>> I don't know. I didn't look at the racial and ethnic break down of the obama voters in arizona. 
>> I did. And she is right. 
>> I don't think you did, bill. 
>> Pretty sure it did. 
>> You did say it sounds like a small town. I believe it is 4200 with 736 obama voters. 
>> Not enough to carry the place. But significant amount of a small town. And you notice I am looking at the camera. 
>> Very weird. 
>> The readers are thankful for that. The viewers. 
>> All of the rders are thankful. 
>> I have been out of magazine for six years, longer actually. 

[00:32:26]


>> The left does this all the time. You brought up the boycott of chick-fil-a and papa john. They say it is okay to boycott a business, but not a business owner to boycott customers. 
>> I think liberals think it is okay to have boycotts when they say it is okay to have boycotts. 
>> That's more accurate. 
>> And they love to go after advertisers and not just the consumer. 
>> I checked out cope reynolds, great name, the gun shop owner. He is at desert scope 1. 
>> Nice. 
>> Here are a few of his tweets. United states dissolving, precursor for civil war. Look in here with a link to his radio show. When peaceful revolution is impossible, don't miss the shooting bench today. If you live in arizona please consider signing this petition. We are over 30% there. 
>> There you go. 
>> Trouble in paradise, it is, woulded up to a frenzy. 
>> Good stuff. 
>> Lastly, the phoenix time did an on-line poll asking readers what one word described what reynolds is doing. Three and a half percent said funny and 9 and a half percent said sad. 6% said smart and 50% said arizona esque. I thought that was funny. 
>> Was that a joke? 
>> No, that is true. I did not make that up. Those are the choices the readers were given. 
>> Okay. 
>> Websites for red state and blue state. I am with you. I think this is silly with caveats which I believe are old-fashioned ties? 
>> Yes, they are. These sites by the way are useless for libertarians. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> They are part of the conspiracy anyway so we would never sign up for it if there was one. 
>> All they want is your information to track you. 
>> Then you could pretend. That's the great thing. If you were like a horny person you would like -- people use match.Com and pretend they are trying to get a relationshi when they are just trying to have sex with lonely people. 

[00:34:35]


>> What does that have to do with libertarians? 
>> They can pretend to be right or left any moment. 
>> I would do that. A, republicans could be good at the -- in the sack, and b, I am a sexatarian. 
>> I don't understand why you need to be on the same political spot in the political spectrum than your lover. My wife and I don't agree on anything at all. 
>> I require my dates to agree with absolutely everything i say. 
>> I believe that. 
>> What's the problem with that? 
>> They will and then secretly not. 
>> Brooke, once you get married all of those like -- the support for your beliefs will disappear. 
>> Put on 100 pounds and he will disart disagrees -- start disagreeing with you. 
>> He will start breaking wind. 
>> You stopped dating liberals when you found out fighting over the muslim brotherhood infiltration was not ironic? 
>> No it was not erotic. 
>> Oh, okay. I still don't understand the first part, but that's already. San francisco avoiding a nudity ban. How about as far as businesses are concerned let the free market deal with it. If a business wants to allow nudity it should be able to. 23 it does -- doesn't want to uh nudity it shouldn't be able to. 
>> We are talking about people being nude. 
>> Around your shoulder. 
>> That's why I didn't say wallet. 
>> We are talking about people being nude in public. 
>> San francisco people -- 
>> it is a separate issue. I agree. But I was asking as far as businesses are concerned. 
>> Is this one of these libertarian questions. Questions? 
>> I am for a business owner saying you can be nude I will regret saying this. 
>> And then what will happen is it will be an all nude restaurant. They have to split the resort in half. 

[00:36:38]


>> That's what I'm saying. Let customers decide. 
>> Smoking and nonsmoking. 
>> The funny thing is it would be smoking because all of the hot people would be clothed and not smoking would be the naked ugly people. 
>> That's a bigger problem we have to deal with here. 
>> The homely? The homely and naked? 
>> Yes. 
>> If there are any nudists watching this show, they will send their pictures in. 
>> That is the entire plan. That's why we are doing this. 
>> We keep making fun of these naked people being ugly. I have been nude in public. When you look like this, people jump on you and mall you. I have one guy who held on to me so tight I had to beat him of on . 
>> Terrible joke. 
>> That's how bad it is when you look normal. 
>> New york district attorney lied about his porn star past. 
>> I am fairly certain you slandered william henry harrison in this story. 
>> I would like to apologize to all of his family. He wasn't actually in porn. They didn't have porn back then, but it was etched on trees. 
>> Googling william henry harrison in porn which is what I did, interesting results. 
>> Wasn't he a bachelor? 
>> Con fecialed, I believe. Confirmed. I am actually not sure. 
>> Could have been both. 
>> We don't know, greg, we don't have books to tell us things like that. 
>> Gavin, you said who cares about the guy's porn star past which is how I feel too. But I feel the voters in the district should have been the judges of that and by lying he denied that ability. 
>> I guess so. I feel like americans are way too obsessed with the politicians' personal life. I don't want them to do kneeing. Just stand there. I want a cardboard cutout. The best politician is a japanese guy who only knows the word no. Put him in office. 

[00:38:42]


>> You said that last week. Your father did. 
>> It is my mantra ssments. 
>> Like they say, he was rude to someone. I don't care if he had an affair. If somebody was anti-gay marriage and hit on a guy in the airport bathroom, well i didn't try to marry him. That's none of my bees wax. 
>> You left your bees wax in the green room, by the way. 
>> Gavin, I basically gru with you, but I think he shouldn't have lied about it. His constituents should have had the information so if they don't agree with you or me in this case and it does matter they should have that information available. 
>> Yes. That's part of being a politician. You have to be an open book. I don't understand why personal lives are -- 
>> he was on imdb. His pictures and video were out there. He has the same muss stash. 
>> When you base your voting on if someone is cool or not you end up with a president like obama. How about policies for a change? 
>> I don't disagree. Lastly, your point, you don't see how people think they can get away with lying about being a porn star. They only need to get away with it until the election. 
>> Good point. 
>> Two for two. 
>> They both worked. 
>> Swoosh. 
>> I am done. 
>> Thank you, andy. Coming up, is there a better alternative to gas? Brooke goldstein on why her car runs on kittens. 
>> What? 
>> Terrible woman. But first, what is this? What is this controversy about? I don't know but it sounds controversial. 

[00:43:25]


>>> Is the issue on world's sexiest man controlled by the klan? "People" magazine saluted channing tatum. I have no idea who he is. It was about his sexy nest. There was something about the cover, his white skin. According to "the daily beast" that's a monster. She writes for a monster of the she notes that 25 of the last 26 sma winners have been as pale as they are pretty. The only exception was denzel washington in 1996. I have that poster above my bed. She said, quote, where are the blair underwoods and tay digs and the terrance howards and howards and the jesse williams and iris eldridge. Yes where is blair underwood? He has my chaps. "People" magazine is sensitive to represent people of color. Our sexiest man alive issue is no exception. Every section includes a diverse -- there is the word, a diverse group of men. Let's discuss in the -- 
>> lightning! Rooooouuuuuunnnnnddd. Lightning round. 
>> Brooke, one critic says that "people" is coping out. They can't come out and say that black men don't sell magazine covers because there is more white people percentage wise who buy gossip magazines, I guess. 
>> So the issue is they have chosen black men to be the sexiest men alive, but they don't put them on their cover. What that means is the african-american community is not stupid enough to want to read people magazine. That's it. I think it is a complement. 
>> Well played. 
>> Chris, could you make the case that gay men are also under represented on the list? There is no rupert everett or rupert everett or rupert everett or the delicious rupert everett, or the strikingly -- 
>> who is rupert everett? 

[00:45:26]


>> Who is rupert everett? You, sir, get off the table. I want everybody to tweet a picture of rupert everett to gavin right now. Chris, answer the question. 
>> No. I am so overall of this crap. If there is a word that i could like mute from the entire world vocabulary it is racism. We just got done. The country elected a black man as president for a second term. Now I am supposed to believe that the insipent racism in "people" magazine is something we should give a crap out. "The daily beast" is a piece of crap. megan McCain writes for "the daily beast." Enough said. 
>> They said he is hot at the moment, is he sexy, is his career on fire this year? By that logic. You should have won. 
>> Thank you very much, greg. I appreciate that. The assumption here is that black people read "people" magazine. They read -- I mean I am very close with some black women and they read "essence,"" heart and soul," "ebony" and" sister to sister." They don't read "people." "People" is choosing their readers' fave. I don't think they are too smart. I think the other magazines are just as schmlutzy to use an african-american word. 
>> I was a write other "heart and soul" and they took all of the articles that I wrote for another magazine like" women's health and prevention" and then they did something to it. That's what they did. The editors would go like, we need to change it. 
>> They made it black. "Heart and soul" should be called black people and" people" should be called white people. White people chose a bunch of white people is the controversy. 
>> And they should only sell it that guy's gun shop. 
>> You are a hemaphrodite and you get shafted every year. Ryan gosling. 

[00:47:33]


>> Gorgeous. 
>> As a sequential, I wish i had the shaft. 
>> Unnecessary. 
>> Yes, that's what she is doing. She realizes she is angry and does president know what to do with her -- and doesn't know what to do with her anger. Everyone knows the goss is off, and nobody is a fanning of channing. But it was the person who would pose for the photos and ryan being an actor and artist would not. 
>> Wow. Would you kick either of them out of bed for eating crackers ? 
>> Absolutely not. I would provide the cracker. Here he is. 
>> Time to take a break. 
>> Announcer: Stop! Living with hair loss, that is. Losing your hair is no fun and no one wants to be bald, but there is hope. 
>> Getting my hair back was the best thing that ever happened to me. 
>> I'm happy with the way I look now. 
>> I'm very excited about my hair. 
>> I feel beautiful. 
>> I love my hair. 
>> Announcer: Hair club offers all-proven hair loss solutions backed by our commitment to satisfaction guaranteed. If you're not 100% satisfied with the solution you choose, hair club will apply the purchase price to another proven hair loss solution or transplant more hair at no charge.

>> I'm 52 and I look better now THAN I DID WHEN I WAS IN MY 40s. 
>> I feel great.

[00:52:04]


>>> next topic on sunday, jane fonda received the press club's visionary award. Fonda said she was surprised by the award given her controversial relationship with the press during her activist days. She said her greatest regret is sitting on that gun. They called her hanoid jane because of the photo taken in 1972, the same year tennis was invented. Doesn't it say more about the press than it does about jane? They are willing to for gect she is a -- for the fact she is a traitor? 
>> Sheupports the boycott of jewish film makers at the toronto film festival. She monetarily supports the black panthers, the group that engages in voter intimidation. #Kwr not give her an award from the liberal press? 
>> That's her sarcasm. 
>> Is she sorry about the picture, or sorry the picture was taken? 
>> I think she is sorry that she was on a bunch of biker patches and they called her hanoi jane and she was embarrassed and got caught. She is a visionary in the sense that she predicted this wave of socialism that would eventually win. We have been in it for four years and we have another four years to go. We have the new york times reining supreme to this very day. She is a prophet. 
>> I have to disagree. I think there is another movement and it is a conservative movement. 
>> Who won the election? 
>> I don't want to talk about that. Way to bring me down. 
>> You won. We lost, greg. 
>> Chris, what kind of country are we in if we help our enemies ? 
>> Is she even still alive? I could careless about jane fonda. I won't even say her name. It is like beatle juice. Ii don't want her to show up in another movie. She is a wretched human being. The thing I regret is that thing didn't go off and blow-other. Blow off. She is a terrible, terrible, terrible person. 

[00:54:13]


>> On-line your name is hanoi jane. Do people confuse you with fonda? 
>> They do. 
>> I will tell you something. My dad is a vet and I get why he doesn't like her. Everyone else, I don't know. It doesn't inspire enough bile in me to be like shake my first this way or that way. Even in her advanced age i would not kick her out of bed because once again I am a sexitarian. 
>> We will close things out with a post game wrap up with andy levy. Dissolve to a break 

[00:58:05]


>>> catch me later this morning on the opie and anthony show. Barney and company on fox business network later. Brand-new "red eye" returns tomorrow. 
>>> Time to go back to tv's andy levy for the post game wrap up. 
>> What do you think of greg's speech at the restoration weekend? 
>> There was only one whose speech was better than greg's. 2 wasn't mine. It wasn't mine. I want to thank the freedom center for having all of us on restoration weekend. 
>> You didn't listen to my speech. 
>> I didn't. 
>> It felt like a comedy routine more than a speech. 
>> Chris I'm assume thrg is a story behind the stache? 
>> Yes, it is for movember for prostate cancer and other men's cancers. I am rocking this sweet hockey kicks cancer t-shirt for leukemia and lymphoma. Go to my website, the real red baron.Com and there are links to both of these great causes on there. 
>> Gavin, how come nobody bought your book? 
>> I think people get caught up in charity and helping people, and that can be a little day pressing. If you don't want to be brought down please buy my book. I know only old people buy books, buts you are going to be dead in the next 10 years. Get on that as soon as you can before death I kicks in. You in florida I am counting

>Hello I'm Patrice King Brown and you are watching HTV. Has it become more and more difficult to remember names? Do you struggle to find the right word? Or maybe you find yourself walking into a room or store and forgetting why you were going there in the first place? Well today's show is all about memory loss about brain fog and the other symptoms of mental decline. So many people live in fear that they're mental decline will result in losing they're independence, That family members will no longer allowthem to make there own decisions or even drive. Its terribly freighting. Think about this. Does this sound like you or perhaps a family member? Has it become increasingly difficult to remember what you've just read, or perhaps you now struggle to follow a conversation or retain the Sunday sermon you used to look forward to all week? forgetting how to get home? Imagine that? Well If you're experiencing more than your share of mental confusion and frustration., then today's show is for you. Medical science can correct many of the challenges of old age -From synthetic joints to improving mobility to prescription glasses to instantly correct age-related vision loss - but when our mind and memory begin to fail, many people wonder what can modern science do? Is it even possible for an age-ravaged brain to be brought back to 'normal again?' Today, we'll learn about an amazing technological breakthrough that may do for the brain what prescription glasses do for the eyes. It's a brain-boosting memory pill that may make tired, old brains feel young again. My guest today, is a gifted head and neck cancer surgeon, He's a 

[00:02:00]


PhD of psychologist as well. He is an expert on the brain, and knows firsthand about this remarkable life-changing development that's giving people back their independence. Welcome, America's Brain doctor, Dr. Paul Nemiroff. It is a pleasure to have you here today. >>Thank you, Patrice. And thank you for the invitation. You know I'm always excited to have an opportunity to speak with people about this important breakthrough in helping to reversing memory loss. >So, doctor, tell us your story. How did you learn about this amazing development? >>You know I became aware of this a number of years ago, And I was working like a crazy 80 hours a week, Doing surgery's, A family, Running around doing all sorts of things I was exhausted. And I started to wonder, am I starting to lose it mentally with respect to my memory. Things weren't sticking like they did before. >Uh... is that a medical term? Sticking? >>No, Its not a Medical term but it's accurate and I thought to myself was I somehow not as mentally efficient? Had I burnt out some circuitry? I was really concerned because you know my brain is what I use everyday. And I did what I've done throughout my career. I began researching the literature to see what, if anything, was available... I looked for something to wake up my brain and re-energize my memory. >So what did you find? >>Well one day during my research I came across an intresting article, fascinating article in a medical journal about a drug-free compound called Procera AVH. That consists of three ingredients designed to address the root causes of forgetfulness and poor concentration. A team of scientists identified a cluster of age-related symptoms which some people call Premature Mental Decline. That's a term we use now. And anyone over the age of 45 or 50, 55 may recognize the symptoms. They can include examples like you mentioned earlier Patrice, stemming from memory lapses, the inability to concentrate and stay focused, brain fog or fuzzy thinking, low mental energy and mental fatigue just to name a few. 

[00:04:00]


>Well that sounds like so many people today. It seems that maybe this problems a little more prevalent than it was in the past. I always thought it was normal aging though? >>No, No its not normal aging its quite widespread and years for years now people just chalked it up to that, of growing older. However, as a physician, I can tell you nothing could be further from the truth. Research now suggests that for many, these problems may be caused by a handful of relatively easily corrected conditions in the brain. >So, are you telling me that Procera AVH can help make the senior moments a thing of the past, or at least be less of a problem? Because I have seen first hand confusion, Pain, Frustration of mental decline that seniors can feel. >>Well, for many the answer may be yes Patrice... Procera AVH accomplishes this in three stages. First, blood flow and oxygen to the brain can slow with age, so Procera provides increased blood flow to your brain, bringing more oxygen and more vital nutrients. This is critical, these are some of the important fuels that power the brain that you need. Like you know, You've gone outside before and taken a breath of fresh air on a cool day, it can help wake up and mentally energize a tired, sluggish brain. >Now you use this Procera AVH, have you noticed the same energizing benefit that you've just mentioned? >>YES, I have! I was amazed at how my brain reacted within the first week of trying Procera! It was amazing. I noticed my mental clarity was better and that my focus was much sharper. I compare it to reading an eye chart say at theptometrist's office with the right pair of glasses for the first time. Everything snaps into focus, your brain feels more crisp, more focused, sharp and d clear. >That's pretty amazing. >>And I quickly felt like I did when I was younger. I felt I had my mental edge back. It was that dramatic Patrice. > You know well that's very important and very impressive. Ok, so tell me exactly how does Procera AVH help a forgetful brain? >>One of the more brilliant aspects of the formula is how it helps the brain talk to itself... > I don't want to interrupt you now Doctor, but wh "I" think about it talking to it's self I'd get funny looks if I did that kind of thing. 

[00:06:01]


Not that way? >>No, not the same thing Patrice. Procera improves what's called intra-brain communication by helping the little brain cells communicate with each other in a more efficient manner To do this, your brain relies on billions of tiny messenger molecules called neurotransmitters. But with age and years of stress, the brain can begin to run low on neurotransmitters. When it reaches a tipping point, your brain can begin to sputter and lose function. >Scatter brained, right? >>That's correct. Procera can help re-supplies your brain with memory-boosting neurotransmitters, doing this naturally which can help you think faster, learn and remember more readily and have a sharper, crisper mind. >What else does Procera do? >>Well, over the course of a lifetime, free radicals and brain pollutants can also take a toll on your brain health. Once you take Procera AVH, it goes to work, helping to reduce those mind-dulling free radicals and toxins. It does this with a sophisticated mix of brain-specific antioxidants. >So do Doctors recommend Procera for their patients? >>Well Patrice, there are few, if any, brain health supplements, that I know of, that physicians feelomfortable recommending to their patients, much less using personally. Procera AVH is one of them however that people do recommend and Doctors do as well. And It's a natural formula, which means it contains no drugs, which seniors will greatly appreciate, nobody wants to take another medication. And it's something that's actually beneficial for your brain and body, when taken daily. >Yes, bu tested and supplements usually are not, right? >>You're right, and that's usually the case, but the in the case of Procera AVH the formula was really put through the grinder - a double blind placebo controlled clinical study. In fact, it used the same rigorous FDA-approved cognitive function tests that are used in pharmaceutical drug trials. It worked so well that Procera AVH users saw a significant improvement in memory, focus, concentration, mental energy and even mood even mood in just 30 days. >Wow! 

[00:08:01]


That is impressive. Ok, but when I start taking Procera how will I really know it's working? I mean there's no way to actually measure improvements in my brainpower and focus, or is there..? Let's get to that next Dr. Nemiroff, but right now I want to give our viewers a chance to call and get more information. If you would like more information on Dr. Nemiroff, or your interested in how America's #1 brain health supplement, Procera AVH may specifically help you, then pick up the phone and call the number you see on your screen. As always, at HTV we have worked out a special arrangement with our guest, so when you do call, be sure to mention HTV and you'll receive a bonus free month supply of Procera AVH. And I've also been told, for a limited time, we have some very nice free gifts for those who call today and try Procera AVH. Including a free copy of the medically acclaimed book, 20/20 Brainpower, with the program Dr. Nemiroff recommends based upon the suggested Mayo Clinic guidelines for brain health and longevity. We have trained representatives standing by who can answer all of your questions. So, if you'd like some more information and your free month supply of Procera AVH and book, then pick up the phone now and give of us call >And If you're just tuning in.. I'm Patrice King Brown and you're watching HTV. And my guest today is sueon and psychologist, Dr. Paul Nemiroff, he is America's brain Doctor. The topic of today's show is memory and mental decline. Now before the break Dr. Nemiroff we were talking about Procera AVH, which of course now your telling me is a stunning break through nutritional supplement not medicine, Not a drug for memory that can do for the brain what prescription glasses does for the eyes. >>That's right, Patrice. And just like a good pair of glasses can make fuzzy, out-of-focus vision, sharp and crystal-clear, for many Procera AVH can make a tired, sluggish, forgetful brain, feel razor sharp and alert. It's a clinically tested formula that was shown to help improve 

[00:10:02]


memory, focus and concentration, and even mood. And was clinically shown that it can even help people who take Procera reclaim up to 15 years of lost memory and brain power in as little as 30 days. >Wow! That is impressive. Now before the break you were talking about measuring memory and brainpower. So, if I take Procera I, Can I get a measurement to prove it's working for as well? >>Absolutely! In fact every person who tries Procera AVH receives a free brain test from Brain Research Labs to assess and measure his or her memory and brainpower. And you take the test privately in your own home, So no ones watching to see how you do and it only takes a few minutes to complete. Can even fun! And you can retake the test whenever you want to see that your actually getting improvements with Procera and its making in your mental performance. >I've never heard of such a thing, but I do I like the idea though that you can actually measure your mental improvement, And I like the idea that you can do it in the privacy in your own home. Now everywhere I go I have to ask you about this, I see people drinking those energy drinks. It seems that there doing it all the time? Now, Let me ask you how can Procera AVH make these amazing improvements in the brain with out using drugs or pharmaceutical additives? Whats the secret? >>That's a great question, Patrice. The researcher who developed the formula knows the human brain like the back of his hand. He knew that it was possible to make dramatic changes in the brain by combining very precise amounts of certain natural brain energy nutrients, each has a long history of safety and effectiveness around the world. In fact, as you see here, just one of the ingredients alone in Procera was shown to energize a dull, tired brain in less than an hour. >Wow, that is quite a difference! Look it energized things lit up that aging brain looks kind of like a Christmas tree its so lit up! >So let me try to sum this up Dr. Nemiroff.. Procera boosts circulation to the brain, providing those fresh supplies of oxygen and nutrients you mentioned, and it increases levels of neurotransmitters. That .. what are neurotransmitters again? I'm sorry! I probably could use some Procera myself today. 

[00:12:03]


>>That's ok, this is new information to most people you know? Neurotransmitters in a medical term here are those chemical messengers in your brain responsible for memory for concentration, alertness, and even decision making, It also helps with overall thinking and processing information. >And then you talked about how the toxins in our air, in our food, in our water and we hear about them all the time how they can effect how the way the brain functions.. >>Thst's correct Patrice, to further help improve your mental clarity and quickness, Procera can help neutralize those free radicals and dangerous brain toxins that we just cannot avoid in today's world. So it's a triple formula that has a triple action. >Now a good friend of mine swears by that popular brain ingredient of the 90's, alot of people were taking ginkgo biloba. >>Mhm > How does that stack up against Procera AVH? >>No comparison actually in my opinion. While ginkgo has been shown to help enhance brain circulation, more recent studies were really inconclusive. And many don't feel any difference. They don't know if its working. It simply can't hold a candle to Procera's patented triple-action approach to memory improvement. >Well, I will definitely pass that information on to my friend. Right now, I'd like to take a few moments to share with our viewers some experiences from some people who have taken Procera over time from all across the country. I have a few letters here that I'd like to share and some of the comments. Okay? Lets see what they have to say. Some of them are health care professionals as well. You know, I have seen many people Dr. Nemiroff, go down hill mentally after retirment and its a very sad situation. You plan your whole life to retire and things don't work out. So we do have a story here about a retired college professor. And his name is Richard, He's from Seabrook, SC. And just after he retired, Richard went into a deep funk, and he just couldn't get up the mental energy to do any of the things that he was waiting to do at this stage in his life. Like so many other people. And then, thanks to his son, he discovered Procera AVH, And soon after taking it he felt like he awakened from a slumber. And Richard writes that he started taking guitar lessons, 

[00:14:04]


that he took up painting, something that he never imagined he had the skills to do. And remarkably he even already has very first piece now into an art gallery! This all after retirement its a new career he was back to his old creative and productive self again. >>Nice story. What seems to have happened here is that retirement may have caused his brain to go into a sort of a sluggish inertia, Sluggish motion It needed some stimulation. You know the move it or lose it thing and some good brain nutrition to get it active and vibrant again. And that's just what Procera does, it helps restore depleted oxygen and neurotransmitter levels getting those neurons fired up again! > Boy that's good! And as you mentioned earlier again, in addition to stress, and aging, and toxins causing premature mental decline, there are certain medical procedures and im sure some kind of medications as well that can contribute to memory loss or to that low mental energy, and mental confusion. One woman wrote in to say that at age 50, and " you know I don't know about you but I don't think that 50 is all that old" after a medical procedure this woman tried to go back to school she wanted to get her advanced degree. Now Unfortunately, she could barely concentrate, and her memory and her ability to learn and retain new information she says seemed " to be gone forever." Well after reading about Procera AVH, she decided to give it a try and that's when she wrote to us to tell us her story... With Procera she could now "focus and retain information just like she could when she was 25". >>Wow. >That's quite an improvement, And she says that she's not only got her advanced degree but she's very excited she also a great new job too! >>That's terrific! And we get this feedback all the time, it can also happen when women go through menopause or other hormonal changes, and there's also a condition called chemo-brain which can really wipe out a person's memory as well. Unfortunately many popular medications like cholesterol medication, sleep allergies and others can also contribute to memory problems. You know stressful life changes like a divorce can also affect memory and accelerate mental decline. And Procera can help. 

[00:16:05]


>Wow? Well here is a letter also from a commercial airline pilot who says he harnesses Procera's natural mental energy to ensure mental sharpness and endurance while flying. And I don't know about you but I wanna make sure the pilots being pretty good. >>You want him sharp. >That's right you want him sharp. >The pilot wrote "Many of my trips are all-nighters or 'red-eye' flights. I find that Procera AVH gives me greater mental clarity and endurance throughout the flight." So im happy that he never? >>I can't agree more, Patrice. I think if you're especially responsible for the safety of others, Procera AVH can provide you with additional confidence and security that you'll be at your best. It certainly has changed lives. >I want to take a minute now and give our viewers a chance to call for more information. Now If you'd like more information on Dr. Nemiroff, or are interested in how America's #1 brain health supplement, Procera AVH, can help improve your memory, Your focus, Your concentration, and even mood.

[00:18:05]


or grandparent, who may have grown increasingly forgetful or frustrated or mentally confused and sombodys finally ready to do something about that memory loss and mental decline if so then todays show is just for you! I urge you to stay with us for the next few minutes because the information you're about to hear has changed lives and can change your life as well. My guest today is America's Brain Doctor, Dr. Paul Nemiroff, he's a head and neck cancer surgeon he's also a doctor of psychology. And today we're discussing the new brain health phenomenon known as Procera AVH. So earlier in the show you made an analogy that Procera AVH can have the same effect on an older brain that prescription glasses have on older eyes. What did you mean by that? >>Well thank you again for the introduction Patrice. Let me first say that just because our health changes as we get older, that doesn't necessarily mean that it has to stay that way. Here's a good example. Every year, millions of Americans will schedule an annual checkup with their optometrist to correct their age-related changes in their vision. Yet very few people are even aware that they can do something to help correct the age-related memory loss. > Why is that? >>Well it's because they simply didn't know that life can be different, But with Procera they may now be able to do something about it. And that's important. Give people chance give people hope.. >And how does Procera AVH make that foggy brain, sharp again? >>Procera AVH works by addressing some correctable conditions in the brain, which often can be associated with aging, stress, toxins, and medications. As we mentioned as we age, circulation to the brain is reduced for a number of reasons. This can have a serious effect. When blood flow to the brain is restricted, the supply of oxygen and nutrients needed for optimal brain function can be reduced. This has an immediate effect on mental alertness, your ability to concentrate and focus. It can also diminishes recall, which can reduce your short-term memory. >And what about stress? Everybody's dealing with some form of stress, and over the 

[00:20:06]


course of many years it can really deplete reserves of those little neurotransmitters in the brain. And when the brain doesn't have enough of these specialized molecules, memory can suffers, mental acuity drops - Your just not as sharp as you want to be.. and your ability to stay on-task is hampered. >What about all the toxins though too Doctor in the environment? We hear about them all the time. How does that affect the brain >>Well that's the third condition that Procera AVH addresses free radical and toxin damage. I call it, You know 'the bullies of the body.' Referring to free radicals and these molecules can ricochet around the body wreaking havoc, They can affecting cellular health, and the health of entire organ systems, especially the brain. >So how long does Procera take to start working well for you? >>Well its going to vary but the clinical trial was done in 30 days so with procera in just a few weeks, You can feel more alert more mentally energized more productive with improved memory recall, its even been shown in clinical research to help improve your well being so you may actually feel better and improve your mood. >Boy that is really good news. That people need this kind of thing, Well we wanna thank you Doctor. It looks like Procera AVH truly is a total brain formula and you know fustration, We've talked about that is a word that we often hear in association in memory loss, in mental decline and fear as well as we age, That we're not as in charge of our lives as we might want to be as we once were. Especially when we age a people can no longer read sometimes. People can no longer comprehend all kinds of things that they've been reading. It takes longer its not as enjoyable and you worry about what you can do? >>And people can't read their favorite bibles passages any longer when there hearing there pasture's Sunday sermin. >And that's a fear too because that's an important part of peoples lives. You want to have some control you know, We always say think about it as adults that we were in control and then we find ourselves we always joke about how the children eventually take over. We want to people as long an opportunity to be independent as 

[00:22:10]


they possiy can. >>And the fear loss of independence with mental decline, Patrice is significant. Whether it's fear that a spouse or their children will no longer allow them to make their own decisions. Or perhaps they need to take the driver's test again and that's a big deal to seniors, they may be terrified that they may not pass may not be able to drive, and end up a prisoner in their own home. And its sad, and for many it just doesn't have to be that way. By simply doing certain things to improve brain health, like taking Procera AVH daily, or following some of the tips in the brain health book I recommend, 20/20 Brain Power, many things can turn around. And you want to give people hope and this is something that can give you hope. >And you've mentioned earlier we were talking about people being& losing there independence, I know even my mother was very concerned about this when it came time for her too take her state drives test again and she wanted to be prepared and she wanted to study, She was really very very worried about it and she said " This is my inpendence" fortunately she passed. She passed. >Now I'd like to take a minutes Dr. Nemiroff, and share a few, more letters. Okay? From viewers that was sent to us from another Procera user. And this one certainly applies to woman all the women who are watching. And many of us have experienced the effects of hormonal shifts and all that that can have on the brain. Leah writes us Leah's a 55-year-old college instructor from California, and she writes that, "Hormones are at an all time high at our house! Like many mothers of teenagers, I am going through menopause. I feel absent minded, had low energy, I couldn't make decisions, I could not concentrate on issues at work, and had no patience at home." Leah also wrote that, "I found taking Procera noticeably helped with my short term memory". She goes on to say "Because I felt more organized and in control, my mood improved, my patience deepened. And I credit Procera with helping me get through some really very difficult times". >>Those are some difficult times. Yeah, so many women really struggle with brain fog and 

[00:24:10]


memory loss from hormonal changes throughout their lives, even after childbirth. And for many Procera can really help. Now, if you wouldn't mind,I'd like to put on my doctor hat again for a minute or two, if that's okay. > You go right ahead. >>Thanks Patrice. If your embarrassed when you forget a name that you've known years, or draw a complete blank on what you were going to say next, or worried that you may not have locked your doors at night - remember it's not your fault. As we grow older, these things can happen to all of us. But an increase in these senior moments is something that you should not take lightly. So, here's the bottom line.

=======================================================

>> As peak, someone is dying, right now. 
>> And over the next hour, three people will die. 
>> He went to sleep and he had no idea this was gonna be his last night on earth. 
>> From misusing perfectly legal prescription drugs. Taking a deadly dose. 
>> Poise center, this is debra. 
>> I'm a little concern had that may have taken something that wasn't good for me on accident. 
[ Phone ringing ] 
>> I took a few methadone from my grandpa. They were 10 milligrams. 
>> What you are listening to are actual calls. 
>> How is he acting? 
>> At the washington poison center in seattle. 
>> Just drowsy, okay. 
>> And lately, more and more of them sound something like this. 
>> And today, I took about 90 milligrams of america set percocet. 
>> Oh you did? 6:00, I wasn't really thinking and I did a bar of xanax and I'm reading all this stuff online how that is a very lethal combination. I have a lot of friends who died in their sleep and I just wasn't really thinking. Now I'm wondering if I should stay up tonight. 
>> That kind of call to me is really scary. 
>> Oh, it is scary. 
>> What goes through your mind? 
>> So, I would be very frightened about that young man not making through the night. 
>> Dr. Bill hurley is the medical director of the poison center. He is also a trauma doctor. 
>> Possibly too many of his meds. 
>> They are not sure what all they've got. 
>> We are here in seattle, in part, because the problem is bad. 
>> This bottle still has quite a bit in it. 
>> But also because, as you will see, there are real solutions. 
>> No other meds? 
>> For hurley, it started five years ago. 
>> He's got pinpoint pupils. 
>> He started noticing overdoses, a lot of them, coming through his e.R. Doors. 

[00:02:01]


>> We thought, well, these are the guys who are on the street, maybe using heroin. 
>> But looking deeper, he realized they weren't junkies, not at all. It usually began with a back sprain. 
>> They were taking these medications no to the get high but try to control pain in most cases, back pain and then they were mixing them with other medications and having fatal reactions to that. 
>> A lot of people have back pain. A lot of people take pain medications for that pain. And what you're saying a lot of those people are then dying? 
>> Yeah. A lot of them are dying and a lot of people in our culture right now are at risk of dying from the exact same thing. 
>> I wanted to know more. So they allowed me to listen in. 
>> Poison center. May I help you? 
>> Yeah, my wife took hydromet and when we checked it later, she had taken 30 millimeters instead of five. 
>> To see the problem firsthand, I rode along with lieutenant craig amman. He has been on the job for 30 years. He will tell you, when he takes an overdose call, the usual suspect is a painkiller. 
>> What sort of impact have you seen here in seattle? 
>> Well, I think if you pull a group of people together from this community, someone in that group is going to have had a friend, a loved one that has either had difficulty with a prescription drug or potentially died from that. 
>> Amman's unit responds to 45 calls a month about overdoses involving these types of medications. And this is important, it can be difficult to tell whether it's a painkiller or heroin, because they come from the same ingredient and do the same sort of thing to your body. 
>> Aside from needle tracks in the arms, someone who has had an overdose of pain medication like that or heroin, they could look very much the same? 
>> Absolutely. They could be unconscious from a medication that they think is relatively safe for them because instead of getting it on the street, they get it from a pharmacist. 
>> Okay. 36, code green. 

[00:04:02]


>> Possible drug overdose. 
[ Sirens ] these people are suffering from chronic pain. They know that a little bit of pain medication helps, so maybe a lot would help a lot more. 
>> When we arrive, another medic is on the scene. 
>> Somewhere in that parking garage, there's a call about someone having a parking garage. 
>> The overdose victim came to and walked away, but while we're there, another call. And it's been just a few minutes. 
>> We've got a 52-year-old. He took approximately three dilaudid plus methadone. 
>> I decided to ride along with lieutenant john fisk, who is headed to the scene. 
>> Sounds like he has decreased level of consciousness respiratory compromise. Sounds like a narcotic overdose. 
>> Car crashes are no longer the number one reason people die accidentally in the united states. Nowadays, it is actually prescription drugs. That's because on any given day people take more than the recommended dose, mix and match or take medications not prescribed to them, maybe take pills with alcohol. And all of it can make for a deadly dose. In fact, the most recent data shows 37,000 drug overdose deaths in one year, mostly accidental. 21,000 involved prescription drugs. Of though 75% were pain killers. By the end of this hour, i promise you your idea of a potential overdose victim will change. To this. 
>> This could be you. It could be me. 
>> And that's the point. It could be anyone. 
>> He was big, strong, handsome, smart. Wanted to make something of his life. He had no idea that he was turning out the lights. None. And if it's true of him, it's got to be true of a lot of other people. We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of Tim and Laura. It's amazing how appreciative ople are when you tell them they could save a lot of money on their car insurance by switching to GEICO...they may even make you their best man.

>>> On december 19, 2011, benjamin gupta, a law student at george washington university died suddenly. Mysteriously. He is no relationship to me, but when his family got word, they spent hours trading phone calls. They were in stunned disbelief. >> There was a message from his mom. And she had left three messages for me, so I knew there was something wrong. 
>> I received a call from my mom. I didn't answer but then I got a text message from her, which is very unusual. 
>> And I called her back. And I said, what happened? And she says, it's ben. He died. I just didn't have any of the information. 
>> I finally said, how did this happen? And she said he went to sleep the night before and he just never woke up. 
>> He was always smiling, every picture he was smiling. 
>> For days, ben gupta's family was desperate for answers. What killed him? He was only 28 years old. He had recently been give an clean bill of health. How could he just not wake up? 
>> And then the thoughts went through my mind that maybe it was some sort of a brain aneurism or something must have happened. 
>> But his father was in for a shock after a conversation with the doctor who performed ben's autopsy. 
>> And he called me and said, yes, you know, they found oxycodone in his system. 
>> He tells you he believes that your son died of a -- an overdose of narcotics? 
>> Yeah, right. 
>> What do you think at that point? 
>> I was just shocked at that time. 
>> Did you think it was possible, what you knew of your son? 
>> No. No. 
>> He worked for the state department and he, you know, was gonna graduate in a year with a dual law and mba degrees, you know, the type of person where it just doesn't even run through your head that he is having a problem because he is doing so well. 

[00:11:13]


>> Stuart bridge was a close friend of ben's. They met in grammar school. He recalled a conversation that would later prove to be very important. 
>> He had met somebody new and he really liked this new girl that he was dating. 
>> And ben told stuart that he and his new girlfriend tried oxycodone and they thought it was no big deal. 
>> You know, I'm not doing it regularly. It's not something I'm seeking out, but it's something they've tried. 
>> Now, anyone else might just shrug off that conversation, but bridge wasn't just a friend. He was also a doctor. And he warned ben about taking oxycodone and about mixing it with alcohol. 
>> I've seen people die who are on these medications or who have experimented with these medications. 
>> From just experimenting, the reason, the line between experimentation and death, it turns out, is tenuous. Oxycodone and other painkillers like it are what's called central nervous system, or cns, depressants, slowing down the body's vital functions, breathing, heart rate, blood pressure. That is not usually a problem when the pills are prescribed for you, but when you add them to other cns depressants, like alcohol or other prescription drugs, the effect is multiplied. The nervous system slows and slows until breathing, heart rate, brain function, all grind to a halt. Ben's deadly dose, according to his girlfriend, was drinking beer and scotch throughout the day along with an unknown quantity of oxycodone. When his blood alcohol level was tested, it registered .04. That's relatively low, less than half the legal limit. Here is the implication, it may not take much alcohol to tip the balance toward death. Ben fell asleep in front of the tv and by the next morning, he had stopped breathing. 

[00:13:17]


>> Almost what makes it even more frightening, that he went to sleep and he had no idea this was gonna be his last night on earth. I mean, he had no idea that this was gonna be it. 
>> It just seems so preventible and so stupid. It just didn't have to happen like this. It didn't have to be, you know, like that. 
>> You explained what happened to my friend to me in two sentences. If people get something that simple, that direct, then it almost doesn't matter how boozed up they get before they pop the pill. They will remember that. 
>> How are you? 
>> I first learned about ben gupta's story when I got a phone call just after his death from former president bill clinton. Ben's father is an old friend of the clintons. Over the years, he has donated thousands of dollars to theirs and other democratic political campaigns and over time, the families became close friends. 
>> Ben, a beautiful man, with a beautiful life. Some people live four times as long and don't do as much good or bring as much joy. 
>> Why did you decide to call me? 
>> I called you in desperation. I wanted to know what to do. I just knew that somebody needed to do something, but that's why I called you. I thought you, a, I knew you'd care about it. B, I thought you'd know something about it. 
>> I could tell in your voice that you were pretty broken up. What kind of kid was he? 
>> A light shined out of him. All I can tell you. He grew up, he was big, strong, handsome, smart. And wanted to make something of his life. He was industrious, but normal and liked to have a good time. I promise you that night he had no idea he was turning out the lights. None. And if it's true of him, it's got to be true of a lot of other people. 
>> As soon as people hear that someone died of a drug overdose, they immediately have a perception of who that person was, what kind of life they led, their behaviors. It's not true in a lot of these people. 

[00:15:20]


>> No. 
>> Including ben. 
>> We -- all of us, the whole culture, we need to start thinking about this. This is crazy. Not a single solitary one of these people has to die. 
>> President clinton said to me, nobody thinks that taking an oxycontin and a few beers is a good idea but you also don't think you're going to die. 
>> Yes. 
>> You think that was ben's sort of state of mind? I know this is playing with fire a little bit but I'm not gonna die. 
>> I don't think that he knew that this could kill him. 
>> He finds some solace from his son's death by funding programs that educate people about the dangers of misusing prescription drugs and the recently, he made a $1 million pledge to the clinton global initiative to support the former president's newfound passion about this issue. 
>> He said, I have been very fortunate. And my son was worth $1 million. 
>> It's still hard to talk about. 
>> It is. It is. 
>> Do you think it ever won't be? 
>> No. I think about him all the time. Like I'm in d.C. Today, I've went walking on the g.W. Campus looking for him. 
>> Looking for him? 
>> Yes. And I could feel him. I could feel him. Every day, I just miss him. Every day. 
[ Sirens ] 
>> my girlfriend found me dead already. I had been not breathing, no pulse. And I was turning blue. use Miles For their annual football trip. That's double miles you can actually use.

[00:21:23]


>> May have stockpiled some of his own and taken it afterwards. 
>> It's called stacking, prescription pills stacked on top of other pills, each one amplifying the previous one's effect. 
>> I'd say it probably began about ten years ago. 
>> Dr. Steven anderson, an e.R. Doctor in washington state, sees the end result of stacking virtually every time he goes to work. 
>> I've taken two vicodin before, no problem. I've taken a valium to sleep before. No problem. I've had a couple of drinks before. No problem. But all of a sudden, you add all of those into the same scenario and it adds up and causes the complications. 
>> You're talking about, when you say stacking, sounds like it making it exponentially worse. 
>> Exactly. 
>> Here's why. Pop a pain pill and you get pain relief. The same time, your breathing slows down. Even after the pain relief wears off that slowed breathing persists, sometimes for hours. Now, if you pop another pain pill before it's time, you depress the breathing even more. Some of the deadliest combinations, high-dose painkillers stacked on other painkillers. Painkillers stacked with anti-anxiety medications or painkillers mixed with alcohol. 
>> We have seen absolute skyrocketing of overdose deaths and correlates directly with the number of prescriptions that are written. 
>> The problem, in part, is that here in the united states, we are being flooded with painkillers. Consider this, americans take 80% of the world's painkillers. 80%. Distribution of morphine, the main ingredient in most popular painkillers, increased by 600% between 1997 and 2007. Pain couldn't have increased that much in ten years but painkillers did. It's become a lucrative business and with so many pills out there, there's no broad system in place for doctors and pharmacies to keep track of it all. And again, every 1 minutes, we see the consequence. And doesn't even account for people like this man who came close, too close to dying. Thankfully, he survived. And so did this man from virginia. 

[00:23:47]


>> My girlfriend found me, dead and not breathing, no pulse. 
>> His name is ben. He didn't want to give his last name. 
>> I took some. 
>> Now, listen closely. What he is describing is nearly dying after an overdose. 
>> I remember standing around feeling good, talking with someone and then thinking, i just need to sit down for a second. I was turning blue. I was gone in a minute. I had only had a few beers and i had also taken plenty of methadone at the same time. 
>> Methadone, which you may recognize as a treatment for heroin addicts, is also a popular painkiller prescribed by doctors. When he overdosed about four years ago, it was the first time ben had tried it. Do you remember the point when you started using prescription drugs? 
>> Well, originally, I had been prescribed them for an injury. I was on painkillers and muscle relaxers, and definitely even within that time you there were probably couple days I took more than I was prescribed. 
>> Did you think about the safety at all? 
>> It's classic statement, this isn't going to happen to me. Well, of course, everyone who it happens to said that at one point. 
>> That's where the story of ben from virginia intersects with ben gupta, the law student and thousands of other unwitting overdose victims, it won't happen to me. 
>> It's more realistic for someone like me who has a job to overdose because it's amazing how little you need of a mix of alcohol and narcotics to overdose when your body is not used to it. 
>> How little are we talking about? 
>> Four or five beers and two or three shots and that was it. 
>> A few beers, a couple of shots and some methadone? 
>> Exactly. 
>> He was at a party. He felt sleepy. And then he stopped breathing. Your girlfriend just happened to find you? 

[00:25:48]


>> Thankfully. Yeah. 
>> If she hadn't found you? 
>> I wouldn't be here. 
>> You would be dead? For sure? 
>> Definitely. I was dead when she found me. 
>> For ben, the story's going to sound familiar. It started with a prescription for shoulder pain. In fact, he, in part, fits the profile of an overdose victim. Typically, they are male. THEY ARE IN THEIR 40s AND 50s. They started with a prescription. And three years later, they were dead. Between the time he got his pain prescription and then had his overdose, ben started to become dependent. 
>> Started out with small, like, you know, vicodin and percocet. But then, of course, those don't work as well, you eventually someday try oxycontin. 
>> At your peak, how much were you taking? 
>> EIGHT TO TEN 80s IN A DAY. And still function. 
>> EIGHT TO TEN 80s? 
>> Yeah. 
>> They are 10 to 15 times stronger than anything we used to have and I don't think that people fully appreciate how strong those medicines are. And they are longer and longer acting and that's part of the problem, too. 
>> Another problem, these powerful painkillers were originally intended to treat end of life and cancer pain. But, see, those patients didn't live very long, so there wasn't long-term data on what they would do to ben or to me or, frankly, to most people who now take them. They are being prescribed for all sorts of chronic pain problems with no data to suggest high doses of powerful painkillers are either safe or effective over the long term. 
>> When did you start taking opiates? 
>> Dr. Jane ballantine is an anesthesiologist at the university of washington. 
>> You had very good physical therapists. 
>> Ten years ago, while treating patients on high defense painkillers, she found something surprising. Not only with those patients not getting pain relief but the painkillers were, in fact, doing something that could best be described as the opposite, making patients more sensitive to pain. It's called hyperalgesia. So, more pain medications ultimately meant more pain. And that, of course, means, well, even more pain medications. It's easy to see the problem. 

[00:28:09]


>> The hyperalgesia was so obvious in those patients that you could, for example, see that they couldn't bear the sheet on them or any intravenous stick was abnormally painful to them. 
>> You said that this has essentially been 20 years of failed experiment and that not many people are sort of supporting this anymore except for the die-hazard -- die-hards and the ph 
>> I would never suggest that we shouldn't continue to prescribe for those that are really helped by opiates, people who have a real need, but the way we do at the moment is actually harming more patients than it helps.

>>> Former president bill clinton's familiarity with painkillers goes back to when he lived in the white house. Have you ever been prescribed a medication like this? 
>> Well, I did take some painkillers when I tore my -- 90% of my quadracep, but I tried to be very careful and I was in a lot of pain. 
>> And years after leaving the oval office, he once again would need pain pills. He says he and his doctors were cautious. 
>> After my heart surgery, you know, I hurt pretty bad for three weeks so I got some medicine, but I really tried to get off it as quick as I could and my doctors were really good about it, you know, telling me, take this if it's killing you, but be careful. 
>> Poison center, this is rosie. 
>> Be careful, it's warning that might prevent call after call pouring in here at the washington poison center. 
>> Poison center, this is debra. 
>> I wasn't getting pain relief and I took too many oxycodone. I, took, um, five ten-milligram oxycodones and I'm feeling really shaky, lightheaded. I'm just nervous. 
>> For the most part this hasn't been recognized as a national phenomenon or a national problem at all. 
>> Not recognized among the general population and also not recognized among the medical community? 
>> Exactly. They had no idea that this combination of medications could lead to their death, and in many cases, their doctors don't recognize the risk to those patients. 
>> So how did we quietly become a country inundated with pain pills? Some believe it all began when pain was designated the fifth vital sign. 
>> When you talk about vital signs, typically, someone gets their body temperature measured, their heart rate, their respiratory rate and their blood pressure, but the results of this push to say the fifth vital sign is pain. Never forget about asking someone about their pain. You think that fueled this or helped drive this? 

[00:34:44]


>> I do. I think physicians around year 2000 started to get pushed to better manage pain. And the physicians in our culture, that means give out more medication. 
>> So pain becomes a vital sign. Laws are passed liberalizing the use of opioids. Doctors prescribe the drugs for legitimate reasons but for chance could be treated with milder medications or therapy. The result, we proscribe enough pain pills to give every man, woman and child a dose every four hours for three weeks. Remember, 80% of the world's opioids are used by americans. 80%. Does that surprise you? 
>> I didn't know that. No. Because -- 
>> is that a cultural problem? 
>> Yes, it is cultural. People think, I've got a headache or I've got this or my elbow is sore or xaefr. I don't want to minimize, there are a lot of people who live courageous lives in constant pain but there's no question since we represent 5% of the world's people we got no business popping as many pills as we do. 
>> Why is this you think, such a distinct american phenomenon? 
>> We like things to happen quickly an instantaneously. IT'S the McDonald's phenomenon. You can drive through and get your food immediately. The same thing, you can go to the emergency department and get your pain relived immediately. 
>> Immediate relief but very little education to the dangers. And lots of questions about the long-term use of opioids. A concern I put to john castellani. He is president and ceo of the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america, which represents and lobbies on behalf of drug manufacturers. Do you know of any studies that actually show people taking narcotics for longer periods of time, other than that would be associated with end of life care or terminal cancer and having positive, consistent results? 

[00:36:53]


>> We do know the feedback we get from patients and physicians and that is where patients are able to manage pain with their physician. They are able to manage their chronic and acute pain. They have better lifestyles. They have a more robust life. 
>> But remember, there is no good scientific data on the effects of long-term use of high-dose opioids. Do you think we prescribe too many pain medications in this country? 
>> I can't answer that. That has to be a decision between patients and their doctors. 
>> Are these medications addictive or not? 
>> Narcotics? Everything I know is that they are if they are misused. If they are used properly, they are not. 
>> Problem is misuse is rampant. In 2010, about 12 million americans reported using painkillers without a prescription or medical need. And that number, every 19 minutes, someone died. The challenge, of course s finding ways to stop misuse, addiction, and death without cutting off a lifeline. 
>> Life starts to lose some of its meaning when you're in chronic pain. 
>> I have seen her curled up in a fetal position for hours. money I am probably going to the gas station about once a month. Last time I was at a gas station was about...I would say... Two months ago. I very rarely put gas in my chevy volt. I go to the gas station such a small amount that I forget how to put gas in my car.

>>> Which was the most effective tool that we've offered you? 
>> Methadone. 
>> Hi, welcome back. 
>> Could you just tell me when your pain started? 
>> Well, actually started after I had my stroke. 
>> Hi, my name is eric hall. 
>> The university of washington center for pain relief is busier than ever. 
>> Most of my pain comes from laying down at night. 
>> Every single day, we see anywhere between 250 to 300 patients that suffer from acute, postoperative chronic pain. This is my favorite. 
>> Dr. Alex kahana is chief of pain medicine at the university of washington. 
>> It's all for the patient. This is not a clinic with doctors offices. This is for tients. 
>> He designed the center for pain relief, he says, to be a welcoming, supportive environment for patients who struggle to live normal lives. 
>> To make it you know, human to make it tender, to make it hospitable. When people ask me, is it hard? No, it's not hard. It's a privilege to do that. 
>> It really gets to you you doesn't it? 
>> Yep. 
>> You're taking more than we now consider a safe dose. 
>> Many of these patients are here because some physicians and legislators are trying to curb washington state's prescription drug overdose problem. 
>> Think this is the worst man made epidemic in history. 
>> Dr. Gary franklin is medical director for the state of washington's department of labor and industries. When is the first time this even became an issue that you had noticed? 
>> By 2001, our claims managers were sending me cases of injured workers who had had a low back sprain and who were dead three years later from an unintentional overdose of prescribed opioids. It was the saddest thing I had ever seen. 
>> So he took action, helping write guidelines that this year, became state law. It applies to non-cancer chronic pain patients. It mandates prescriber education, treatment plans called pain contracts between physicians and patients and tracking of opioid use. 

[00:44:46]


>> If states don't do new laws reflecting best practices and universal precautions so opioids can be used safely and effectively this will never turn around. 
>> The washington state law does have its share of critics, many of whom are patients dealing with pain right now. They are personally concerned about one provision. It requires that if a physician wants to provide a daily dosage of an opiate above a certain amount, he or she must first consultant with a pain specialist. The problem is there aren't enough specialists. 
>> There are not enough pain docs in the world to take care of all the pain in king county, let alone in greater seattle. Simply not enough. 
>> Today on a scale of zero to ten what would you rate your pain as? 
>> That's why the university of washington center for pain relief is inundated with patient referrals. >>Erie edwards from sitka, alaska. 
>> And it's why it organized so-called tele-pain conferences in which the center's experts provide advice to patients. 
>> A 33-year-old woman with joint pains and you have got questions about, I think, diagnosis and some treatment strategies. 
>> Many of whom are practicing in remote locations. 
>> Her primary concern is just severe joint pain. 
>> Yesterday we had 50 dial-ins all over the country from sitka, alaska, all the way to rochester, new york. 
>> Does she actually have swelling that you can see in her hand? 
>> One of the biggest fears about the new law is that doctors, unhappy with its requirements, will stop accepting or treating legitimate pain patients, that those with chronic conditions will be left without the care and the medications they need. 
>> Life starts to lose some of its meaning when you are in chronic pain. 
>> I have seen her curled up in the fetal position for hours, even crying at times. 
>> In tacoma, washington, christie and burt, husband and wife are both in pain, his is caused by multiple sclerosis. 

[00:46:49]


>> My leg is constantly being electrocuted from the inside out. 
>> Hers caused by a car accident, 16 years ago. 
>> I was in a big old '77 chevrolet station wagon, bent it in half, I looked in my rearview mirror and I could actually see the woman putting mascara on and I knew I was in trouble. 
>> You are slowing down or stopped at the light? 
>> I was at a complete stop. I just saw her barrelling toward me, could I see she wasn't even looking at the light. 
>> Putting on mascara? 
>> Yep that I could see and she just plowed right into me. Unfortunately to this day i still have back issues because of it. 
>> Are you in pain right now? 
>> I am. Yeah. The pain medications make a huge difference, thank goodness. Without them, I don't think i would be able to work a full-time job. 
>> But she says after the new state law passed, no doctor would treat her. How hard has it been to find doctors who give you the medications you want? 
>> Since this law passed, it's been incredibly difficult. I ended up calling multiple clinics. I would call and say -- first words out of their mouth, if you want pain medication, forget about it, we're done. First words out of your mouth, 
>> christie believes that doctors are turning away patients because they see prescribing any pain medication as a risk, they see it aa potential violation of the law. Eventually she did get appointments and took along her medical records to prove her need for painkillers. 
>> A lot of them didn't even look at them and were not inclined to prescribe me the medications I was on. I just didn't think I could handle one more doctor's visit and feel like I'm being attacked and being treated as a liar. 
>> Did these doctors essentially treat you as a drug addict? 
>> It felt that way. It was very difficult and at a certain point, I almost gave up. 

[00:48:54]


>> Christie says her experience is not unique because she is a lawyer whose work includes cases of accidents and injuries. 
>> I have had numerous clients contact me saying I can't find a doctor, I'm in so much pain. 
>> Has this left some patients in the lurch, made it harder for some patients to find doctors to treat them? 
>> I think yes, in all honesty, the university of washington always saw patients that the community felt uncomfortable seeing. That's part of our mission. 
>> But dr. Kahana and dr. Franklin, believe the guidelines, first published in 2007 as voluntary, are reversing the overdose epidemic in their state. 
>> Between 2008 and 2010, we saw about a 20% decline in the state in the number of deaths. 
>> She says that her low back pain is at a zero intensity. 
>> It's working. It's -- that's -- there's no question? 
>> No, not in my mind, at least. 
>> This helps me understand that we are on the right track you. 
>> Possible solutions for washington state. But what about the rest of the country? 
>> You're the chief of explaining things what do you tell the american people about this? things, trying to find a better job can be frustrating. So at University of Phoenix we're working with a growing list of almost two thousand corporate partners 
- companies like Microsoft, American Red Cross and Adobe - to create options for you. Not only that, we're using what we learn from these partners to shape our curriculum. So that when you find the job you want you'll be a perfect fit. Let's get to work. ?????? important ?????? when you give a child a toy, it has to work. ??????

[00:54:11]


>>> As we speak, someone died now, right now, from an overdose and that something has to change. 
>> Dr. Alex kahana at the university of washington center for pain relief says that change starts with a simple first step, spend time and listen to parents. How would you best describe this place? 
>> A place where we can actually sit and listen and understand what patients have. 
>> I thought I'll never get out of this. It was 20 years that I had pain. 
>> Dr. Kana believes better treatment and fewer unnecessary prescriptions will come from understanding a parent's entire life experience. 
>> You have to start capturing the story of patients in a way that you can extract it and analyze it. 
>> This is your home screen. 
>> At the center for pain relief they do this through a system they call pain tracker. It starts with patients filling out a questionnaire before the appointment. 
>> I see a two-page report. I say, oh, mr. Smith, I see you have back pain since 12 years since you fe from a horse. I see you're sad. You're worried and drinking maybe is a problem. And you say, oh, my god, someone who finally understands what's going on. 
>> And patients can even see the results tracked over time. But if question is, is there really time for these types of in-depth conversations in the emergency rooms? You guys are busy. Do you have time to be drilling down on pain issues when you're dealing with all the things that E.R.s DEAL WITH? 
>> It may not be any longer than five-minute, honest sit-down conversation. But if we're really out there to save lives this is something we have to take the extra five minutes for. 
>> Dr. Anderson walked me around a hospital in tacoma, washington. One of the first things you will notice here and every e.R. In the state is a reminder for patients of restrictions on how much pain medication they can be prescribed. 

[00:56:11]


>> Not only are we all playing by the same rules, we are also now all communicating with one another. 
>> This is being done through a statewide database. It provides a patient's history of visits to emergency departments in the last five years as well as other vital information. 
>> In some cases, it might even show care guidelines, like this particular physician has said no narcotics should be issued through the emergency department because they are on a pain management contract. 
>> If something like this didn't exist, the scenario is somebody could come to one emergency room, possibly get a prescription for pain medication and maybe even the same day, go to another emergency room and get a prescription for pain medication and that could happen? 
>> That's happened for years. 
>> So pharmacies here also share data. 
>> We now have a prescription monitoring program through every pharmacy in the state of washington that allows me to see every restricted medication that's been written in the last year for this patient. 
>> There are other states with similar databases but they are not all connected. And an effort is well under way to try to create a national information exchange with the support of the pharmaceutical industry. 
>> We are partnering with the national association of pharmaceutical boards on the creation of the interconnect program, which will be a national database, so a subscribing physician can know what an individual parent's history is. 
>> Congress has considered creating a similar federal system to track prescriptions but that effort has been stuck in legislative limbo. 
>> We are gonna have to make a decision to save ourselves, to save our families. 
>> Battling this overdose epidemic is a daunting challenge. Do you think that it's fixable? 
>> Sure. 
>> We like our pain pills in our country. 
>> It is fixable. I think now just bringing this out will have a lot of corrective impact. 

[00:58:13]


>> Nobody is suggesting we stop prescribing narcotics. They allow so many people to function who would otherwise be crippled by pain. For them, this medicine is an absolute lifeline. But all of us need to take note, don't take pills that aren't prescribed for you. Don't mix prescription drugs with alcohol and never take more than the prescribed dose. You're the chief of explaining things. What do you tell the american people about this? 
>> I would say we are going to start a national conversation about this but you need to have one in your family. You need to have one in your place of worship. You need to have a one in your place of work. You need to make sure your kids talk about it in school. We need to understand that it is a good thing to alleviate pain. It is a bad thing to kill people through abuse of these alleviations. 
>> In a nation overflowing with so many pills, with so many patients wanting and expecting the quick fix, with so many truly naive prescribers, users and misusers of medications, we have to find a way to prevent people from taking a deadly

3. And it would be the first book detailing smart's account of her kidnapping back in 2002, her recovery, and more. 
>>> That will do it for me, I'm fredricka whitfield. The cnn news room continues at the top of the hour, with martin savage filling in for don lemon. Keep it here for sanjay gupta. 
>>> Everywhere you look, it seems a heart attack is just waiting to happen. More than a million heart attacks a year. That is one just about every 30 seconds, just in the united states. If you haven't had a heart attack yourself, you likely know someone who has. Well, I have a secret to share. With what we know right now we could see the last heart attack in america. I have been investigating this for over a year. I have lessons to share. Things you need to know, things your doctor may not tell you. I'm a pretty typical guy in his EARLY 40s WITH A FAMILY HISTORY Of heart disease. So I decided to go on a mission to never have a heart attack. But how? This doctor has guaranteed he can see trouble coming, years in advance. 
>> Here is where the blood is flowing, and this is the lining. 
>> Reporter: Agatson is using an ultrasound to look for plaque in the artery, a blockage here would be a sign I'm at increased risk of a heart attack. 
>> Unless you do the imaging, you are playing with trouble. 
>> You're looking for what? 
>> The plaque, the calcium. 
>> I have never had a problem, but you're looking for it anyway. 
>> Yes, and if you're heading for a heart attack in five, ten, 20 years, you will already have plaque. It is a lifelong process. 
>> We all know plaque is bad, blocks your blood vessels. It is formed by the cholesterol in the blood, the bad cholesterol. Think of it as "l," for lousy, building up on the walls of your artery, creating plaque, building up over time, narrowing the blood vessels. This narrowing in the blood vessels leading to your heart can cause chest pain, called angina. It can also cause a heart attack. Did you ever wonder how seemingly healthy people can have a heart attack? This may surprise you. Most heart attacks happen in people with no symptoms. In people whose arteries are less than 50% blocked. Here is how. Cholesterol can cause unstable bubbles or blisters of plaque to form in your aries and can be incredibly dangerous. Most of them are covered by a cap, but stress, and other dangers can cause that to rupture, blocking the flow to the heart. Robbed of oxygen, the heart muscle can't function properly. Heart attack. And therein lies the key, agatson says, we can now find clues before heart trouble gets dangerous, even before the first symptoms. 

[00:03:15]


>> One of the best kept secrets in the country in medicine is that doctors who are practicing aggressive prevention are really seeing heart attacks and strokes disappear from their practices. It is doable. 
>> And you're saying with what we know right now, we don't have to have anymore heart attacks in this country. 
>> I'll never say not any, but the great majority, yes, absolutely. 
>> It is the biggest killer of men and women, heart disease in this country? 
>> And it is stoppable. 
>> Your body makes cholesterol, in the lining of every cell in your body. The liver sends out ldl cholesterol, and when everything works right, the good, hdl, takes the ldl and brings it back to the liver. You also get cholestol in foods, things like meats, eggs, butter, ice cream. The cholesterol number is a good measure of what is in the blood. But here is the problem. It doesn't tell you if it is building up in the walls of your blood vessels, forming plaque, which causes heart attacks. 
>> If you look in the coronary care unit, the people who have heart attacks, the cholesterol levels of those who have heart attacks versus those of people in the street who have it, are essentially the same. 
>> That is surprising, you hear people exchanging numbers, if it is low, they're proud of it. High, a cause for concern, you say you're not looking in the right place. 
>> That is essentially useless. 
>> Here is what does matter, he says, the size of the ldl, or bad particles, larger particles don't pose much of a threat, because they pass through the blood vessels without sticking. It is the smaller particles that lodge in the vessels and cause a build-up of plaque. That is why the doctor likes the blood sample. He wants to find out if I have a lot of small ldl particles, a sign that I could be prone to building up plaque, no matter what the numbers are. You will hear about my test results in just a bit. But next, a controversial diet. This 66-year-old woman skipped surgery to try and eat her way to heart health. 

[00:05:33]


>> We'll never end the epidemic WITH STENTS AND BYPASSES. @ l???? ??xw x???? . 

[00:08:43]


>>> Sharon is sixty-six years old, a retired private investigator from canton, ohio. A year ago she had a heart attack after an artery became completely blocked. 
>> He said for someone who had what you have, the only warning you usually get is death. And at that point, I really knew how lucky I was. 
>> Reporter: Like a lot of women, she did not experience the classic chest pain, but rather fatigue, and a pain in her jaw. 
>> He said you're going to have to have open heart surgery. He said I can fix you today, just take you right down to or and operate on you right now. My son was in there, and he was ready to wheel me down to the operating room, because he was frantic. It is terrifying. 
>> Reporter: What she did next surprised you. She turned the surgeon down cold and said no to open heart surgery. 
>> I bought these parsnips the other day. 
>> Reporter: Using food as medicine. 
>> I love these. This is wonderful. 
>> Reporter: She is betting her life on a controversial diet. Created by dr. Caldwell esselton. 
>> We know what they shouldn't it. That is oil, dairy, meat, fish and chicken. What do we want them to eat? All of those whole grains, beans, vegetables, yellow, red, green and fruit. Now, what particular vegetables do we want them to have? Bok choi, mustard greens, arugula, asparagus, and I'm out of breath. 
>> You can imagine, the meat and dairy association thinks that is a terrible idea. 

[00:10:45]


>> Putting lean beef in a healthy diet can actually help you stick to a healthy diet, because it is a food you enjoy. 
>> Eggs are a source of vitamins and minerals. 
>> Dairy foods are nutrient-rich. 
>> He has no special degree in nutrition. But when it comes to food as medicine, he is a true believer. 
>> You know, sharon, doctors recommended she had an intervention, she is not doing it. Is there a down side? Could she put herself at risk? 
>> No, I think that is a great question. In data going back over 20 years and in this most recent study, once they start to eat this way, you will make yourself heart attack proof. We know that if people are eating this way they're not going to have arrest heart attack. 
>> His food-based prescription puts him squarely against conventional wisdom which says diet is only part of a heart-healthy life-style. 
>> If a doctor said heart disease is a food borne disease, if you follow this diet, in exchange you wouldn't have a heart attack, what would you say with that? Would you agree with it. 
>> I would say it is an over-statement of what we're really able to do. Though I know there are people that say it. 
>> I was curious about the science, so I dug up the peer review journals, they're small, just a handful. But impressive. But people on the cholesterol-lowering medication, and the diets had no heart incidents, and three quarters of the people saw their blockages get smaller. 
>> You're not talking about using the heart attacks, you're talking about reversing. 
>> The late wisdom is, that once you develop these plaques, they're there, you're stuck with them, try not to let them get worse, is that faulty thinking? 

[00:12:50]


>> I think it is absolutely faulty thinking. 
>> Reporter: Here is a picture, he shows the patient with the blocked artery, and here is that same patient after going on the plant-based diet. You see how that disappeared? A year after her heart attack, she feels great. Check out those moves. A year ago, simply walking was enough to wear her out. With the diet, there is one question you have to ask. Can she keep it up? I asked sharon to meet me here in new york city. You know, cooking at home is one thing, but eating on the road, eating on the run, well, that is quite another. As the old saying goes, if her diet can make it here, it can make it anywhere. 46th and broadway, please. Sharon, how are you? All right, so here is another restaurant. 
>> Okay. 
>> I'm going to take some advice from you. You look at a menu like this, tell me what comes to your mind. 
>> The majority on there, I'm not going to eat. 
>> So you just -- 
>> I can have the baby spinach leaves, minus the chicken, i could have the peaches, the strawberries, forget the walnuts. 
>> Is this a restaurant where you could eat a meal here? 
>> You bet I could. 
>> Do you think this will help you live longer? 
>> Well, I hope so I hope you get to see you retire. 
>> I have a feeling you will live a very long time, which i hope you do. 
>> I hope you do, too. You know what, if I don't live longer, I know I'm going to live more of a quality life. 
>>> Coming up, former president bill clinton opens up about his bad heart and his own brush with death. He tells me he is now a vegan. That is right, a vegan. way meeting... Anne's tablet called my phone. Anne's tablet was chatting with a tablet in sydney... A desktop in zurich... And a telepresence room in brazil. The secure cloud helped us get some numbers from my assistant's pc in new york. And before I reached the top, the board meeting became a congrats we sold the company party. Wait til my wife's phone hears about this.

[ Female Announcer ] WITH CISCO AT THE CENTER, Working together has never worked so well. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 

[00:18:14]


>>> a survey by the american heart association found that 40% of americans believe their hearts are had great shape. The number? Fewer than 1%. President clinton was an example, he passed all his physicals, but later, it took a triple bypass operation to save his life. 
>> I was lucky I didn't die of a heart attack. 
>> Former president clinton, like too many people, was busy. And for years he ignored warning signs from his heart. But in 2004, during an exhausting book tour, there was something different. 
>> I had a real tightness in my chest when I was getting off the aine. And it was the only time I had had it, unrelated to exercise. 
>> We're here outside the new york presbyterian hospital, where president bill clinton is scheduled to go through surgery. 
>> So I immediately went down to our local hospital. And they did a test. They said you have real problems. They hustled me down to columbia presbyterian, and they confirmed the determination that I had serious blockage and needed the surgeries. 
>> The doctors immediately knew, options were limited. The fifty-eight-year-old clinton needed to have his heart stopped and surgery performed. 
>> There was no procedure to reverse what was in his blood vessels. 
>> All I remember happening, everybody who cared about me was scared. And I felt rather serene. 
>> On labor day in 2004, mr. Clinton had four blood vessels bypassed. 
>> Starting this morning, at about 8:00, he had a relatively routine triple bypass operation. We left the operating room around noon and he is recovering normally. 

[00:20:16]


>> Well, it hurt like the devil for about three weeks. And it hurt so much that I had a hard time even watching movies, much less reading. And then when I started again to exercise, and I forced myself out, I mean like the first day. Tried to just walk a half block one way or the other, I was really trying to push myself into doing the therapy there was that period when you're just not sure you can come back. 
>> Did you confront your mortality? 
>> Oh, yeah, but I lived with it. I am -- you know, when I was in elementary school, I was fascinated by cemeteries. And I used to walk in the cemetery in the little town where I was born where my father and my grandparents are buried. Now my mother buried. And I used to go visit them and read the head stones and see when people were buried there, and when they lived and how long they lived. It was different for me. I was -- I grew up knowing that I couldn't live forever. I grew up knowing that people i loved would die, because my father died before I was born. So I never had the fear, the terror of my own mortality. 
>> How do you know that you're healthy now? First of all, would you call yourself healthy now?

>> Wow, that is a grand ambition, how much was that, will you tell us? 
>> Uh-huh, I weighed, I got down to 185. Now I got down -- when chelsea was married, I weighed about 192, which was when I weighed when I graduated high school. Anything under 192 was the optimal weight. I ran at the hottest time of the day, which I could do in order to make the pounds go off. It was the first time since i was thirteen years old, to weigh that much.

>> Putting this altogether, the imaging, the laboratory tests, what can you tell me? 
>> You're at low risk for a heart attack, even though there is family history. Clearly your life-style, the exercising, the diet, decreased your risk.

[??????...] 
>> I wanted to understand more about philosophy's exclusive 
formulation: Their miracle ingredient h.P.R. 
[??????...] so I came to memphis, tennessee, to meet the man who invented it. A Ph.D IN PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY, University professor emeritus in medicinal chemistry and recognized expert in the field of molecular modeling, dr. Bill purcell. ...Here we are. Hi. ...What is h.P.R. Exactly? 

[00:15:51]


>> H.P.R. Is a molecule that I invented that is different from the rest of the retinoids. I could see that the scaffold of a retinoid had great potential as an anti-aging agent, but i knew that part of the molecule was causing irritation. So I decided to tinker with the molecule. We removed the acid and put another group on there which made what we call an ester. We have held on to and maintained the good part-- which is that it works in anti-aging-- and then we have changed the molecule so it's not an acid anymore. 
>> What can h. P. R. Do for our skin? 
>> You will see results rather quickly with smoothing, the texture, the radiance, the youthfulness. It's really quite miraculous. 
>> Everything I've learned about philosophy's box of miracles has been amazing-- how easy it is to use, how well it works and how much women love it. Then I found out the price and that was the most amazing thing of all. 
>> Female announcer: How much would you expect to pay for your own 30-day supply of philosophy's box of miracles? 
>> What do I expect it to cost or what do I wish it would cost? 250, $300.

[camera shutter clicks] 
>> Female announcer: What if you could test philosophy's box of miracles for eight weeks? That's what these women did and here's what they said at the beginning of their eight-week challenge. 
>> My name is heather. 
>> Jennifer hammentree. 
>> Annie olsen. 
>> Man: What are you noticing? 
>> Oh, wrinkles around my eyes. 
>> The wrinkles around my eye and forehead. 
>> I hope that by the time I'm done, I've improved my self confidence with a little younger look and a little bit more on top of it to give an edge in the marketplace, trying to find a new job. 
>> What I hope is that I come out looking a little fresher and kind of a slightly better me. 
>> Female announcer: And here's what they saw just eight weeks later. 
>> Wow, that's really cool. 
>> No wonder people commented on my skin. It does look really good. My cheeks are really nicely evened out. Wow. 
>> Actually, I can even see a little difference... It's kind of a little bit everywhere. Fine lines, I think, diminished. I see a little bit in the forehead, so it's working. I won't stop. 
>> Wow, that's really cool. The brow lines are definitely less distinct. That's cool. I think it's great. I noticed a difference. I wasn't expecting to... Um... I win. [Chuckles] 

[00:20:45]


[??????...] 
>> Male announcer: Clinical studies demonstrate that philosophy's miraculous retinoid pads produce results. In a 12-week test of 46 women age 39 to 64, dermatologists observed that in just one week, the vast majority had smoother, more radiant skin. And the skin benefits continued to improve over time. At 12 weeks, 91% of participants had minimized the appearance of wrinkles. 96% showed significant improvement in the appearance of pores. 98% had reduced the appearance of fine lines and discoloration. And every single woman in the study presented smoother, more radiant skin. 
>> Kimberley: I heard about a renowned dermatologist in san antonio, texas, so I arranged to speak with dr. Vivian bucay. She's a board-certified dermatologist, published author and international speaker. 
[??????...] ...So, dr. Bucay, philosophy talks about dermatological gold standards. What does that mean to you as a dermatologist? 
>> A gold standard is simply something that works and has the science to back its claims. For me, that gold standard is going to be a retinoid and by that, I mean something in the class of vitamin a. 
>> What are the benefits of using a retinoid? 
>> The nice thing about a retinoid is that it can really speed up cell renewal so that your skin looks brighter, more even toned. It can also slow the breakdown of collagen. So it's a two-fold benefit. Retinoids unfortunately also turn on a signal for irritation. One of the exciting advances in retinoid research has been the development of something called h.P.R., A very gentle retinoid that has managed to separate efficacy from irritation, so you can have a potent, yet gentle product. 
>> Women absolutely love philosophy's anti-aging skin care system and they love to talk about how it's changed their lives. Let's eavesdrop. 
>> I started using miracle worker pads when my skin just wasn't as bright as it used to be. 
>> After spending money on so many other products and it not doing what they said it would do, finally this is something that worked. 

[00:22:48]


>> A minute or so in the morning, a minute at night and the difference in your skin is just unbelievable. 
>> In fact, my husband even says I am better looking. 
>> You just kind of walk around with this little inner smile. You sit there and maybe sometimes you walk by a window and you catch your reflection and you're like, "wow, I look pretty good." 
>> What is in the box of miracles exactly? 
>> Well, this is really an exciting collection. What you're getting is you're getting a cleanser, you're getting targeted treatment and you're getting a moisturizer. 
>> And they're formulated to be extremely effective, yet gentle for all skin t 
>> if you want skin so impeccably bright, brilliantly smooth and glowing-- 
>> yes, please. 
>> All those things, we can give you those things, where makeup becomes an option instead of a requirement. 
>> So talk us through the system if you will. 
>> Well, the first step: Purity made simple daily facial cleanser has a wonderful feel and texture. 
>> Annie: And what's amazing about this cleanser, it will get your skin completely clean and it feels lightly hydrated, so it's not dry or tight. 
>> It cleanses, it tones, it hydrates and it removes even the most stubborn makeup. Eye makeup as well as lipstick. And it does it all in one step. 
>> Miracle number one. 
>> Annie: So step two is our miracle worker miraculous anti-aging retinoid pads. This includes one of philosophy's most breakthrough ingredients ever-- h.P.R. Or high-performance retinoid. 
>> H.P.R. Is our next generation retinoid that gives you all the benefit of a retinol, but it does it with minimal irritation. It's our frevh pour technology that is so innovative and that is what allows the h.P.R. To be totally stable. And all you do is you just fresh pour the solution over the pads and it's ready to use. 
>> Annie: You just swipe it on your face at night and let the miracles happen. 
>> And you'll see results in as little as a week. 
>> Kimberley: Wow. And what else goes into this miraculous retinoid solution? 
>> It's infused with skin-loving vitamin c, vitam natural botanicals. 
So you get two great things: You get enhanced benefits as far as the anti-aging benefits, but you also get the soothing and the calming that your skin will really appreciate. 

[00:24:56]


>> There's one more step, step number three, which our miracle worker miraculous anti-aging moisturizer. This is no ordinary moisturizer. It guards against all signs of aging and it also helps to keep the moisture in the skin so it looks more plump and refreshed. 
>> Miracle number three. So we have the cleanser, the pads, the moisturizer. Three super-easy steps. 
>> Heidi: But really unlike any anti-aging skin care regimen out there. 
>> More like a box of miracles. 
>> More like a box of miracles. 
>> Female announcer: How much would you expect to pay for your own 30-day supply of philosophy's box of miracles?

[flashbulbs popping] 
>> Dance is about movement, and photography is about freezing a moment in time. Wow, beautiful. But ballet in particular, there are very definite lines to stay within. An arabesque can't be bent. The legs have to be straight. Good dance photography is special because movement continues in a still image. An essence of a human being comes forward. I started off as a dancer, and then I became a photographer. Has it been rosy all the time? Oh, no. Has it been easy? Far from it. But I have done what I've wanted to do, and I continue to to this day. I was born in englewood, and I grew up in maywood, new jersey. It was a magical setting for kids. My mother had big blue eyes and a killer sense of humor. And my father,hen we were little boys, very much involved in his career and in the military. But I looked up to him, and I wanted his affection. 
>> When we were owing up, we would dance all the time. We would do the twist if that was what was happening at the time. We were always dancing. 
>> On occasion, my mother would ask, "would you like to study dance?" And I would always give my father's answer: "Boys don't do that." I gave the answer my father wanted to hear. I didn't give the answer that I really wanted to give. I was 18 miles away from new york city, but I might as well have been on another planet, because there was no exposure to dance other than on television. The first time I saw real ballet was on the ed sullivan show. 
[applause] 
>> Now from the new york city ballet, jacques d'amboise with karel shimoff. And they're wonderful. Let's have a wonderful, wonderful welcome for them. 

[00:08:37]


>> And my mother would always scream from the den, when I was upstairdoing my homework, "they're on." And I'd go barreling down the stairs, and we'd watch them in awe and in silence and just, ow, look at them." And I thought, "those are divine creatures from outer space. They're not human. They can't be." I thought ballet was a world one was born into, like royalty. I had no idea that one could learn it. When I was in tenth grade, I auditioned for brigadoon, our high school play. And I not only made it as a dancer; they made me a solo dancer, and I was thrilled. And we did the original agnes de mille choreography. A person who worked directly with her came fromew yk to sta it on us, and he said, "steven, my goodness, you have these legs and feet and splits and extension. But you must study ballet as a foundation." So I went home, and I said, "mom, I'd like to study ballet now because"--and I told her the story. And she was very excited. She said, "of course." And my father was not so happy about it. 
>> My dad being an ex-military guy and kind of machismo kind of guy, it didn't set well with him. My father would have been more comfortable with steven excelling at football versus ballet, which he had no knowledge of. 
>> Our family, being second-generation greek, wanted so much to be american and to fit into the mold. And perhaps that's exactly where steven's father was coming from. 
>> I believe that in this country and our family and the world at the time when steven was looking to be a dancer that it was a bold move. It was a bold step. 
>> So I started taking ballet lessons in a little school in new jersey. And the first day I got there, there was a magazine with a picture of robert blankshine from the joffrey ballet leaping on the white house lawn in a giant split. And this answered so many questions for me, you know. This confirmed so many things. This said, number one, "there's a man in tights, and he's leaping, and it's got to be okay with the general public, because he's in front of the white house." And then I went in and took the class, and between the beautiful girls and the plies and the connection with the beautiful classical music, I knew that moment, "this is what I want to be. I want to be a ballet dancer." 

[00:11:05]


>> It's something that happens to very few individuals when you get a calling. No matter what, come hell or high water, you're going after it, and nothing's going to stop you. And that's what happened to my brother, I feel. 
>> So I took two classes a week for about four months. But during this period, there was a big change in my life at my high school. Being in a broadway show was cool for the high school kids. But being a formal ballet dancer was something I really wanted to keep to myself. But word got out, and I went from being the most popular or one of the most popular, funny guys in the school to a laughed-at, bullied, made-fun-of person. It was very rough, very rough for me to handle, to the point where I would go home every day after school, and I would just collapse. I said, "please, mom, don't make me go back to this high school. Please, I can't. Because I want to be a ballet dancer. I know it now. And I can't handle it." I was in a diner on the highway, and the waitress had this very balletic look to her. And I asked her if she was a dancer, and she said yes. And I said, "do you know of any great schools in new york?" She said, "the joffrey school is the best." I got up the nerve. I found out where they were downtown in new york city. I got on the bus on a saturday, since there was no school, and went in and walked up this stacase. It was very ominous, but I loved it. I knew where I was headed, I suppose. And I walked right into the office, and I said to the secretary, "i'm here to audition for a scholarship." So she asked me how many years I'd been studying, and I said four. It wasn't really a lie. I could have finished and said four months, but I just said "four," and I left "months" out. And she said, "you'll take the advanced class at 12:30." I went out, I got dressed, and I walked into the studio, and I was the first one there. And I sensed some great things had been happening in this room. I found myself a safe place at the bar. No one was there yet. I thought, "i want to be out of the way." And the dancers started to come in-- obvisly company members from the joffrey and other companies too and very advanced students. And then nureyev and fonteyn walked in the room. And then I knew, "i am in over my head." And the class began, and I ran around the room for an hour and a half, mimicking the dancers. It was basically a chase that I never kept up with. It was so difficult and embarrassing. So I walked back into the office, drenched with sweat. The secretary did not look up. All she said was... 

[00:14:12]


>> The teacher feels you have no talent. No talent. No talent. 
>> And I stood there absorbing that. But I was thinking "what's the alternative here? It's nonnegotiable. I am not going back to high school next year in new jersey." So I thought, and I thought, and then I said, "is there another class I can take?" And that's when she looked up at me. And she said... 
>> There's one at 4:00. 
>> So I went out, sat down, waited until 40, and went into that class. And that was a completely different experience. That class was intermediate level. That was taught by another man. So theecond time I walked into the office, she looked up again, and she said... 
>> This teacher feels you are very talented. Very talented. Very talented. 
>> He said, "we must give him a full scholarship." So I went home, I told my parents, and the training began. And it was intense training. These teachers were very, very serious. 
>> The studying was extremely focused on learning technique. And I think I took four and five classes a day. I mean, you had a technique class in the morning. Then you had a men's class and a partnering class and another technique class. 
>> There was strong discipline involved in your stance and your behavior in class. There was no talking. At one point, the pianist was playing so loud, the teacher barked a real big correction across the room at me, and I said, "excuse me?" And he said, "what?" And I said, "excuse me? I didn't hear you." He said, "get out." I mean, it was that serious. 
>> Boot camp. It was like boot camp. 
>> For instance, the jumps at the end of the class, I was gasping for air, and he would scream, "don't stop! Don't stop! Don't stop!" 

[00:16:14]


>> Constant practice. That was the thing that amazed me the most, the amount of hours and hours of hard practice. You can't do the normal things that the rest of us were doing. The prom and staying out and all the things that teenagers do, he wasn't gonna be able to do. 
>> My father was angry about this american dream gone wrong. Head no interest in my becoming a ballet dancer, especially early on. My father would not allow my mother to pick me up at the bus stop. And it was a mile and a half from the house, maybe further. So winter, spring, summer, fall, I had to walk home, and I had to walk to the bus. 
>> Steven was very sad when he would come home. There were times where he would come home from the city and he would be exhausted. And I remember being at the house and him dropping his bag at the front door, being very tired, and lou being very, very forceful with him: "Pick up your bag. You shouldn't be that tired. This is what you want to do." I do recall the tension. The tension was great. 
>> So I'm now studying one year and four months. I had seen a performance of the new york city ballet during that year. And I fell in ve with this company. I saw the most beautiful dancing. I thought, "my god, that's perfection." And I thought, "that's the company, in a perfect world, for me." Again, I got up my nerve, and I went to the school of american ballet, and I auditioned. And then they called me into the office afterwards, and they said, "well, steven, you are a little overweight, you're a little heavy, and you're old; you're 16. But you show great promise. So we'll give you a year. We'll keep you in intermediate men's, and if you improve significantly, we'll let you stay." At that point in my life, I knew nothing about george balanchine. 

[00:18:20]


>> When george balanchine came to america in 1934, there was no american ballet in any real sense. What ballet we had was an entirely foreign transplant. And people experienced it as that. It was a foreign novelty. It did not arise from or speak to the american experience. The unique aspect of balanchine, his great significance, is that even though he was an emigre artist, he came to the united states and embraced america in all of its aspect. He loved the speed, the pace, the angularity of american movement. And he was determined to lay the groundwork for a genuinely american style of ballet. He did that first by starting a school, the school of american ballet. Once he started to get the dancers he wanted to work with, he put together a series of companies. But they took shape in 1947, 1948, and then became new york city ballet. Second of all, he created a repertory of dances that expressed his ideas about american movement and american life. Without balanchine's having done these things, I daresay that ballet in america would still seem like a foreign transplant. Instead, now, half a century down the line, it feels like something that belongs to us, that comes out of us, and he did that. 
>> I started to learn a lot more about mr. Balanchine seconds after arriving at the school, because it was the only topic of conversation with all of the students. It was all about this great genius, this great choreographer, this great man. And the first time I saw him was when he would appear unannounced at the studio just to sort of spot-check the students and watch his teachers. 
>> All of us students were terrified when he'd walk in the door. He'd come in for a little while, watch, and then leave, because I think he had a very good eye and knew what he wanted. As he always said, "i know what I want to see on that stage." 

[00:20:27]


>> Maybe a year or so later, if we were working on a piece of choreography, and he would be hands-on with us and show me how to hold a girl and put her over her leg. My heart was pounding with him within reach of me and looking at me and speaking to me. It was thrilling. It was thrilling. 
>> You know, I always felt he was a father figure for me. He was like the father that I never had. One time, I was very young, my first years, and I was walking home in the snow, and I didn't have boots on. So he picked me up-- took my bag, picked me up, and carried me over the snow and the slushy streets, the snow-covered streets. You know, we were his children. We were his family. 
>> We adored him. We loved him. We worshipped him. But it was not blind worship. It was really out of true recognition of how-- how great he was. 
>> Balanchine was ballet, and we were balanchine dancers. 
>> Over the two years that I was at s.A.B., I was completely determined that this is what I had to do and had to be. And at one point in the spring of 1969, after class, I was changing in the boys' dressing room, and we heard the phone ring. 
[phone rings] And the door opened, and the secretary said, "a phone call for steven caras." And I turned to the boys, and I said, "it's mr. B. I got in the company." And everybody laughed. And I got to the phone, and it was betty cage, the company manager of city ballet, and she said, "mr. Balanchine would like to invite you to join his company, and if you are interested, please come in on monday and sign a contract." I couldn't believe it. I started screaming. And all the kids came out of the dressing room: "What's happening?" "I got in the company. I got in the company." 
>> Steven had a meteoric rise, which I believe the family just was astonished by. 
>> When he was accepted, I just thought, "this is very big. How many people ever can get this opportunity, no matter how good they are?" 

[00:22:31]


>> He had what mr. Balanchine wanted, which was the energy, the attack, strong technique. Balanchine wanted dancers who were interesting to look at, somebody you wanted to watch. And that was steven. 
>> I'll never forget how nervous I was the first day I was to take company class with city ballet. It was tuesday, the day after I signed the contract. I went into the state theater, I went up to the main rehearsal hall, and there I was amongst those dancers that I loved so much; for two years, I was watching from the audience. I found myself a place at the bar in the very back of the room, and mr. Balanchine walked in. He clapped his hands once, and the plies began. And then he gave a very quick tendu st, bum, bum, bum, bum, and then a very quick tendu jete step off the ground, off the ground, off the ground. The end of the bar, when everyone walks to the center, I stayed in the very, very, very back of the group just to get as tiny and as invisible as I could. But mr. Balanchine walked through the class. The waves parted. I thought, "oh, no, he can't be coming to me. I--he can't." He grabbed me, he took me by the shoulders, he walked me to the front of the room, he turned me around to face everybody, and he said, "this is our new greek boy. We will make him strong." And they all applauded. And I thought, "my goodness, he is a king, and he's a daddy. He's both." With only three years of training, how in the world could I keep up with the best dancers in the world? My first performance was maybe two days after I joined the company. The first ballet that I was in was the first ballet that I saw, a midsummer night's dream. And of all things to be in, it's the wedding march. And I thought, "how perfect. I'm marrying this company and this world that I love so much." But they taught it to me very quickly, and within a day or two, I was onstage performing that. It's the simplest dance a corps member can do. It is so easy. It is intermediate easy. But I was petrified. One of the most beautiful girls in the company, linda merrill, was my first partner. 

[00:24:58]


>> And here is this absolutely gorgeous man with a beautiful physique, beautiful legs, beautiful feet, incredible partner, and he's dancing with me, and we're going for it. And I squeeze his hand to say, like, "honey, we're going for it." 
>> There's a big pop noise, like a... 
[clicks tongue] And then the curtain goes flying up, and you hear... 
[makes buzzing noise] And then you see all these lights that look like diamonds, and a big cold rush of air-conditioned air hits you in the face. And there's this huge orchestra at your feet that was gigantic in sound and overpowering. And suddenly I felt so tiny and insignificant. But linda had looked at me right before the curtain went up, and that was just what I needed to hold me through this. 
>> I remember being in the audience and seeing steve onstage at lincoln center and crying... 
[chuckles] Because I was so proud and just amazed at what he could do. 
>> We t out of our seats. And, you know, we were applauding and thinking, "am I supposed to say 'bravo'? I think we're supposed to say that, so let's say it too." And the whole family said, "bravo! Bravo!" 
>> The actual time that my father admitted to steven how proud he was of him was many, many, many years after this particular evening at the new york state theater. 
>> I think, ultimately, he did understand. I think, ultimately, lou came to the realization that this was his son and that he did love him. But I believe much damage was done long before that. I think there's lasting damage, that loss of early love can never be replaced. 
>> When I joined the company, there was a great sense of formal protocol. Balanchine's leadership flavored t entire atmosphere. You dressed appropriately if you were backstage. You dressed appropriately when we flew to another country or another city. 

[00:27:09]


>> We were like the argonauts on a boat and all sharing this new york city ballet at a creative time. I mean, balanchine would do four, five ballets a season. Robbins would lead two or three. It was an amazing, fecund time of rich-seeded life and fabulous dancers and balanchine every day, every day there, and classes and every night in the wings, watching, watching. 
>> When you went into class with mr. Balanchine, you never really knew what to expect. 
>> The bar was the fastest thing I'd ever experienced. It was, like, 20 minutes, and it was like this, fast, fast, fast, fast. Then we went to center, and he gave combinations for the girls. And I remember standing at the bar waiting for the boys' step for about what seemed like 20 minutes, and then all of a sudden, one of them went, "hello, mr. B., We are"-- and he went, "ah, boys. Ah, girls, go away. Boys, co on." And then he gave us a step. And double tour to a calm plie, that was the first step. Stone cold at that point. And then, of course, towards the end of my life with him, I wouldn't want to miss one of his classes, because I ended up thinking they were the best classes ever. 
>> Or sometimes you could see a bit of the choreography he was gonna put in the next ballet. 
>> Let's say, one day, he s gonna oreograph a variation and it had a lot of footwork. So one day, he'd be working on that in class. One day, he'd be working on some kind of special turns, one-time jumps, a lot of ports de bras. 
>> He told many stories. He often talked about cooking. I remember one time, he said, "you really need to read the gulag archipelago." 
[laughing] AND I SAID-- I said, "what? I need to read what?" "No, no, no, you must read solzhenitsyn." And I said, "i do?" He spoke every day about art and literature and philosophy and things that mattered. Our class in the morning was as much a lesson in how he wanted us to look onstage as much as how he wanted us to behave and to be. 

[00:29:34]


>> I think that audience members that see ballet have a misconception that there is no pain and it's lovely and it's pretty and it's not difficult and it's effortless, and it's so not the case. What you see from the audience and what we're feeling are very often two very different things. 
>> When you're a dancer, you usually take class in the morning, you rehearse during the day, and then you perform at night. And you get tired. 
>> You might not know it, you might not even acknowledge it, but the physical rigors of, you know, basically seven days a week, all day long, rehearsals, classes, performance, it does take its toll. 
>> I have had probably a file that thick at the doctor's office. 
>> I've torn my achilles. I've had both hips replaced. 
>> Actually, my back just last year, I have three bulging discs. 
>> Knee injury, torn hamstring. 
>> I have a daily routine after work of putting my ankles in ice buckets. 
>> My knee was basically going out, and I had to take painkillers and get out there and dance with that. 
>> My back, my neck, my hands. 
>> I tore my acl. 
>> I was in a demi-solo in a ballet called theme and variations. And I landed on one leg and fell to the floor. It completely affected my dancing for the rest of my dancing career. It was a turning point in the wrong direction. You know, it's one thing to become a member of a ballet company. It's another thing to last physically. But yet it's another thing entirely to make it emotionally and deal with, "not young enough, not thin enough, not tall enough, not high enough, not whatever enough." And that's what ballet is, and that's just physically. But what that takes on you emotionally is something else entirely. 

[00:31:38]


>> Everything that is being told to you is basically, "you're doing it wrong." So it takes a lot of courage to stand up there and accept that and say, "you're right. I'm doing it wrong, and I have to fix it, and it's my job." 
>> It's a very exacting profession. You know, it is about being perfect. It's about turning your human body into something that is perfectly beautiful and to--executing movements that are impossible perfectly. 
>> There's no such thing as the perfect dancer. And you are striving to be this. 
>> And there's a tremendous cost to that. You really don't value just yourself or who you are or how you feel or maybe even your humanity. But that is a cost you pay. And I would say that for some people, it's worth the cost. It was for me. 
>> It does get scary from time to time. There were a couple of ballets that I still remember, when i hear the music now, my stomach sort of goes in circles and knots. 
>> As you're standing in the wings and the music is coming, your entrance is coming, are your toe shoes in place? And the ribbons there, is your hair in place? But that's part of the excitement is overcoming that fear and trying to meet that challenge. 
>> It takes tremendous courage to be a dancer. It takes tremendous intestinal fortitude to go thro the demands of that career. You are at every minute exposing your true self-- I'm gonna get emotional here-- to vast numbers of people who don't know you and only want you to fail. You've got to be able to step up, pick yourself up off the floor when you've fallen down, and keep going. It's a frightening thing to have to do. It's a frightening thing to have to dance. 
>> After about six years of dancing with city ballet, I was really blown out. the end of my rope. I was in the corps de ballet, but we danced eight performances a week, and I was in three and sometimes four ballets a night. And I went to mr the company." And he said, "don't quit. Take a leave of absence. Get a job as a waiter somewhere. Tell us where it is. We'll give you great tips. And then if you'd like to come back you've left the door open." So that's what I did. I took a leave of absence. So I took class every day. I stayed in very good shape. And about eight or nine months later, I received a call from lincoln kirstein asking me to come back to the ballet. He said, "stevie, the parade passes you by very quickly. Make the decision. Don't take too much time to make the decision." So within 24 hours, I said, "i'm back. I'm back." I went back because it was all I knew, all I knew. Ballet was my love, ismy love. It always has been. Well, when I came back to the company, I was back in some ballets that I had been in before. 

[00:34:55]


[dramatic orchestral music] ?????? ?????? but then some wonderful things took place too. Mr. Balanchine gave me a gift of the first theme in the four temperaments, which was sublime and a beautiful part. 
[dramatic orchestral music] ?????? ?????? my favorite role in the entire repertory was donizetti variations. And there are three boys in it. And when I did come back, I noticed that nine guys were called to learn those three roles, and I wasn't one of them. But when I found out his reason, it was a giant turning point in my life for me. Mr. Balanchine said, "oh, well, dear, you know, you've danced the part enough. Let's let others get a chance to do it. I want to see new faces." And that was a killer comment for me to hear, because i thought, "at 26, if I'm an old face, this means there's a time limit on my time in this company and as a dancer." And time is also the most expensive element in a world like ballet. 
>> Dancers have hard lives because they stop in the middle. And once they stop, they have to find a solution for the rest of their lives. And sometimes they do, and sometimes they don't. 
>> You can't dance all your life, unfortunately.T!T! Mr. Balanchine allowed no one to come in from any of the publications or any of the media to photograph the company. He knew it should be someone that thoroughly understood ballet. So when I asked mr. Balanchine if I could photograph, he welcomed me into it and gave me privileged access, truly, to this private world. And I started playing with black-and-white film and photographing dancers from the wings and performance. I photographed them in rehearsal. I photographed them warming up. So I felt I had a potential purpose again. 

[00:55:38]


>> And he was always around, always around with the camera, always. It was like, "stop it." But there he was. And, you know, he was obviously very good at it, and he had a gift. 
>> The dancers liked my pictures because they knew a family member was recording them and they knew that I knew how they wanted to look. So they enjoyed seeing themselves from a dancer's perspective and knowing them so personally as people but also as artists. 
>> You always felt confident with steve photographing you, because he knew. He knew what the position should look like, and he always wanted the best for each person he was photographing. 
>> He knew what everybody would like, because he knew what the picture was supposed to be, not just the pose but the energy and the spirit in the picture. 
>> Steve knew the choreography, the moment. It was just natural. We felt naturally at ease with steve's presence, which is very important. 
>> Well, he was always joyous about it. It was--it was something joyous for him to take the photos. 
>> Martha swope, who was the reigning photographer of the company, she taught me how to develop a roll of film and how to make a print, and in turn, I cleaned her studio for her, and I walked her dog topo. 
[dog barks] Some of the first shots I remember printing myself in my own darkroom were of bart cook in square dance-- beautiful jump-- and a picture I loved of mr. Balanchine I took backstage in saratoga springs. It was in his typical western shirt, and he was thinking about something. 
>> But we all endorsed it, and we all loved him, and we all knew that he discovered a talent, you know, another talent. And dance is not forever, as we all know, so this was something that we all agreed to allow him to be around everywhere. 

[00:57:49]


>> Not long after I bought my first camera, we were filming ballets for pbs. And I asked mr. Balanchine before we took that trip, I said, "mr. B., Can I bring my camera and take some pictures?" And he said, "yes, as long as you're quiet and you stay out of the way." So I was thrilled. So in the ballets that I wasn't dancing in, I was photographing. So I was in the balcony, and I was in little nooks and crannies. And I took a bunch of pictures. A couple weeks went by. We're back in new york, and mr. B. Asked if I would bring my contact sheets to his office the next day. And I said to him, "well, they're not very good. They're out of focus, and some are overexposed, and some are underexposed. Do you really want to see them?" And he said, "yes, dear, please bring them in." So I brought them in the next day, and I sat with him in his office. And he started to point at them. "I need 5 of this one, 10 of this one, 30 of this one." And when I heard mr. Balanchine say, "i need this picture, I need this picture," I realized I had an excuse to belong to the world that I loved for the rest of my life. And that's the day I knew I was a photographer. 
>> The next thing is, steve has become a company photographer, taking terrific pictures. 
>> He had the advantage of being a fantastic dance photographer because he was a dancer himself. So he knew exactly from what angle to take the picture. He knew exactly when to snap. But obviously there was a gift there too. And so his pictures always ended up being superior to any other picture. 
>> Iyou're somebody who has been inside these dances, who hasn't just watched them but who has executed them, then you know something that goes much deeper about their flow, about their structure. You really know not just where to point the camera and what's going to happen, but you have an instinctive sense of what moment you should try to capture. 

[00:59:55]


>> When somebody's moving, it's very hard to catch it at the right moment. He knows the right moment. He always did. So he was a fellow dancer who had a very great eye. 
>> A great photograph lets the subject of the photograph live. And you see that in steve caras' work. The lushness and sensuality his photographs draw us in as viewers, allowing us to be in that exact moment. 
>> When you look at old, old photographs of nijinsky, for example, even though they give you some sense of what he must ve been like, they feel static. The shutter speeds were slow. There was no possibility of shooting in a performance setting. When you see a photograph like this, it is as though you've just looked up from your program and suddenly this mome is there before you. 
>> You feel the performance in hishotographs. You take one look at a steve caras photograph, and you know what it is to dance. 
>> Part of it is because he knows them. Then he has this opportunity to really get to the soul. 
>> When dancers are photographed, the passion comes through, and you feel their life. You feel their breath. You feel why they are so passionate about what they do. And it's contagious. 
>> We gain an excitement from looking at photograph of dance, because we are constantly brought back to this feeling of excellence. 
>> It takes us to where beauty, grace, agility all come together. Looking at photographs of dance brings us to another place. 
>> Within steve caras' archive, we are embrang many technological advances. We see his very early work in black-and-white, done under available lighting. He then moves to studio work in color. And he is now working in digital format. But his early work is on film, which is very important for a research archive. What photographers normally retain with their digital files is only their best images. With film, you have complete sequences. You see process. You see progress. We see sketchbooks within film that we will miss in the digital age. One of the most important components of steve caras' archive is that we can follow the career of certain dancers, such as baryshnikov. Early on, we see him in 1979 and 1980 under balanchine's influence dancing apollo as a young man. Later on, we see him in his dance a cloud in trousers. We see a much more mature baryshnikov, brilliant in his stance and in his definitive movements. In steve caras' photograph of suzanne farrell in vienna waltzesin 1979, we see a dancer at the peak of her performance. She is elegant. She is elongated. The sweep of her gown is stunning. But in this photograph, we have a record of this very moment for posterity. 

[01:02:59]


>> He's very interested in those transitional areas, the wings, the studios, the hallways, between the stage and preparation for the stage. 
>> That is the ultimate privileged view, the thing that we never get to see out front. 
>> You're putting your toe shoes on. You're getting yourself ready. You're doing the makeup. So your appreciation may be of the dance, the leaps, and everything that's going on on the stage, but he wants everyone to appreciate what happened to get them to the stage as well. I like that. One of my favorite shots is of gelsey kirkland in an a.B.T. Class. The potential revealed in that photograph is enormous. It hearkens to what will come in her future. Some of the most important photographs in sve caras' archive are of george balanchine interacting with the dancers. When he is showing them a gesture, when he is showing them a move, you can hear him speaking. And it's a reflective moment that he captures when suzanne farrell is portrayed in the wings. 
>> And when you see a photograph like this, you think you know the person in it because some part of their essence is coming through the image. 
>> Steve caras' career spanned it all. He was there. He did it. It's on film. It's in prints. It's a cultural legacy that will be available for generations to come. 
>> IN THE EARLY '80s, Mr. Balanchine was there, but we all knew that he was feeling under the weather. And no one discussed it much, but still there was an air of concern for mr. B. 
>> But I know that as he grew more ill, he was there less and less. And at first, it was very difficult for everyone, because they remembered him being there all the time. 
>> We sort of knew that it was getting towards the end. When mr. Balanchine's health started to fail, it was devastating. And to see somebody start to disintegrate like that was--it was heartbreaking. 

[01:05:15]


>> Well, they were devastated. They were in despair, because the company was george balanchine. And for many people, dance was george balanchine. 
>> The last night of our spring season in 1982 was july 4th. Traditionally, mr. Balanchine would bow once a year and at everyone's encouragement. I wasn't dancing that night, so I was out front with my camera, and I took the closest seat to the edge of the stage on what would be audience right, or stage left. Well, the ballet was beautiful, and at the very end, the crew normally turned the stage lights down. It would be very black in the stage, and mr. B. Would appear in front of the audience. But for some reason, they left all of the stage lights on, and it was extremely bright. 
>> And there are several of us dancers offstage applauding him. He's holding the curtain, and it looks like he's pulling it back, but he was actually holding on because his balance was so bad that he was very frail. And bouquets were being thrown to him, and the house jumped to its feet and was screaming. It was a cheer the likes of which I hadn't ever heard. It was like a rock concert. 
[cheers and applause] 
>> But I was staggered when I saw this photograph. I thought, this must be, in a way, the perfect photograph. It is the right man at the right moment pointing the camera in the right direction and telling the entire story of the moment through the image. 
>> This photo is probably-- it's gonna become the most famous photograph ever in the world of dance. 
>> I happened to be in the right place at the right time and take this photograph. I'm so glad I was there, because it's my favorite picture, and no one's dancing in it. 
>> Everyone knew that it was a matter of time and especially when he went to the hospital. 

[01:07:20]


>> Mind you, I'd been going to the hospital. I said, "oh, mr. B., how am I ever gonna be there without you?" And he said to me, "you must listen to peter now, because I can't do for you anymore, dear." 
>> Barbara hogan, balanchine's longtime secretary, called me, and she said to me that he's gone. And I said, "oh, my god." And she said, "why don't you come to the theater in a couple of hours?" And so a number of us met at the theater at, like, 6:00 in the morning. The big question was, should we do the matinee? And somebody asked me, "what do you think?" And I said, "i think we have to dance. That's what he would have wanted. We have to go out and dance, and we have to do our best." 
>> Everything we on. Everything went on, because we felt, we all felt that that's what mr. Balanchine would want. 
>> And then the ceremony with hundreds of people packed in a very hot church. It was one of the most memorable and touching experiences of my life. 
>> Every time we lose a being, the world changes. But to lose a being who raised you like he did with steven and many of us-- he raised us. You know, we were all his people. 
>> I was born as an artist. I was confirmed as a dancer, what I wanted to be the day I saw that picture at that ballet school in new jersey. I said, "i will be a ballet dancer." Mr. B. Made that happen for me. He taught us dignity, respect, protocol, manners, humor, music. He was everything to anyone who was a part of that world in my time. To me, personally, he saved me from drowning. When I left the company, it was because mr. Balanchine had passed away. And now I'm being hired by major publications and other dance companies. 

[01:09:29]


>> It's very hard for a dancer to do a photo shoot. You get very stiff, because, you know, you have to hold the poses. But with steven, it was just moving and fun, and we laughed. It was like dancing. And that, for a dancer, is mical. And I just crack up, smile, and he took the picture. And that's the one that they chose for the cover of dance magazine, to my surprise. 
[chuckles] 
>> He has impeccable timing. He knows the height of your battement. He knows the height of the position. In the studio and in performance, it's unbelievable what he can capture because of his sense of timing. 
>> And, I mean, that is a split second. It's a pose that's hit for a second or two, and then it moves on. But, I mean, the lighting and everything, the way he was able to capture it, was, yeah, spectacular. 
>> He did photo shoots out on the beach, you know, on a seawall. And I think he also trusts that if you have something to offer, he will take that in and respond to it so that you're working together as part of the process. 
>> When I met steven, you know, I knew his strength was ballet. And I helped encourage him to look beyond that. He started expanding his horizons a little bit. He was able to see what, you know, other choreographers were able to do in the modern genre, the contemporary genre. 
>> It's very hard for photographers to grab images of streb. What streb's subject actually is, is action and the implementation of action, the demonstration of action, and the presentation theatrically of action. Steven was all over the place. I think he got inside of the work that we were doing. I was in rapture, number one, when I saw the photographs that steven had taken, and not only that. I wanted them. 
>> That was probably one of my most favorite photo shoots that I've ever done. I love these pictures because he captured an essence of who I am not only as a mover but as a dreamer. His work is just extraordinary, and it stands apart. 

[01:11:39]


>> If lou was here, I'd say, "well, dad, look at your son. Look at your son." 
>> In my sphere, I would call steve a renaissance man. He knows music, he knows ballet, and he's a photographer. He's a speaker. He's a motivator. You know, his classes are incredible. 
>> I think he's among the best because he was a professional dancer. And that gave him the upper hand over everybody else. 
>> The dance world is lucky to have steve in it. 
>> I believe he's the greatest dance photographer that has ever lived. 
>> This will be, as he continues to photograph, one of the most extraordinary dance archives of the 20 and into the 21st century. 
>> If I could, I'd just walk through a world of steve caras' photographs every day.

=======================================================

>> John: A it's a big space where anyone can come. Everyone shares it. 
>> It feels good just like this children song make you good about sharing. 
>> Sharing, sharing it can be fun. 
>> John: When I asked, what is better, public or private? Most people said. 
>> I would say public. 
>> If it was private they would charge you a fee. 
>> John: Wait, is that true. Is supermarkets are private so are churches but mother are more accessible than say public schools. Also, public sometimes this is very nice. 
>> What comes to mind when you hear the words public toilet. 
>> This is the image of public toilets. In my town public parks including this one used to look gross. Garbage and graffiti. 
>> Sharing is not necessarily caring. Sharing can mean neglect but then why is this park so nice because it's under new management. Private management. 
>> It goes against what people expect. 
>> This is privately managed park? 
>> Really. I did notice last week. 
>> John: Even the toilets are better. 
>> They clean them very nicely. 
>> When you own something you take care of it. When no one owns it, nobody takes care of it. Nobody watches a rental. 
>> People destroy other property like the rain forest. Settlers killed nearly almost all of the buffalo. Now, we are overfishing the ocean. 

[00:02:02]


>> When nobody owns it nobody takes care it. It's the tragedy of the commons. That is our show tonight. 
>> Hands now john stossel. 
>> John: We like the idea of sharing, communal property but it does lead to one economists call the tragedy of the commons because nasty things happen when everybody owns something. I first heard that phrase and a story about some shepherds who live around a grassy area they call the commons. Of the shepherds shared this free green grass and they grab as much as possible. Captain breeding sheep. Many more to raise. Soon all the grass was gone. The sheep died. The shepherd said nothing. So then they debt divided it into parcels. Now each one owned one. Each had an incentive to limit the number that grazed on his grass. Prosperity happened. Everyone lives happily ever after. Okay. Is not quite that simple, but we should think about this today on thanksgiving. This week school children were taught, it's a day of sharing. Pilgrims and indians shared the fruits of the harvest, but that misses the point. Most of their teachers don't even know. Thanks to sharing the programs almost starved. George mason university economist brush roberts as the real thanksgiving story. What's the real story? 
>> An important lesson we learn from the programs which was when they first came to this country they thought it would be nice to share. Communal property, a big area that they farmed. 
John: The corporation actually ordered them. 
>> Work on this together and then we will divvy it up equally well, it was pretty harsh. It was cold. A lot of them got sick. They didn't grow much food for two reasons. One was that everybody is working together there is a tendency to shirk. Let the other guy do it. I still get my share. Similarly, when stuff grew and the harvest came some people poked. They picked the fruit, corn in this case. Depicted early thinking of get a whole year if a ticket and keep it. Otherwise and sharing it with everybody else. 

[00:04:29]


>> Get a bigger share overall as a result. Their productivity in that first year was atrocious. Governor bradford realize this immediately after a so what happened that the incentives or wrong. 
John: Wrote in his diary. What must they do so they might not languish thus in misery? 
>> What he did was imposed the right kind of incentives on the system. If you produce it you get to keep it. The essence of capitalism. You work hard, produce something. It's yours. If you irt and a lazy you don't give much. 
>> Said corn. Every man for his own particular. And so assign every family a parcel of land. This simple change took them from near starvation two and f plenty test in a fight the indians in and say let's share. 
>> I don't think there were celebrating banks giving because they realize that capitalism works and communal property is a failure. There just happy to be alive. I sure they share with the indians because they're good people to get along with. The real lesson is, what is the role of incentives? And private property as opposed to communal property the incentives for artwork and storage of to take care of the land and use it productively of there. Communal property is very weak. 
John: Morning your own stuff makes you work harder to take care of it. It's not really a surprise. 
>> The incentives are there to protect it. 
John: It just sounds wrong to people. It has this instinct to say that is selfish. We want equality. We want government to take care of the important things. 
>> There is a place where communal property works pretty well, and that's my family and yours. In a family situation because we all know each other, it's much harder to get away with it. We like each other. And so I don't mind working for the other person if it's somebody of loving care about. My wife and I don't have a problem. In general home life is communal. People interact with each other constantly. We are going to have social norms and conventions and all kinds of ways to make sure people the right thing. Get into a larger setting. That is where communal property struggles and fails. A great economist understood we have this natural urge to take the socialism of the family and expanded out to the society. What could be better? Let's take this love and make it wir, but we are not build the weight. We tend to spread it water and take advantage of each other. It leads to tyranny. 

[00:07:11]


John: Let's look at the rain forest. We keep hearing, they are destroying the rainforest. 
>> They ar public property if you let a tree grow larger tonight it should be, if it's on your land you capture that benefit for yourself in the form of more would. If you're in a public land or you can't control who will come after you, you can't incident. It's not yours to claman take care of. The next person that comes in cuts down the tree they decided to bypass and capture it. Everyone has that incentive, and as a result the rain forest its butchered. 
John: In america people own sections a forest. The government house forest. There are more forest fires in the government-owned forest and privately-owned forests. People have more incentive to take care of their would. 
>> Plant more and to not cut it down early. That is the biggest problem. We see it with the pilgrims. They pick the corner early. Fishing. Keep the small fish rather than throwing it back if it's not your pond. It's a notion you throw it back. Someone else will get it. Keep it. If it's yours, let it grow to the size that it should. It is publicly owned, you worry about the other pochard coming in and taking a. 
John: I understand how private ownership would work in some and land area, but I can't see how you do with the ocean. 
>> A couple issues. Migrating fish, you can't really on the property. You can on the fish, have a certain tagged fish with electronic surveillance and other technologies, but the way they solve the problem with notions as the tuna. They build these enormous bins. It's a fish farm in the ocean. Saltwater. They are case then. It's a big case. They get that natural exercise. It makes the face healthier and tastier and that is one where the technology is helping convert a public area into something private with the appropriate incentives. 

[00:09:13]


John: You say traffic would g faster if we had a private. 
>> It comes from the fact that there is no incentive for the owner of the road, which is all of us, but the owner of the road has no incentive to maximize productivity. As a result we get stuck in traffic and complain. 
John: Finally, animals, endangered animals. What should we do about that? Bear in mind we are on thanksgiving, no turkey shortage 
>> an amazing thing. Some animals are scarce and some animals are plentiful. We worry about animals going extinct, endangered species. Here's the puzzle. If you want to save an animal which encourage people to edith? You would think -- 
john: Donated. 
>> But if you can make a prfit from eating it, that creates the incentive, and if you can prioritize the ownership that creates an incentive to take care of it and grow. As a result there is plenty of turkey, but you chicken, and other animals are scarce because there is no incentive, unfortunately to take care of them. 
John: Both humans and hot seat taken, but the more hawks the fewer chickens, the more seamen's the more chickens. 
>> That was an inside of henry george, early economist. He understood that this nature, more hawks, they eat the chickens. Come deplete the population. If we get numerous more chickens . That is the power of incentives. 
John: Breed chickens. Make sure we have plenty. 
>> Uprighted to be made from growing demand taking care of them and making unhealthy and beating them. If we made it illegal to sell seconds we would be in trouble. 
John: Profit saves things. Thank you. George mason university. Coming up, these animals are endangered. Was the best way to save them? Kill them. That's right. Kill them. me, you know it can be hard to breathe, and how that feels. Copd includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Spiriva helps control my copd symptoms by keeping my airways open for 24 hours. Plus, it reduces copd flare-ups. Spiriva is the only once-daily inhaled copd maintenance treatment that does both. Spiriva handihaler tiotropium bromide inhalation powder does not replace fast-acting inhalers for sudden symptoms. Tell your doctor if you have kidney problems, glaucoma, trouble urinating, or an enlarged prostate. These may worsen with spiriva. Discuss all medicines you take, even eye drops. Stop taking spiriva and seek immediate medical help if your breathing suddenly worsens, your throat or tongue swells, you get hives, vision changes or eye pain, or problems passing urine. Other side effects include dry mouth and constipation. Nothing can reverse copd spiriva helps me breathe better.

john: Look at the buffalo roam. Bison are a great example of tragedy. 30 million of them once roamed in america. That's because no one knows them or rather everyone knows them. Indians and the white settlers kept haunting them until there were nearly extinct. The buffalo herd went from 30 million to 1,000. Now they have made a comeback, because now people own them. Here to help explain what happened. What happens? 

[00:14:25]


>> Well, property rights were established over the very few remaining by some of left. When they got down to about 1,000 there were some cattle ranchers have roger been a real enough to figure out that the bison were worth more alive than dead at that point. So they went out to the great plains and gathered the remnants of what was left, 10-15 bison and grew them into the herds that today have made -- led to the comeback. 
John: They protected them for their own profit. 
>> They found a way to make them pay. The market, for them, was me. They sold bison to circuses, zoos, and public preserves. 
John: Before that when there werr 30 million, at first there were not enough indians to kill them. They were doing okay. The white settlers could not really get to kill enough to endanger them. 
>> You had a commons without access. Right after the civil war, of a sudden you could give hunters into the plains and you could get the bison back to the markets in the east and overseas. That is when the real tragedy occurred. 
John: Some people shut them from the transfer of sport. 110 waste. There were not even collecting the bison. Just remember fun. 
>> The same concepts have been used to save elephants and zimbabwe. But essentially has been done is they provided an ownership interest of villagers, and that is helping to save them. Prior to that you had to milan's . 
John: The government saying don't kill the elephants. 
>> Don't kill the elephants. Villagers are growing crops, but livestock, aquino land and the elephants were coming through in destroying those crops and other wildlife was running out there while stock. The villagers did not have any interest. 

[00:16:25]


>> Villagers were allowed to start getting proceeds from trough the hunts and from safari tourism that came through. All of a sudden the wild life became an asset. They hired their own game wardens. Wildlife had -- habitat doubled. Because now it was a benefit. As a result the elephant population also doubled over 13 years. 
John: Why you know about this? You are with -- 
>> property in environ research center. 
John: Based in bozeman, montana. You folks city areas where private property can help protect animals. 
>> We believe that ownership provides the best incentives for conservation. 
John: Most of the buffalo are owned by private ranchers, but there are still some in state parks or one state park. One has a roundup. 
>> And they are actually treating their bison most like private ranchers are, making them pay. What they do is once a year for 45 years they have this huge round with a bring in their 1500 bison. Tourists come from all over the world among pay money to watch these bison get heard it, and all wild west fashion with cowboys and cowgirls, and the bison come sweeping down the planes. The earth shakes. They did move in the corrals, and we all go eat bison murders after words. The point is, the park is making money from the tourism. Then about a month later they auction off a portion to private ranchers and they're also making money now wait. All that money goes back into custer state park to pay for operations of the park. So they're paying their own way. 
John: More benefit from profit. Coming of, how government made the indians poor and how private property made america rich. ] again. Time for cii price rewind.

john: Have you ever been to an indian reservation in temecula release sought serious poverty and alcoholism and drug abuse. Something about indians that makes them lazy or irresponsible . When india's own their own land they do about as well as other americans. 
>> Nobody chooses poverty. We have been legislated by the federal government's both in the united states and canada. 
John: They have been taking care of you. That sounds like the best deal. 
>> Well, by taking care of us that means providing social welfare programs. The only way to break the cycle of poverty, I believe, is by the recognition that every other canadian and american takes for granted, real property rights. 
John: In canada reserves are on by the government. So the indian has some piece of paper that says this is my lot. 
>> But underlying that is the fact that in canada the federal government owns the land. 
John: So you can't borrow against it. 
>> You can borrow, get a mortgage, be bonded. There is nothing that you can have that will allow you to be able to go to the bank on your own without the minister cosigning that loan. 
John: Does bring another guest. Economist terry anderson. You find indians do much better when they own their own land. 
>> Yes. I first get interested in this subject in 1976 when I visited a member of the flathead indian reservation. And while visiting his house i noted just how well off he was. He was not in poverty. I asked how he explained that. On never forget in many across the table, rested his chin on his hand and elbow and saying, i own this place. That was my first introduction to the fact that many reservations in the united states to have some privately-owned land like you and I own our houses. And the indians that have privately-owned land too much, much better. Their land is way more productive than a land that is overseen by the federal government, held in trust. John:90% more productive. 

[00:23:49]


>> Yes. The statistics are just astounding. I have done a lot of gathering of that data. They show that the lands, anywhere from 40 to 90 percent more productive than the lands held in trust. And as he said, these indians to have their land under their trusteeship of the federal government to my can't borrow against them. They are really locked into a poverty cycle as a result. 
John: Pretty amazing that no group has been more taking care of by big government and the indians, and no group in america has done worse. 
>> Fundamentally the group -- root of the problem is the fact that we don't have the same property rights as others take for granted, and that has to fundamentally change. We have to be able to recognize the collective ownership and free the imagination of the individual entrepreneur. We had economies that went back many, many millennia and were successful until 1492. 
John: Indians had a form of property rights before white settlers came here and mess that up. Some indians actually owned the salmon streams. They manage those streams so that they let the larger salmon go up to spawn. The result is that even today those streams have larger salmon and the streams that were held in common owned by everyone and hence managed by no one. 
John: Not an individual indian, but a plan would on the stream. Why today would they still have more salmon? 
>> That just goes back to what was superior management over a century ago. And at the same time I should know we are mismanaging our salmon stocks by chasing them around the ocean, open ocean and over harvesting salmon and many other species. We could learn from what the native americans did. 

[00:26:01]


John: You say you can see the private property difference by driving through some indian land 
>> it is fascinating to drive through the reservation in the west. Recently I drove through the crow indian reservation in south-central montana, and when you come to a fence line and on one side see overgrazing, a few scrawny cattle, maybe a house and if so not a very little boss, right next door you would see cultivated fields, irrigation systems, beautiful barns, and so on. And you don't even need to look at the property records to know that the productive one is held in private and the other one is held in common interest by the federal government's. 
John: Indians on both sides of the road, but private property on one. You can even see a. The difference. 
>> You can see it. It's fascinating to adjust to will a reservation, the blackfeet reservation, growth. 
John: There is not much development. Very few farms. Here is one. 
>> You can see this same thing on manas reserves were they have managed to develop an industrial park. They are creating jobs, wealth, and at least getting 1 foot up the ladder out of poverty. 
John: I'll give you the last word. 
>> Well, what we have to do is reserve -- reverse 500 years of colonization. But first nations, indian tribes in theedriver's seat. We can be successful where the federal governments in both countries a failed. The only way that that ultimately can be rfsolve this by granting us the right to be able to own our romance. 
John: Thank you, terry anderson, may joules. Coming up, the return to my local park. Why is it so nice and so many are a mess? Up next, how clever ways to mark property helped make america rich. know Cheerios has oats that can help lower cholesterol? And it tastes good? Sure does! Wow. It's the honey, it makes it taste so...

[00:31:13]


john: Now, I want to introduce you to one of the most impressive people I know. I first met in maybe 15 years ago, one of those lunches. Ideas about solving poverty. I go to lunch is like that because it bugs me that america is so rich when most of the world's poor and the world is not figured out a way to give them what it was that gave us power to prosper. So I go to lunch. I'm skeptical, but there since hernando de Soto of the institute for libertand democracy, a think tank based in peru. He starts pulling these pictures out of his briefcase, pictures that show slum dwellings built on top of each other, much like this. He went on to explain, well, i will let you explain it. What to these pictures show? 
>> They show that roughly about 4 billion people in the world actually build their homes and all their businesses outside the legal system. It's all haphazard and disorganized, but because of the lack of rule of law, the definition of who owns what in because they don't have addresses, can't get the credit. 
John: Don't have addresses. 
>> Well, to get an address somebody has to recognize the that is where you live. Legal recognition. Legal recognition means property when you have property, mailing address is command when you make a deal was someone you can be identified. The first -- the second characteristic in the is the address. If you go anywhere they say what is in a minority live. And some property is defined by law they cannot get into the kind of deals or the division of labor which is cooperation, specializing and create wealth because that is what makes you will the, the fact you don't have to milk a cow every day. You don't have to us borderland every day, build your own house. You can stick to doing a tv program. This part of a blackberry. The all market put together. The whole building, take care of it, and they can specialize. The day that they get titles, the day that the businesses in their homes, the sewing machines , whatever it is, the car repair shop finally gets recognized, start expanding. Start using skills. And. 

[00:33:32]


John: The need to be recognized by local authorities, this is yours. 
John: They need to work with them a lot. They take arrest. They just work a deal with the guy on the first floor and build their house in the second floor. 
>> That's right. Barely begun the first floor have the guts to scott and make a deal with someone from government decided to look the other way has got an invisible property right. It is not very different from when you americans started going west following the california. For example, the california gold rush. A land didn't belong to them. The country did not belong to them. It was mexico. You went in, but 800 mining claims association got 3 million americans. After a while you decided, why keep on shting at each other. In the beginning of the 20th century you go out, create a private property system. That brought in banks, and you create. 
>> But california really got rich. The rest of the world is not. What is the difference? 
>> You americans at that time were absolutely conscious of what the rule of law was about. People kept on moving from the east coast to the west coast george washington called in bandied. The band is don't have a right to be here. Congress can around and said, oh, yes they do. You start rewarding property on the basis of improvement. 
John: We did not always have these in america. American settlers worked out their own generally exempted right to property. 
>> Those areas where you shaved off part of the tree. Indicate they had accepted it. In some cases where they grew corn, for example, the corn grew from here to there and that established a ride from here to there. Those are actually called corn rights. It was an improvement on land that gave you the type. You had worked it. 

[00:35:33]


John: Still developing such property rights. 
>> Much of the countryside, the past prevail. 
>> The whole notion of property rights has been pretty alien tow formerly socialist countries because right from the beginning , in the 19th century, property -- 
john: Compare the countryside to cities like shanghai. 
>> I visited shanghai about 30 years ago. None of these buildings existed at that time. It is incredible what happens when you change the rules of the game. 
John: Should the rules of the game. 
>> The rules of the game have to say and recognize who really knows what because how you relate to the assets you have determine size you relate to your neighbor and the rest of the world. We work on paper and plastic, and if you don't have what you own on paper and plastic you will not be recognized and you can't play the game. 
John: This idea of eddied protecting property seems simple, but it is very powerful. All this commerce between total strangers, but it wouldn't happen otherwise and applies to more than just skyscrapers and factories. We cover stock markets. Tussaud taught me that they only work because of the-like paper work that we trust because we have rule of law. 
>> That represents about 40,000 head of cattle. I never see this. I have never been outside chicago to the west to see where these animals are. 
>> In the united states and western europe your duments go to the market and practically work for you and think for you. In developing countries and most of the former soviet union the majority of people actually have to bring their animals to market 

[00:37:35]


>> people in the developing world have cattle, land, and houses the same way they do in the western world. What is missing is the rule of law. 
John: You say, if they just said rule of law that would be as rich as we. 
>> Of course. Let me tell you, bringing in the rule of law is no easy thing. They're trying it in afghanistan . And not getting there. 
John: You started your working in peru working, trying to establish property rights. An economic adviser to the president. Reform to the extent that other countries and by you to go to -- you got to russia, libya. Twenty-three countries. Egypt and honduras and the philippines. The leaders of these countries must get that they are doing something wrong. 
>> They did it easier than in north america. The people who brought in the rule of law and property rights into the united states, the 18th and 19th century, you can't remember that. In the case of these guys, they see that they are poor relative to your wealth. It's easy for them to sycamore is the difference? They are constantly looking so they can recognize much faster. We did not realize the fact it you can determine that a piece of land went from there to year, you can also do it with a movie script. You can also do it with an idea, an invention. And certainly. All of a sudden we started seeing that people just the paper. On top of that, you build a stock market and all that leverage. Get you into some kind of trouble, but without which you would not have gotten where you are today. 
John: Property rights give us the power to prosper. Thank you. We will be right back. ] tests, prego. Prego?! But I've bought ragu for years. 
[ Thinking ] WOER WHAT OTHER QUESTIONABLE Choices I've made? I choose date number 2! Whooo!

john: All over america there are parks that are filthy, dangerous, badly maintained. The government is in charge and say, what can we do? Budget cuts took our money. We don't have enough for maintenance and security. That's what they say. Do we let them rot? Let them become havens for drug dealers, prostitution, violent crime? Now it's nice. Parts of a few blocks from the studio. What changed it? This man changed it. He essentially privatize the part. Now he wants to do the same thing to the boston,. That is a terrible idea. A boston journalist. So how did you save it? 
>> Well, you have to make the park great if it is going to attract private funding. Security, sanitation. Whole cultural. A lot of programming to a draw people into the park at off hours. It's always safe. The best safety is not that tough security. 
John: The businesses around the park to cough up the money. And since 1996 we have n as the city government for a single dollar. 
John: It sounds good to me. The park looks great. What's wrong. 
>> Well, the park looks good, but it could be better, and it could be public. 
John: What is so wrong with sucking money from private businesses? 

[00:43:44]


>> It goes into private pockets. 
John: So what? 
>> Is very good to use, for dan to use the public land for running a private business or rent apart where all year round there is commercial revenue from renting in up to businesses. He keeps all that money. People don't realize that. I was in the park yesterday. I walked around and did a survey I asked 20 people if they thought this money was going to the city, and they'll think it is. So. 
John: So what if they think it's going to mars. The park is nice. 
>> It would not have the taxes. We have the money left over. The park could be just as good. 
John: Well, it certainly is true that the park is very commercial these days. But buying and selling going on. Holiday gifts. Very commercial. On the other hand, the public seems fine with that. 
>> Its and look very nice. A different story. 
>> A lot of the things that they should be doing. You should -- 
john: Some money. 
>> That's right. You will study. If everyone would feel just as good. 
>> Is a very public. Nobody has viewed it as privatized, and the final answer to these arguments, every dollar that is earned by concessions and sponsorships and events goes right back into the park. All that money is earned in these ways. The way we provide private skating complex skating for free which we do is from those booze and a sponsorship from city which has been very generous. 
John: Less talk about your next one combustion. Boston, and was once a common breezy feel. So for the tragedy. It was overgrazed. Now it's a part. Managed by government for about four and years. Badly managed, and this is the result. Your plans. 

[00:45:59]


>> Well, last thing we want to do is privatize boston common. It's not new york. It's not as commercial. We are in the position of coming up with ways to greatly augment the city's budget, which everyone involved feels is inadequate. 
John: If the people around the park to pay most of the money. 
>> Private companies, the central part model is a little tougher. 
John: Just for clarity. I have a bias. I am on the board of the charity that helps manage center part. I joined people because I saw what they did. Government manage central park. It was buried in dangerous. Now it is wonderful. The model is that I give money. People live around there. It's not a business arrangement. You're doing some mixture of that in boston. 
John: It would be a mixture. Bill of money from private sector companies, sponsorships or they don't demand a billboard they demand almost nothing. Give them a little small plaque of retribution and a bottle of money into the. 
>> We already have plutocrats and now we will get the corporations. The best of both worlds. First of all, the point is not what the size of the billboard is. The problem is that we don't need to do this. We don't need said -- 
john: What is the heart? 
>> Teach our next generation of children that the only way they can get a public brown is as the charityward of rich people and corporations. We can afford our public ground and are entitled to it and pay taxes and that is the government's job. This is not a model. This is not a model. 
John: A good model. 
>> It's not a model. We have dollar government accountable. 
John: I don't know what will happen to the rest of the country. It's working in some central park. 
>> It's working for your corporations, and is working for your billionaires'. 

[00:48:02]


John: Is working for the public. 
>> It's not. These people, the money bags did decide how the park is used and who goes there and to -- 
john: Do they keep out. 
>> To the desirable are into the undesirables. 
John: Sewer the undesirables. 
>> Primarily homeless people. Always the first thing on the list of how to deal with the homeless people. 
John: More homeless people. 
>> Well, homeless people have to be somewhere. If we don't make a system that accommodates people who don't have a place to live, they have to be in the public from. Unless you can suggest something better. 
John: You're on 42nd street. 
>> We have an answer to that. The same number of homeless people today that we had when it was viewed by everyone including yourself as horrible. At we did not have been and we have now is 4,000 other people. The ratio of almost a homeless as 4,000 to 13 1/7 to 5213. Any fema walking into brian parker might have in the past been concerned about security, this doesn't look like promising not to me. They're welcomed if they follow the rules. The same 13 people there almost every day. 
>> I appreciate that. 
John: That is another major thing. When people get mad at their government to have to be able to take it to the streets of the park, and that is one of the most -- since time immemorial the purposes of public space. And a lot of this privatization, and mr. Of other parks in boston and I'm sure here also, to stop the rallies and all that. John:50,000 people wanted to protest abortion central park. 
>> Or not allowed. 
John: Not allowed. 
>> What's more important, democratic free-speech or the grass you can replace the grass. 
>> Whatever it will take. 
John: We don't have enough democratic free-speech they can protest in the street. 
>> This is the place where they would get their proper publicity , the legitimacy. 

[00:50:05]


John: It was government that said no, not corporations. 
John: The kind of government that is now giving prices over corporations. That is what the real problem is. What we have to do is fix the government because we are ending up with two tiers. 
John: Of give you the last word. 
>> A quick word on events and free speech. The parks department right the permits, so they are the final. Any time a politician wants to demonstrate we have had an obnoxious people on both sides, racist preacher, a gay pride demonstration. Both were permitted because under the first amendment we are the agent of the city and have to let it be. We do not a bridge in the streets. 
John: Thank you. I wish I could say good luck to both of you. Also good luck to him. Up next, how can I convince the public and private ownership and management is a good thing? Here is a guy who talked about how great the privately run bryant park is. 
>> You just said public is better. projections... Optimistic. Productivity up, costs down, time to market reduced... Those are good things. Upstairs, they will see fantasy. Not fantasy... Logistics. Ups came in, analyzed our supply chain, inventory systems... Ups? Ups. Not fantas who would have thought? I did. We did, bob. We did. Got it. ???????????? 

[00:54:11]


john: Isn't that sweet. It reminds me, I'd like to wish you happy starvation day. Well, that is what thanksgiving would be called if the pilgrims had kept to the communal property rules they started with when they first settled. There were told share everything share the work. Should harvest. There was to be a common. Sellers were to receive there necessaries out of the common stock. No individual property. The labor the colony was to the organized according to the different capabilities of the settlers. Each according to his need. And that sounds fair. They nearly starved. It is the tragedy. People can get the same stuff by working less. They will. Plummets of less fake illness rather than work the common property. The colony's governor they should set corn every man for is of particular, assigned to every family, a parcel of land. The results were dramatic. This had very good success and made all hands very industrious. Much more corn was planted instead of famine, plenty. Things to private property they got food, and we have food. Be thankful. Now if only more people realize that is private property that allows us to have wealth, to create wealth. Some people in the privatized part understood that private ownership does good things. 
>> Private ownership public. 
>> Private. 
>> Private. 
>> They run things better than the government does. 
>> Private. 
>> Others have to have explains to them. Private managers delivered when government did not. Private property does, as the pilgrim discovered, conect efforts to reward. That creates an incentive for people to care much more and protect things. That is what has protected the elephants in zimbabwe, the buffalo in the west, and these atlantic salmon. It's would save the pilgrims. And then it made america the richest country in the history of the world. Live in a slum in egypt that has no deed to your property. You're stuck in poverty. When you know that your home or your store or whenever you make is safe from confiscation, then you can borrow and take risks and invest. That gives you the power to prosper, and that is the lost lesson of thanksgiving. So happy thanksgiving. Go prosper. Have a nice weekend, and good night.

[00:02:25]


>> Dr. Tanzi: Thank you, deepak. 
(applause) Over the next 60 minutes, I'm going to share with you some amazing facts about the brain, and I'm going to tell you how you can transform your brain into a super brain. A super brain. What can you expect from a super brain? Well, you'll find it easier to solve everyday problems, you'll find yourself making better decisions with a greater sense of intuition, you'll have a better memory, you'll be less stressed, you'll even find it easier to lose weight, your relationships at home and work will improve, and finally, you'll be able to reduce your risk for our worst nightmare as we age, dreaded alzheimer's disease, which I've devoted my professional career to studying. I know, this sounds like a lot, and it sounds all too good to be true, but believe me, the science is there to back it up. As a neuroscientist, I can tell you that. So let's start. First, I'm going to tell you the single most important thing you need to know about how to create your super brain. Simply put, you need to realize that you are not your brain. That's right. You are not your brain. You are the user of your brain. Your brain serves you. You shouldn't be serving it. And this will be a recurring theme throughout this presentation. For now, our task is to think about how to age and at the healthiest way, keep our brains healthy, and that means how can we develop a super brain? Let me that begin by telling you a little bit about your own brain. What you may not know is that one of the reigning ideas about how the brain is organized is the triune brain, meaning that the brain has three major parts, okay? So to demonstrate this, I'm going to use my hand. This is called the handy brain, and this was developed by ucla neuropsychiatrist dan siegel, the handy version of the brain. So put up your hand. Okay. Now, fold your thumb inside and make a fist. So I want to show you the three regions of the brain. Down here in the fleshy part of your palm, that's called the reptilian brain. It's the back of your head. Open your hand. In the middle, that's the limbic system or emotional brain. And then over the top is the rest of the brain. That's all these real estate here that's still under development, the intellectual brain. Now we'll go one by one, okay? Let's start with that reptilian brain. The reptilian brain is about 300 million years old. It first showed up in a little lizard. The reptilian brain is your instinctive brain, so the way to think about it is can you remember the last time you got really scared? Or maybe you wanted to attack someone because they threatened you? Well, you know, hopefully not. But this often happens, for example, in bad dreams, right? You have a frustration dream. You want to lash out and attack something. This is coming from your reptilian brain. The reptilian brain is concerned with four main functions-- feeding, making sure you get food, fighting, you know, protecting what's yours unless the other guy's bigger, and fleeing is the third function, and the fourth function is reproduction, making sure the species continues, okay? So you really need this. And we'll get back to reptilian brain a little later. Let me move on now to the limbic brain or the emotional brain. That's the one represented by your thumb tucked inside--deep inside the brain. This is the second oldest part of your brain. It's about 100 million years old, and it controls your emotions and your short-term memory. Now, when you're feeling connected with those around you, a good connection, this brain region is really good to you. It lets you experience healthy emotions. You feel emotions like love, compassion, peace and joy. Your entire body and your brain feels in balance. Life is good. But when we're lonely, when we're disconnected from others, this brain region's not happy. It feels hostility, resentment, guilt, shame, anxiety. When your brain and body are out of balance, life is not so good. So this is the part of the brain that works best for yoen you try to stay connected with others, staying socially engaged. The bottom line is never try to isolate yourself. We are by nature social beings. We weren't intended to live alone. We're intended to interact with each other. And it's the limbic or emotional brain that ensures that you will be a happy person if you do so. So now, let's move on to that third part of the brain, and that's the neocortex, the intellectual brain. This showed up about 4 million years ago, so not so long ago compared to the others. It's a pretty new part of the brain, and that's the bulk of your brain. There's a lot of real estate there still under development. This is the part of your brain that controls your intellect, and actually, you're using this part of the brain right now to understand what I'm telling you. Well, at least I hope you are. 

[00:07:30]


(laughter) It allows us to have long-term memories, to plan things, to predict things, to be reasonable and rational, but perhaps most importantly, it gives us free will. Free will allows us to make our own choices and decisions. You know, that little lizard with just a reptilian brain, he can't make decisions. He just--it's automatic, you know? You're walking--you know, if you're walking around in florida and you see a gecko, the gecko scurries into the bushes. It can't help it. Okay? Fight or flight. But when you have a--this new part of the brain, you can make choices about what you want to do. And when all three parts of the brain are in balance, working in harmony, the greatest achievements of civilization are possible. The symphonies of mozart, the works of shakespeare, the insights of einstein, da vinci, and galileo. And when this balance is ultimately achieved, well, this is what we call a super brain. And I'm here today to show you how to get one, okay? So how's that sound? Would you like a super brain? 
>> Yes. 
(applause) 
>> Great. Next, I want to show you how you can bring maximal health and benefit to your life by regulating each of the three parts of the brain. Your reptilian brain, which is back here, as I told you, is very important, okay? It's--you need it for survival. But the problem is it can get you into trouble. You know, unless your actual survival is threatened, it's better to just keep this brain region in check. You need it but you can't let it get out of hand. Let me give you an example. Suppose you're driving on the highway, someone cuts you off, and then, to add insult upon injury, they blow their horn at you. And your natural instinct is to respond aggressively. But here's a formula you can use over and over again to override those negative instinctive reactions that are gonna come up when something like that happens. Your brain stem's gonna try to get you upset and try to get you stressed, but if you can remember this, here's a way to just nip it in the bud and move on. And to remember this, we used the acronym s.T.O.P. S-t-o-p. "S," as you might have guessed, stands for "stop." Just stop, hold on, wait a minute. Okay, yeah, you just got cut off, the guy blew his horn at me, but just stop. "T" stands for take three deep breaths. 

[00:09:55]


(breathing deeply) Those are deep. 
(breathes deeply) And after you do that, smile. And don't just smile. Try to make your whole body smile. Try to do that. Pretend your whole body's smiling. I can feel it, okay? So you're driving while you're doing this, be careful. UM--(laughs) Now "o" stands for observe what's happening inside of you. You may still be upset, and it may not feel very good, but if those three breaths happened and they did you well and you're smiling, you might feel okay. And finally, "p." "P" stand for "proceed with awareness and kindness," okay? So "s," stop, "t," take three breaths and smile, "o," observe how you're doing, "p," move on, proceed and stay aware and be kind. And what will happen is if you do this, every time your reptilian brain tries to stress you out or get the better of you, you'll be able to stop it. It's amazing how well it works. You know, the key is to be able to do this all the time. If you get into the habit of doing this, your brain is incredibly susceptible to repetition and persistence. It will follow suit. It will do this automatically if you keep training it to do so. And the reason for this is there's a saying in neuroscience that goes, "nerve cells that fire together, wire together," okay? "The nerve cells that fire together, wire together." So every time you repeat something, your brain's rewiring itself to make it easier next time to reign in your reptilian brain when you're starting to feel stressed. In other words, rather than your reptilian brain controlling you, you're using your reptilian brain. You are the user of your brain. That's the key. And as you repeat this process, you will be transforming your brain. You'll be taking the first step into creating your super brain. So again, I'm gonna emphasize, instead of your brain using you, you need to learn that you use your brain. Take control of your brain, okay? So now, let's move on to the limbic brain or emotional brain inside the hand. That's the one tucked in here. Now, besides controlling your emotions with a part of the brain called the amygdala, the limbic brain is also responsible for your short-term memory. So as you're listening to me speak, this information that's coming in is being stored short term in this area called the hippocampus. The hippocampus is latin for seahorse, and if you make two C's WITH YOUR HANDS AND PUT THEM Together and link them like that, looks kind of like a seahorse. That's why it's called the hippocampus. And it's actually tiny if you look inside here. Here's this big giant brain and the hippocampus is just this little tiny piece in here. So if you think about it, it's kind of weird, right? Because, you know, every bit of information you're taking in has to be stored there first before it can go to the big hard drive here in your frontal cortex. Now, the problem is how do you keep this short-term memory going strong as you age. The first thing you need to know is this. Short-term memory is reinforced by emotion. The stronger the emotion that comes with some event, the greater the odds that you're going to remember it later. We learn best when we learn with passion. We learn best when there's lots of emotion associated with what is being taken into your brain. For example, we all remember like it was yesterdawhere we were on the morning of 9/11. I mean, think about 9/11, do you remember every detail of where you were when you saw this happening? And why is this? Because this incredibly intense emotions, in this case, shocking emotions that were associated with those events reinforced those memories. So now, do this, try to remember your first kiss. Too many of you are smiling. 

[00:13:54]


(laughter) Must have been a good first kiss. Now, try to remember the first congressman you voted for. Hmm, not as many smiles. So I know which one you probably remembered better, right? Because there was emotion associated with that first kiss not with who you voted for. Emotion is what will hardwire memories. Now, young children have incredible memies. You ever think about why? It's because everything in their lives, for a young child, is just so darn intense all the time. Every moment is a wow moment. For--our little daughter, laila, 4-year-old laila, every single minute, every single second of the day is just incredible, you know. Over the weekend, she was in the pool and a beetle flew into the pool and landed on the water. All of a sudden, I heard her shrieking, saying, "daddy, daddy, look, look, look." I'm like, "what? What?" I thought something was wrong. "There's a beetle in the pool." I'm like, "ah, good." So you know, I mean, she's gonna remember that little swimming beetle for a long time because that was an incredible event for her. Her emotional brain hardwired that memory just like that. So, how can you use your emotional brain for your maximum benefit? Well, to do so, I'd like you to get into the habit of, whenever possible, asking yourself two questions. Try to do this on a regular basis, but just don't it out loud. People will think you're crazy. The first thing is ask yourself, "what am I feeling right now?" Ask yourself, "what am I feeling right now?" The second question is, "hm, is that feeling good for me?" Two simple questions, how am i feeling right now and is that feeling good for me. And if whatever you're feeling right now is making you emotionally distressed, well, that's not good. That's not good for your brain or your body. Well, here's what you can do. You know, sometimes, you know, you just say, "how I'm feeling?" You just feel bad. You don't even know why, okay? Don't try to figure out why. Just do this instead, try to recall a memory that evokes joy, love, happiness, harmony. Like a beautiful sunset while you're on vacation, or the day your child was born. Okay, so now, I know this is starting to sound a little, you know, touchy-feely, you know, especially for a scientist. But the fact is, there is science behind this to back it up, so just bear with me. When you simply recall the experience of love or joy, your brain will actually react and start to release neurochemicals. Chemicals like oxytocin, dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins. And they will instantly make you feel better, okay? It's neurochemistry. These are the molecules of emotion. And guess what, as they get released by your brain, just 'cause you're thinking about something really nice, it will also serve to improve your health. These chemicals have been shown to enhance your immune system. There's a whole part of neuroscience called neuroimmunology that studies how your emotional well-being can work to enhance your immunity against, you know, getting a cold or just getting sick. So as you repeat this process every day, you will increasingly become the user of your emotional brain rather than letting it use you, and you'll be taking the next step toward creating your super brain. Now, let's talk about that newest part of the brain, the newbie on the block, 4 million years old. The neocortical or intellectual brain, the big daddy over here. Lots of real estate. This is the part of your brain that allows you to reason, to plan, to be creative. It's perhaps the most important part of your brain because it also provides you with imagination, free will and choice. The neocortex also gives us meaning. It allows us to apply meaning to everything we experience. This is one of the special things about being human is we can apply meaning to our lives. So now, let's think about how you can use your intellectual brain to your greatest advantage. Well, the way you do this is by taking the time whenever you can to consciously reflect on the meaning of your life, the purpose of your life. Now I know that may sound cliche and most of us don't think about this anymore. We get older. You know, when you're younger, especially in college we might think, what's the meaning of life? You know, why am I here? But you know, it's worth thinking about that even when you're an adult because it activates a part of your intellectual brain that is providing the most imagination and creativity. Take the time to ask, "what is the meaning of life? What is my purpose? What would I like to do with my life?" By searching for meaning, you're activating parts of your neocortex that are gonna serve you well. And when you ask and if you keep asking these questions, the answers are gonna come to you naturally. They're gonna come to you intuitively. And this has--brings us now to one of the greatest and newest frontiers of neuroscience where we're thinking about how intellect begins to emerge with your overall state of awareness an intuition. How can we train ourselves to be more aware, more intuitive? And we'll get more into this later in the show. But for now, let's recap what we have learned so far. First and foremost, you are not your brain. I think you know that by now. You are the user of your brain. Second, you learned about the three parts of your brain, the reptilian or instinctive brain, the limbic or emotional brain and the neocortical or intellectual brain. And finally, I gave you some exercises to regulate these brain regions for your maximal benefit. When we come back, I will share with you even more informaon on how to use your brain to maximize your health, happiness and well-being. And later, I'll tell you how to keep your brain young and how to help stave off alzheimer's disease. See you then.

(applause) 
>> Wow, this is such great information. I hope you're enjoying this look into the world of neuroscience and I am delighted to be right here in the studio with dr. Tanzi. Rudy, thank you so much for bringing this show to pbs, such fascinating information. 
>> Well, it's great to be here at pbs. I mean, my family watches a lot of the show. My little daughter loves "thomas the tank engine." I've actually been on a number of "nova" episodes and we really love pbs. 
>> Well, this is the place for your kind of science and we're delighted to have you here, and there's a lot more to come. And just so you know, dr. Tanzi is one of the world's leading researchers in the field of neuroscience. He is the joseph p. And rose f. Kennedy professor of neurology at harvard and the director of genetics and aging research at mass general hospital. And this pbs station, as you likely know, exist to serve you as a result of the tremendous financial support we received from people just like you. Now we encourage your support in any amount, but we've got a couple of levels for you to consider starting at the affordable $60-a-year membership level. We will say thank you with the dvd of this lecture that includes everything on the television broadcast, plus, over 30 minutes of your most frequently asked questions about how to enjoy the benefits of a "super brain" or you can move up to the $144 level of support and we'll show our appreciation with "super brain, a user's manual." Now this life-changing multimedia learning system includes a three-book set that will give you more science about the secrets to enjoying a super brain and it also includes a seven dvd library, and it has information and programs to help you manage your weight, deal with anxiety and fears, learn the latest about research on alzheimer's and there's even a download in it to help you get a better night's sleep. Now, you're gonna enjoy all the benefits of a super brain with your gift of support right now. And please remember, this package is a pbs exclusive so please call or join safely and securely online. Now, dr. Tanzi, I got to ask you a pretty simple question. I've watched now the first part with our viewers of the show, but I still don't quite understand clearly this concept of a super brain. What do you mean by that? 

[00:22:02]


>> Well, what I mean by a super brain is that you take the different parts of your brain, the three major parts of your brain, and you learn how to monitor them all, use them all, and integrate them in a balanced manner so once they're harmonious, you'll find you have a healthier and happier life. 
>> You know what I love about it, rudy, is just what you said, the science is there to back it up. There's not one thing in this package, in the books, in the seven dvd library, whether you're exploring how to deal with stress or how to deal perhaps with getting to a more ideal weight for you, you're using the science, the neuroscience that you've studied and the work that deepak chopra has done, you've combined them to make a--really, a set of technologies that can help people do these things that you're suggesting 'cause there's one thing--a lot--you can get opinions from anybody, but it's really nice to get a really step-by-step strategy for how to make changes in your life that you know is backed up by real science. 
>> Yeah, you know, greg, I mean, I'm a professor--a working professor at harvard and mass general hospital. I run a large research group of about 50, 60 people working on alzheimer's disease and we publish probably, I don't know, 3, 4 dozen papers a year about our research. So I'm not gonna give anybody information that's wrong. I'm a real scientist. And the point is, I wanted to reach out by working with deepak chopra to say, "let's combine what we know about science about how to exploit and use that mind/body but now mind/brain connection to have a healthier life. So we basically put the science out there and then give you very, very simple advice to develop skills and tools to make the optimum use of your brain, optimally using this incredible organ that you own. It's all yours. And then you turn it into a super brain and your life changes, your relationships. You make better decisions. Your intuition goes up. You're happier and your whole body is healthier because your brain controls your body out. Okay. Once you see all these in the BOOK, THE DVDs, THE MANUAL, You'll see how easy it is. And, you know, I don't want to get too excited about it, but I'm just very excited about it. It's just a great thing. 

[00:24:07]


>> But I know people are out there are watching, watched the lecture so far, listening to us talkight now might be going, "can anybody take advantage of this?" Do I have to be a 30-year-old and change my life in a big way? Can I work it at 40? What if I've already got some disease states that I'm dealing with? Can this help anybody?" 
>> Yes, I mean, I want to emphasize. Anybody can start creating this idea of a super brain right now. AND THE MANUAL, THE DVDs, THE Book, every--the starting--getting started guide makes it easy, okay? We're gonna get across to you the science in a simple way of how amazing your brain is. Just like carl sagan told us how amazing the universe is. Your brain is just as amazing. I mean, the number of, you know, connections you can make in your brain is the number as the tire number of atoms and particles in the universe. We tell you how to practice mind over brain. You know, how you can tap into your brain, to have it serve you. EACH OF THE DVDs IN THE SEVEN Dvd library will get you closer to understanding how you can be the master of your brain, not the other way around. How to use your brain, not just simply be a servant to your brain. And we'll give you an understanding of the science in a very simple way. So you get both sides. Here's the science that backs it up and here's what's it gonna do for you when you start creating your own super brain 
>> wow. It's great, great stuff, and i hope you're looking forward to taking advantage of it. Right now, it's time to go back to the next segment of "super brain," but we're gonna be back in the studio with dr. Tanzi in a few short minutes. But please show your support for this program right now by using the telephone or using this station's website. Now, if you already pledged your support, thank you. If you haven't done so yet, why not? Please give yourself the power and freedom of the super brain as our way of saying thanks to you for your support of this pbs station. 

[00:26:08]


>> announcer: WELCOME BACK TO "Super brain" with dr. Rudy tanzi. 
(applause) 
>> Dr. Tanzi: Thank you. So now I'd like to continue on this theme of how to create your super brain. I already told you that you need to become the user of your brain, and not let your brain use you. You need to realize that you are much more than the sum of your thoughts, and feelings, and sensations. You need to become the master of your brain. You need to balance all three parts of your brain, so that they work in perfect harmony and balance. Now, in addition to being a scientist, I played piano for most of my life, including professionally for a while. And you know, what I appreciate about music is that it can be used to activate these three different parts of the brain. Now, I'm gonna show you a little bit on the piano. So let's start with the reptilian brain, right? This is, you know, usually the aggressive part, the fight or flight. So to represent a reptilian brain, we can think about a 2-4 beat, a march. 
(piano plays) You feel the aggression, you feel the marching, okay? 'Cause the reptilian brain tends to want to take territory, and if it can't, it flees. It says take food. It says survive, survive, survive. It's doing us a favor. And then the emotional brain comes in, and the emotional brain is--could be a thing of beauty. It could also be a negative emotion, but we'll choose a nice beautiful emotion. 
(piano plays) You know, it evokes a feeling of peace, and calm, and beauty. This, you know, warm and fuzzy feelings. Now, the third part of the brain is the neocortex. And I don't really know how to play an intellectual song, but i think it might sound like this. 

[00:28:14]


(piano plays) You know, like those computer commercials you see on tv, you know, when the little chips are going. So those--so this is just showing how music can turn on and represent different parts of the brain. The problem is, many of us tend to let just one brain area dominate our lives. So for example, you may have a pathological overeater, who may unknowingly spend most of his time in the reptilian brain. Okay, so remember that reptilian brain sounded like this. 
(piano plays) Now, picture I'm chewing while I'm doing that. 
(piano plays) 
(laughter) Another bag of chips. 
(piano plays) Okay? It can get a real march rhythm going as you munch that food, and you're not even thinking about it. Instinctively trying to satiate the desire for that pleasure brought about by the sheer act of eating. And then you have the drama queen or king who dwells in that limbic system, immersed in a world of runaway emotions, negative or positive, and just loving it. So I'll do the positive one, you know, we have... 
(piano plays) And, you know, that's fine, but you know, that's not all there is to life. You need to kind of get out of the emotional brain once in a while. It can hold you back. And then you have, and I know a lot of these people, the hard-nosed intellectual who lives their entire life stuck in the neocortex, showing little sensitivity or compassion for those around them, okay? Because all that matters is the intellect. 
(piano plays) Okay? I'm not sure if that's an intellectual song, but it's what came to me. And the thing is that none of these three situations are optimal. You don't want to be just stuckin the reptilian brain or the e brain or neocortical brain. You need to notice when that's happening. So you probably all heard of the term mind over matter. Well, to achieve your super brain, you must practice something else. It's called mind over brain. And if you think about it, the brain is matter. It's white matter and gray matter, so in this case, mind over matter becomes mind over brain. And only then, when you do this, can you begin to consciously make your own choices. Choices that will allow you to promote your physical, mental and spiritual well-being. The key is, to remember, that you always have choices. So--oh, look at this. Someone just brought me a wonderful box of pizza. You know, I see pizza like this and I'm sitting in front of the tv, I could eat four pieces of this pizza and not even know i ate it, and then eat the other four, and then it's all gone. Okay? My reptilian brain is going crazy, my emotional brain is saying, "wow, smell that cheese and it's piping hot." But wait a minute, my neocortical brain just reminded me of something. Okay? If I have too much of that pizza, it's not gonna be good for me. My balanced brain says, "yeah, that's a great-looking pizza, you want to eat the whole thing," but the intellectual brain is coming in and overriding that burning desire, overriding the rtilian brain, saying, "it won't be good for you if you have too much." So then, the cortical brain says, "you're in control. Have some pizza, just have one piece." And then the reptilian brains says, "yeah, but make it a big one." You know, so--so-- thank you. So-- 

[00:31:48]


(chuckles) So, you know, that's the brain integrated, talking to each other, making sure everything is balanced. All three parts of my brain are satisfied and now in harmony. Next, I'd like to introduce an idea that--it's a new idea, and this is an idea that's really taking the field of neuroscience by storm. It's a new subfield of neuroscience called contemplative neuroscience, like contemplation. Contemplative neuroscience. It's a bit difficult to explain, but I think the easiest way to do it, and this has to do with this concept of mind over brain, is to think about the term mindfulness, mindfulness. So what is mindfulness? One way to define mindfulness is that it's the act of paying attention in a totally neutral manner. Devoid of judgment, devoid of analysis, devoid of calculation. When you are truly mindful, you don't just hear, you listen. You don't just look, you see. And maybe the best way to explain, you know, mindfulness is to give an example of lack of mindfulness. So, my wife, dora, called me the other day at the lab to remind me that we had to go to our daughter's violin lesson the following week. And halfway through the call, i got an e-mail--'cause I was sitting at my desk--and the e-mail had some incredibly exciting data in it about a new alzheimer's gene. So I couldn't help it. You know, I opened up the excel sheet, I started checking out the data. But i--and I thought I was still talking to my wife on the phone. I thought I was. And--and then, you know, the following week came, and dora reminded me about little laila's lesson and I had no idea what she was talking about. And luckily, she just laughed, uh, 'cause my wife is nice. But the thing is that all of us, every one of us, tends to try to multitask. Okay? Who has not multitasked in this room? That's an honest group. So, guess what? Multitasking is not possible. Multitasking is not possible. Your conscious brain can only do one thing at a time. To create your super brain, you need to develop mindfulness in different aspects of your life and remember that you have to concentrate on one thing at a time. The four areas where you need to think about how to be mindful include sensory awareness, body awareness, mental awareness, and social awareness. So let me give you an example first of sensory awareness. I want you all to imagine a beautiful sunset. Now, imagine a newly born infant crying. Now, imagine the smell of hot buttered popcorn. Mm. Now, imagine licking a lemon. 

[00:34:54]


(chuckles) And now, imagine touching the rough surface of sandpaper. So when you were imagining that sunset, your visual cortex, the vision area of the brain back here, was actually turned on, activated, as if you were really seeing the sunset. When you heard that newborn, your auditory cortex was activated, as if you were really hearing that baby. When you smell the hot buttered popcorn, your olfactory cortex was activated. When you imagined licking that lemon, your sensory cortex, your taste was activated. You may even have started salivating. So, guess what, here's what you just did. You just became the user of your brain. An exercise like this shows you that you can turn on whatever brain region you want. You actually just did this. You even changed the chemistry, the wiring of nerve cells, the gene activity in those brain regions as you turn them on. Can you imagine that? In these brain regions, things change, wiring change, chemistry change, genes were turning on and off, and you did all of this with just your mind. All through just mindfulness, you changed the actual activities in your brain. And this is really one of the keys in terms of your path to a super brain, is to realize that you have the power to change your own brain. So now, how about a practical way to apply this? I'm gonna use the example of sitting down to eat a meal. The next time you sit down to eat, try this. Try taking more time to pay attention to the taste and smell of your food. Take your time. You'll enjoy it more. And as you do, the hunger center in your brain, which tells you whether you're still hungry or be satiated earlier, if you just take your time. Essentially, with this type of mindful eating, let's call it that, you'll actually lose weight because you'll eat more slowly 'cause you're enjoying it and that area of your brain that needs to be satiated will be satiated earlier so you're gonna eat less food so you'll lose weight. Mindful eating. Now, let's move on to the second category. This is mindful body awareness. And here you need to be aware of two aspects of your body. First, your muscular skeletal system and this includes, like, your legs and arms. And you need to ask yourself, "how do I feel right now? Do I feel lethargic? Do I feel energetic? Do I feel heavy? Do I feel light?" Ask yourself these things. Be in touch with your body. The second aspect is being aware of your internal body. Actually trying to be aware of your internal organs. For example, you can be mindful about whether your stomach is empty or full. You can be mindful of how you are breathing. Are you breathing slow or fast? Deep or shallow? You can be mindful of your heart rate. With this mindful body awareness, you'll actually activate the parts of your brain that control these parts of the body and because you're just showing them a little tender loving care, you're paying attention to them, you will have your brain take care of your body's needs in a better and healthier way. You'll also start, intuitively, making the right decisions regarding your body's needs. For example, you'll be sure to get enough sleep when your body says it needs it. You'll know when your body needs sleep. You'll be listening. You won't eat when you're not really hungry. That's body awareness. Next, let's talk about the third, mental awareness. With mental awareness, you need to be careful to observe, whenever you can, the thoughts and feelings going through your mind. Their thoughts and feelings that have been generated by your brain in your mind all the time. And as you observed them, you need to always appreciate that you are not simply just the sum of your thoughts and feelings. You are much, much more. The real you is the one that's able to observe your thoughts and feelings. I said earlier, your brain has evolved to endow you with self-awareness. Self-awareness, this is an incredible gift and you need to use it. So instead of just mindlessly reacting to every situation, often with bad consequences, instead, you'll make wise choices, the ones that will best serve you and those around you. And this brings us to social awareness. In social awareness, you need to think about being aware of those that are closest to us, our family members, our best friends, and then try to extend that same level of awareness to those you work with and then on to all of society, and as you do this, try to practice what WE CALL THE THREE A's. THE THREE A's. First, attention. Really listen to what others have to say. They'll appreciate it. And if there's appreciation, notice and mention something good about them. And finally, affection. Let them know you care about them. This can be a family member, a co-worker, or just someone you know, you don't know very well. It costs you nothing. THE THREE A's, ATTENTION, Appreciation, and affection. And if you do this, you will become more connected to your world and your emotional brain will reward you. You'll have great feelings of joy, peace, happiness. And as a result, you will also enjoy better mental and physical health. So these are the four aspects of mindfulness that I want you to practice to achieve your super brain, sensory, body, mental, and social awareness. As you start to live a more mindful life, you will gradually begin to reap its benefits. You'll find that you're less argumentative and it's easier to stay calm. For example, when your co-worker is blasting loud obnoxious music in the cubicle next to you, you won't go ballistic, raising your blood pressure, or maybe having a stroke. That's not a good thing, okay? You'll find that you're shedding bad habits, that you're shedding addictive tendencies. You'll find that your sleeping better. And sleeping better, you know, getting good sleep is very, very important for the health of your brain. I'll tell you why later on. You'll start feeling like you're more in charge of your life and be making better choices. Basically, you're going to transform your life with mindfulness, from being reactive to being more creative and intuitive. Essentially with mindfulness, you'll be celebrating the greatest gifts provided to you by your brain. Insight, intuition, choice, and creativity. Now, in the next segment, we'll talk about how to keep your brain young and help stave off alzheimer's disease. So I'll see you in a moment. 

[00:41:35]


(applause) 
>> Wow, what great stuff. Are you ready to make the simple changes in your life that will turn your brain into a ser brain? Hi, I'm greg sherwood. I'm delighted to be here in the studio once again with dr. Rudy tanzi, the host of this fascinating program. And rudy, I got to tell you, the more I watch this thing, the more I learn it really is great stuff. 
>> Thanks, and I'm so glad that so many people can hear about "super brain" and start changing their lives today. 
>> I know, and that's the whole idea. Right now, we're gonna give you a few minutes before we get into the last segment of the program to encourage your support, and if you can do that at the $60 level, you will get the dvd of the program we're enjoying right now, but get this. It's got an extra 30 minutes of great q&a at the end where a lot of people ask the questions you probably have right now. But I would really encourage you to consider moving up to the $144 level because dr. Tanzi and dr. Chopra have created a user's manual for our brain.It's called "super brain, a user's manual." It is an incredible package. It's got the book that the whole lecture is based on. It's got workbooks. IT'S GOT SEVEN DVDs AND A Library and they explore every one of the areas most of us are concerned about, whether it's weight loss, money management, perhaps you worry and struggle a little bit with anxiety. They have tools and information to help you in all those areas. That is our gift to you for your phone call and gift of support right now at the $144 level. And when you think about it, rudy, this is the one network where science is really taken seriously. 
>> Oh, yeah. I mean, you know, pbs is such a gift. It's a gift for the whole family. I love the science shows. I love "nova." I've been on "nova" several times. I love "nova science now." So many great shows. I mean, I think, we mainly watch pbs at home. My little girl loves "thomas the tank engine." And you know, where else can you get that? I mean, it's just the best--by far, the best network. 

[00:43:38]


>> So actually, public broadcasting isgood for you. 
>> It actually is good for you. I mean, you know, if you're watching a rerun of "gilligan's island," you're not doing much for your brain, but if you're learning new stuff and you're making new synapses, which you can only get at pbs, you're actually doing a lot of good for yourself. You're creating--helping create your super brain. 
>> And you know what, rudy, you actually, in the package, clearly at the $144--i love the notion of a user's manual because it's this idea--we all take our brains for granted, but what you and dr. Chopra have done has taken the science that you spent your life working in and synthesized it down into a package of tools so people who DON'T HAVE PhDs IN NEUROSCIENCE Can actually learn how--can make those connections to get to a place where you're healthier about how you make decisions. So perhaps you got some weight issues or you got anxiety issues. We even got a whole dvd about people struggling with money issues 'cause a lot of that has to do with which part of the brain you're using when you make bad financial choices. All these things are in this package and all of it goes back to the science that you're so famous for working on. 
>> Yeah, you know, we just wanted to really just make it simple. You know, I mean, there are lots of places you can get self-help about, you know, how to have a more positive attitude and help your brain. But in this package, what you're going to get is simple to understand science, newest breakthroughs about the incredible potential and ability of your brain. And then we say now, "isn't it great you have this amazing organ in your head?" But guess what, it's not who you are. You're the user of your brain. Now, here's how you can master your brain, reshape and remold your brain to your liking into a super brain so it will serve you better. And it begins with being mindful, just taking advantage of the fact that you're self-aware. You can observe what's going on in your brain. Learning to do that every day and you will, over time--it can happen more quickly for some versus others, but it does ppen quickly 'cause it's easy. You reshape, remold, rewire your brain to best serve you, make you a healthier, happier person, in all aspects of your life. 

[00:45:42]

>> You know, rudy, we've talked about lots of the details in the "super brain, a user's manual" package, but I want to step back for a minute before we get to the final segment of the program and let you describe to people briefly what the big benefits are. Why should I get over the phone right now and make this call and gift of support for this exclusive package? 
>> You know, once you make this decision, and I would say it really is one of the biggest and best decisions you'll make, that your brain, either master of your brain and use your brain to its highest potential. You start to create what we call the super brain. And as you fine tune your brain, what will start to happen naturally, is you'll make the right decisions. You won't even know how. Your intuition has just been heightened but in a good way so you get more aware of financial decisions, hunches about, you know, good people to be around versus people you should avoid, relationships, how to make them better, how to keep people around you and your family, at work and in society in general, happier to be with you. Okay, people actually want to be around you because of the positive energy you're giving out because your brain is working for you. You're not just serving it. That's the key. So it leads to at all levels, the social level, the health level, the spiritual level, the mental level, a happier you thatretty quickly because we got the science to back it up. The science is saying, here's how your brain works so now how can we use that to give you everyone around you is gonna be happier. 
>> Well, that is a good news and that can be news coming into your life if you give us that call and gift of support. We're about to return to the final segment of dr. Tanzi's lecture. We'd love to get you on board before the end of this program. It's your station, support it. 

[00:53:06]


>> announcer: WE'RE BACK WITH "Super brain" with dr. Rudy tanzi. 
(applause) 
>> Dr. Tanzi: Thank you. Thank you. So far, I've told you about the three parts of your brain and how to balance them. I told you how to practice mindfulness in the four aspects of your life. All of this will serve to help you create your super brain for a healthier, happier, and more mean next, I'd like to focus on howu age. How to have a better memory and what you can do to help stave off dreaded alzheimer' alzheimer's disease is my particular field of research, one in which I have been passionately investigating for the past three decades of my life at mass general hospital and harvard medical school. I'm often asked two different questions. First, I'm asked, "what's the difference between alzheimer's disease and dementia?" And the an alzheimer's is a type of dementia in the most common form. The other question I often get is what's the difference between age-related memory loss. When do I know I have alzheimer's or I'm just getting older and my memory is going downhill? So, the answer is that, you know, while age-related memory loss som very early alzheimer's disease and progress into it. For most of us, as we age, we all start to suffer from senior moments without necessarily suffering from alzheimer's or being in the early stages of alzheimer's. So I'll give you a personal example. I like to work on my computer, you know, reading, writing papers while I watch tv. And, you know, sometimes--and i know that's multitasking, but I'm just doing one thing at a time. I say, "okay, now, I want to watch the baseball game. So--so, of course, you know, i get thirsty, and I'll say, "okay, I'm gonna go to the kitchen and, you know, take a little break. So I get up and I walk to the kitchen, and more often than not, my new following close behind me 'cause he thinks he's gonna get a treat in the kitchen. And then, very often, I get into the kitchen, I just find myself 

[00:55:31]


(laughter) And then I look down, I see my cat, he's just looking around. 
(laughter) And then we look at each other, and we say, "i don't know." "You know?" He'd say, "i know, I want a treat." So I totally forget. I say I totally "forget" why i but guess what, I didn't forget. I never knew. 
(laughter) There's a difference. That's what a senior moment is. You see, in a senior moment, you in the first place in your brain. Okay? It may have been that when I had that flash of a thought of a desire for a glass of water, i was so distracted while reading the article on the computer and watching the game that, you know, by the time I got to the kitchen, I didn't forget why i went into the kitchen, it just never restered in the first place. This is actually the most common reason for what's called a senior moment. So the thought went through my head and right out. And basically, what happened, i wasn't mindful. I wasn't min I didn't pay attention. I was multitasking. I was doing everything wrong for a super brain. So these are the most common reasons for these so-called senior moments, okay? And they can be avoided with you see, as we age, we get increasingly distracted. We take on too much bandwidth. Too many things are going on at once. We're e-mailing, texting, buying things online, and eating lunch all at the same time. So, as a result, of course we're going to get jaded. We're gonna get apathetic. If you want to improve your memory, try this. Re trying to remember something. Be sure to consciously observe what you are doing. This memory. Don't let it just shoot in and out. And now, the odds will be much higher that you will retain and recall that memory. So let's take the example of getting home and putting your keys away. First thing you want to do is take the time to observe where you're placing the keys. Second step, associate that location with something nearby, like, maybe, a nearby vase. Consciously remind yourself that you're registering this memory. Okay, make sure it stays. And--or you can just do what i do. I always put my keys in the same place. But you know, if you don't, this is a great way to find your keys. You know, the brain has this amazing ability and it doesn't really go away as we age. We make it go away, but we can bring it back by just being mindful. How many of you knew that new nerve cells are being born in your brain for your entire life even in old age? Okay? It's called neurogenesis. Now, I know some of you are thinking, "you know, what? This guy is a professor at harvard, he doesn't even knownows that." Well, yeah, that's true but then, new ones get born. You know, I remember my mom when I was a kid--well, not a kid, but an adult and I go off to the pub with my friends and she say, brain cell you lose as you drink, you know, have beer or alcohol, will never come back." And you know, how many of you heard that? Well, you know what, mom was right. You kn alcohol in moderation, and alcohol will kill some of those nerve cells, but the fact is, new ones do get born. And they get born in two key spots. One of those key spots where they--you can get new nerve cells born as stem cells, your whole lifetime, is that same area I talked about earlier, the hippocampus, okay? The seahorse. And this is really good news because in alzheimer's disease, this is the area of the brain that's hit particularly hard, the short-term memory area. Alzheimer's disease, the short-term memory goes downhill, okay? But if you can make, if you can somehow make new nerve cells grow there, you can actually help prevent memory loss. So now, I'd like you all to do something for me, okay?Eryone, stand up. And let's start running in place, okay? Keep going. You need to keep going. A little bit more. Okay, good, you can stop. Okay, sit down. Sit down. So, guess what you just did for your brain? You know what you just dor your brain? Well, besides jogging around like jelly. But what you just did for your brain was you actually induced the birth of new nerve cells in your brain. Exercise has been shown over and production of new stem cells, new nerve cells in the hippocampus. The second thing you did, you cleared away some of the pathology of alzheimer's disease that starts to accumulate in all of us after the age of 40. This is called the senile plaques. Exercise has been shown to actually clear the senile plaques away. So exercise is probably the single best thing you can do to stave off alzheimer's disease. It won't guarantee you don't alzheimer's, but it will be probably your best way to try to protect yourself. So your brain has another trick up its sleeve for staying use to believe that when your brain get injured, it could never regenerate or heal itself. But that's wrong. Now, we know that the brain actually possesses amazing when the brain is injured by a stroke or a head bang and the nerve cells start to die, guess what? The nerve cells next door, the neighboring nerve cells next door to the ones that died actually start to sprout new nerve endings and make synapses to recapture the ones that were lost. It actually rebuilds your neural network. So, here's some neurons dying, you got a bang or a stroke. These nerves next door say, "we got you covered." They sprout, they make synapses, and actually retain the memories that would have been lost. They rebuild your neural network. It's pretty amazing, right? So the thing is, this goes on your entire life, even when you're old. And you know, even when you're very old. You just have to allow it to happen. So now, how can we induce neuroplasticity? How can we induce new synapses in our brain? Well, that's easy. You're doing it right now just by watching this show. Okay? Do is stay socially interactive, hang out with lots of people. We're doing that. And stay intellectually stimulated. So if I'm not boring you to death, I'm helping you to and what's so important about making new synapses in your brain? Here's the thing. When you learn new things and you make new synapses, you have to remember something, all of learning is based on association.Earn involves making synapses that are following the synapses you already have. You learn by associating with what you already know. So you make new synapses, you strengthen the synapses you already have. And if you look at what happens in alzheimer's disease. What--you know, if you ask, "what does the degree of dementia in alzheimer's disease co-relate with?" It's mainly with the loss of synapses. So the more synapses you can make by being intellectually stimulated, the more you can lose. It's like having money in the bank. Having a few extra synapses to back up the ones you've been making your entire life. And you can do thi watching pbs, being intellectually stimulated. "Gilligan's island" won't do it. Sorry. It's a great show, but it's not gonna do it. I'm not saying that these activities are going to guarantee you will not get alzheimer's disease, but they have all been documented and shown to lower risk. Now, alzheimer's is a terrible, terrible disease as you know. For over half of those over the age of 50 who were surveyed and asked what is the scariest disease imaginable? Okay, the answer was alzheimer's disease as well as you know, cancer, being the other one. But alzheimer's is a disease that actually slowly robs you of yourself. It does this by unraveling your entire tapestry of memories. The very memories that define your life and it does this until your entire personality is just completely ripped away from you. There's nothing worse. And for many decades last century, we really didn't know the cause of alzheimer's disease. You know, we were able to look into the brain, you know, autopsies and we were able to see the pathology and get some idea of what was going on and that really helped us a lot in terms of, you know, how to figure out what was going on. But just, you know, looking at the autopsy brain doesn't tell you the early events, just like you know, going to a baseball park after the game is over, wanting to understand the game of baseball. You can get an idea, but not enough to really get the root causes. And the big break came in the '80s AND '90s WHEN MY LAB AND Other labs, discovered the first genes that can cause alzheimer's disease. We found genes that, you know, they're normal genes, that do their normal job, but when they carry certain defects, we found that they can cause alzheimer's. We learned something else, that genes also taught us that while there are these defects I told you about that can guarantee the disease, usually striking under 60, and this is terrible because some of the mutations we found in these genes guarantee you get the disease and there's nothing you can do about it in terms of your lifestyle. But luckily, these are very rare. They may be 2 percent of alzheimer's disease. Most of alzheimer's disease strikes after the age of 60. And it involves the interplay of both your genetics and how you live your life. So in other words, most cases of alzheimer's involve both genes and lifestyle together and the same pattern holds for most big age-related diseases, heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer. And why this is good news it means that for most of us, you know, if you didn't get one of these rare mutations that guarantee the disease, for most of us, regardless of the genetic hand that was dealt to us by our parents, we can think about how to adapt our lifestyle to help prevent alzheimer's and even other age-related disorders. So how do we do this for our brain? How do we keep our memory and our brains healthy as we age? How do we protect ourselves against alzheimer's disease? Now, I've already told you about the protective effects of exercise, social engagement, intellectual stimulation, and learning new things. I want to tell you a few more. First is diet. It's very, very important to eat a balanced diet. Limiting sugar, fats and salt. You know, those are the three main ingredients of junk food. Sugar, fat, and salt. And you know, going back in evolution, we really crave these things. Reptilian brain told us, you need sugar for energy, you need fat to survive the winter, you need salt for homeostasis. But now, you know, we don't really need them just quite as much. You want to also limit your red meat and processed foods. Many studies have shown that a mediterranean diet is healthiest, meaning try to replace butter with olive oil, eat lots of whole grains, legumes, mixed nuts, fresh fruit, and whole vegetables. Antioxidants are good, blueberries, dark chocolate. There are certain supplements that are showing promise. Some of the old indian ayurvedic supplements like ashwagandha is one we are studying that we think can help clear the amyloid out of the brain. Another important factor is sleep. Sleep is extremely important. It's very important as we get older to get enough sleep. I bet you didn't know that it's only in the deepest stage of sleep called slow-wave sleep that all those short-term memories in your hippocampus are now turning into long-term memories in the frontal cortex. The transfer of short-term memories which are really just the thumb drive stuck in the computer-- the way you get them on the hard drive is slow wave sleep. That's the deepest stage of sleep. And the problem is as we get older, some of us have such sleep problems that we never even reach that slow-wave sleep. You can also try to reduce stress. Meditation is good. In fact, if you're really good at meditation, you can even induce that protective delta state in the brain. Yoga is great for the brain and the entire body. And I would atso say, try to live in the moment. Reduce stress by not obsessing on the past, not being anx about the future. Try to stay in the present because the present is always okay. I use the mantra myself all the time--i'm okay right now and there is only right now. Yeah, I may be dreading the future for some reason. I may be really upset about the past, but there's only right now and I'm okay right now. I'll learn from the past, I'll plan for the future, but I'll live in the now. This can do amazing things for reducing stress. And finally, stay busy. Take up new activities, especially those that can help you to help others. If you're helping others, your brain is really happy. We are made to help others. For example, volunteer at a senior center. This is what my mom does and she loves it. It keeps her young. Well, I've given you a few different ideas about how to protect your brain and how to help stave off alzheimer's and we've come to the end of the show. We learned that you are not your brain. You are the user of your brain. We learned about the three parts of the brain and the importance of keeping them balanced and in harmony. We learned about the importance of mindfulness and practicing mind over brain. And finally, we learned how to keep our brains young and healthy. How to help stave off alzheimer's disease. And the more you do this, the more you practice these things, the more you will transform your brain into a super brain. And as you create your super brain, you will also increasingly find yourself becoming more and more intuitive. You'll find yourself making the right decisions often without knowing why. You start to become a better judge of character. You rely more on your insights and hunches and gut feelings. You'll use them like a sixth sense. So--and just remember, one thing is for sure, it's really important to know this, your brain is really very, very susceptible to persistence. The more you repeat things, the more you persist, your brain will give in. It will adapt the way you want it to, but it takes practice and it takes repetition, persistence and dedication. Practice these things you've learned and you will have a super brain. Do it as often as your lifestyle will allow you. Use your mind to take charge of your brain and your own super brain will bloom, and in no time, you'll enjoy greater awareness, a healthier body and brain, a happier and more fulfilled life, and even protect yourself against age-related memory loss and alzheimer's. Thank you for your attention and I truly hope that you will start creating your own super brain today. 

[01:11:11]


(applause) Thank you. 
>> Dr. Chopra: That was amazing, right? Yeah? On your way to a super brain. 
(applause) 
>> Hey, are you ready to change your life for the better by turning your brain into a super brain? If so, please go to the phone right now and showour support for this public television station. Hello again, I'm greg sherwood here for one more final intermission with the host of "super brain," dr. Rudy tanzi. Rudy, once again, thanks for doing this show and bringing it to pbs. 
>> Oh, are you kidding? It's my pleasure. I mean, to help pbs, I mean, how much pbs is helping everyone every day to keep their brains healthy. I mean, there's no other station that can keep your brain healthy like this than pbs. 
>> And we've got some wonderful ways to say thank you for your gift of support, including a package of tools that will give you and your family everything you need for building your super brains, and you should know this package is exclusive to pbs. You're not gonna find it anywhere else starting at the affordable $60-a-year membership level. We'll say thank you with the dvd that includes everything we just televised in the lecture, plus, an extensive audience q&a. Now, if you can move up to that $144 level of support, we'll show our appreciation with "super brain, a user's manual." This life-changing multimedia learning system includes all the keys to turning your brain into a super brain. You're gonna enjoy three books, a seven dvd library including the program dvd and six other DVDs DESIGNED TO HELP YOU IN Specific areas of concern like weight loss, money management, issues with willpower, self-improvement and everything you need to know that science can tell us about alzheimer's. And you can start taking advantage of one of our breakthrough technologies right away, our "super brain" blissful sleep app. Just share your e-mail address with us so we can quickly send you the download code. And please remember, this package is a pbs exclusive so call the number on the screen or join safely and securely on the line. It's an exclusive package and it's going away in a few minutes so we need your call and your gift of support right now. I've just got a few more minutes to spend a little time with rudy. And rudy, I know that a lot of people watching are just like me and I just mentioned one of the facets of the "super brain" user manual package is, you know-- willpower is a big issue whether you're ting to stay--you know, lose that 5 or 10 or 20 pounds or you're trying to get yourself up off the couch and exercise. You have some interesting ideas that are outlined or infused this whole package about willpower. 

[01:14:19]


>> Yes, greg. I mean, we argue that willpower is not the way to do it. I mean, willpower suggests that you have to work against the resistance of, you know--as i mentioned your reptilian brain is saying, you know, "give me more food, you know, be aggressive." So with willpower, you're trying to resist what your brain is doing. And whenever there's resistance, there's going to be persistence. This is a rule, resistance leads to persistence. So instead of willpower, we're telling you just make over your brain. Redo it, a redo. Rewire, remodel, reshape, and it's actually really easy. That's the idea behind "super brain." When you follow the steps in the DVDs, THE MANUAL, THE GETTING Started manual, the book, okay? You will actually reshape your brain so you won't even need willpower, you're gonna do the right things naturally. You'll be on that path. It's amazing how well it works. 
>> Now, I've got to ask you another thing 'cause this is sort of--i don't think I ever thought of this before, but you're saying that if we understand the technologies and the science of how our brain works and we take some of these technologies and incorporate them, make them part of--automatically part of our life, we actually can end up being happier? 
>> Yes, and you know, we're not just telling--giving you self-help advice and saying trust us, believe us. In the book, we give very, very simple, but very interesting and intriguing information about the newest breakthroughs in brain research. We back up what we say, okay? And when your brain, you know, when you read this and your brain knows that there's something behind this, we're not just saying, "hey, you know, be happier, have a positive attitude." We're telling you that the brain works this way and here's how you need to do it. This is all the idea behind "super brain," reshaping your brain to benefit you to the max. 
>> You know, public broadcasting has been here for decades, for all of us. Maybe you were fortunate enough as I was to grow up with it and watch it grow and change. And you know, with all the changes in the technology of the world and the digital world, one might say, "well, what do you need a public broadcasting system for anymore? There's so many other things to do and watch and play with. But when you think about it, it's really a question of quality. Where else on the 500 channel dial do you still see the kind of quality and the commitment to education you find here on your pbs station? It's worth watching and it's wohy of your support.

>> You know, this package that we've been outlining is really incredible. It's got so many benefits in so many areas. You know, I've got to ask you, it feels a little bit like it's too good to be true, but your argument is the science is there. 
>> You know, the thing is, when you work with your brain and you learn how to rewire and refine and retune your brain, you know, nothing's too good to be true. I mean, the science is all there. We know what the brain can do. We're still learning what the brain can do. All we're doing with this package is saying, based on what we know the brain can do and based on how the brain can change in response to your own mind, and we show some of these exercises, you have the power right now to refine your brain into a super brain. And that's when all these things get easier, the relationships, you're healthier, you stave off the ravages of aging on your brain. All these things come with just learning how to work with your brain rather than against your brain. And that's what we teach you in this package. You know, as a scientist, I'm not gonna come out here and be a salesperson. I just want to help people. That's what I do, 24/7. I do research to help people and make their lives better. And I really believe this will help people, and that's why I'm here doing this. You know, not a lot of scientists who are working, you know, in the lab every day are doing this type of thing. I'm doing this because I believe that millions, tens of millions of people can have better lives if they follow these instructions. I firmly believe this, and so that's why I hope you'll call and not only support pbs but make your life better. Reshape your brain to work with you and the benefits would just blow your mind. 
>> Hi, I'm dr. Deepak chopra here.

Deepak chopra have put into this package, now is the time to make that call or find your way over to the website. And it really is, you know, rudy, I was thinking about it once again, we're asking people for $144 a year in support of this public station to get this incredible package, but there are literally tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of information, if you take the amount of research that both of you have applied to making this technology and synthesizing it in this way, it really is a simple yet comprehensive package. 
>> Yeah, you know, greg, I've been researching the brain and the genes that work to shape the brain for three decades now and I've tried to distill this information down to a simple level concentrating on the newest breakthroughs that are most exciting for realizing the incredible potential of the brain. And the conclusion I came to in, you know, especially working with deepak chopra is that mind over brain is the answer. When you take control of your brain and say, "you know what, I'm going to work with you, brain. I'm gonna refine you and tune you up so you can work, for me, the best." And then you get this incredible positive feedback loop. Your mind is helping your brain. Your brain gets stronger, helps your mind and then this goes on and on every day with the help of this information. And the next thing you know, your whole life changes. It's just great. 
>> It's really getting down to the wire here and we'd love to get your financial gift of support right now.

[00:14:36]


>> Und??cima semana de "Idolos de la canci??n". Los clasificados pasan directamente a las semifinales. Vamos primero al primer clasificado. Comienzo con Mar??a Conchita Alonso primero. ??Por qu?? y qui??n es el primer clasificado? 
>> Primer clasificado para m?? es una persona que la primera vez que o?? a este artista cantar, no me asombr??, no me gust??. Es m??s, cuando la volv?? a escuchar, o lo volv?? a escuchar, dije, pero, ay, ni me acordaba. Y hoy de verdad que me Hoy no, las anteriores tambi??n me sorprendi??, pero hoy m??s que Mu y bien y aqu?? esta enrrique y no recibi?? tan buenas criticas en la ultima actuacion y estoy dispuesto a sacr la espinita. 
> >> Pero tu eres un hombre que se dedica ala muM??sica?. 
>>> Si , la verdad y esta es una etapa que estoy viviendo y me gusta. 
>>> Que tal con el tema de esta noche. 
>>> Bien he trabaajdo con las nota saltas y muchas gracias adelante y vamos a la capsula de las tranformaicon y dejamos a alejandro fernandez Y ahora qui esta con el apluso lo decireci tendrmoemos . . . . . . . . . . . . . M??s all?? de la raz??n . . 

[00:19:14]


(Aplausos). 
>> Ah?? est??, Enrique Orozco! A Jackie Guerrido le gust?? mucho, porque qued?? contenta, la vi hasta cantar el tema. 
>> Content??sima, yo creo que yo siento por dentro todo lo que ellos tienen que hacer. 
>> Ah! 
>> Y yo aprieto muscularmente, yo pienso que eso les va a ayudar a hacer, lo que yo les digo siempre que hagan, eh, eh, hoy, has demostrado que puedes cantar esos agudos en el tono de Alejandro Fern??ndez. S??, se??or! 
>> Le cambio ahora el apellido a Arredondo, porque le dije de una compa??era del canal el apellido, pero se lo cambio, ??qu?? pas??, Maury, algo no te gust??? 
>> Realmente, Enrique, Alejandro Fern??ndez, hoy te mereces que este p??blico se ponga en pie y te d?? un aplauso. 
>> ??Ser?? el p??blico? Porque los compa??eros, mira lo que piensan los compa??eros de ??l. 
>> El que siento un poco, tambi??n d??bil, es a Alejandro Fern??ndez, porque su f??sico no es tan parecido como Alejandro, pero s?? tiene mucha potencia y mucho parecido en la voz. 
>> La persona que es m??s d??bil, yo veo en este momento, en esta etapa del concurso es Kike, o sea Alejandro Fern??ndez, porque ya en esta etapa est??n luchando mucho con su parecido, aunque tiene una gran voz, pero en el parecido, pues, le falta un poquito m??s. 
>> Mar??a Conchita Alonso. 
>> Mira, Enrique, si estuvi??semos en la ??poca de oro, la de Ednita y la m??a, hace muchos a??os, ya salieras de aqu?? con un contrato con un sello disquero. 
>> Y, entonces, ??qu?? pas?? con la ??poca de oro, Ednita? 
>> Bueno, yo sigo en la m??a, perfectamente. 

[00:21:15]


(Risas). 
>> Claro. 
>> No, no, se??or, perd??n, Ednita, las cosas no son como estaban en nuestras ??pocas. 
>> Bueno, para alguna gente, para m?? est?? maravillosamente. 
>> Bueno, no s??, yo no estoy hablando de ti y de m??, yo estoy hablando de que hoy d??a, ning??n sello disquero va a salir a contratar a nadie, porque es muy dif??cil. 
>> ??Qui??n sabe, ya? Oye, para el gusto los colores. 
>> Hay que gastarse millones de d??lares. 
(Ambas hablan a la vez). 
>> Bueno, aqu?? lo que importa es calificarlo, Ednita, como imitador de Alejandro Fern??ndez. 
>> Yo, yo, la verdad, que mis respetos, estoy de acuerdo con Maury que hizo un trabajo incre??ble, los ados, hoy no desafinaste nada, nada, nada. Y el trabajo corporal, de verdad que se nota mucho los gestos en la cara, tu lenguaje corporal, verdad, te felicito, porque lo hiciste muy bien. 
>> Y cuando se trata de la imitaci??n, el siguiente concursante se lo toma muy en serio, es Edgardo, el imitador, que te tir?? un poco a ti, el imitador de Jos?? Feliciano; quisimos saber, c??mo ha sido para ??l la experiencia de imitar, esto fue lo que nos respondi??. 
>> Para m?? ha sido una experiencia bien, bien gratificante, bien edificante, el imitar a Jos?? Feliciano. Ya que es un puertorrique??o, un ??cono puertorrique??o para la historia, ya que fue ganador de un Grammy, primer crossover en Grammy americano, tambi??n, este, cambi?? la forma de cantar el himno americano. Me he identificado mucho, mucho, mucho con ??l, porque es un puertorrique??o para la historia, un puertorrique??o que, de verdad, ha puesto mi isla en alto. 
>> Y aqu?? est?? Edgardo Espinoza, cuid??ndose y parece que esto siempre le, le, le produce emoci??n, Edgardo. 
>> S??, me llena de mucha emoci??n, porque s?? conoc?? a Jos?? Feliciano, pero no es hasta que llego aqu??, a imitarlo realmente, aqu?? en S??bado Gigante, que logro ver su grandeza, como artista y como ser humano. 

[00:23:18]


>> Bueno, la ??ltima vez no te criticaron muy bien la canci??n, por lo menos Maury no te critic?? bien la canci??n "T?? me haces falta". 
>> Bueno, yo entiendo que dentro de este concurso, este, he hecho baladas, he hecho canciones movidas, de pop, entonces, la canci??n de "Me haces falta" es una canci??n cl??sica de Jos?? Feliciano. Jos?? Feliciano es un bolerista. 
>> ??Qu?? voy a hacer sin ti? 
>> Aj??. 
>> Ese es el tema que vas a hacer hoy d??a. 
>> Ese es el tema. 
>> Y, ??qu?? tal ese desaf??o? 
>> Bueno, ese desaf??o, ahora es una balada completamente m??s moderna que tiene retos vocales mucho m??s grandes. 
>> Bueno, vamos, entonces, a la c??psula de las transformaciones, mucha suerte esta noche y ya estamos pr??cticamente al final del concurso, adelante. Ah?? est?? en la c??psula de las transformaciones, y ahora s??, Jos?? Feliciano cantando. Pasaste por mi lado . Con cruel indiferencia . Tus ojos ni siquiera . Voltearon hacia m?? . Te vi sin que me vieras . 
>> Ah?? est?? la c??psula de las transformaciones. Transformado en Jos?? Feliciano, llega hasta esta etapa, la n??mero 11, Edgardo Espinoza, que nos trae el tema "??Qu?? voy a hacer sin ti?" Edgardo Espinoza como Jos?? Feliciano. 
(Aplausos). 
>> Buenas noches, y dice: . ??Qu?? voy a hacer sin ti? . Cuando te vayas . ??Qu?? voy a hacer sin ti? . Cuando no est??s . Mi barca se ir?? a anclar en otra playa . Y t?? vas a olvidar mis noches junto a m?? . ??Qu?? voy a hacer sin ti? . Si todo se derrumba . Despu??s de conocerte . ??Qu?? voy a hacer sin ti? . El sol se olvidar?? de mi ventana . Y sumido en las sombras quedar?? . Abr??zame, di que no ha sido una aventura . Dime que t?? tambi??n me extra??ar??s . Demu??strame que aqu?? no se termina . Y que este adi??s de hoy no es el final . ??Qu?? voy a hacer sin ti? . Si todo se derrumba . ??Qu?? voy a hacer sin ti al despertar? . Mis manos apretadas a tu ausencia . ??Qu?? voy a hacer sin ti, mi amor? . Si te vas . ??Qu?? voy a hacer sin ti, mi amor? . SI te vas . 

[00:27:16]


(Aplausos). 
>> Ah?? est?? Edgardo Espinoza. 
>> Muchas gracias. 
>> Vamos a ver qu?? dice Ednita Nazario, vamos a ver esa opini??n, mientras llega aqu?? don Edgardo Espinoza. 
>> Bueno, esta ha sido una de las veces que m??s, he escuchado m??s a Edgardo y un poquito menos a Feliciano, la voz, creo que, creo que, a pesar de que suena s??per bien, porque cantas muy bien, te alejaste un poquito de Feliciano en esta canci??n. Indudablemente todo tu, todo tu, toda tu, la Bueno, esa es mi opini??n, todo tu lenguaje corporal es Feliciano, y de verdad, por momentos lograste vocalmente acercarte m??s a ??l, pero creo que te alejaste un poquito. 
>> A ver, ??qu?? dice Maury? 
>> Bueno, yo quiero comenzar, antes de ir con Feliciano, realmente lo tengo que decir, porque la ??ltima vez Raphy puede decir ue mis espect??culos son aburridos, eso que yo acabo de ver es un desastre, es una cosa antigua y horrible, lo que acabamos de ver con las bailarinas. 
>> Pero una cosa, ??c??mo algo tan moderno te parece antiguo? Si antes no se hac??a. 
>> No, no, no, es antiguo, es aburrido, en vez de ayudarnos, realmente nos afectas, pero vamos a pasar a Feliciano. 
>> Est??s dolido conmigo. 
>> Yo creo que, yo creo que lo que est?? pasando, es que Edgardo, Feliciano, me da la sensaci??n que est??s en un lugar un poco c??modo y no ha pasado lo que ha pasado con Alejandro, con Enrique, que ven??a de ser lastimado y golpeado y se est?? levantando como un guerrero, siento que est??s en un lugar un poco, un poco confortable y no s?? si eso te est?? ayudando, habr??a que apretar. 
>> Muy bien, vamos a ver qu?? dice Mar??a Conchita Alonso. 
>> Yo siempre, creo que, yo he sido una de las que siempre he estado a tu lado, siempre te he apoyado, me parece que cantas, toca la guitarra s??per bien, pero opino que esta noche, fue tu noche, la m??s floja de todas. No tu voz, pero, pero, s?? te falt?? algo, esta noche no me atrapaste como todas las noches anteriores. 

[00:29:36]


>> Bueno, esto ha sido una etapa dif??cil tambi??n para Edgardo, ??no? 
>> Bueno, s??, definitivamente es bien dif??cil, yo vine, pues, obviamente no es para poner excusas, pero yo vine de enterrar a mi pap?? la semana pasada, y eso me causa, eso me causa mucho, mucho dolor. 
>> Te agradecemos el esfuerzo, de verdad, porque sabemos todo. 
>> Ah?? est?? la foto donde est?? ??l ah?? con, con su pap?? y tambi??n, por supuesto, lo lamentamos, ??l se ha superado para estar aqu?? esta noche. Ya conocimos a los tres participantes de hoy, le voy a pedir al jurado que inicie ya sus deliberaciones para que no me digan "me tengo que ir", "no s??" estas son las etapas finales, hay que estar muy claro qui??n se va y qui??n se queda, contigo. 
>> Don Francisco, que entre, obviamente, entre m??s pasan las semanas, peor se pone la cosa. Aqu?? yo tengo a los dos chicos que est??n bastante nerviosos, pero especialmente t??, Enrique, o sea, lleg?? aqu?? atr??s, Don Francisco, y estaba temblando, ??qu?? pas??, cu??l fue la diferencia entre tu participaci??n pasada y esta? 
>> Pues, como acaba de decir Maury, yo ven??a ya con ese trabajo doble, de sacarme la espina de lo que hab??a hecho y lo que hab??a pasado la semana anterior y ahora, bueno, queriendo resurgir y dar, de verdad, pelea, para poder estar metido en la final y entre los mejores, entonces, fue como, fue demasiada adrenalina. 
>> Vamos a ver qu?? pasa, y usted, no se mueva, porque al regresar vamos a ver qui??n se va y qui??n se queda, en esta d??cimo primera semana de "Idolos de la canci??n", despu??s tenemos mucho humor, aqu?? en S??bado Gigante, no te muevas que regresamos. . 
>> SI usted nota que su ser querido se desorienta en tiempo, lugar o est?? muy pasivo, podr??a ser algo m??s que una se??al de vejez, estos podr??an ser los signos de la enfermedad de alzheimer de leve a moderada, los hispanos de entre 65 y 84 a??os, tenemos 1,5 m??s probabilidades de padecer esta enfermedad que las personas blancas mayores no hispanas, consulte a un m??dico sobre estos y otros cambios que est?? viendo en su ser querido; usted no est?? solo, act??e ahora. Para m??s informaci??n busque "Salud" en Univision.com. ??????. 

[00:35:11]


>> Und??cima semana de "Idolos de la canci??n". Los clasificados pasan directamente a las semifinales. Vamos primero al primer clasificado. Comienzo con Mar??a Conchita Alonso primero. ??Por qu?? y qui??n es el primer clasificado? 
>> Primer clasificado para m?? es una persona que la primera vez que o?? a este artista cantar, no me asombr??, no me gust??. Es m??s, cuando la volv?? a escuchar, o lo volv?? a escuchar, dije, pero, ay, ni me acordaba. Y hoy de verdad que me Hoy no, las anteriores tambi??n me sorprendi??, pero hoy m??s que nunca. Yo pienso que la que debe de completamente quedarse, el artista que debe quedarse es Laura. 
>> Laura Hern??ndez. Vamos a ver qu?? dice Mauri Stern. 
>> Laura, Laura, Laura! 
>> Sin duda es verdad, un artista que comenz?? en un lugar irreconocible, no te acordabas de este personaje, no lo conectabas. Y hoy es su ??dolo, hoy es la artista. Por lo mismo Natalia Jim??nez, Laura, tiene que ser clasificada. 
>> Primera clasificada pasa a la semifinal. Y ahora, en esta semifinal, tambi??n las votaciones son m??s exigentes, y el que se va, por supuesto, no regresa; pero ha llegado a un muy buen lugar porque son los ??ltimos 6 finalistas y despu??s de esta eliminaci??n quedan 5. Empiezo con, vamos a comenzar con Ednita Nazario. 
>> A pesar de que esta persona tiene, ha hecho una mejor??a extraordinaria y ha hecho un trabajo excepcional, entiendo que el f??sico no le ayuda mucho para parecerse, estamos buscando a ??dolos de la canci??n, estamos buscando imitaci??n, trabajo, f??sico. Y aunque me duela en el alma porque me encant?? el trabajo que hizo hoy, yo creo que se debe ir Alejandro Fern??ndez. 

[00:37:42]


>> Muy bien, vamos a ver qu?? dice Mauri Stern. 
>> Sin duda, para m?? la constancia y cada programa se mide los escalones que tienen que llegar y que subir, aunque ha tenido una trayectoria impecable, incre??ble y siempre nos ha sorprendido, hoy no logr?? ese efecto en m??. Por lo mismo, para m?? Feliciano, Edgardo, se tiene que ir. 
>> Muchas gracias. Todav??a no sabemos, Enrique Orozco, tenemos un voto y un voto. Y ahora Mar??a Conchita Alonso tiene la decisi??n final qui??n se va. 
>> Ustedes como que se ponen de acuerdo pa' dejarme a m?? el ??Ah? 
>> Por supuesto que no. 
>> ??C??mo no? 
>> Nosotros hemos sido honestos y lo que pensamos. Asume la responsabilidad. 
>> Yeah, sure. 
>> Mar??a Conchita. 
>> S??, se??or. No es porque uno sea mejor que el otro, porque en realidad los dos no son grandes concursantes y no son grandes artistas.

(Aplausos). 
>> Alejandra, Alejandra, la pregunta es para ti. ??Te sacaron, no te sacaron as?? con anillo del altar? 

[02:04:18]


>> Don Francisco, si yo me salgo de mi casa sin casarme mi pap?? me regresa de las gre??as, as?? le voy a decir que me sal?? de la casa casada y de blanco. 
(Risas). 
>> Perfecto, bueno y aqu?? tenemos al equipo de los hombres. T??, Lucas, ??qu?? dices de la misma pregunta? Porque es un anticipo de lo que vamos a discutir. 
>> Convivir, casarse es complicado. 
>> Complicado. 
>> Convivir, definitivamente.

>> Vamos, corre el tiempo, corre el tiempo.

>> Oyeme, avanzaron bastante m??s los hombres que las mujeres, ah. 
>> Como siempre. 

[02:06:18]


>> Las mujeres todav??a estaban enredadas all?? arriba, no llegaron nunca. 
>> Ellas siempre est??n enrolladas, Don Francisco, nos necesitan a nosotros, ??s?? o no? Para solucionarle los problemas. 
>> Por favor. 
>> Claro que s??. 
>> Con ciertas oportunidades que les damos. 
>> Ya hablamos con los hombres y dijimos que los hombres pensaban que el matrimonio era la tumba del amor, no. 
>> M??s o menos, m??s o menos. 
>> Don Francisco, yo le voy a decir por qu?? piensan eso. Hombre que piensa que el matrimonio es la tumba del amor, es porque no hay mujer que los aguante, sinceramente. 
(Aplausos). 
>> El primer paso hacia eso es el casamiento. 
>> Exacto! 
>> Yo les voy a decir algo, ya escuchamos la opini??n de ellos, nuestra opini??n, don Francisco, pero yo quiero que o escuchar lo que piensa la gente all?? en la casa o la calle, vamos a ver. 
>> Don Francisco, yo no creo en el matrimonio porque a mis hermanas, dos casadas, dos divorciadas, es mejor vivir en uni??n libre. 
>> Ya prob??, no me gust??, me parece que no, eso no es para m??, no, no, no. 
>> Y c??mo no voy a creer, hermano, si hace 23 a??os que estoy casado, que m??s remedio. 
>> Don Francisco, creo que el matrimonio es algo sagrado. 
>> Yo no creo en el matrimonio, porque las mujeres esclavizan a los hombres. 
>> ??Matrimonio yo? Nunca. 
>> Por supuesto que creo en el matrimonio, sino qui??n me lavara y me planchara, Don Francisco. 
(Aplausos). 
>> Exactamente, y aqu?? tenemos a quienes van a discutir esto. Un tema fuerte, por un lado tengo al actor Harry Geithner que no cree en el matrimonio. ??????. 
>> El otro actor, Germ??n Guti??rrez, que dice que no hay nada como casarse. 
>> Lo mejor. 
(Aplausos). 
>> Y yo que finalmente voy a ser el que, el que va hacer las preguntas, el ??rbitro, t?? eres un actor mexicano, m??s de 20 telenovelas, la m??s reciente "La que no pod??a amar", el papel de Ulises Hern??ndez, 20 a??os de carrera, 20 a??os de matrimonio, como yo, 50 a??os de carrera, 50 a??os de matrimonio, eso ya no existe, dos hijos, Gema de casi 19 a??os, y Claudio de casi 14. 
>> As?? es, casi 15. 

[02:08:18]


>> Casi 15. 
>> S??, s??, as?? es, entonces cu??ntame, ??porque t?? eres tan firme en decir que el matrimonio es lo mejor que hay? 
>> Porque mi esposa es mi complemento, somos el equipo perfecto, la verdad que he descubierto mi papel como var??n. 
(Aplausos). 
>> Cuando t?? le das el lugar a tu esposa, ella lo valora, ella se siente amada, cuando nos ponemos en los zapatos de ella, ella se siente halagada. 
>> Pero no se necesita un papel para eso. 
>> Bueno, que t?? tienes una experiencia. 
>> Claro, claro, no se necesita. 
>> Cuando haya amor >> Es que Harry tienen experiencia diferente, ??l convivi?? 10 a??os, se cas?? y de ah?? en adelante alcanz?? a durar, ??cu??nto tiempo casado? >?? Siete. 
>> Siete casado. 
>> Siete, s??. 
>> 10 conviv??a y siete casado. 
>> S??, como dicen se??ores, para vivir en el infierno hay que vivir en pareja. 
(Risas). 
>> S??, t?? no crees que el matrimonio te ayud?? en nada. 
>> Mire, yo tengo un concepto muy sencillo, gracias, un concepto muy sencillo, el matrimonio es muy bonito, pero hoy por hoy en la actualidad, se??or, se??ora, sean francos los novios, los que sean, no necesitan el papel, si el amor es todo, no se necesita, hay que tener una relaci??n m??s abierta, vivan juntos, que aprendan, para que no se complique, porque al final, se??ora, se??ores, uno nunca, esto es para que lo aprendan, uno nunca sabe con qui??n se cas??, hasta que uno se divorcia. 
>> Momentito, Alejandra, Alejandra esa es una respuesta que hasta el productor general estuvo de acuerdo. 
>> Don Francisco. 
>> Yo quiero que adem??s t?? tengas opiniones de todas tus mujeres, y t?? Alejandro Chava de todos los hombres. 
>> Tengo de todos lados y hasta de las redes sociales. 
>> A ver, qu?? dicen las redes sociales en este momento. 
>> Me da hasta cierto punto un poquito de pena, porque se nota lo dolido que est?? y lo ardido por no decirlo. Mire, don Francisco Shyrla dej?? un mensaje y dice, creo que si no lo sabemos alimentar y mantener, y mantenemos los detalles, el amor se acaba. Hay otra que dice, yo pienso que uno dura m??s conviviendo que cuando se casan, he visto muchas relaciones que duran una eternidad y cuando se casan se divorcian al poco tiempo. 

[02:10:26]


>> Muy bien, ahora quiero saber qu?? opinan los hombres que est??n en el estudio. 
>> A ver. 
>> ??Qu?? opini??n tienen al respecto, Alejandro? 
>> A ver, ??qu?? opinas t??? A ver, Eliseo, p??rate aqu?? conmigo y cu??ntame, ??qu?? opinas t?? del matrimonio? ??Es la tumba del amor o no es la tumba del amor? 
>> Bueno, el matrimonio es lo principal en una pareja, cuando se unen ??no? Pero bueno, hay que tener mucha paciencia y mucha sabidur??a al est?? casado para mantener a una mujer ??no? 
>> Y Alejandra. 
>> Don Francisco, por aqu?? dice una en el Facebook de s??bado Gigante, dice no, la suegra manipuladora es la tumba del matrimonio. 
(Risas). 
>> Oh, oh. 
>> Muy bien, a ver, qu?? dice Alejandra. 
>> Es porque la suegra no es mi mam??, aqu?? va Luciana, y dime qu?? opina, yo s?? que t?? est??s a favor, ??cierto? 
>> S??, a favor, ya que el matrimonio es un compromiso por el cual x persona tiene mayor responsabilidad contigo y lealtad. 
>> Lo que pasa es que los que no se casan son irresponsables, ??cierto? 
>> Pero yo quiero agregar algo. 
>> A ver, Harry. 
>> Yo voy agregar algo, ok, a m?? me parece muy bonito esa cuesti??n del matrimonio, la boda y dem??s, pero seamos francos, primero es el romance, nos ilusionamos, somos muy j??venes, nos casamos, pasan un par de a??os ??y qu?? pasa? Que a la persona que tienes al lado la empiezas a odiar, entonces es mucho m??s f??cil, que no haya ning??n papel, nos evitamos mucho dinero, nos evitamos muchos problemas y nos evitamos. 
>> Harry, Harry, te lo est??s llevando al extremo, porque yo creo que justamente es cuando t?? piensas que se acab??, cuando le empiezas a ver todos los defectos a tu pareja, es cuando empieza el verdadero amor, el amor madura. 
>> D??jame hacerte una pregunta, ??en estos 20 a??os nunca tuviste una crisis que puso en peligro su matrimonio? 
>> Por supuesto, a los ocho a??os, estuvimos muy, muy mal. 
>> ??Y qu?? hiciste? 
>> Yo me acerqu?? al Consejo, al Consejo del que todo lo sabe y empec?? a aplicarlo en mi vida, en mi matrimonio y ha resultado. 
>> Yo tengo otra segunda pregunta. Yo tengo una pregunta, si es tan maravilloso el matrimonio, don Francisco, expl??queme, hoy por hoy, ??por qu?? hay m??s divorcios que matrimonios? 

[02:12:29]


>> Porque est??n buscando el enamoramiento, nada m??s est??n buscando pas??rsela bien, pero no tiene ning??n tipo de compromiso. 
>> Pas??rsela bien significa, ??qu?? cosa? 
>> Pues t?? sabes. 
>> No sigan. 
>> Ok. 
>> No sigan discutiendo, vamos, Alejandra y Alejandro, vamos a ir a unos mensajes, ??les parece bien? 
>> Claro que s??, don Francisco, yo quiero saber, qu?? es lo que la gente sigue opinando en su casa, la verdad. 
>> Claro que s??, mira ??t?? sabes bailar bachata? Me imagino que s??. 
>> Pues yo soy >> Pues vamos a bailar bachata, a bailar una bachatita porque ah?? viene m??s adelante Domenic y Luz R??os, que nos traen una sabrosa bachata, a ver. 
>> Te voy a ense??ar. ??????. Las fiesta son una epoca d edar y rfecibir y reunirte con tus seres querridos no hay mejor manera de revivir esto con esto y mi favorito es el mocca , c comparte tu espiritu navidi??o con starcbuck ??????. 

[02:16:21]


(Aplausos). 
>> No te emociones, Alejandro, no te emociones, d??jame vete para tu barra. 
>> Ay, perd??n, Don Francisco, seguimos con usted debatiendo le matrimonio. 
>> Bueno, aqu?? estamos, aqu?? estamos con las opiniones y volvemos nuevamente a preguntarte a ti, Germ??n, ya despu??s de todo lo que escuchaste, ??qu?? crees t??? El matrimonio es algo que, porque yo le preguntaba a las mujeres y las mujeres piensan que s??, le matrimonio, las mujeres s??, pero los hombres no. 
>> Por el vestido, el anillo. 
>> Me pregunt?? a m??. 
>> Perd??n. 
>> Est?? bien, ??por qu?? entonces? 
>> Yo pienso porque la mujer es m??s sensible que los hombres. 
>> ??Qu??? 
>> S??, s??, son m??s rom??nticas, ellas s?? tienen el sue??o de su pr??ncipe azul, pero no es f??cil. 
>> S??, pero t?? dijiste que hasta que un no se divorcia no conoce a su mujer. 
>> Gran verdad, se??ores, ??no es as??? 
>> S??! 
(Aplausos). 
>> ??Por qu?? es as??? 
>> Porque al principio, se lo voy a poner de esta manera, se lo voy a poner de esta manera, al principio nos conocemos, ponemos la cara m??s hermosa, nos amamos, nos besamos y todo, empieza la convivencia, empieza la monoton??a, ya no te besan igual, ??entonces qu??? Empiezan los pleitos, despu??s se separan y despu??s se est??n matando. 
>> Ah?? precisamente es cuando tiene que ser una decisi??n. 
>> Alejandra, t?? tienes ah?? a otra persona, no s?? si es tan fan del matrimonio o no. 
>> F??jese, Don Francisco. 
>> Porque hay hombres que no les parezca el matrimonio. 
>> Estaban diciendo que la mayor??a de las mujeres est??n a favor del matrimonio, pero aqu?? tengo a alguien que no. 
>> Estoy en contra. 
>> A ver, dime por qu??. 
>> As?? es. 
(Aplausos). 
>> Vete por este lado, vete por este lado, vente a nuestra barra. 
>> Quiero saber la raz??n. 
>> Yo estoy en contra porque no tengo la obligaci??n de estar ni fregando, ni lavando, ni cocinando y tengo libertad, pero eso me tom?? la libertad de venir a S??bado Gigante a disfrutar. 
>> Ella s?? sabe, Don Francisco, esa es la ??nica raz??n, la verdad. 
>> Inteligente. 
>> Bueno, vamos a pedirle ahora una votaci??n al p??blico, las personas que est??n de acuerdo con el matrimonio, que les parece que el matrimonio es bueno, aprieten en los votadores de ustedes saquen los primeros, van a apretar el n??mero uno, los que no creen en el matrimonio van a apretar el n??mero dos cuando yo les diga, no lo hagan todav??a, aprieten ahora por favor. 

[02:18:34]


>> Apoyen. 
>> Apoyen el matrimonio. 
>> Recuerden, el matrimonio es responsabilidad, no queremos tanto. 
>> Es muy importante, es importante la responsabilidad, claro que s??. 
>> ??Qui??n salv?? el matrimonio tuyo cuando estaba en crisis t?? o tu se??ora? 
>> Yo di el primer paso y ella me sigui??, nos pusimos de acuerdo, pusimos las reglas del juego y ahora las respetamos los dos y podemos vivir en armon??a. 
>> Vamos a ver en porcentaje, Rosina, de las mujeres, qui??nes votaron, ??Qu?? porcentaje est?? de acuerdo con el matrimonio, prefiere el matrimonio y qu?? porcentaje no? 
>> Don Francisco, como ya sabemos las mujeres, el porcentaje que?? est?? de acuerdo con el matrimonio es 64% y que est??n de acuerdo con el convivir nada m??s 36%. 
>> De aqu?? viene la pregunta para ti, Harry. 
(Aplausos). 
>> Fue tu se??ora la que despu??s de 10 a??os de convivencia te dijo cas??monos o fuiste t?? el que dijo cas??monos. 
>> Se lo voy a contestar diplom??ticamente. 
>> No, no, nada de diplomacia, cu??ntamelo como es. 
>> Pero, ??por qu?? me pone as?? hay c??maras? Bueno, fue una decisi??n de los. 
>> De los dos. 
>> S??, se??or. 
>> Don Francisco, debo decir qu?? pas??, eh, a como ??l est?? hablando de las mujeres que es m??s que obvio que le dieron una patada y lo mandaron a volar. 
(Aplausos). 
>> Estoy enamorada, ese es mi problema. 
>> ??Cu??ntos a??os de matrimonio llevas? 
>> Llevo solamente uno, pero te digo algo, cuando yo me cas??, me cas?? para toda la vida, por eso me cas??. 
>> Ok, hablamos en 5 a??os, hablamos en 5 a??os. 
>> Muy bien, vamos a ver Rosina cu??l ha sido el porcentaje de los hombres. 
>> La verdad, Don Francisco, incre??ble, para el matrimonio tenemos 12%, y los que est??n de acuerdo con convivir 88%. 

[02:20:34]


(Aplausos). 
>> Bueno, curiosamente bueno, ahora como tengo que mezclar a los hombres y las mujeres que tenemos en el estudio vamos a ver la votaci??n final, pero antes de ir a la votaci??n final le quiero agradecer a nuetros invitados, Harry Geithner, gracias por venir. 
>> Gracias, Don Francisco, ??puedo decir una ??ltima palabra? 
>> S??. 
>> A pesar de mis opiniones en el programa, definitivamente gran parte y de felicidad de mi vida fue en el matrimonio. 
>> Eso. 
(Aplausos). 
>> Gracias, Germ??n. 
>> Gracias, Don Francisco. 
>> Gracias por haber venido aqu?? al programa, yo, antes de ir al, bueno, vamos primero al resultado final y despu??s les puedo hacer un comentario, vamos Rosina. 
>> Don Francisco, al final de todo lo que gan?? aqu?? con nuestro p??blico es el n??mero 1 con 66% del matrimonio, eso es lo mejor que hay que hacer. 
>> Bueno, al final, matrimonio o no matrimonio hay algo que hubieses salido 99,9%, la vida en pareja es mucho mejor, matrimonio o convivencia es la vida en pareja, as?? que yo creo que la gente aqu?? vot?? en general por la vida en pareja. 
>> As?? es. 
>> As?? es.+ 
>> Vamos a un poco de amor, el +matrimonio y el amor son algo +serio, si lo toman como un +chiste les puede pasar lo mismo que a esta joven, miren. 
>> Manuel. 
>> S??. 
>> S??.+ 
>> ??Por qu?? a tu secretaria le dicen la mu??equita? 
>> Ah, porque ca 
>> Ay, t?? nunca te enteras ni siquiera de lo que pasa en el edificio. 
>> S??, pap??, mam?? tiene raz??n, apuesto que ni siquiera te enteraste que estoy embarazada. 
>> No, tampoco, ??eh? 
(Aplausos). 
>> Como siempre los hombres son los ??ltimos en enterarse. 
>> Es porque estamos pendientes de cosas mucho m??s importantes, por favor. 

[02:22:46]


>> No, tampoco, ??eh? 
(Aplausos). 
>> Como siempre los hombres son los ??ltimos en enterarse. 
>> Es porque estamos pendientes de cosas mucho m??s importantes, por favor. 
>> Claro como eso, d??jame decirte que muero de celos y muero por dentro, me duele el alma y el coraz??n. 
>> Oh, guau, muchacho, un momentito ya va, dime por favor que hoy no te he amado, dime por favor que te mueres de celos, necesito escucharlo, dime por favor aunque sea una mentira. 
>> Muero de celos pero no te emociones porque as?? es el nombre de la bachata que nos traen ahora este d??o de sangre mexicana dominicana y Puertorrique??a a bailar se ha dicho pegadito con este aplauso ellos son Domenic Marte y Luz R??os. 
(Aplausos). ??????. ??????. ??? Bajo una lluvia de estrellas ???. ??? Un par de copas de vino ???. ??? Tu envuelto en sus brazos ???. ??? En pa??os de seda ya te imagino ???. ??? Y mientras tu arrepentida ???. ??? Por dejarme marchar ???. ??? Te mata solo pensar ???. ??? Que ??sta noche quiz??s ella me vuelva a amar ???. ??? No lo puedo aceptar ???. ???

T?? mueres por dentro ???. ??? Muero de amor ???. 

[02:25:51]


(Aplausos). 
>> Muero de celos, Luz R??os, Domenic Marte, bachata rom??ntica, ??c??mo est??s, Luz? 
>> Muy bien, Don Francisco. 
>> Te vamos a poner en el medio as?? para poder conversar >> Claro, s??. 
>> Con los dos porque de Domenic conozco algo de su historia que se inici?? en Lorens all?? en Massachusetts en una ciudad industrial, donde Domenic t?? estuviste ah?? el 70%, el 70% de la gente son hispanos. 
>> Claro que s??. 
>> Y a los 7, todo con 7, a los 7 a??os empezaste cantar. 
>> Claro que s??. 
>> Y tu pap?? trabajaba en una f??brica de zapatos. 
(Risas). 
>> ??Y c??mo t?? sabes todo esto? 
(Risas). 
>> Don Francisco, sabe todo. 
>> No, no, no, pero yo s?? que t?? eres una cantautora mexicana pop que tiene 7 discos, que te lanzaste a la fama cuando Joan Sebasti??n justamente grab?? el tema aire junto a ti. 
>> S??, no bueno, fue una experiencia maravillosa que por cierto tuve ese honor de compartir ese tema con usted, Don Francisco, hace ya qu??, tres a??os, dios m??o y estamos content??simos de estar aqu?? con usted celebrando sus 50 a??os, un aplauso para Don Francisco, de verdad que gracias por tanta energ??a, tanto shows maravillosos que nos ha dado, de verdad que muchas gracias. 
>> ??Y qu?? piensas del tema que est??bamos discutiendo, convivir o casarse? 
>> Bueno, para m?? casarse, yo creo que la persona tiene que estar con ese ser amado, yo soy felizmente casada y, y amo a mi marido y yo creo que, que viva el amor, el amor siempre tiene que ser lo m??s importante en, en todo el mundo, sin amor no hay nada. 
>> Domenic. 
>> Don Francisco, ??sabe algo? T?? dijiste algo de 70% de los que son latinos en Lorens, cuando tuve un americanito que llega por ah?? as?? calladito, t?? dices, hay problemas aqu??, ??Qu?? es lo que est?? haciendo este por esta zona aqu??? Porque t?? no ves ning??n americano caminando por la zona ah?? Lorens, Massachusetts, es puro latino, ??t?? sabes qu?? quiere decir eso, verdad? Pura bachata, pura salsa, puro merengue y latino por toda esquina. 

[02:27:53]

Rye through contributions to your pbs station from viewers like you. Thank you. Inside you already is all the freedom that you'll ever need, power to make things happen, and the flow that you're looking for in your life. All you need is a system for understanding what you already have and how to use it. I'm a teacher of that system, called t'ai chi. 
Narrator: Gain the physical, mental and spiritual balance that is the basis of this ancient wisdom practice. Join david-dorian ross, t'ai chi teacher and eight-time national champion, as he introduces you to basic t'ai chi moves, 
when t'ai chi: Health and happinessairs next. Hello, welcome. Welcome. It's so nice to have you here. You know, some folks who are here today have done a lot of t'ai chi, and some folks have no experience at all, just like the people who are watching in the television viewing audience. Some of you have had some t'ai chi experience and some not at all. So, you're all welcome. And I want to say that I'm really honored to be here on public television. You know, people have been asking me for years, isn't t'ai chi very difficult? Isn't t'ai chi something you have to study for years before you can show it off in public? But I tell people, if you can wave your hands, you can do t'ai chi, right? Let's prove it. Let's take your left hand and just wave. Just "wave, hey, hello, how are you?" So, let me tell you right off the top that what I'm doing while I'm instructing you is mirroring you. If I say right, you go right. If I say left, you go left. It doesn't matter what I'm doing. Across, and up, and right to left. And the right hand scoops under and across, left to right, and down, and scoop. Let's get both hands going, across, and circle. Oh, that's awesome. Look at that. Beautiful. One more time, across, let's come back to the middle, and float down. That's wonderful, wonderful. What you have just done is a movement from t'ai chi called waving hands like clouds. I'm so excited to share with you in this program something that I've done for the last 35 years of my life, all right. It's called t'ai chi, and t'ai chi is something for everyone. You don't need to be a certain age. You don't need to be a certain fitness level. You don't need to be a certain religion or philosophy, because it's a practice that combines everything that everyone needs, right, physical exercise, philosophy, guidelines for life, ancient wisdom, but it's also practical. The principles of t'ai chi, you know, informed by the movements that I was just doing, can transform your life, transform your health, transform everything that happens to you. To kind of get us started, I thought I would tell you a little bit about where t'ai chi comes from, what's the origin of t'ai chi. And to do this, we have to cast our minds back almost 2,000 years to a time in ancient china when there was a terrible flood. The waters of the yellow river overflowed their banks, wiping out whole villages and sending people into the countryside. And after the floodwaters receded, plague arose, such a terrible plague that the emperor himself decided to take his personal physician and send him out into the countryside to find out what made people so sick. The physician came back, and he told the emperor, "i've discovered an amazing thing." He said, "i've discovered that people are like water. When they're moving, when they're flowing, it's healthy. But when they stop moving and become stagnant, pestilence arises." And the emperor's physician, a man named hua tuo, said, well, I discovered something else, the people are getting sick, but none of the animals are getting sick. The animals are still healthy. And you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go back out into the countryside and teach people how to move like the animals. And that way, they'll never get stagnant, they'll never get sick. This is one of the oldest forms of t'ai chi-related practice called the frolic of the five animals, all right, and the five animals are the animals that he found in the forest. There's the tiger. Do this with me. So, yes, the tiger with his claws up and the big tiger's mouth there, the tiger that pounces. There's the deer, got to stick the deer's horns out there, who twists and turns and gallops forward. Yes, there's the bear, the bear who kind of lumbers along, he's very loose in the shoulders and he's kind of, you know, waddles back and forth, there's the bear. All right, the monkey, the monkey, who's very quick, right, grabs little things, and he's always on the lookout for something that he might steal, right, is the monkey. And finally, the bird, the crane with his big wings, rising up in the air and floating on the wind, yes. See, these movements that you're doing right now, this is the origin of what we turn into t'ai chi. Hua tuo made an amazing discovery, but the consequences of his discovery went far beyond health and fitness, and it became not just about medical practice or, you know, something that will make you feel better, but something that would actually be an approach for your entire life, having an abundance of good health, having a sense of clarity of mind and creativity, of great relationships, you know. If you've ever felt like you'd like to have it all, let me suggest to you that what you are really looking for is something very simple. Balance. Think about this. When your life is in balance, everything works. And when your life is out of balance, everything begins to break down. Balance is the combination of three basic experiences, three dynamic experiences that we call freedom, flow and power. And I can assure you that the best thing about t'ai chi, the best thing about this concept of balance is that you already have all three of them, inside you already is all the freedom that you'll ever need, the power to make things happen, and the flow that you're looking for in your life. All you need is a system for understanding what you already have and how to use it. I'm a teacher of that system called t'ai chi. So in our time together, I'm going to teach you how to find your balan, how to stay in balance as much as possible, and how to regain your balance just in case you happen to lose it. You don't need a special room or a special piece of machinery or magic shoes or a potion or something like that. You already have everything that you need to do t'ai chi. So let's kind of do a little t'ai chi exercise while we're doing this, all right. I want to have you all scoot forward in your chairs for just a moment. This is sort of the first lesson of t'ai chi. If you're at home watching, move forward on your chair so that you can tuck the tailbone under a little bit, right, and float the head up. In the ancient writings about t'ai chi, we talk about posture, using the word pearl. They say the spine is suspended from above, like a string of pearls, so here's your head, floating up like the top pearl, and here's the rest of your spine floating down. Tailbone tucks under, the head floats up, and in the middle the spine stretches out, becoming longer and straighter and more comfortable. You know, a question that people ask me all the time: How does t'ai chi give you all these great benefits? So I want to answer this from the chinese perspective, by talking about a word we call chi, the life force, the spirit breath. And when you're in good posture, when you're moving through space in a certain way, your chi, your life energy, moves in a balanced and harmonious fashion. That's one of the sources of the benefits that you get out of t'ai chi. Another way of looking at this might be from the western perspective, and saying, you know, that as much as we might want to stay in balance and be in balance, the fact is that most of us develop great imbalances in life, and here's why. We have a habit of always moving away from what hurts, right, and moving towards what's more comfortable. We move away from the weaker sides of ourselves and towards the sides that are stronger. So we wind up with these weird postures and odd sort of angles of our body. This is what we technically call a compensation pattern. I'm compensating for what hurts or what's weak, right. But here's the thing. Compensation patterns, by definition, lead to advanced wear and tear. They actually age you faster. So, t'ai chi corrects those imbalances, bring you back out of those compensation patterns, and literally turns back the aging clock. So, from a western perspective, this is another source of the benefits of t'ai chi. So, let's review really quickly what leads to balance, these three experiences-- freedom, flow and power. And throughout the show today, I'm going to continue to talk about them and reframe our conversation and our experience together. Let's start with the first one, the idea of freedom. And just to kind of give you a sense of what that means, when my mother was 70, for her 70th birthday, she decided to go skydiving. 

[00:10:10]


[Audience chuckles] yeah, that's the reaction I had. When I tell people about my mother, I get a lot of interesting reactions. I get people who say, you know, oh, I would never go sky-- jump out of a plane, are you kidding, I could never do that, you know, or I shouldn't do that. You know, this is what we, you hear that, shouldn't, can't, won't, mustn't, have to, always, never? It's what we call the language of constraint. It's a narrowing down, a limitation of our lives. It's what I call "i can't." That's the opposite of freedom. Freedom is "i can." "I can't" is out of balance. "I can" is moving towards balance, where everything is possible. The traditional way of talking about t'ai chi is I say I am playing t'ai chi. So, that's what we're going to do today, right, we're going to play, you're going to play with us at home. And in fact, I think we should just get into some motion here, to feel what it feels like to be playing t'ai chi. Let the hands be relaxed by your sides, as you are scooting forward on your chair and getting the tailbone tucked under, getting the head to float up here. And then let the hands float up in front, nice and easy. Oh, yes, and then float down again. Imagine--i'm going to give you a little thought exercise here. Imagine that you're sitting in a hot tub... And the hands are floating on the surface of the water, so the water flows in, the hands begin to float, and they float a little higher and a little higher, and when the water reaches about chest high, it shuts off and then you settle down into your chair and you say, aahh. That was good. See, that is the way t'ai chi is supposed to feel, like you're not even moving, like something is moving or flowing you, all right, just flowing and floating. Together, the hands by youdes and float up, and down. Ah, you can say aahh if you want to, yeah, and float back up again. And now I want you to round your arms out like you're hugging a big tree and open side to side. Now we're going to round out our arms like we're holding a ball, a big beach ball against our chest, with the right hand on top. The other right hand. There we go. And open side to side, and now left hand on top. So we have open and right hand on top, a kind of a closing or a gathering, and an open and come back to hugging the tree. And now we have a floating down, aahh. And a floating up, so we have up, down, open, close, hug the tree, open, back to hugging the tree, and down. Doesn't that feel nice, right? Well, so this is what most people relate to t'ai chi as, these movements that kind of, what, flow, which is the second principle, second element of balance, of harmony, is a sense of flow. Today what I want to do is share with you four simple t'ai chi flows, or t'ai chi movements. Okay, so I'm going to break down these movements for you, and I want you to follow along with us at home. And in fact, I want you to do it iyour chair. There's a lot of students that I work with all the time who are not ready to stand up and do the footwork, which we're going to add a little bit later in the program, but they start out in the chair, or maybe they even continue in the chair, so you can continue in the chair yourself. So, just be in your chair. Scoot forward. Let's go back to standing on the edge of the chair with your head top floating up, right. And as we do these movements, I'm also going to give you some basic rules, some guidelines to follow as you're, you know, doing the movements together. And here's rule number 1, flow rule number 1: Smile, slow down and breathe. Aahh. Right, smile, slow down and breathe. Very nice. Okay, hands relaxed by your sides. The first movement is called opening the door, right... The commencement of the movements, the hands float up in front of the body, not too high, just about chest high, then elbows heavy, everything floats down. Just like we did before, this is the first movement, opening the door. Let's float back up again. So, that's simple enough, so I think I'm just going to tack on the next movement, which is actually the last movement of the whole sequence. Circle your arms around, crossing the wrists at the bottom, and float up, now pause, and just aahh, let it go, float down. Perfect. That's actually the last movement of the whole sequence, which we call closing the door, right. So we're halfway done already. We've got the opening and we've got the closing. Let's try it one more time. So, smile, relax, breathe, opening the door, the hands float up. And float down. Good. Let them float back up again, and round them out like you're hugging a big tree. Open side to side, and we're going to put the right hand on top of the big round ball. The next movement, movement number 2, actually, is called grasping the bird's tail, grasp the bird's tail, and it actually has four small pieces. Piece number one is called ward off, like keep away. We're going to open towards the left, open towards the left, and the right hand is going to press down towards your hip. So this is my keep-away arm, this is my keep-away, my ward-off arm here. Right? That's piece number one. Now part number two is called roll back, and what I want you to do is to let the right hand drift forward until the two hands are sort of facing each other palm over palm, right, almost like I'm going to make a little t'ai chi sandwich. Pull both hands down. Turn the waist and toss the hands towards me. Beautiful. That's the second piece, roll back. Now the right arm is the long arm here, and what I want you to do is to bend the elbow, folding it in, and bringing the hands palm to palm. This is the start of piece number three, which is called press. So I'm going back over here to my left side, pressing my hands forward. Beautiful. Let the hands slide apart, draw them in, down, and push forward. This is piece number four, which we call push. And that whole combination is called grasping the bird's tail. That was very nice. That was terrific. That was terrific. We're halfway done. Let's pick up the other half, all right, so let's go back to hands by your sides. You're doing well in your chair. Scoot forward a little bit. You can relax anytime, by the way. I'm telling you to scoot forward, but if you feel like you want to sit back and relax, go for it. Sit up nice and tall, the head floats up. Now I've given you flow rule number one, which is smile, slow down and breathe. Here's rule number 2. We call it conserve the curve, and it has to do with what you're already doing with your spine. There's this natural curve in your spine here that's supposed to be there, but in t'ai chi we kind of minimize it a little bit, right, like the string of pearls. Your head floats up. Your tailbone drops down. And in the middle the curve is conserved, right? That's flow rule number two. Hands by your sides. Let the hands float up in front, opening the door, and float down, aahh. Very nice. Hands float back up again, rounding out to hug the big tree, open, now we get the right hand on top, and we're going to open towards the left. Ward off. Very nice. Let's let the right hand float forward, and pull both hands down, toss them towards the television. The long arm now folds in, placing palm against palm. I'm looking to the left again as I press. Slide the hands apart, draw them in, and then forward to push. Beautiful, very nice. Now stay with me, because what we're going to do is open and then left hand on top. We're going to do the same move, grasping the bird's tail, to the right side. We're going to open to the right. Remember, left hand pushes down by the hip here. Float the left hand forward, palms facing each other, palm over palm. Pull down and toss them towards the television. A long arm, which is now the left arm, folds in, palm against palm. Press forward towards the right side, beautiful, slide the hands apart, widraw, and push. Nice. Come back to the center and scoop the hands down, crossing at the wrists. They float and pause, and aahh. Floating down, closing the door. That was nice. That was beautiful. That was beautiful. This is what we call t'ai chi forms, t'ai chi flows. We practice the forms to practice mastering the sense of flow, the element of flow, which is a part of balance and harmony. But we say that what's important about flow, what's important about t'ai chi forms is that it doesn't stop giving you benefits when you walk out of the classroom. I believe that you can keep the benefits going in the rest of your life. T'ai chi really has significant benefits to every part of your life. The mayo clinic, for example, has found that people who practice t'ai chi do things like reduce their anxiety and depressi, they improve their balance and stability and muscle strength. It improves the quality of your sleep, lowers your blood pressure, improves your cardiovascular fitness. It can relieve chronic pain. Anybody with chronic pain? T'ai chi can relieve that. It increases your energy, your endurance and agility, your overall feelings of well being. T'ai chi reduces falls in older adults, well, in everybody, really. I tell you, dr. Vijay vad, who is a renowned sports medicine specialist at the hospital for special surgery in new york city, said that preliminary evidence shows that doing t'ai chi once a week can increase balance and reduce the risk of falls and hip fractures among seniors by up to half. This bears repeating. The greatest beauty of t'ai chi is that all the things you need for that kind of balance, freedom, flow, power is already in you. You already have everything you need. There's so much I want to share with you, right, in this exploration of t'ai chi in the rest of this program. The next thing that we're going to talk about is how to actually get in touch, a real physical sensation of that energy we've been talking about in an exercise I call touching the chi, touching the chi. So we're going to come back and do that in just a minute.

Lyn: Hello, I'm lyn may. Thank you for joining us for t'ai chi, health and happiness with david-dorian ross. David-dorian is here in the studio with me, and right now we're going to take a short break to talk with him about t'ai chi, balance, and about this pbs station. Before we do that, please take a look at this. 
Announcer: Contribute $65 to support this pbs station, and we'll say thanks with the companion dvd to the program you're watching, which includes 40 minutes of additional information and exercises. When you call with a $100 contribution, we'll send you the companion dvd and david-dorian's new home practice dvd, 9 flows. Progress from what you've learned today with more t'ai chi moves. For your generous contribution of $175, you'll receive the companion dvd, the 9 flowsdvd, plus the unique t'ai chi beginner's kit. Open the box to find a specially designed t'ai chi exercise ball, a dvd with a program to guide your use of the ball, and a second program with even more t'ai chi exercises. There's also a collection of essays to deepen your understanding of the philosophy of t'ai i. Call or make a contribution online, and thanks. 
Lyn: This is an absolutely wonderful program. We are so fortunate to have it as part of the pbs schedule. Tell me why you chose pbs. 
David-Dorian: Well, pbs is a place where people come for continuous learning, you know, where people who are sort of lifelong explorers of the journey of life come to find out new information and new ideas and new ways of being in the world. So, for me, it was just a natural to want my first special to be on pbs. 
Lyn: I know you also watch pbs. 
David-Dorian: Oh, my gosh. I've watched pbs since I can remember watching television. I've grown up with pbs, and to this day i love watching, you know, masterpiece theatre, masterpiece mystery!, one of my favorites-- 
Lyn: Oh, we share that. We were talking about that a little bit earlier, said, oh, we love masterpiece mystery!-- 

[00:23:41]


David-Dorian: Yes. 
Lyn: There's a lot to talk about, david-dorian, but one of the important things you've done for our viewers is put together a fine collection of thank-you gifts. Tell them about it. 
David-Dorian: Well, of course, the first gift is the companion dvd to this program that we're watching, because you'll want to watch it over and over again and get some of the details and, you know, remind yourself of the things that I've been saying. Plus there's some tremendous bonus material. We had a chance to talk with the fabulous studio audience and take the experience that we had in the broadcast show and just, you know, kind of get deeper and additional explanations of what we're doing. There's a fabulous q&a session, and then this wonderful exercise on learning about cooperation, a game I call t'ai chi for two. And then we have my newest home practice program, the 9 beginner flows, which is like, you know, having a t'ai chi teacher in your living room. So, you'll be able to take all the movements you learned in this program, plus new movements that you can add to your repertoire and have an ongoing practice that just builds and builds. And if viewers can make a generous contribution of $175, you'll receive a dvd of the program you're watching, plus the home practice dvd, plus this wonderful kit I want to explain. It comes with a dvd with not one, but two programs on it. One is another repertoire of movements, so you'll have now three different routines of t'ai chi flows. Plus this t'ai chi ball that I developed, because a lot of my students come to me and say, you know, I'm feeling the workout in my legs and my thighs, but what about my upper body, what about my arms and shoulders? So the weighted t'ai chi ball will answer that question. And so one of the programs teaches you how to use the ball, and then you can use it for all of the t'ai chi routines that you've learned. And it comes with a booklet, a collection of short essays that I've written on the experience of t'ai chi called exercising the soul. Now if you have all these materials, it's more than I'm in your living room, it's like I'm living with you, and you can do t'ai chi 24/7, any time you want. 
Announcer: We appreciate a contribution of any amount. If it's right for you, it's right for us. Just give us a call right now, and thanks. 

[00:25:50]


Lyn: David-dorian, what's the impact on a viewer's life when they get this kit? 
David-Dorian: My goodness. I wanted to create a series of tools that would actually make a difference in people's lives. People are looking for something more than an idea. They want something tangible. To find, you know, what we're talking about in this program is, is balance, you know, the missing ingredient. We all know that we're out of balance in some way or another, so how do we get back? And the tools in this kit really make that possible. We talk about on the physical level that the movements of the routines of t'ai chi will balance out the body but also balance out the energy that flows through you, that, you know, gives you life and gives you power, the chi, the spirit breath. The inclusion of the t'ai chi ball will make your musculature, the outside of you, also in balance so that the bottom half doesn't get more worked out than the upper half, you know, but that this will make it all complete. The fact that we have two dvd programs, you know, that you can study over and over again to expand your repertoire of movements. And what that does is it makes you experience more of yourself, if you will. It really gets you back in touch with your body and with the energy that's flowing through it. And then, my booklet, exercising the soul, a series of essays that really kind of tell you about my philosophy about t'ai chi and lead you through the mental aspect and the emotional aspect of t'ai chi and the embrace of balance and harmony, and how to understand when you are, what it feels like to be out of balance and then how to drag yourself or step towards balance once again. It really does bring you back to a point where you can have new possibilities, a new sense of, that there's something more, there's something that I've always been reaching for and never knew how to get it until now, until t'ai chi comes into your life. 
Lyn: David-dorian, I have tried t'ai chi at a couple of different points in my life. Had you been my teacher, I'd have stuck with it. Tell me about your first experience with your first teacher. 

[00:28:01]


David-Dorian: Oh, my goodness. Well, my first experience actually was a lot like many of my students. I did it entirely by accident. I was not even looking for t'ai chi. I was looking to learn how to meditate, but I was so terrible at meditation that I thought I would try this, because it's moving meditation. So I signed up for this class and I showed up, and I knew nothing about exercise. I knew nothing about chinese culture or martial arts or any of that. So I was completely out of my element, and I started trying to do the moves, but almost immediately, like within three minutes, I was, you know, it was like being struck by lightning. 
Lyn: You had an epiphany. 
David-Dorian: I had, but a physical epiphany. I could feel my body just heating up and, and coursing with energy. And at that moment, I had what I can only describe as a memory of the future, where I knew that I would do t'ai chi for the rest of my life and that I would be a famous teacher someday. 
Lyn: That is amazing. It was like falling in love. 
David-Dorian: I fell in love right at that moment. And the rest, as they say, is history. It changed everything about me. It changed what I was taking in school. It changed where I was living, how I ate, how I dressed, the kinds of activity that I did. It really was a transformative experience. 
Lyn: What an inspiring story. Ah, don't we all wish that we could have those kinds of moments in our life? Pbs offers them, as you may have learned by now, and nothing, nowhere is it better than in a program like this. So, this is your opportunity to have your own transformational moment. All you have to do is call the number you see on your screen. Support this pbs station, and we would be so happy to send you, now you know I want everything. I've always wanted everything. I would suggest, if you can do it, that you make your contribution at the $175 level and get everything. Get the kit. Get the ball. Get both of david-dorian's DVDs. 
Announcer: Contribute at the $65, $100, or $175 levels and we'll say thanks with materials especially designed to expand your experience of t'ai chi, health and happiness with david-dorian ross. And remember, this public television station appreciates a contribution in any amount. If it's right for you, it's right for us. What's important is that you call or go online right now to make a pledge of support. We appreciate you deeply. 

[00:30:24]


Lyn: David-dorian, this is exciting. Tell me what's coming up next. Where you're actually going to use your hands to feel the inner energy, to feel what we call touching the chi. Plus we're also going to do an exercise, it may be one of the hardest things for people to learn about t'ai chi, and that's called letting go. But the audience was so fantastic in this exercise, it's really fun to watch. So, that's coming up in our next segment. 
Lyn: That sounds great. 
Announcer: There's still time for you to give us a call or go online. Let us know you've enjoyed t'ai chi, health and happiness. We appreciate your viewership and your support. I promised that the next thing we're going to do is a little exercise on actually getting in touch with that inner energy, which we call the chi. In fact, you can feel the life energy in the palms of your hands very easily, and I'm going to share with you just a very simple exercise called touching the chi. So, this is what I would ask you to do to start with, is if you've got a heavy watch on or a bracelet or something, you might want to take that off for just a second, you know, put it in your pocket. And then take your wrists and sort of cross them over in such a way like the palms are facing the same, facing each other, but just crossing wrists, and make some small circles, nice and slow, circling around about the size of a half dollar, circling around. And after about 30 seconds or so, you might start to have some sensations. And if you do, what we're going to do is we're going to change the position of your hands, and now move your hands to face each other palm to palm, right, middle of the palm facing each other, and continue your circle, circling around, nice and easy, little tiny circles. And pause, and let's try something else. Let's try pulling them slowly apart. Pull your hands slowly apart, and push them back together. I can see some of you already, I can see the looks on your faces, right. I want you to take a look at the palms of your hands. What does that look like? Do you notice anything? 

[00:32:53]


Woman: It's red. 
David-Dorian: It's red, so you see some color, yes? What else? What about feeling, sensation? Tingling. Warmth, yes. By the way, if you don't feel that, you're not dead. It's all right. 
[Laughter] these are classic signs of an increased flow of chi. Now what's happening is that right here in the center of your palm is a giant acupuncture point, called the lao gong point. And as I'm doing this exercise, what I'm doing is I'm focusing, right, I'm thinking about it. So I'm thinking and my mind is going to this point, and as my mind goes to this point, what happens? The chi follows. In fact, this turns out to be one of the most famous t'ai chi sayings in the entire practice. It goes like this, e-tao chi-tao, where the mind goes, the chi follows. And where the chi goes, the blood follows. And where the blood goes, the body follows, right. So as mind is focused on "i can't," that's where my chi is going to go, but when my mind is focused on "i can," that's where my chi is going to go as well, okay. So this also becomes one of the elements of balance, power, chi, life energy. You know, why is power an element of balance? Being powerful is the opposite of being forceful. Right, when rcing things, you know, things sort of get stuck, but when you're powerful, things just happen without forcing. In fact, in chinese we have a saying about that, which is how power really feels, right, just effortless, how balance really feels. It's just effortless. Now this also brings up one of the other benefits of t'ai chi and the sort of the contrast between t'ai chi practice and some of the more conventional western forms of exercise and health, and that is that in the west we talk a lot about consuming energy, right, I've got to burn some calories. But in the east, in the t'ai chi practice, we talk about conserving energy. I want to keep my chi. Chi is the energy of my life, so I want to keep it as long as possible and live as long as possible and do things with it as long as possible. So this is an interesting contrast between consumption of energy and conservation of energy. I want to finish up the movements that we've been starting, okay, so we're going to add footwork, right, now that we've got the hands all happening really nicely, we're going to add some of the steps to it. Tell you what, let's all stand up. Now you don't have to stand up. I'd like to invite you to join us as we add the footwork, but if you want to just do it, sit in a chair, and anyone here, if you want to do it sitting in your chair, perfectly fine. T'ai chi can be done without the footwork, but let's give it a shot, shall we? All right, now I'm going to turn around so we're all facing the same direction, so you'll be going the same direction as me this time, all right. Start out with the feet together, hands relaxed by your sides. Soften the knees a little bit, and remember, what's our first rule of flow? Smile, slow down and breathe, right? What's the second rule? Conserve the curve, so tuck the tailbone in a little bit. Let the head top float up like the pearl and let the spine fall down underneath it. Beautiful, all right, here we go. From this position, shift the weight over to the right foot and the left foot steps out to the side about shoulder width, and center. Both hands float up in front, opening the door, and then with the elbows heavy, everything floats down and you can soften the knees, but just a little bit, just a little bit of a drop there. Nice. Now, pause and stay right where you are because I want to add flow rule number 3. The third rule here is called knees over toes. So, take a look, right, you're in this position, you're sinking down here. If your knees have fallen out of alignment, bring them back so the knees are right over the toes. This is a basic rule of flow, because when you get out of alignment, you lose your balance. So rule number three, knees over toes. One more time, from the beginning, feet together, hands relaxed by your sides. Left foot steps out to the left and center. Both hands float up, and aahh. Good, knees over toes. From this position, shift the weight over to the right foot and step in, tapping the left foot down on the ground and embracing the moon, right hand on top. Open the left foot to the side and step out into a lunge position, all right. Let the left hand float out, ward off. Beautiful. Now stay right there. Stay in this position. So, you're doing pretty good, I can see, knees over toes, very nice. I want to add t'ai chi flow rule number 4. Flow rule number 4 is called heavy feet. Heavy, yeah, good, heavy feet. So this is what this is like. Anyone have kids, or cats? Ever try to pick up a cat that doesn't want to be picked up and suddenly it weighs like 2,000 pounds, right? That's what this should feel like. That's what this principle is like. So your entire body weight, your entire mental weight, your entire emotional weight, everything goes down into your feet, heavy feet, it makes you feel rooted, anchored into the earth. Right, this is another rule of flow. So here I am, in ward-off position, my feet heavy, my knees over my toes, the right hand floats forward, and floats down. Now turn and toss them to the front of the room. Beautiful. The long arm folds in, palm to palm, and press, shifting forward. Beautiful. Slide the hands apart. Rock back. Here I'm sitting back, even the toe comes up on this one, and then forward again to push. Very nice. Stay with me. Sit back. Turn inward and open, back over here to the left foot. Step in t-step and left hand on top. Step out with the right foot into a lunge and ward off. Beautiful. Left hand floats forward, pull both hands down, and turn and toss them towards the front of the room. The long arm folds in, coming back to facing to the right, press forward. Slide the hands apart. Sit back and withdraw. The toe even comes up. And rock forward and push. Oh, so nice. Stay with me, a big finale. Sit back, turn inward and open, back over here to the right foot, but only step in half a step and cross the wrists. I'm going to turn around here so we're facing each other. Crossing the wrists and then they float down, aahh, right. Left foot returns to the right. And we end with a little bow. And those are four simple moves with four simple rules of flow. Beautiful, very nice. Very nice. Go ahead and have a seat. Have a seat. That was, that was terrific. Fantastic job. So, just like the movements of flow and the rules of flow, there are rules of power, right. There are rules that help the chi to flow. I'm not going to go through all of them in today's program, but I do want to talk about one of them. This is power rule number 3, and it's called letting go. Yeah, letting go is hard, isn't it? Letting go is a challenge for people, and sometimes, you know, we find it to be a challenge because we have confused a couple of ideas in our minds. We think that being powerful means, you know, holding on, I've got it all under control, I've got it all wrapped up, I'm in, I'm powerful. In fact, what t'ai chi teaches us is that wherever there is holding on, wherever there is tension, chi stops flowing, right. So wherever there is physical tension, there is no chi flow. Wherever there is mental tension, there is no chi flow. Wherever there's emotional tension, there's no chi flow. Right, so we have to let go in order to gain power. Now I'm lucky because I have a natural reality check in my life called my four-year-old daughter, who teaches me about this principle all the time. So, you know, a great example, when it's time to go to bed and I say, all right, you know, it's time to go to bed, and she says, why? And I say, because I said so, I'm the dad, right? That's not powerful. That's not powerful. That's me, you know, kind of, you know, being a bully. I'm bigger than she is, right. So, there's a forcing trying to go on, and nobody's happy. Right, we both wind up going to bed being unhappy, unsatisfied. What works out better is when she teaches me about cooperation rather than conflict. And we sit down together and we say, honey, you know it's time to go to bed, and she goes, well, if you just sit with me for a second, you know, I can put my head down, and we cooperate. We make it happen together. And there's no forcing. There's no pushing. There's no yelling. There's just like aahh, and that's being powerful. That's being effortless. Right, that's what power is all about. T'ai chi, for me, is kind of like a guidebook for the journey that we're on, the journey of the mind and the body and the spirit. It's kind of like your spiritual gps, without the annoying voice. So if you let this be your guide, your gps, your compass, it can always lead you toward balance and not towards the opposite, which we call chaos. Earlier in the program, we started touching on the idea of freedom, and I promised you we'd come back to it and talk about it just a little bit more. And for this exercise, I'm going to need a volunteer. Thank you so much. 

[00:43:12]


[Laughter] 
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? Marge: Marge. 
David-Dorian: Marjorie, all right. So, marjorie, just watch one time. I'm going to sort of demonstrate what we're going to do together. Okay, well, I take that back, what you're going to do. All right, so, this is a kicking exercise from the t'ai chi routine. You're going to stand on one foot, open and kick. And slowly fold back in and float down. Got it? 
Marge: Absolutely. 
David-Dorian: Absolutely, all right. 
[Chuckling] 
Marge: You going to catch me when I fall? 
David-Dorian: Maybe. Beautiful, beautiful. That's exactly right, okay. No, stay right there, stay right there. Just give me one hand, just one hand. Okay, do the same thing again. Get settled down. All right, left leg is going to lift up. All right, I got you. Open out to the side and kick. Fold back in and float down. Awesome, yes? 
[Applause] we're not done yet. Now I just want a half a hand. Okay, all right. And same thing, get settled down, the knee comes up. All right, opens out to the side, kicks out, right, and floats back in, and down. Better and better. Give me one finger. I just want one finger, all right, and knee floats up, opens out, kick out to the side, fold back in, and down. Now just in case anybody's asking, do you think I could hold up marjorie's entire body with one finger? No. So I wasn't really doing anything about this. This is about her own mind. Remember I said this before, that, you know, that the opposite of freedom is constraint, is the language of "i can't." And really what was going on in marjorie's mind was, pfft, I can't do that, right, I don't have a blue shirt, right? 

[00:45:15]


[Laughter] I can't do that. But what we did with the exercise here, with going from one hand to half a hand to one finger, is changing "i can't" into what? 
Marge: I can. David-dorian: I can. That's what I want you to stay to yourself, I can. Say it. 
Audience: I can. 
David-Dorian: Awesome. Thank you so much. Beautiful. 
[Applause] so, why is this so important? Why is letting go, why is being, you know, "i can" so important to balance? Because when we limit our thoughts and we think I can't, you know, "i can't" is a limiting belief, when we limit our thoughts, we limit our possibilities. We limit our mind. And our mind, remember, controls the chi. So if we're limiting our mind, we're limiting the flow of life's energy, right, because where the mind goes, the chi follows. And if a mind is always going to "i can't, I can't, I can't," that's where your chi is going, too. So to free your power, you must free your mind. This has been an introduction, just a taste, to what I hope will be a long and happy journey, because you can do t'ai chi for the rest of your life. You can keep on practing what you've learned today, keep on practicing the flows that we've learned today, keep on exploring, keep on, you know, taking t'ai chi from other teachers. One of the things that, you know, I wanted to share with you is that, wherever you are living, there is, you know, likely a teacher nearby, you know, even in the places out in the country or in small towns, I find that there is somebody usually who knows t'ai chi and is willing to share it with you. My own journey, my own, my own experience of t'ai chi has guided my life for the last 35 years. It really has changed so much about me. It's changed my health. When I was a child, i, you know, hated exercise. I was asthmatic. I never participated in sports. And, you know, now I'm 55. I feel better than I did when I was 25. I have got clarity of mind, a sense of vision, and this is what I love to do. This is my bliss. This is the first step to having it all. T'ai chi is a very important tool. The first step to happiness, the first step to health, the first step to harmony, right, is to follow these principles we've been talking about. And the first principle of power and freedom and flow is to, what, be in the moment. Be in the moment. So, let's let this be our moment. Right, let this show be your turning point, so to speak, where you find that you really did have everything that you need to have it all. You have freedom in you. You have power in you. You have flow in you. Right? And when you realize that you already have power and freedom and flow, you realize that you have everything that you need to have a life that you've always dreamed of. I want to end with a little quote from lao tzu, the famous chinese philosopher, who said, "be content with what you have, rejoice in the way things are, because when you realize that there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you." Thanks for being here today. Thanks for joining. Thank you. 

[00:48:25]


[Applause]

[00:50:30]


Lyn: David-dorian, I loved watching you in this program, your control, your physicality. You're in fabulous shape. But you haven't always been into physical fitness. I was fascinated by that. 
David-Dorian: Oh, my goodness, no. As a child, I had terrible asthma. I was allergic to just about everything that you can imagine. And I really wasn't an exerciser. I wasn't into sports at all. It really wasn't until I was in college and discovered t'ai chi for the first time that I finally was introduced to my own body and my own sense of physicality. And it was t'ai chi that unlocked the door for me. I probably would not be here today if it hadn't been for t'ai chi. 
Lyn: One of the things everyone always wants to know about any exercise program, will I lose weight? 
[Laughter] 
David-Dorian: Well, the short answer is yes, but it may not be for the reason that most people think about. The biggest way that t'ai chi helps you to lose weight is it changes your sense of possibility. Most people are stopped in the losing weight, the whole effort, because they have a thought of "i can't," just that's kind of the overview of where their whole approach to losing weight is. And as we talk about in the program, t'ai chi changes "i can't" into "i can," and by changing that sense of posbility, you really do finally get the results that you were looking for. 
Lyn: Is that partly because everyone can do it at his or her own level, and no matter what age-- 
David-Dorian: It's a beautifully embracing kind of activity that anybody can do, regardless of your age or your current physical condition. It's made for everyone. 
Lyn: What an interesting solution if you've been struggling with weight loss and you have it in your head that you can't shed those extra pounds. So this is yet another reason to consider calling the station right now and making your contribution and receiving these gifts, an unexpected benefit to your health. David-dorian, tell us about this fabulous kit, full of goodies. 
David-Dorian: Oh, my gosh, well, as we've been talking about in the program, t'ai chi covers many different elements, many different facets of life, the physical, the mental, the emotional, the energetic. And so you've got a lot of tools in this kit to get all those different elements, like the t'ai chi ball, which is really about the physical aspect. 

[00:52:42]


Lyn: Now I'm holding the ball, but I don't know what to do with it. I like the weight. 
David-Dorian: You like the weight. Well, what happens is, you use the ll with the movements you've already learned fromhe other programs. So, a movement like wave hands like clouds, you transfer the ball from hand to hand and you get the double benefit of the energetic flow plus the physical. 
Lyn: All right, so I have the ball. 
David-Dorian: Just like that. 
Lyn: And what's interesting is that it makes me want to be quiet. Now there's something. [Chuckles] I like it. This alone would make it worth the kit. What's next? What else do you have? 
David-Dorian: What's next is a dvd with two different programs on it. One is a progr that has an additional routine of movements, so you get a chance to circulate that chi energy around the body with more motions, and another program that tells you how to use the weighted t'ai chi ball. And then the most important part, I think, for me is the book that comes with it. This book, called exercising the soul, is a short collection of essays that, about, about t'ai chi and its impact, and infused in there is a bit of my own personal philosophy of what t'ai chi means and how it can benefit your life and how it can transform your life. And you get all of that in this kit, the ball, the two programs on the dvd, and the book. 
Lyn: This station can bring you david-dorian and t'ai chi because viewers who care have stepped forward and made a pledge of support. That action, that individual, personal step is what keeps this station healthy. Now, maybe you've always wanted to try t'ai chi but you just never got around to it. You were too busy or you didn't know where to go. This station, as david-dorian says, is the place in this community for lifelong learners, for explorers who want to keep on discovering new dimensions of life. So, please call the number on your screen now and take your first t'ai chi step to supporting this station. 

[00:54:44]


Lyn: I do love the concept of having it all. Who doesn't? It's just what david-dorian has said and what we all aspire to. So, the way for you to have it all right now is to call this station and make a contribution at the $175 level. Whether your goal is to lose weight or become more fit or just have that experien of getting out of that chair and moving your body, you've seen the effects of that in this program. And of course, david-dorian is a terrific teacher, AND ALL OF THAT COMES TO YOU IN THE DVDs You've seen today, and of course if you get the kit, you get that wonderful red ball that you can use and that'll help just make your body feel even better. So give it some thought and think about what you are prepared to do for yourself and for this public television station. We count on you, and you can count on us. Thank you. 
Announcer: When you contribute at the $65, $100 or $175 levels, we'll say thanks with materials especially designed to expand your experience of t'ai chi, health and happiness with david-dorian ross. The companion dvd, home practice dvd, and the t'ai chi kit all have been designed to help you find balance in your life. This public television station appreciates a contribution in any amount. If it's right for you, it's right for us. What's important is that you call or go online right now to make a pledge of support. We appreciate you deeply. 
Lyn: One of my favorite elements of what you've done and what you've talked about is being in the moment, very hard for most of us to do. 
David-Dorian: Oh, it is so hard, because it's, it's not really part of our culture, which is why t'ai chi is such a magical tool for people, because it teaches us, in every way, how to experience being in the moment, physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually. And, you know, this is an opportunity for people to be in the moment right now in their relationship to the pbs and public television station that they're watching. 

[00:56:57]


Lyn: And alas, I have to be in this moment now and reluctantly bid you adieu and thank you for being with us. Ank you for what you've brought to us and to public television. We really do appreciate it. And we thank you for being with us, too. We hope that you enjoyed this program, and there's one way you can tell us that will reassure us that we're on the right track. You still have a moment to go to the telephone, make that call and support your public television station. Thank you for being with us. 
Announcer: We appreciate a contribution of any amount. If it's right for you, it's right for us. Just give us a call right now, and thanks.

=======================================================

>> "Teen kids news" is about to get started, and here's what we've got for you. 
>> Film star dakota fanning, secretary of state hillary clinton, tennis great venus williams, and singers sheryl crow and mariah carey. Do you know what they all have in common? Here's a hint -- cookies. 
>> Most boys will agree, middle school can be a battleground. I'll have a report from the front lines. 
>> They are three little letters, but they can spell the difference between life and death -- cpr. I'll explain what they stand for. 
>> A huggable egg from outer space, and that's just for starters here at this amazing museum of art. 
>> And there's lots more ahead, so stay with us. 
>> Welcome to "teen kids news." I'm mwanzaa. 
>> And I'm livia. Here's this week's top story. 
>> Their slogan is "do a good turn daily," and they've been doing that for more than 100 years. Lauren reports that girl scouts are celebrating the beginning of a new century of girl power. 
>> When you think of girl scouts, what do you think of? 
>> Cookies. 
>> Cookies. 
>> Thin mints. 
>> I think of, like, little girls and I think of cookies. 
>> Well, how about robots? Or writing letters of appreciation to those serving in our military? Or chemistry experiments? 
>> We're making gak for girlcouts so they can learn about polymers. 
>> It felt really squishy. 
>> This is just one of the many celebrations across the country for scouting's 100th anniversary. There are activities for the littlest daisies and brownie scouts, up through juniors and cadets, to seniors and ambassadors. 

[00:02:00]


>> So, you can learn about different things, and you can kind of change the world in your own way. 
>> Girl scouts have been changing the world ever since they got started in savannah, georgia, in 1912. Back then, the first troop had just 18 girls. Today, there are more than 2 million scouts. 
>> Our founder, juliette gordon low, believed that girls needed to take charge, and she wanted to teach girls how to be secure, how to be confident, how to look after themselves, how to have a career. 
>> When girl scouting began, women were not even allowed to vote. But thanks to the leadership training girls get in scouting, women have come a long way. Today, two out of three women serving in congress were once girl scouts. So were 80% of all the women who now run their own businesses. To prepare the leaders of tomorrow, the girl scouts of america is a partner in the national s.T.E.M. Project. S.T.E.M. Stands for science, technology, engineering, and math. 
>> I actually started in fifth grade with the younger robotics team, and I have now moved up to this team. So, it's a great way to get girls into s.T.E.M., And this gets them interested in the field. 
>> Scouting also has a long tradition of service. To help other people is in the first line of the girl scout pledge. 
>> I taught boys and girls how to pitch a tent, how to build a fire, and how to tie knots, and all the camping skills. 
>> My project was entitled "dover kids say 'boo' to bullying." It was an anti-bullying program that I implemented at the local elementary school. 
>> Those are just some of the many service projects that earned these 200 scouts a gold award. 
>> The gold award is the highest level of achievement that a girl can receive in girl scouting. It is the girl who has put in the most service hours, who has dedicated themselves to creating a project that is not just to get them into college, but a project that's gonna make a difference in their world and their community, and they did it themselves. 
>> Nowadays, girl scouting also emphasizes personal growth. You can earn badges for a journey of self-discovery. And guess what can help -- selling those cookies. 

[00:04:04]


>> You learn about finance. You learn about how to set a goal, how to budget. And you learn those things by doing this experience. 
>> And the cookies help support all the other great things that girl scouts do. And, yes, dakota fanning, secretary of state clinton, venus williams, sheryl crow, and mariah carey were all girl scouts. For "tkn," I'm lauren. 
>> We'll be back with more "teen kids news" in just a few moments. 
>> Stick with us. 
>> In "a tale of two cities," charles dickens wrote, "it was the best of times, it was the worst of times." He could have been describing middle school. No question, middle school can be a challenge, and the challenges are different for guys than they are for girls. This week, scott reports on surviving middle school from the boys' perspective. 
>> Middle school is life-changing. 
>> Middle school is competitive. 

[00:06:05]


>> Annoying. 
>> Confusing. 
>> It's stressful. 
>> Middle school is a circus juggling act. 
>> Those comments don't surprise dr. Michael thompson, a psychologist and an author. He spent a lot of time studying the issues boys face in school. 
>> Boys are not as wired as well for school as girls are. It's a harder fit for them, and it is right to middle school, because they're so much more physically active, they're so much more impulsive, and they want to be outside running around. 
>> And boys are more likely than girls to drop out before finishing high school. But schoolwork isn't the only challenge boys face in middle school. 
>> I really appreciate you coming to talk to me. 
>> To help us with this report, dr. Thompson agreed to guide a discussion with some students from the masters school in dobbs ferry, new york. 
>> You guys are all in sixth, seventh, and eighth grade, right? 
>> All: Yeah. 
>> All right. Do you think of middle school as being a pretty tough time in your life? Tougher than elementary? 
>> I feel that, during the middle-school years, socially, it gets a lot harder, but at the same time, it's getting academically harder, which puts more stress on you than you've had in your, like, elementary years. 
>> You start to become more aware -- aware of your actions, what people think of you. You have academic worries, you have social worries. 
>> Yes, josh. 
>> I do find middle school a little harder, and not just because of the fact that school gets harder every year as you go on. As you get older, sometimes, for some people, it gets better because they strengthen and they get faster at stuff, but, like, for certain people like me, i don't, like, strengthen and stuff, and it gets worse. 
>> You're saying you got to get more athletic, or else -- 
>> yeah. 
>> It gets worse for you. Why, josh? Does everybody have -- do all boys have to be a good athlete in middle school? 
>> I mean, I don't think that, but I feel that a lot of people do. And it's definitely something that I found really hard, because I wasn't the fastest, i wasn't the strongest, I wasn't the best at sports. 

[00:08:16]


>> I think, in sixth grade, like, who's taller, who's faster, who's stronger. 
>> How many boys here have ever had the wish that you were growing faster? 
>> I've noticed situations where in, like, sports or gym class, the teacher will be like, "all boys on this side, all girls on this side." 
>> Yeah. 
>> And people will be like, "hey, so-and-so, go over to the girls' side." 
>> No boy wants his masculinity attacked. 
>> In fact, these students say it's common for middle-school boys to insult one another. Even if only a joke, it can still be pretty hurtful. 
>> You have to be able to take a hit sometimes. 
>> From whom? 
>> Bullies, or just, you know... 
>> Are boys hard on each other in middle school? 
>> They can be, and sometimes they don't know they're being hard on each other, because, i mean, I do it sometimes, too. That's how we play. That's how we joke around. 
>> We'll continue this special report on surviving middle school when we return. And we'll get some advice on how to deal with that alien species, girls. 

[00:11:26]


>> And I feel like a lot of people are sort of -- not conforming, but changing themselves to try to fit in. 
>> We're back at the masters school with more discussion on surviving those difficult middle-school years. To describe his challenge, this student uses a term that comes from battlefield medical treatment -- triage. 
>> Well, I think one of the biggest worries that I have is not just finding a balance between academic work and my social life, but kind of triaging them and finding out which one is, like, more important to focus on right now. That is definitely a big challenge for me. 
>> Mm-hmm. Triaging. That means sorting out what you're supposed to do and what's most important. It's like prioritizing? 
>> Yeah. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Then there's the issue of cliques and exclusion. 
>> So, kids in middle school want to fit in, and if the group excludes you, you know you've been pushed to the side. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Experts say a good way to deal with this is to take advantage of the different activities middle school offers. Sure, there's joining a sports team, but there are all kinds of social groups available, from the school paper, tousic, art, chess, foreign language, the environment, and so on. OR STqRT YOUR OWN CLUB. The point is to find a group where you'll feel comfortable fitting in. Of course, if you're lucky enough to be in a group, the nicest thing you can do is reach out. 
>> My advice, as someone who's been in this a long time is be willing to reach out to those other kids who might be standing by or on that fringe. Welcome them into your circle. 
>> As for the next big challenge, you can sum it up in one word -- girls. know what they're thinking, so... 
>> Can the girls hurt your feelings more than other boys can? 
>> It can be both. Some girls, they can just be really mean. Some can just exclude you from things, and you don't know what you've done to them. 
>> Like, the big difference between, like, girl bullying and boy bullying is that boys are much more, like, open about it. They'll say, "i don't like you, and this is why." 

[00:13:28]


>> Right. 
>> But then girls are more like, "i'm gonna speak behind your back, but in front of you, I'm gonna be, like, really nice to you." 
>> According to dr. Thompson, there is a real difference here between boys and girls. 
>> Boys use direct aggression. They insult each other to their face, generally. Girls use indirect, or relational, aggression. They go behind each other's backs, or they attack each other's friendships. 
>> So, how do girls survive middle school? We'll explore that in a separate report. Meanwhile, here's some words of advice from our guys. 
>> If you get rejected, just get back up. 
>> Always be yourself, and never be someone you're not. 
>> You have to stay strong. 
>> But also be nice. Like, try to get along with everyone. 
>> Stay on top of your work. Just keep calm. Try not to let what others say affect you too much, because you'll see, you know, later on in your life that it doesn't really matter as much. 
>> Just be yourself, because people who you want to hang out with will accept you for who you are, anyways. 
>> Here's my advice. Avoid middle-school drama. It's just not worth it. For "tkn," I'm scott. 
>> One thing you can expect from life is the unexpected. That's why knowing some basic first aid is important. 
>> What is cpr? 
>> Cpr stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and that's a really big term that basically means cardio -- heart -- pulmonary -- lungs -- resuscitation -- try to bring back. We provide a combination of chest compressions and rescue breaths to manually circulate blood throughout somebody's body, because when they're in cardiac arrest, it means their heart's not working, so we need to work for it. 
>> Is it something that we all can learn? 
>> Absolutely. In a real red cross course, when you take the full thing, you learn how to give breaths, but absolutely anybody can learn how to do hands-only cpr. And that's what we're gonna practice today. 

[00:15:37]


>> Okay, I'm ready. What do we do first? 
>> Step one -- we want to make sure this person is actually unconscious, because they might be napping. I don't know. So, let's find out. Hello? Can you hear me? Are you okay? Hello? If they don't respond, that's a problem. So, I'm gonna tell somebody else to go call 911 -- "please, this person's unconscious" -- then come back to me. Then I need to see if they're breathing. So, I'm gonna open the airway with a head tilt, chin lift. Get really close to their nose and mouth to feel for breath on my cheek. Look at the chest for any movement, and I'm gonna do this for 10 whole seconds, 'cause i want to make sure it's normal breathing. If they're not breathing, we begin hands-only cpr. That's compressions, not breaths, okay? Now, I know I'm wearing these gloves right here, but in real life, you can do them with or without. In the red cross course, we advocate for gloves because they help prevent disease transmission. Okay, two hands right in the center of the chest. Your shoulders directly over your hands for support. 
>> You're gonna press at least two inches deep for an adult, about two inches deep for a child, and about 1 1/2 inches for an infant, at a rate of 100 compressions per minute,iring. So, I'll do a few. One and two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight and nine and 10 and 11 and 12, 13, 14. All right. So, we keep going over and over till the ambulance gets there. In real life, you might get tired, as you mentioned. And if that happens, I really don't want you to pass out next TO THE [Chuckling] PERSON, SO Please take a break. You know, shake it out, stand up, do whatever you need to, and when you can, go back to it. 
>> Okay. 
>> Want to give it a shot? 
>> Yeah, sure. 
>> Come on in. 
>> Mm-hmm. 
>> Three, two, one, go. One and two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight, nine, and 10, 11. 
[ Chuckling ] NICE. See, so, it is really hard. You want to try and hear that click every single time, 'cause that's when you know you've hit two inches. 

[00:17:39]


>> And how do you know you're doing it hard enough on a real person? 
>> On a real person, the most common mistake people make is they don't actually compress deep enough. So, think hard and fast. Don't worry about the depth. You might have to go a little harder than you think you do. That's the only thing I can say about that. All right? So, when would you stop those compressions, 'cause in real life, you don't stop after 12? When do we stop? 
>> You just keep going? 
>> You keep going. 
[ Chuckling ] THAT'S RIGHT. You don't stop. When that ambulance gets there, they'll tell you when to stop so that they can take over. Again, if you get tired, you can stop. But other than that, that is what you're gonna be doing to keep blood circulating for this person. 
>> To find out more about cpr and first aid, there's a link to the american red cross on our website. For "tkn," I'm alexa.? ??? 
>> this might surprprise you. Our lungs are more exposed to the world around us than our skin is. An allergy doctor put it this way -- the average person's lungs have about the same surface area as a tennis court. So, when it comes to inhaling harmful chemicals from smoking, need I say more? 

[00:19:54]


>> When you think of an art museum, do you imagine a place that's as quiet as a church, with a lot of paintings hanging on walls? Well, carly says, "think again." 
>> Baltimore is like many american cities. It has big buildings, a baseball stadium, and all sorts of historic sites. But baltimore also boasts a rather unusual museum. 
>> Hi, carly. 
>> Hey, how are you? 
>> Good, welcome to the american visionary art museum. 
>> Awesome. Why don't you show me around? 
>> Okay, great. 
>> Nick explained that all the art here is a celebration of imagination. 
>> So, what's this? 
>> This is actually a sculpture of icarus by artist andrew logan. He's on a winch, so he goes up and down through our stairwell all throughout the day. 
>> Wow. That's so cool. 
>> Yeah. 
>> In greek myth, icarus was the guy who ignored his father's warnings and flew too close to the sun. He crashed. 
[ Crash! ] anyway, back to the museum. The exhibits are as unusual as they are colorful. For example, these pieces of art are made from beads -- the kind people wear at mardi gras celebrations. 
>> Our museum, carly, is dedicated to visionary art, and that's actually art made by self-taught artists. These artists were inspired by a voice or a vision that they had -- something that inspired them just to create. A fire inside of them. 
>> And some of these artists were inspired to create some pretty strange things. This certainly looks like a throne that would be any king's crowning glory, but look closer. It's made out of nothing more royal than bottle caps. There's so much to see here, that we asked the founder of the museum to show us the top five things that you shouldn't miss. 
>> Okay, carly, this is our number-five pick. This is a scale model of the famous boat, lusitania,by the visionary artist named wayne kusy. And it's made out of -- guess what. 
>> What? 193,000 toothpicks. 
>> Wow. How long did it take him to make this? 

[00:21:55]


>> Well, it took him about 2 1/2 years. You can see all the effort. 
>> All right, so let's go to number four. 
>> Number four, you're gonna love. Number four is our giant pink poodle, fifi. 
>> Wow. 
>> That's not just a giant sculpture. This can be pedaled, human-powered, all around the city of baltimore for 15 miles. 
>> Fifi shares the gallery with other moveable sculptures. Once a year, they all take to the streets in a wild and wacky race. 
>> Our race starts the first saturday of may, and we get, like, 40 different sculpture vehicles, and then they have to be pedaled through mud pits and up and down hills, and then they have to float over the water. 
>> We'll have more of the top things to see at the american visionary art museum in baltimore when "tkn" returns. FiOS Is the fastest internet in america. Just ask pc mag.

[ Male Announcer #2 ] IF IT'S AVAILABLE, You should get it. ?? 
>> we're back at baltimore's american visionary art museum, and we're getting a tour of its top five attractions. Number five was the toothpick ship. Number four was a giant poodle you can pedal. So, this is our number three, right? 
>> This is our cosmic galaxy egg, and it was made by andrew logan. And it has the real-life images from deep space of dying galaxies, which turn reddish before they pass away, and then infant stars. 
>> It's not often you get to hug an entire galaxy. Guess you can call this an intergalactic, interactive exhibit. And this is what you call a wind tower, or a whirligig. It's the creation of a north carolina farmer named vollis simpson. 
>> He was 76 years old when he made this. He's 93 and still making whirligigs. And he said, "i had a lot of junk, and I had to do something with it." 
>> It's a moving monument to recycling, made from cut-up street signs, parts from cars and bikes, and other strange things. What's really cool is that the more you look, the more you see. 

[00:26:00]


>> People love it. It got baltimore's most beloved piece of public sculpture. 
>> Well, I can see why people liked it. You want to go in at number one? 
>> Absolutely. Just turn right around, carly. I think this is "b" for bling for baltimore. 
>> This entire wall is a mosaic of broken mirrors and glass. And not just any glass. 
>> The blue glass is known as baltimore glass all around the world because bromo-seltzer and noxzema were made here for over 100 years. 
>> But to get the full effect, you have to see the museum from a distance. No doubt, it's unlike any other building you've ever seen. The outside is as much a work of art as any of the works displayed in its three buildings, and just as unique. So, what did you think about the art museum? 
>> I think the art museum was really cool. It had some cool art and very creative things inside it. 
>> My favorite part was the big, fluffy dog. 
>> I partilarly liked the display with all the kinetic sculptures. Each sculpture is connected to a handle. When you turn it, you can make the sculpture move. Weird, funny, awesome. Those might not be adjectives you usually use to describe art, but they certainly apply here, because this art is visionary. For "tkn," I'm carly. 
>> That's "teen kids news" for now. Thanks for tuning in. 
>> We'll be back next week. See you then. MiMichael: westen. I used to be a spy until...

=======================================================

It's time to go back... 
?????? Oh, what a night  to the '60s...    and the '70s...    Didn't I blow your mind this time    a time when soul music meant love.    Ooo, baby, baby    this is smooth soul.    Ooo, baby, baby     ??????
man, that takes me back. Hi, I'm smokey robinson. In the '60s, love was in the air and so was the sound of soul music and, when the two came together, the results were magic. 
?????? When a man loves a woman     can't keep his mind on nothing else       I've been loving you          too long       to stop now     ??????
when an artist like otis redding sang a love song, he had that special gift we call soul. You can feel it in the music of all the great singers, including the one and only gladys knight. 
?????? He's leaving     [leaving]       on that midnight train       to georgia       I'm so tired of being alone       I'm so tired of on my own       won't you help me, girl       just as soon as you can?     ??????
what great songs! And now I'd like to introduce you to my co-host, suzette craft. Welcome, suzette. Smokey robinson, wow, it's such an honor to work with you. You are a music legend and your amazing career as a singer and songwriter just goes on and on. Well, I've been blessed. I don't think I'll ever get tired of writing or singing. You know, you've written so many hits for yourself 

[00:02:01]


and for other artists, but if there's one thing that your fans know, it's that when smokey robinson writes a song, you'd better believe it's a love song. 
?????? Oh, oh, oh     you treat me badly       I love you madly       you've really got a hold on me     ??????
oh, smokey. I love those early miracles' records. Well, thanks. Let me tell you, if you love the sound of classic soul and you can't resist a great romantic song, get ready! Because we're about to take a musical journey through the world of smooth soul. Now all the romantic soul hits of the '60s and '70s are together in one collection. Time life presents smooth soul. Smokey, let's go back to 1962. You were already leading the miracles and writing and producing hits for other motown artists. And one of those artists was motown's first female superstar, mary wells. 
?????? Well, I've got two lovers and I ain't ashamed       two lovers, and I love them both the same       oh, no, not my baby       oh, no, not my sweet baby       if you see me walking down the street       and I start to cry       each time we meet       walk on b      baby, I'm yours [baby, I'm yours]       and I'll be yours until the stars       fall from the sky     ??????
smokey, those early days at motown must have been exciting. They really were. It seemed like every day some amazing new artist would walk in that door. And most of us were from detroit, including the legendary four tops. 
?????? Baby, I need your loving  

[00:04:04]


   got to have all your loving       stop! In the name of love       before you break my heart       well, I'll be doggone       if I wouldn't work all day, baby       and I'll be doggone       if I wouldn't bring you my pay, baby       I guess you'd say       what can make me feel this way?       my girl, my girl, my girl       talking 'bout my girl       my girl     ??????
smokey, do you remember top 40 radio back in the day? Oh, man! You'd turn on your favorite station and out of nowhere you'd hear a song that just made you want to sing along. 
?????? What kinda fool do you think I am?     you think you can go on       seeing him?       he'd just go um, um, um, um, um, um       um, um, um, um, um, um       searching, searching for my baby          I'm searching, searching       for my love       pull a string       and I'll wink at you       I'm your puppet       but I'm ready [ready]       to learn       yes, I'm ready [ready]       to learn     ??????
in the '60s, soul music was full of incredible performers, but when it came to on stage excitement no one topped the godfather of soul, james brown. 
?????? This is a man's world     this is a man's world       but it wouldn't be nothing       nothing       yes, love is a hurting thing    

[00:06:08]

Smokey, in the 50s, the miracles really started out as a street corner doo wop group. That's true. You know, vocal group music never really went away. It came back in the '60s more soulful than ever thanks to groups like the dells. 
?????? If you stay     stay, darling       stay in my corner       didn't I blow your mind,       this time?       didn't i?       cowboys to girls       oh, yes, indeed, baby       cowboys to girls

??????

I don't think there's ever been a soul artist who could write, produce, sing, and play with the level of creative brilliance of stevie wonder. 
?????? My cherie amour     lovely as a summer day       never gonna give you up       no matter how you treat me       never gonna give you up       so don't you think of leaving       oh, god didn't make little green apples       and it don't rain in indianapolis       in the summertime       oh, it's crying time again       you're gonna leave me       I can see that faraway look in your eyes     ??????
smokey, when I was growing up I used to always hear folks say that your music was made for when the lights were low. Well, I take that as a compliment. 

[00:14:14]


After all, what's sweeter than a song that helps two people get closer. 
?????? Baby, baby, don't cry     baby, baby, here's why       hypnotized       you've got me hypnotized       tell it like it is          don't be ashamed       to let your conscience be your guide       you got me going in circles          oh, round and round I go       you make me feel       you make me feel       you make me feel       like a natural woman     ??????
wow, the queen of soul. It's amazing, smokey, but I think you've got every soul legend in this collection singing that special love song that became a part of our lives. From aretha and otis, to james brown, stevie wonder, and marvin gaye. They're all here. That's right, but one of the things I really love about the smooth soul collection is that they also found room to include some of those really hard-to-find soul classics.

[00:20:20]


What a fantastic time. I'll never forget those super slick vocal groups. They danced great, mmm-mmm they dressed great, oh, yes. And man, could they sing. 
?????? Oh, girl     I'd be in trouble if you left me now       it was just my imagination          running away with me       I'll never       hear the bells if you leave me       and betcha by golly wow       you're the one       that I've been waiting for forever     ??????
one of the most exciting things about the '70s was a new tv show called soul train. Along with those cool kids dancing, we finally had a show presenting the top soul acts performing their latest and greatest hits. 
?????? Everybody plays the fool sometimes     there's no exception to the rule       one of a kind love affair is       the kind of love that you read about       in a fairy tale       ooo! Let's get it on       oh, baby, let's get it on       let's love, baby       don't you know that I'm still in love       sho' nuff in love with you       and i...     ??????
in soul music, you tell it like it is, good times and bad. And no one expressed that bluesy side of romance better than the legendary b.B. King. 
?????? The thrill is gone        the thrill is gone away       ain't no sunshine when she is gone    

[00:22:21]


      it's not warm when she's away       it's a thin line between love and hate       a rainy night in georgia          a rainy night in georgia       I'm gonna go outside       in the rain       it may sound crazy     ??????
aretha franklin recorded so many great love songs over the years, but one of the most moving is this ballad written for aretha by her sister carolyn. 
?????? Gotta find me an angel        to fly away with me       if I were your woman       and you were my man       you'd have no other woman       you'd be weak as a lamb       me and mrs. Jones          we got a thing going on     ??????

=======================================================

It? Welcome to the journal, editorial report. Is the obamacare a sure thing or vast expansion o medicaid, heavily dependent on state implementation and a growing number of the governors are saying they won't do the federal government's bidding. Wisconsin's scott walker is one of them and joins me now, governor, great to have you with us. 
>> Paul, good to be with you. 
>> Paul: When you wrote to the hhs secretary kathleen sebelius, you wouldn't set up a state exchange you wouldn't have the flexibility to make it work. Why don't y elaborate on what you mean by lack of flexibility. 
>> Each of the governors who run it, a state run, partnership or referring to the federal government. Any folks that have a state run exchange they need to realize in the end there is no flexibility in terms of final outcome, there is no substantive difference between the three option, all of them lead to a federally run exchange one way or the other. Great example of that talking to my friend gary herbert, the governor of utah, utah, and probably most of your viewers know five or six years ago set up an exchange and did it in a free market way and one of the lowest costs in the country of health care and still have quality health care, but did it through a market driven exchange. According to my friend gary herbert that doesn't qualify under the new affordable care act and they're going to have to come back and put in place something more aligns them with what the federal government wants. To me, you get the exposure without any of the flexibility, that's not a good deal and on behalf of the taxpayers in my state I said no thank you we'd rather have the federal government not only take on the responsibility, but the responsibility to pay for it and not defer to our tax base. 

[00:02:06]


>> Isn't there a risk if the federal government runs the entire show you guys will be cut out totally and basically, you'll have even less room for maneuver, your companies in the state, your providers in the state will really have to march entirely to washington's dictates? 
>> Well, there is, and there's that risk, but the reality is, we looked at this. In fact, we looked at it laterally two years ago, december of 2010 after the election, I and a bunch of other governors in both parties went to the white house, and the executive office building with the secretary and others and talked about flexibility then. The reality is the flexibility was limited mainly not to things like how many staff and the state do you have? Do you have a handful like utah or hundreds like massachusetts, in terms of regulation of what has to be included and how it's governed in your state, those things are essentially dictated through the federal government, and for all the talk about flexibility, it really doesn't happen. I've got to tell you though as a governor who believes in federalism and believes in the 10th amendment instincts tiffly, my gut to have the state run it rather than the federal government. You'll get things like the food stamp program and special education anthes a mandate that for years has been mandated by the federal government and the school districts in their country and never comes close to covering the cost of that. I think that most of us who said no and deferred to the federal government did so because we didn't want the cost incurred on our taxpayers. 
>> As the law is drafted, i gather that the subsidies can only flow through state exchanges, that is the subsidies for individuals to have health care. Now, if the federal government delivers the exchange in your state, runs it, then, at least as drafted, the subsidies will not be able to flow. Was that part of your calculation as well on it decision? 
>> No, I think in the end there's a series of things, that being one of them. Some other things in terms of insurance regulation in the state beyond the exchange itself. Those are things all of us, including some democrats who did the same thing we did and deferred to the federal government, we're going to come back to the congress and work with members of both political parties and I think those are reasonable adjustments, technical type adjustments, that the congress should be able to make going forward. As you know, and again, your viewers know, most of those decisions were made a few years ago, late in the game without input from governors or for that matter just about anybody else and these are the technical things, if they're going to have it. I objected to it, fought it in court and fought it politically and I lost those battles and conceded at least for the time being there will be exchanges in my state and won't be run by the state. I think if you're going to make it work, most people realize there has to be technical adjustments. 

[00:04:56]


>> One of the things you did win on is medicaid and states have the option of opting out of the medicaid expansion, a big part of this bill. Have you made the decision on medicaid yet? Are you going to opt in or out? 
>> I have to tell you as much about the original question, i have as do governors in both parties, hesitations about that. And which is was has over 90% of our people covered. And we have one of the moeks extensive coverage systems in the country and that's part of the reason we fought the bill in the first place and we do it well and a small number of people and why blow up the system for that. Having said that, our real concern, the 100% expansion, under the terms of law itself. Reading it three years from now, it drops down to 90%, any of us who have dealt with the federal government before and anything else and special, that was a good example I gave before. Know they come nowhere near the goals after the legislation. And so, I think many of us are concerned, looking ahead to the future saying you're going to add massive numbers of people on medicaid and some in more states than others and ours to be a mimal number, but still, adding people and not have the funding, and that's assuming they comply with the law and in light of the fiscal deliver and everything else there, there's a possibility even with the next year or two that medicaid fds to the state might be reduced and without true flexibility with a block grant we have a tough time with what we're dealing with today without adding more. 
>> What's your estimated number of people to add on medicaid in order for the expansion. Do you know that off the top of your head? 
>> That varies, that's one of the varies, we thought the cost of just an exchange, it could go up to as much as 60 million dollars, for us the number that would be eligible fluctuates depending what we can do with the rest of our population, I think for a lot of governors, that's a part of the concern if we had a concrete answer to this, it might be easier to make those decisions, but we keep sending questions to the administration, not just from the republican governors, but through the national governor's association and we get letters back that really don't answer those questions and that's part of the problem.

>> All right, well, governor, thanks so much. It's going to be a big debate and I'll watch your decisions carefully. 
>> Go packers on sunday night. 
>> Paul: I agree, all right. And when we come back, after laying low in the run-up to the election, president obama's army of regulators is about to make up for lost time from agriculture to financial services and a look at some of the new rules coming your way in a second obama term. 

[00:10:43]


>> Well, all is quiet in the leadup to the election, but president obama's army of regulators is now back in formation, ready to issue new rules on everything from health care exchanges to greenhouse gases. A rough guy to what's coming down with the regulatory pipeline in a second obama term. The editorial page editor and james freeman and mary kissle and joe rago. So, joe, give us a big picture sense here, what are the magnitudes of what we're talking about? Many of these are hundred million dollar rules or more in terms of cost, aren't they? 
>> Yes, when you look at the bush and clinton administrations averageded same number of rules, about 45. Obama's first two years, that surged to about 66, 63 in that range. And now, we're starting-- then it fell in the second two years in the leadup to the election and this is because the regulators slowed down, it's because they delayed everything until election day, now, we're about to get-- they're about to make up for last time. 
>> Paul: Mary, what do you think are the big rules you're following? 
>> Think about energy, particularly epa. They're bringing out billion dollar rules and something we haven't seen before. And it's going to really affect almost every part of our economy, because energy goes into the production, pretty much everything. You're talking about ozone air quality standards and carbon standards and greenhouse gas emissions and maybe fracking on federal land, fracking be the high drawlic fracturing technique that leads to oil and gas production. That's regulated by the state. Are you saying that the fed wants to get in on the act and preempt the states? 
>> I think it's a possibility, paul, yes. 
>> Paul: So that would complicated drilling decisions by companies and potentially add to costs even though it's been a big boon to president obama's economy. 

[00:12:46]


>> You'd think this is the one area where the regulators might want to have a light touch, unformer, it's probably-- 
>> james, af been following the financial services industry and dodd frank, i know it's your favorite bill, it's much loved across the land. 
>> Certainly. 
>> Paul: But most of these bills, most of the rules, i think, haven't been written. 
>> You think of the first obama term with its slow growth, and regulatory frenzy, a nightmare, but really, from that 2010 law, most of the burden on the economy hasn't happened yet. The law firm does a scoreboard and they say they're 398 rule makings, separate rule makings that were required by the law. 
>> These are relatively major. 
>> Yeah, really, remaking the financial markets, only a third of them have been enacted, so, most of the big regulatory footprint is coming in the second obama term, even from the law that was passed. 
>> And give us an example or two? 
>> Well, it runs the gamut from derivatives trading on wall street to bank regulation and consumer loans, it's all over the board and on top of that, you have what bankers called the basel standards so these are incredibly complicated rules, for the financial crisis now coming back more complicated. So it's optimistic about economic growth when you see this behemoth. 
>> Paul: And joe, to have the full-blown obamacare, and he's got a deal with the exchanges and medicare and medicaid and the insurance rules as well. 
>> And the day after thanksgiving, 300 new pages of rules come out on essential benefits, all health plans must cover. >>En your job, joe, to read all-- so, but I'm sorry. 
>> So we're starting to see the wave of these rules are going to the white house budget office for review, and ij you think about it, this law is supposed to be up and running on october 1st, ten months from now, we're really going to see a crush in the meantime. 

[00:14:58]


>> Paul: What about the economic costs of this, mary? And not just in terms of how much each rule may effect the economy, but is there a larger cost to the economic growth? 
>> Sure, I mean, take dodd-frank talking about, that can affect access to credit for hundreds of millions of americans, and financial innovations and the kinds of products available to buy and businesses that don't know what kind of regulatory costs they're going to face, they'll have to make decisions whether or not to hire more people to invest. And these have costs to the economy. 
>> There's also a question of what we can do about this. I mean, with congress, congress can't stop it. 
>> And two terms by the congress. >>, But congress can't do much, the courts-- 
>> I mean, it's possible, now that the election is over, that you see some willingness among democrats to maybe paer back a few of these laws where they didn't want to acknowledge their failures before the election, but i wouldn't be that optimistic, yes, you've got some court challenges and there is reasonable constitution law for dodd-frank, for example and perhaps others. 
>> Well, we saw what happened with the constitutional challenges, I wouldn't put that in the bank, all right, when we come back, talk to avoid the fiscal cliff continues and these defense cuts are on the table. Should republicans embrace the so-called sequester or cut a deal to avoid it? There's a debate ahead. ?????? ?????? 
[ Male Announcer ] JILL AND HER MOUTH HAVE Lived a great life. But she has some dental issues she's not happy about. So I introduced jill to crest pro-health for life. Selected for people over 50. Pro-health for life is a toothpaste that defends against tender, inflamed gums, sensitivity and weak enamel. Conditions people over 50 experience. Crest pro-health for life. So jill can keep living the good life. Crest. Life opens up when you do. 

[00:19:43]


>> First of all, this pressure is not something that I propose, it's something that congress has proposed, it will not happen. 
>> Paul: Remember that? President obama in the third debate with mitt romney promising to sequester those across the board cuts to spending to kick in january 1st will not happen. And to avoid the fiscal cliff, sequestration is on the table, and some think-- and okay, james, so, 500 billion dollars in defense already built in to cut. Then sequester would cut another 500 billion over ten years, and why should republicans go along with that? 
>> Because, this is really their only leverage on president obama, and I think that as congressman jordan has said, the only thing worse than a defense cut is no cut at all. What you get with the sequester is defense, but also cuts in the social-- 
>> another 500 billion dollars in domestic discretionary, too. 
>> Right, and it adds up to about 100 billion in 2013. I think you will find that president obama will go a long way to avoid those roughly 44 billion in cuts this year, to social programs and I think if you want to get a deal out of him with meaningful reform on spending or tacks, this is, this is the key leverage point and if it happens, it happens. 
>> And you get some spending. 
>> Paul: So use spending on discretionary and defense to leverage better tax policy out of the president. Bret? 
>> Well, good luck. 
(Laughter) 
>> first of all, let's bear in mind we've already cut 500 billion dollars from defense. You know, I was out on an aircraft carrier in the persian gulf a few months ago, this is a carrier that ordinarily takes about 90 aircraft. It had about 60 aircraft on at the time. I don't think that americans really appreciate the way in which defense cuts are already hurting us strategicically abroad in terms of the kind of forces that we can deploy and the other thing, when you cut defense, those defense cuts are easy to cuts forever. I mean, you just think of the difference between the kind of defense expenditure that we had in the 80's to say nothing of the 60's compared to what we have today. I am not so sure that these cuts in domestic discretionary spending, okay, are going to be forever. No one congress can bind the next. I think that republicans are foolish to think that those domestic cuts are really going to-- 

[00:22:22]


>> look, it's the long-term protection of defense, but i think we ought to be concerned about and the fact is we're not going to be able to be in military super power if they're not an economic super power. And we also know you can't grow your debt and spending faster than our economy and expect this to work out. It would be great if we didn't have to worry about what stuff costs, including defense, but we tried that. It was the obama first term debt roughly doubled to about 12 trillion dollars. So, the-- 
>> and what an elaborate-- 
>> and one thing, we're sort of having a discussion, he wants to take the hemlock, i want to take the cyanide, and these are not -- these are some bad-- 
>> it's a way to get to a better place, I think. 
>> What about his leverage point, though, james' leverage points, the only that on president obama, to lead to a less destructive solution on tax and spending. 
>> Why, do you think he cares about it? 
>> I think the one thing he cares about is big government and-- 
>> he wants big government. 
>> Because the problem is that-- thaepublicans have-- he doesn't care if taxes rise, he's fine with it, probably prefers it, right? 
>> The one thing he has campaigned on is taxes rising on the rich. This is an emotional issue for the president. This is something he clearly cares about, he was deeply stung by the tax deal that he agreed, the extension in 2010, not only sung by his own left wing base, I think he was almost ashamed of that. I think you're mistaken, if the you think that the republicans-- 
>> let's say he refuses to deal as he has been. You still get, at least a beginning toward fiscal sanity. You get the cuts in overall federal spending and that's good for the economy. 
>> All right, well, viewers, you're seeing this debate here. This is what the republicans are talking about on capitol hill, too, we have to take one more break. When we come back, hits and misses of the week. 

[00:27:33]


>> Time now for hits and misses of the week. Mary, first to you. 
>> Paul, I'm giving a hit this week to president obama for an unusually strong defense of human rights that he gave in the speech at university in burma. Instead of speaking directly to the regime as many presidents often do, he spoke over the regime to the people of burma, to aspirations for freedom and democracy. Now, mr. President, I think it's time to give that speech to the people of russia and china. 
>> All right. Mary. Joe. 
>> And he is squire, americans the year. Miss dunham is celebrated for reinventing the romantic comedy with the h.B.O. Program "girls" and chief justice roberts celebrating for reinventing taxing power for conservatives who endorse liberal priorities and I hope the chief justice is enjoying his new intellectual company. 
>> Paul: All right, joe. Bret. 
>> Ron paul, thank you finely for retiring. There's been a question of ron paul, a great man of principle or somewhat strange character with often some might say bigoted views and recently come out talking about the virtues of succession, those of us who always thought ron paul was a crank and find ourselves confirmed. 
>> Paul: Remember, if you have your own hit or miss, send it to us at jer@foxnews.Com and follow us on twitter at jer on fnc. That's it for thiedition of the journal editorial report. I'm paul gigot, hope to see you right here next week.

Th biggest stars and bravest heros to enter the no spin zone. Stories of courage and honor from american war heros. 
>> You are killing them. 
>> I'm killing them to protect my fellow americans. 
>> Bill: And you liked it? 
>> Hollywood super star ben affleck on a new movie about iran that's causing quite a controversy. 
>> This is really a tribute to the folks in our clandestine services and diplomats and foreign service risking their lives over there. 
>> Plus the strangest moments ever to unfold on the factor. 
>> I was told you might have snuck across the border. I might have to make a citizens arrest. 
[ Laughter ] no. 
>> It's the factor's most compelling right now. 
>> Bill: I gave you the opportunity to define for millions of people what you want the law to be and you can't. Caution, you are about to enter the no spin zone. thanks for watching this special edition of the factor. We begin tonight with three genuine american war heros. Chris kyl and former seal marcus la tremendously. All have remarkable stories to tell us. We begin with sergeant meijer. 
>> Before we get to the book, and what you did and what you were honored for, recently, the u.S. Command in afghanistan forbade american and nato troops from patrolling with our afghan allies. At is just stunning to me after 11 years in the theater. What do you think about that? 
>> I couldn't imagine. I was living withvi these guys, these afghans and I trusted them with my life. You know, I was so close to them that I was as close to them as I wasth the marines. 
>> Bill: So and you were out in the forward bases so you had the elite afghan troops with you, right? 

[00:02:00]


>> I mean, they are just like a regular platoon. They weren't elite or special reports forces they were regular guys. 
>> Regular guys out with you and you say that you trusted them as much as you trusted americans? 
>> Did i. There was never any time I was worried about them a going against me or anything like that. I'm seeing the s recent, you know, the media here lately. I don't know what's going on. So you don't know why there have been recent and within the past 12 months you were out of the theater when this started. Afghan soldiers and police uniformed haveif been killing nato and americans and you don't know why? 
>> No, I don't know why. I can speculate on this that, you know, we're getting ready to leave these guys and they still have to stay there, so, you know, I don't know why. 
>> Bill: For some reason ita think the taliban have been able to infiltrate. 
>> They feel that the taliban is the power t now. They see we are leaving and within a year, you know, a year or two, then the taliban is still going to be there. The tall will ban will sit back, wait until we leave. 
>> Bill: So you think that some afghan troopsro are being influenced by that? 
>> I do. 
>> Bill: Usually the ones that attack americans are killed righsot away. They have to be pretty devoted to the taliban to give up their lives. They take out two or three nato forces and they themselves are killed. 
>> Look at suicide bombers. 
>> It would be more than a calculation that maybe I goal over to the taliban. These are people who really want. Now, is it so chaotic that any taliban can get a uniform an afghan army uniform? 
>> They take their gear down to the market and sell it all the time.E. No accountability problem. 
>> Bill: The police also are different from the afghan army, right? 
>> I wouldn't trust the police in any way, shape or form. 
>> Bill: Why? 
>> Y know, afghans talking aboukit afghans, you know what i mean the afghan national army didn't like the afghan national police. 
>> Bill: What's the problem there? 
>> Where I was at up north they were always setting up posts and checkpoints. They were corrupt. They seemed to be more corrupt than the afghan national army was. 

[00:04:06]


>> Y what do you mean corrupt? Taking money shaking down people? 
>> Shaking down peopleou around. Flip flopping. I was told you can't buy afghan but you can rent one. 
>> You think it's pervasive from what you saw. 
>> I'm speaking on what i seen. 
>> In the bookde you describe and we want people to read your book into the fire. The fire fight and how intense it was. I'm going to leave the details because I know you don't like to talk about yourself but you are a hero, medal of honor winner. Was it worth it for you though as a an american soldier? What did you in afghanistan, was that worth it? 
>> You know, was it worth it? 
>> You saw a lot of your friends get killed andfr hurt. 
>> It was worth it because i get to come home and I get to live in the greatest country on the face of the earth. And I know that it's guys like that who went over and sacrificed the men and women still going over and sacrificing for us for me to be ableve to live here and live in a free country. 
>> Do you think most afghans appreciatedcr your sacrifice? You do. 
>> Io was so close to the guys, you know, and they told me, i mean they said they there is good and bad in every group. 
>> Bill: Absolutely. 
>> I had some guys five of them were real close to me and they were sergeants and they saidyou know. We're not going to let you die for our country without us dying for it and guess what THEY ALLil DYED. 
>> Bill: Like vietnam a lot of south vietnamese very loyal to the u.S.A. And appreciated our sacrifice there and then there is an element that isn't. You did the best you could and you won the medal of honor. 
>> Bill: So, chief, I read your book, very entertaining. I think my audience will like it. First of all, you say you knocked jesse ventura to the floor with a punch. Now, you don't mention his name but everybody knows who that is. Number one. That happened? You knocked him out? I knocked him down. 
>> Bill: Why would you punch ventura? 

[00:06:07]


>> In 2006 was the year that we lost our first two seals in iraq. We came home and lost our last guy just before coming home. We had the wake in a seal bar there in core nada. And he was there. He was there for a speaking engagement at a bud ceremony. Graduating class. 
>> Because he was a seal, right? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> He was a navy seal. He was bad mouthing the war, right? 
>> Bad mouthing the war, bad mouthing bush and bad mouthing america. 
>> Bill: And you took exception. 
>> Did I find a problem with it. The family was there. I asked him to please tone it down. We did not want to upset the family members of mikey monday sewer. 
>> Who was killed? 
>> Yes, sir. He earned the medal of honor and jumped on a -- 
>> Bill: He said you deserved. 
>> He said we all deserved to lose a few guys. 
>> Bill: Navy seals. 
>> I'm assuming. He was saying that to me. 
>> Bill: Was he drunk. 
>> Not. I never saw him with a drink in hand at all. 
>> Bill: Once he said you deserved to lose a few guys you popped him. 
>> Yes, sir. He fight back. 
>> He was there he went down and I took off running. 
>> It did they arrest you. 
>> No, sir I had a master chief that said punch and run. 
>> Bill: Are you going to pop me tonight? 
>> No. 
>> Bill: Okay, good. The other thing in the book is that you are credited with 1 auto certified kills which means you as a sniper took out 150 guys and somebody else saw it witnessed it. So, so you areth most lethal sniper in u.S. History. You have the five stars to prove it what struck me in the book though is that you considered the people you were killing, the iraqis you were killing quote, unquote. Savages. 

[00:08:09]


>> The people I was killing. Not just iraqis. Why did you consider the enemy savages, from their actions the way they lived day to day as far as the violence they commit on american troops. The beheadings, the rape of innocent villagers and townspeople that they go into. Just to intimidate them. They live by putting peer in other people's hearts. Civilized people don't act that way. 
>> Bill: You were so effective in iraq that they put $25,000 on your head if one of them killed you they would have been paid $20,000. Do you believe that they considered you a savage. 
>> I'm sure they did. Honestly I don't know and i really don't care. 
>> So you were committed to killing these people because you in your heart believed that they deserved to die? 
>> I wasn't so much committed to killing them ifsz I'm committed to making sure every servicemen over there american or allied came home. 
>> Bill: As a sniper your job is to kill them. Not wound them, not arrest them. You have to have a certain mentality to be a sniper you are killing them I'm killing them to protect my fellow americans. 
>> You liked that job in the book that comes. You know. Your wife didn't want you to do it. She wanted you to stay home. You went back how many times did you go back? Four times. You liked killing these guys. Did you ever figure that out? I mean, it is not a problem taking out someone who wants your people dead. That's not a problem at all. 
>> Bill: A lot of people coming back from both afghanistan and iraq, a lot of service people, very, very well trained service people have a problem adjusting back here in the united states. Did you have a any trouble coming back? 
>> I did in the beginning. The hardest part for me was getting out. I got cut from everything that I knew. You know, that lifestyle that I had been -- you know, I had been training for since I was a kid. And being around those guys and all of a sudden it's over with, tossed out into the civilian world which is not a bad thing. I mean, it's not that I'm not ignorant. I mean, can i fure things out. But when you go from a pace like that and then it kind of goes from 100 miles per hour to nothing, can you just kind of sit ig.N there with your head spinning trying to figure out, you know, what to do and where to do it. So, it's -- it's causing a lot of problems for a lted of guys. 

[00:10:44]


>> Bill: Rate is 41% syndrome of people coming wax from the battlefield. Enormous. I think we had that in vietnam as well. They didn't diagnose it as well back then. That's an enormous problem, is it not? 
>> I think it is. Yij ying that the war -- a lot of people probably didn't anticipate that the wars were going to last this long 19, 1920-year-olds kids. Setting in there I will say. This one of the things that happened to me. I got away from all the people who were telling my I had a problem. If you sit around and listen to people telling you you are messed up. You know, this is what is wrong this, that and the other. That stuff starts to get with you. I completely shifted focus on my end and put focus into my family and to what I was doing today. To kind of help me push through what I was dealing d with. And I'm not going to say that I got over it 100%, yeah. But when I have problems i talk to the t guys that I was over there with. Maybe they had something that I didn't know.Y how they solve their issues and it kind o of works itself out. Yeah, I mean, that's a pretty high ratio of over 40%. 
>> Bill: There a a lot of people t suffering. Gave good advice. Get away from the nay saras. You doing. This and get in with your guys. Develop alo network of support. Last question real quick. Training with the navy seals. Training you effective as possible to the battlefield. Do they ever say to you it's going to be over some day and when it's over you are going to have to take certain steps to decompress? 
>> For the most part after we train up, g we go out and we come back there is a big decompression time. A time for us to come down off the high and turn everything back around before they release us into the wild. That's one of the things that's different between our community and a lot of the other conventionalon forces. 

[00:12:48]


>> Bill: The book is service navy seal -- thank you very much.

>> Bill: Bill in the unresolved problem segment tonight how should the u.S. Deal with iran. Ben affleck new field about iran called are a go. I talked with him about it and how america should deal with the iranians. 
-- Hurts the carter administration that's why he lost to ronald reagan. A guy you like you though wasn't conscious at this time why are you making a movie about this. 
>> Great story. One thing it's a killer. Actually a comedy with the hollywood satire. Complicated cia movie. It's a political movie and it's all true. 
>> Bill: So you wanted to make an entertainment about a serious subject rescuing americans from a dictatorship, iran? 
>> I did. And the serious aspect of it was that this is really a tribute to the folks in our clandestined services and diplomats in the foreign service risking their lives over there tragically seeing examples of that very recently. Folks who are, what they give up to serve us and to serve our country. 
>> This is a valentine from ben affleck to the intelligence community. The same people who waterboarded the same people who renditioned, liberal friends going to say to you. 
>> I don't worry too much about what my liberal friends are going to say. To me I made a movie that my friends who are democrats and my friends who are republicans can both watch. That's not a political movie. 
>> In the back of your mind you didn't say look I'm glorifying people who maybe did bad things in the name of the country to protect -- 
>> -- listen, I have been to the cia. These are extraordinary honorable people it at the cia. Make no mistake about that. 
>> Bill: All right. That's good to hear. All right, now, iran again influencing presidential election because of the nuke thing. 
>> Well, I'm worried about it in the sense that everybody is. Obviously a trouble spot. Same regime that is in my movie in 197 with khameneiy. Islamist regime. We are still dealing with them. If they got a bomb, I think everybody thinks that would be trouble. I'm just an amateur pundit. But my feeling about it is one has to be judicious. I don't think there is a lot of daylight between. 

[00:17:24]


>> What does judicious mean. Here is the choice strangle them with sanctions which seems to be working right now because their currency is collapsing right now. 
>> They are in bad trouble. 
>> Bill: Give go in reaches a certain point and whack them. 
>> My understanding is netanyahu or israel is not entirely capable of whacking them to the extent they need to be whacked. I wouldn't trust u.S. Foreign policy to any other government. I would be judicious in the sense that hyper sen tages of americans don't want to see another war. Be quite careful. However we have to have a line beyond which we say that is not acceptable in iran. 
>> If that line were crossed by iran and they were very close, you wouldn't oppose military action to stop their nuclear program? 
>> I wouldn't oppose military action, but the question is where the line is. I certainly wouldn't make the line public and I wouldn't be backed into the line. 
>> Bill: All right. The movie is argo. Ben affleck, we appreciate it. 
>> Bill: Coming up. Richard dawkins running hard, try running four. Fortunately we've got ink. It gives us 5x the rewards on our internet, phone charges and cable, plus at office supply stores. Rewards we put right back into our business. This is the only thing we've ever wanted to do and ink helps us do it. Make your mark with ink from chase. ?????? ??????

>> Bill: Impact segment tonight, you may remember atheist richard dawkins is he on a crusade to convince believers they are idiots. Who am I to turn down a joust? I debated religion with him and then continue the discussion with dr. Deepak chopra. 
>> Now, you wrote this book and this book, you know, is marketed somewhat toward children adolescents, correct? 
>> And you want them. You want them to not only believe in science, which i think is a good thing. But reject god and religion. 
>> No. This is a book about science. It doesn't talk about god. 
>> It mocks god I looked at it it? 
>> No it doesn't. Which you have looked at. 
>> Bill: I went through that book and you basically are saying that everything can be explained by science. Correct? 
>> Well, everything about the natural world can be explained by science. Where does it mock god? 
>> It basically says these things are myths, not true. 
>> Every chapter has myths at the beginning of the chapter. 
>> Bill: Hah-ha. 
>> Egyps. 
>> Bill: Playing semantic games with me. You are trying to get to the kid and say you are an idiot if you believe with god. 
>> Nothing with god. Myths from all over the world. Judeo myth is thrown in occasionally as one of many myths from around the world. 

[00:22:34]


>> Bill: Judeo-christian philosophy is not a myth. 
>> Bill: Through the history. So worst regimes have been atheist stick, communists under stalin. 
>> Nothing to do with atheism. 
>> Bill: No, really? See, my hypothesis is that religion is a constraint on society. Goodwill toward men, teach treating everybody as jesus taught the same as you. How you would like to be treated. The 10 commandments. There are constraints against bad behavior. 
>> Of which the 10 commandments do you value. 
>> All of them. 
>> Thou shall not make a graven image. 
>> Thou shall not violate the sabbath. 
>> Thou shall not kill. 
>> Widespread believe. 
>> Not by joseph stalin they all had one thing in common they didn't believe in god. 
>> In any case it has nothing to do with whether you believe in god or not. 
>> You don't see religion as constraint on human behavior. Evil. Who is more evil. 
>> What I do think logical connection between believing in god and doing some times doing evil things. 
>> So what do you say to a guy like dawkins? I had him on twice. And you have never talked to him face to face, right? 
>> Yes, he ambushed me when i was in oxford. He used a subterfuge channel 4 called me wanted to do interview. Went into the interview. 
>> Bill: It was him. 
>> It was him. 
>> Bill: You kicked his butt. 
>> I did for three hours i kicked his butt. He took three minutes out of that, put it in a movie called enemies of reason answered ambushed some very other respectful subjects. 
>> Bill: I think dawkins is a dishonest guy. 
>> By the way he uses scientific credentials to cam fallujah his bigotry. 
>> Bill: But I don't know if it's bigotry. He really believes that we're idiots, doctor, he does. He thinks he is a genius. He thinks you and me and the rest of the bleeforts are idiots. Now, he basically says that the united states isn't founded on judeo-christian philosophy, that's just absurd. Our justice system is based on the 10 commandments. In fact what hangs in the supreme court? The 10 commandments. They haven't gotten rid of them yet. They are there. 

[00:24:55]


>> Believer. 
>> Absolutely abraham lincoln read the bible every day. You will never get through a guy like dawkins. One motion with them. Don't you find. >>It unscientific way. 
>> They get really upset. 
>> To attack somebody you don't believe in with such vigor and enthusiasm and anger. 
>> I'm not angry dawkins doesn't believe. I don't care what he said. He gets really teed off. What has convinced you that there is a deity? And do you believe in an active god? A god that actually intervenes in human life? 
>> Well, you know, scientific background and the more we understand the nature of the universe through science, the more we also understand there is more unknown and there is is the unknowable. The unknowable because sign tisk discoveries show that the laws of physics themselves preclude us from intellectually getting in touch with the source. You have to go beyond the intellect. You have to listen to the heart. The heart has reasons that reason doesn't know. And you have to, in a sense, understand the great, the great prophet jesus. Whoever, they transcended to a level where they were in touch with the mystery. They used the language of the tine. I'm the father of one. 
>> That's a matter of faith though. Do you believe that there is an active deity that interconvenience in human nature interconvenience in the world? 
>> I think there is an active source an intelligence source that is omnipresent. Omnipotent. Omniscient. And that we have connection to that. 
>> Bill: Do you believe in miracles? 
>> We have free will, too. The fact that we live, that we exist is a miracle. Why do we have to even go beyond that. 
>> Bill: Because the meteorite hit the world and that's what happened. The meteorite did this and then evolution. You know, but, look, the fact comes down to. 

[00:27:00]


>> Evolution doesn't contradict the fact. 
>> Bill: That's what I say intelligent design does not contradict science and science has never been able to manufacture one single human cell, have they? 
>> No. 
>> Bill: After all of this advancement. 
>> Most primitive form of intelligence has not been created and whatever has been created comes from intelligence that is connected to the source. 
>> Bill: Up next, the most compelling interview of the night. Involving a campaign to wipe out the word illegal. Wow. ] 
-- you can stay in and share something... Or you can get out there and actually share something. ?????? ?????? the lexus december to remember sales event is on. This is the pursuit of perfection. fats. Avoid bad. Don't go over 2000... 1200 calories a day. Carbs are bad. Carbs are good. The story keeps changing. So I'm not listening... To anyone but myself.

For multi grain flakes tt are anxcellent source of fiber try great grains banana nut crunch and cranberry almond crunch. 

[00:29:36]


>> Bill: Thanks for staying with us, for this special edition of the factor? In the unresolved move on posted video with the headline wondrous word we hear all too offensive on fox news. Take a listen. 
>> Calling a person illegal takes away their humanity. We can join our voices to ask the media government t drop the I word now. The I word derails more conversation immigration a human rights. 
>> Illegal aliens are in the country including many murders and rapists. 
>> Racially charged, illegally accurate and morally wrong. 
>> Illegal racial epitaph. A way of legitimizing violence against a particular group of people because of what they're. That's the definition of a hate crime. We can stamp out this. No human being is illegal. I word. 
>> Bill: Fine the far left doesn't like the word. Who is really looking out for them in the common sense department? Recently I spoke about this with monique can a novea campaigner for the drop the i word movement first of all you are from el salvador. Did you come here legally yourself. 
>> No I didn't actually. 
>> You are illegal immigrant yourself? >>. No but that's not what I'm here to talk about. 
>> Bill: I understand. We have to define how are in addition to what you believe. Did you comen here illegally. 
>> Iev came here as a war refugee. 
>> From he will el salvador. 
>> My family all easily got papers. 
>> Bill: Have you papers and you were here because of the -- you know I covered the war and actually when you left el salvador in 1982 I was there getting shot at. 
>> Okay. 
>> Bill: I know what you are going through and I'm happy you are here. 
>> I am happy I am here too. Part of the drop the I word legacy is picking up where immigrants started doing immigrant rights work in the 1980s during the sanctuary movement telling their stories and putting humanity on the front burner and making sure that our laws were humane. It's the same thing that we are doing now. 

[00:31:39]


>> With your intent but you are misguided in the sense that you feel that using the word description illegal alien which I do all the time by the way is, somehow wrong. It is a crime to enter the united states illegally. It is a federal crime. Woe are a nation much laws. Key I do fine the books as they stand. I'm not committing a hate crime by saying illegal aliens are just that. 
>> We are a nation of laws and we respect laws but we also respect humane laws. Also seen in the past that laws thatin weren't hume have been changed. 
>> Bill: Then work to change them. Don't demonize people who are accurate in the description as using a slur or using a hate word because it's not true. 
>> It's funny that you say it's inaccurate and all this. I think that we can take a page from foxag news latino who doesn't use the I word at all who has the policy that they will not join the bandwagon of people dehumanizing immigrants and using this language. 
>> Bill: But I don't think I'm doing that I don't think I'm dehumanizing anybody by describing what the reality is. Let me ask you a couple of questions about your belief system. Do you believe we should have open borders here that anyonshe who comes to the united states should be able to come? 
>> I think that what we should be doing right now is looking at the reality and the reality is is. 
>> Bill: Now, you know, with all due respect ms. Novoa, what you did, what you did. 
>> They deserve the right. 
>> Bill: What you did just dodge. 
>> As workers as family members. 
>> Bill: You dodged the question and now you are filibustering. That is two things weon don't allow on this program. I will rephrase the question. Do you know in open borders that people should be able to come to the united states without any impediment? Yes or no? 
>> I believe that our laws should get modern. I don't think. 
>> Bill: I'm going to put you in charge. I'm putting you ine. Charge. You are in charge of modernizing or changing the law. 
>> Um-huh. 
>> Bill: The immigration law would be under your regime? 
>> I think that the first thing that we need to do, which is why we are doing the drop the I word campaign is to put human beings at the center. 

[00:33:44]


>> Bill: That's the law putrs humanth beings at the center of the conversation. 
>> Until we do that. 
>> Bill: I just appointed you you are the czar. Tell the people what you want. Your the czar. What is the law on immigration under your regime? 
>> A humane law looks like pattern who is undocumented, an undocumented worker, a worker being able to move about in a way that will allow for themal to provide for their family. 
>> Bill: Does everybody get that status? Everybody who wants it? You haven't even thought this out, ms. Novoa, you have not even thought this out. With all due respect because i appreciate you coming in here. You come in here with a very hot campaign, allpa right. Run by a far left web site, demonizing people like me who are accurately telling the people what's happening, and you don't even know what you want. 
>> Again, fox news latino agree with us. Maybe you can talk a little bit to him. 
>> Bill: I like fox news latino but I do my own program. 
>> The I word is racist. It's not language that is accurate. 
>> Bill: I'm not a racist.'M I'm just reporting what is happening. People are coming here and they're not just latino. They are asian, they are russian, they are everyone. And they are coming here and crossing our borders illegally therefore they are illegal aliens. I'm not aa racist. I'm not tryingi' to hurt anybody. I'm trying to tell the people the truth. But I haveru to say I'm very surprised that I gave you the opportunity to gee fine for millions of people what you want the law to be and you can't. 
>> We're here to talk about the I word today. 
>> Bill: No, no. You are here to talk about what I want to talk about. This is my program. 
>> While they impact -- while the intention may not be, you know, racist, while people may not be intending to be racist. People are beingte impacted every day in their lives. 
>> Bill: Coming up, the strangest moments ever in factctctctct It's hard to see opportunity in today's challengi environment. Unless you have the right perspective. BNY Mellon Wealth Management has the vision and experience to look beyond the obvious. We'll uncover opportunities, find hidden risk, and make success a reality. BNY Mellon Wealth Management

>> Bill: Thanks for staying with us, I'm bill o'reilly personal story segment tonight. It has been on the air 16 years, can you believe it? All that time there have been many memorable moments. We have chosen a few of the strangest for you tonight. Some of the most outrageous things that have happened on the program. Tonight, it's all wrapped up into one segment and we begin with our old pal michael moore we talked with at the democratic convention way back in 2004 when the iraq war was raging. What did they die for? 
>> They died to remove a brutal dictator who had killed hundreds of thousands of people. That's what they died for. 
>> That was not the reason they were given. 
>> Bill: Weapons of mass destruction was a mistake it was not a lie. 
>> Brutal dictators in this world. If you sacrifice. Let me finish on this. Would you sacrifice your child to he remove one of the other 30 brutal dictators on this planet? 
>> Bill: Depends on what the circ+stances about. 
>> You would sacrifice your own child for that. 
>> Bill: I would sacrifice myself not any children to remove the taliban. Would you? 
>> Huh-uh. 
>> Would you? That's my next question. Would you sacrifice yourself to remove the taliban. 
>> Sacrifice my life to track down the people that killed 3,000 people on our soil, absolutely. 
>> Bill: Given refuge by the taliban. 
>> We didn't go after them, did we. 
>> Bill: We removed the taliban. 
>> That's why the taliban are still killing our soldiers there. 
>> Bill: Moore, you can't kill everybody, come on. 
>> Bill: We say that her positions are radical and they are radical. 
>> Let me tell what you is radical. What's radical is to send more americans to die in this war which is a monumental blunder by a president who swaggered us into it which, by the way, the at least tacet approval of the democratic party there is a lot of sin to go around here. 
>> Bill: What's radical. 
>> You want to send more people to this war? Is that your position? 
>> Bill: If we cut and run out thereof like you want to do he wield be putting every american in thousand times more jeopardy than they are now. 
>> We are going to cut and run anyway, bill. 

[00:39:50]


>> Bill: You are a cut and run guy and I don't want my family in danger -- 
>> -- you want to stay the course, don't you? 
>> Bill: Here is what I want to do. I want to give the iraqis a chance to train their army so they can defeat these people who are trying to turn it into a terrorist state: 
>> You wouldn't send your children to this war, bill. 
>> Bill: My cousin just enlisted in the army you don't know what the hell you are talking about. 
>> Congratulations. 
>> Bill: Is he a patriot don't denigrate his service or i will boot I you right off the set. 
>> Bill: The term white devils, would that be good. 
>> We are talking about the most mohammed white man is the devil. If you don't believe that trust me, you white folk also do to the real one gets here. 
>> So white devils we are going to hear that. 
>> The devil is wicked and he is a master of deception. I say in the words of malcolm x if you find any good white people kill them first before they turn bad. 
>> Bill: You don't want to kill anybody do you. 
>> Sir I want to do to your people what you delighted in doing to us. I want you to treat you the way you have treated us. You have killed our men and our women and our babies. Of course I want to give you the same hell you have given us. 
>> Bill: Are you willing to break the law to do that. 
>> We believe peace in possible, violence in necessary. 
>> Bill: You still went out in july and said everything was great and off that a lot of people bought stock and lost everything they had. 
>> No. 
>> Bill: Yes, oh yes. 
>> I said it wasn't a good investment. 
>> Bill: Don't give me any of that we just heard the words. You didn't say that you? Want me to play it again to you. 
>> You didn't listen to it. 
>> Bill: I listened to every word you said and I have want transcript right here. 
>> I said it wasn't a good investment. 
>> Bill: You said going forward we are going to be swell. 
>> No I didn't say swell.

>> The problem going on your show. 
>> Bill:90%. 90%. None of this was your fault. Oh. No people lost millions of dollars. It wasn't your fault. Come on, you coward. Say the truth. 

[00:41:52]


>> What do you mean coward? 
>> Bill: You are a coward. You blame everybody else. You are a coward. 
>> Here is the problem with going on your show. You start ranting and the only way to respond I almost to look as boorish as you. Here is the fact. I specifically said in the quote you just played that i didn't think it was a good investment. 
>> Bill: Tre two years. Bottom line is the stock drops 90%. Any private industry you are out. 
>> Bill: What was your drug of choice? 
>> Alcohol. 
>> Bill: You were drinking a lot. 
>> Well, you know I used to do it because I was bored pretty much. 
>> Did you drink when you were playing a lot. 
>> Oh my god. Like a rock star. 
>> Bill: Give me a stale scale on 1 to 10, 10 being the biggest party animal where were you. 
>> I was there in the upper echelon. 
>> Bill: Do you regret it? 
>> No. I don't regret it at all. 
>> I think all women quite honestly would prefer marriage by and large to different kind of. 
>> Bill: So she hates you? 
>> No. She actually worships me. You know me. 
>> Bill: I don't know about that hair. Something going on up there. 
>> You can check it out. 
>> Bill: Gene, I'm not going to check it out. I'm going to sit here and interview you. I'm not checking your hair out. 
>> Bill: When we last left you in 1990, you were arrested by the u.S. Military. Were you tortured by the military. 
>> No. It was a tv show, man. Get a grip on reality. 
>> Bill: What have you been doing alf.

>> What I got to say to everyone from every political persuasion in the nation is this, scram. Get out of here. 
>> Bill: You are a little aggressive. 
>> There what do you mean? 
>> Bill: You are like in people's faces. 
>> Are you saying I'm in your face right now? 
>> Bill: A little bit.

>> Bill: In the second personal story segment tonight, three of television's most familiar faces recently brought their games to the table. Here now, jon stewart, la bar burton and jimmy walker all in the no spin zone. We begin with mr. Walker. Jay leno, I have been on the program a dozen times. I don't really know jay. Respectful to me. Nice to me. 
>> Great guy. 
>> Bill: He does a fine program. But you feel that he has changed a bit? 
>> He has changed. He has let us down. Weed all started literally in the last same five year period. 30 million people are not out of work. 30 million people are just in between jobs. 
[ Laughter ] you are not drowning, you are just in between land. 
[ Laughter ] 
>> Bill: You came one leno? 
>> And then jay worked for me as a writer, along with david letterman and many others. Louie anderson and a lot of other people. 
>> Bill: Where were you when he was writing for you. 
>> On our show in los angeles. 
>> Bill: How did leno change. 
>> He changed in terms of bringing on new talent, which is that spot which is johnny carson, jack parr, steve allen. He has not broken in his 20 something years on the air, he has not broken one major act. 
>> Bill: You know, it's a different time now andaj the ratings pressure I bs so intense. 
>> Jay is numberre one. Jay can do whatever he wants. 
>> Bon jovi ride in air force one with the president. That's pretty cool. Joe biden, he had to drive up in a van with the guys who sang "who let the dogs out." 
>> You can tell me 10 minutes a weekho going to destroy your whole career, I'm not buying that all I say to jay leno is do whatin was done for you. That's all. And now jay used to come on every five to six weeks on the letterman show. I got him on the merv griffin show a billion times. That's what happened. It doesn't hurt you if you bring on the new guy because you want to see somebody knew. When johnny carson was the host. We didn't know johnny carson. High exsoughted vatican leader. When jay leno took over, it was one of us. And wen said okay, our guy is is in. Yea! And it would be like bill clinton getting in and closing the door to james carville. 

[00:49:01]


>> Bill: You were down in the -- I didn't see you though. You were in tampa. 
>> We couldn't get on the floor and get press passes. 
>> Bill: They wouldn't let you in because you would mock them. 
>> I didn't realize that was their objection. 
>> Bill: Why should we let this guy in he is going to mock us? >>Is the dnc put us up this is true in south carolina. 
>> Bill: You took their money. 
>> They did not allow us to be -- they wouldn't even put us in a hotel in state. We were set up in south carolina. And the north carolina peoplepl I will tell you I will say, this the nicest people, most hospitable you want to meet. There is a certain point because you know us coming from new york. Where I felt like it was almost sarcastic. 
ill: THAT THEY WERE Morning you like being too nice can I get you. Are you doing good? I would be do you want a pies of this? 
>> Bill: Running screaming into the night. Was there anything at all at the democratic convention that impressed you? 
>> At the democratic convention? 
>> Bill: Yes. 
>> Streets did not run red with the blood of protesters. I was impressed that the whole thing didn't disintegrate into anarchy. 
>> Bill: Clint eastwood. 
>> I thought he was great. Clint eastwood at 84 could take both of us and throw us over a bridge. He was the best. Scripted info commercials. To have a guye get up there. 
>> Bill: He is real. 
>> He is real and he is doing his own thing. It was a breath of fresh air. 
>> Bill: Did you think it was disrespectful to talk to a chair that represented the president of the united states, your man, the guy that you idolize? 
>> Yes, no. My idol. You are thinking of he elvis. I don't think it'si disrespectful to talk to a chair. These are political conventions. The whole point of these things is they should be called three days of disrespect to the other guy. 
>> Bill: I'm going to submit to you mr. Burton that they can compete in the free marketplace like nickelodeon, cartoon channel and other things and do just as well without taking the taxpayer money because we're in an era where we have to bring down the spending. We have to do it. And you say? 

[00:51:12]


>> And I say you are missing the point. , Bill. If you are going to focus on the $414 million, you are missing the point. America has always claimed to be the nation that wants to provide a quality education to all of its citizens. And I'm not saying that pbs is perfect. And you are quite right. The sesame workshop can take care of itself and we don't need to worry about big bird. He is going to be fine. He is going to be okay. But the underlying issue, bill, is how -- how do we do the job j of educating america's children? 
>> Bill: So you believe that if we pull -- the government pulls the 450 million a year from pbs, that education over the television airways, directed at children is going to crumble and that will hurt the kids. 
>> It's going to suffer. It's going to suffer. There are already plenty of children falling through the cracks, bill. Come on, let's get real. We are either going to live up to the promise that this experiment is or going to be a be aam it's the promise america holds out to all those who live within our boundaries. 
>> Bill: When we come right back, 50 years half a century after their first hit record the legendary beach boys have another best selling song that has never happened in the history of e e e e e feeling skin.

[ Designer ] ENOUGH OF JUST COVERING UP My moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. I decided enough is enough. ?????? ?????? 
[ Spa Lady ] I STARTED ENBREL. It's clinically proven to provide clearer skin. 
[ RV Guy ] ENBREL MAY NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE 
-- and may not clear you completely, but for many, it gets skin clearer fast, within 2 months, and keeps it clearer up to 9 months. 
[ Male Announcer ] BECAUSE ENBREL????, ETANERCEPT, Suppresses your immune system, it may lower your ability to fight infections. Serious, sometimes fatal, events including infections, tuberculosis, lymphoma, other cancers, and nervous system and blood disorders have occurred. Before starting enbrel, your doctor should test you for tuberculosis and discuss whether you've been to a region where certain fungal infections are common. Don't start enbrel if you have an infection like the flu. Tell your doctor if you're prone to infections, have cuts or sores, have had hepatitis b, have been treated for heart failure, or if, while on enbrel, you experience persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, or paleness. If you've had enough, ask your dermatologist about enbrel. . 
>> Bill: Welcome back to this edition of the factor. Toe , the beach bys 50 years later. Recently, I sat down with brian wilson and mike love and talked about their success and how that music magic really happens. 
>> Outside of the beatles, the beach boyu have endured the longest, as far as people being emotionally attached to their music. That's why you continue to be successful. ???????????? ?????? 50 years on the road you are 97-years-old. He's 97, all right. 

[00:55:45]


>> But I look so good. 
>> Bill: It is true, out in california that is what happens. What is the emotional attachment the music has to the american people? 
>> We try to do in our songs, themes that relate to people. When we started out it was serving, southern california, california girls. It was going to the dance, surfer girl. All these great things that were going on in our lives. I think they were going on in millions of lives. We connected through the themes along with the harmonies and created that feeling. 
>> Bill: That's what it is. People go to see your concert and listen to your records because they are celebrating their own lives. Every time a song comes on, a flashback -- when I was a lauer, I was singing slope john b. ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ?????? 
bill: You nice have connected to the american people when your songs come on, they remember the good times in their lives. 
>> That's right. ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? 
>> bill: You are going to be 70-years-old, next week.

=======================================================

Weill be getting a live report on from richard engel in gaza in just a couple of minutes. But I'm also thankful tonight to be able to report that the election has finally concluded in arizona, where it took them 14 days to count votes and announce the results this year. In the end, it turns out that all three competitive congressional races in that state went to the democrats. But the competitive u.S. Senate race for republican jon kyl's old seat, that seat stayed republican. And yes, the county sheriff who did the whole taxpayer-funded stunt about having his cold case posse uncover the fraud of president obama's birth certificate, that sheriff did get re-elected, barely. Last time he won by a 13-point landslide. This time he won by much less than that, but did get re-elected. And that public publicity-hungry arizona sheriff is not the only arizona republican elected official who has recently been fixated on the president's birth certificate. The arizona secretary of state this year threatened to keep president obama off the ballot in arizona for this year's election. Because, you know, kenya, or whatever. And because that is the record of arizona's secretary of state, the state's current top elections official, I think nobody had very high expectations for him in terms of how well he would do running elections in the state of arizona. And indeed, the arizona elections this year went horribly. And it took them 14 days to even come up with the results. But they do have results. And surprise, I'm thankful to report that that same arizona republican secretary of state, who was a birther and who threatened to screw up the whole national presidential election because of his flirtation with birtherism, and who supervised what appears to be a pretty terribly botched election in his state, that guy, that secretary of state in arizona has now responded to his botched election by saying that he is not proposing making the next election worse. And this is news. Because republicans in wisconsin and ohio and iowa since the election have proposed making voting and voter registration even more difficult the next time around than it was this time. But this guy, ken bennett, arizona's republican secretary of state, the birther guy, today he did not do that. Instead, he is proposing just sort of normal, technocratic reforms for arizona, that seemingly are not designed to make things worse. He's proposing voting centers, where anybody in the county can go vote, no matter where where are specific precinct is. It's been in lots of other places, even used in some parts of arizona. It is now panacea, but it is not the pursuit of further voter suppression, from a republican elections official. And for that, I image arizona voters who stood in these long, long lines this year, and then had to wait 14 days for a result, for that, I imagine arizona voters are thankful, as am i, as somebody who wants our voting process to be where the two parties compete and not how they compete, I am thankful for that news today. And while we are on the subject of being thankful, I will also say that I am thankful for this guy, former utah governor, jon huntsman. Yesterday, president obama's campaign manager, jim messina, did an event for politico.Com, in which he explained that the obama campaign was very relieved that the republican party did not pick jon huntsman as their nominee to run against president obama this year. Obviously, governor huntsman did run for president this year, for about five minutes. But he got out quickly and cleanly once it became clear that the republican party this year was not going to pick a guy who tweeted things like this. "To be clear, I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy." Yeah, that was not going to work for the republican party this year. And so jon huntsman got out, early. And while the obama campaign must have been relieved when he exited the race, the fact that he exited the race completely, without having to go through the worst of the nonsense from the republican primary, and the fact that he got out in a way that largely kept him from being associated with the ultimately losing and now politically toxic mitt romney campaign, all of that means that jon huntsman is alive and well in american politics. Jon huntsman is available to be a potential leader in the future republican party. And whether or not you like the republican party, frankly, that party having somebody available for a leadership role, who has been a successful governor and a successful ambassador to china, who has a constructive mutually respectful relationship with president obama, who was willing to put country first enough to work for president obama, even though he is a republican, a guy who believes in science and isn't embarrassed about it, to have that guy survive in republican politics this year in 2012, while mitt romney disappears forever. I mean, hearing jim messina admit now how highly president obama thinks of jon huntsman, and how much he was worried about him as an opponent is a remainder to be thankful for jon huntsman. And frankly, hopeful that he keeps his hat in the ring in his own party. And thankful today, too, that the first post-election direct mail thingy that I got from rick santorum, remember him, was a political overture wrapped around the idea of buying made in the usa christmas presents. Yeah, rick santorum, it wasn't about evil obama care or how horrible it is that gay people want to get married or some imagined war on religion or any of the others rick santorum shtick, it was all about buying made in the usa stuff. Okay. Let's start there. Let's talk. I am thankful to report that the republican governor of iowa, terry branstad, is suggesting that the iowa republican party should get rid of its straw poll. Not suggesting getting rid of the iowa caucuses, just the straw poll. Which is not a real poll or a real election of any kind, just a republican party fund-raiser, where republican candidates bribe people and bus in people from all over the state for a big fake contest that the national media treat as a real thing. Even though it is nonsense, which you can tell by the fact that michele bachmann was the winner of it this year before her complain imploded. The iowa straw poll means nothing. It is a hoax that the republican party of iowa perpetrates on the country and the candidates every year, and the media goes along with it, every year, even though we all know that's true. But now the republican governor of that state says it is ridiculous, let's get rid of it. That would be a blow against cynicism. Thatould be a blow for political rationality. And I am thankful for that news. Not all symbolic political events are pointless, though. And in today's news, I am also thankful that there is a somewhat bizarre political tradition in this country at thanksgiving time of the president of the united states pardoning a turkey or two, so they get to live and not die, even as the country prepares to cook and eat the carcasses of millions of birds of their same species. In our american culture, it is very rare that we celebrate mercy, right? That we model mercy, as laudatory behavior by a strong leader. And so I am thankful, every year, that we go through this mercy pageant, where the president issues a formal pardon to those big, awkward birds. This year in particular, I am thankful that the birds were named cobbler and gobbler. Cobbler and gobbler. Watch. 

[00:07:18]


>> You know, they say that life is all about second chances. And this november, I could not agree more. So in the spirit of the season, I have one more gift to give. And it goes to a pair of turkeys named cobbler and gobbler. The american people have spoken and these birds are moving forward. 
[ Turkey gobbles ] ve this bird. Now, I joke, but for the first time in our history, the winners of the white house turkey pardon were chosen through a highly competitive online vote. And once again, nate silver completely nailed it. The guy's amazing. He predicted these guys would win. 
>> I am thankful that the president made a nate silver joke when he pardoned the thanksgiving turkeys, cobbler and gobbler, this year. I'm thankful that nate silver's professional success this election season has at least temporarily put a halt to the nonsense questioning of whether polling is real. Of whether numbers can be trusted to be true, even when you do not like what the numbers indicate. If you are thankful that barack obama was re-elected as president, I have to say, you are probably not thankful that john boehner was re-elected as speaker of the house. And vice versa, if you're psyched about john boehner, you're probably not psyched about president obama. But there is one thing about the re-election of both of these men that I think is maybe worth being thankful for. I am thankful that john boehner forever and president obama may be only recently, these two men have been willing to show emotion in public. To be big, tough, american leaders of the highest order, right? Both of them in positions where they really answer to no one but the voters. And they are willing to be seen shedding a tear, without shame. I am thankful for that in our national american leadership. I am thankful that the brilliant bbc series, "house of cards," about the most evil politician ever, a mini series that I've watched a million times and I've been addicted to for years, I am happy, I am thankful, I am thankful that "house of cards" is being remade by kevin spacey and it comes out in february. I'm thankful for nbc white house producer, shauna thomas, who sent us this picture for the lines of early voting in houston this year. And we posted that online and that led to our viewers from all over the country sending us pictures of long lines when you guys went to vote early, which helped us bring national coverage to the issue of just how long people were waiting in line to vote, even before the long lines on election day itself. We could not have covered that story without you guys sending us data for us to follow up on. And I am very thankful that you watching this show consistently send stuff into our blog that helps us cover the news in a way we could not do otherwise. I am thankful for that. And while we're on the subject, honestly, I'm thankful for everybody who had the stamina and resolve to stand in the long lines to vote this year. I'm thankful for anybody who volunteered in the election effort on any side whose job it was to talk people into voting, and to help people stick it out, despite how hard they made it in some places this year to actually get your vote cast. I'm thankful that regardless of the two candidates in this case and their two parties, in one state this year, it proved untenable to win a seat in the united states senate by mocking and attacking your opponent for being part native american. Particularly on this holiday, i am thankful that in 2012, running an overtly race-based campaign could take an incumbent who everybody thought would probably win and hold on to his seat, could take that incumbent and instead have him lose his seat by eight points. After that campaign, regardless of who he is, I am thankful that that campaign was a failure. I am thankful that the satire site, the onion, ran this headline in the middle of the petraeus affair scandal. Right? Nation horrified to learn about war in afghanistan, while reading up on petraeus sex scandal. Yes, yes. The onion gets it right again. Sometimes satire gets it better than outrage and explanation ever could. And this goes in the pantheon of perfect onion headline. I'm thankful for foreign correspondents, and news organizations who pay them, and pay their expenses, which are considerable, and who give them the freedom to explain exactly what it is that they are seeing out there in the big, dangerous world. I'm thankful that we are at a time in american media where we have foreign correspondents who are not only daring and capable, but who are critical and independent and uncowed by anyone. I am very thankful for that. I am thankful, specifically, for abc's martha raddatz, who is the first foreign correspondent to ever cross over into the role of solo debate moderator in the presidential season. She was the solo vice presidential debate moderator this year, and she ran a freaking excellent debate. And while we are on the subject of people on other networks, for whom I am thankful, I am specifically thankful for mark nolera cbs, who I've never met, but whose twitter stream is an factual statements declaring basic details of the president's movement and all sorts of political things that all of us end up needing detail on. Why isn't there going to be a second refueling when the president is coming back from asia? Mark knoller's on it. Tail winds from japan. What was in the bags of food handed out at the white house charity event? Mike knoller's on it, and it includes yams. I'm thankful that in just a few weeks, the great city of chicago is going to be organizing a welcome home parade to mark the end of the iraq war. A parade on december 15th to thank americans who have fought in iraq and who have fought in afghanistan. I am thankful for the iraq and afghanistan veterans who themselves decided to self-start veteran's cleanup and recovery crews for the coast in new york and new jersey when hurricane sandy hit. I'm thankful there is still an american automobile industry, when it was not at all clear just a few years ago that that would be true. I'm thankful that the american automobile industry not only exists, but it is kicking butt. I am thankful for that. I'm thankful that when my pal, xeni jardin got diagnosed with breast cancer this year, xeni decided to go public with it in a way that has led millions of people to look at cancer differently and more critically, in a way that is uncompromisingly unpatronizing and very smart. Like everything she does. I'm thankful for xeni. I'm thankful for the reporter name terry camp at the localbc affiliate in flint, michigan. He's the reporter who got vice presidential nominee paul ryan to admit that contrary to what the nra was saying and multi-million dollar ad buys around the country, that actually president obama wasn't changing gun laws to take anyone's guns away. And then paul ryan pulled off himicrophone and his handler put that piece of paper up in front of the camera and paul ryan never did another local news interview until he lost the election and the campaign was over. I'm thankful for local news reporters who work generally in lousy conditions with lousy support for lousy pay, and who do things as wide rangingly wonderful as ktla covering the story of the glendale bear wandering the streets of los angeles, to cbs atlanta, building this wacky graphic to accompany the story of the georgia republican state senators holding a seminar on president obama's mind control techniques, to the political reporter for the abc affiliate in miami who had the big pitcher of water thrown all over him, when he was bravely trying to report on the story of the scandal-ridden now former congressman, david rivera. I'm thankful, specifically, for james carter, who brought the infamous 47% video from mitt romney to light with help from david corn at "mother jones" magazine. And that video, of course, ended up being a bigger deal, even, than how distracted everybody got by the fact that james carter is the grandson of former president james carter. I'm thankful for reported local politics blogs, some of which are partisan and some of which aren't. Sites like eclecta blog in michigan, and ohio capital blog in ohio for reporting out and documenting local political stories in a way that we really need nationally, but we sometimes can no longer get from the local more official press, since the business model has cost so many reporters their jobs. I'm thankful for the jackson free press, specifically, staying on the mississippi voter i.D. Story, when those of us up here in new york were having a heck of a time trying to follow the twists and turns of that mississippi voter i.D. Story any other way. And we couldn't have done it without them. I'm thankful to the "miami herald" for keeping this great reporter, carol rosenberg, on the guantanamo beat, even when the country has largely turned away from that story. Carol rosenberg's reporting is definitive and relentless, and it is a service to the country that the "miami herald" has kept her on that beat. I am thankful to the republicans and to the conservatives who will brave the people on their own side who tell them not to do it and who will nevertheless come talk to liberal hosts like me and the other liberal hosts like me here on msnbc. And yes, that means steve schmidt and michael steele and meghan McCain, who we've been able to bring on board officially here at this network, but also, everybody else on the right, who was willing to come on just as a guest, because you are not afraid to leave the echo chamber. I will not say your name here for fear it will get all your christmas party invitations rescinded from your friends on the right. But you know who you are and i thank you. And I hope there are more of you next year. I'm thankful for c-span. I'm thankful for the election that we just went through. And I'm thankful that it is over. And that it really, really, really, I swear, it really is too soon to start talking about 2016, for a long time, it will be too soon to talk about 2016. I am thankful for that. And for the fact that through this flawed and contested, but ultimately noble system of regular elections and representative democracy, what we have in this country are peaceful transitions of power. I am thankful for all of that. And you know what, I am thankful for the fact that the highest profile person in our entire country other than our president is our nation's top diplomat. With tonight's cease-fire in the middle east, I am very, very thankful for diplomacy. American diplomacy and just diplomacy. We have more on that just ahead, live from the middle east. There is a lot to be thankful for this thanksgiving eve, including the fact that ours is a country that makes a holiday out of thankfulness. There's a lot ahead tonight.

>>> When a cease-fire between israel and gaza took effect today, it was 2:00 p.M. On the east coast of the united states, with a time difference that meant it was 9:00 p.M. In gaza. And this is how people there reacted. After eight straight days of very fierce fighting, very welcome news. Today, when the fighting stopped, people poured into the streets of gaza, cheering. Now, it was not a given that the cease-fire would happen today. Not, especially, after a bomb exploded this morning on a bus in tel aviv in israel, injuring dozens of people. After that bombing, the rockets out of gaza into israel and the bombardment continued right up until the cease-fire was scheduled to go into effect. Right up to the minute. I mean, the cease-fire was scheduled to go into effect at 2:00 p.M. Eastern time, right? At least one israeli missile landed in gaza as 1:57 p.M. Even after that, at 1:59 p.M., four rockets were launched into israel from gaza. But then a minute later, the cease-fire was due to take hold and it stopped. What was immediately noted, i think, particularly for those of us watching from over here, watching from the united states, was just how much our own country ended up being at the center of the effort to stop the fighting. We've been talking on this show the last few days about how the nation of egypt is really the key connection for the united states to both sides in the fight right now. And that was driven home today by the fact that when the cease-fire was announced, it was announced by u.S. Secretary of state hillary clinton, and egypt's foreign minister at a press conference in egypt. 
>> In the days ahead, the united states will work with partners across the region to consolidate this progress, improve conditions for the people of gaza, provide security for the people of israel. Ultimately, every step must move us toward a comprehensive peace, for all the people of the region. 
>> The leader of hamas held his own press conference in cairo today, during which he said that while his side agrees to the cease-fire, his fighters have, quote, their hands on the trigger. In jerusalem, the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu also spoke about the cease-fire agreement. And his office put out a remarkable statement saying why israel was agreeing to it. Look at this. "Prime minister benjamin netanyahu this evening spoke with u.S. President barack obama and acceded to his recommendation to give the egyptian cease-fire proposal a chance." He acceded to what president obama wanted. In other words, this is the american's idea, not mine, but I'm going to go along with it, because they're advising me i ought. It's very specific language, highlighting how central the united states is in what's happening right now, but also sort of distancing israel from the cease-fire. Making it our american cease-fire and not theirs. The most important thing tonight for people who are living in range of the rockets and the air strikes is that, of course, the cease-fire appears to be holding, at least for tonight. In terms of how long it is likely to hold and whether it has created room for any more robust hope of ongoing peace, of course, remains to be seen. But we do know whatever happens next on the diplomatic side of this conflict, at least right now, it is our government, the u.S. Government, that is right there, right there in the middle of it. Joining us now live from gaza is richard engel, nbc's chief foreign correspondent. Richard, thank you for joining us again tonight. It's nice to have you here. Can you tell us what it's been like in gaza since the announcement of the cease-fire? 

[00:24:39]


>> There has been a tremendous celebration here. But it is not because people are celebrating that the violence is over. Certainly, people are thankful for that. But mostly, they are celebrating because hamas believes it has scored a victory. That hamas has been able to force this cease-fire on the israelis. Look at what happened four years ago. Four years ago, there was a similar round of violence. Much more serious, because the israelis entered, destroyed a lot of territory, and then at one stage, the israelis just said, we're done. And never communicated with hamas. Right now, there was a negotiated settlement between hamas and israel. It didn't take place directly. It took place through egypt, the united states, but hamas feels it gained recognition. There were more than a dozen foreign ministers who came here, came to gaza, and paid homage to the hamas leader. Something he never had before. They were able to fire rockets from here in gaza and hit areas around tel aviv and jerusalem, something that hadn't happened before. Hamas was losing popularity on the street in gaza, and now its popularity is skyrocketing. So to give you an example, tomorrow hamas has declared a public holiday, and there are expected to be victory celebrations across the gaza strip. 
>> Richard, in terms of the way that israel couched its agreement to this, I wanted to highlight the fact that they named the united states as the party that asked them to do this, essentially saying, or directly saying, they acceded to american will on this. Why do you think they stressed that so much and what do you think israel is likely to do now? It sounds to me like they're still holding off the prospect that he could restart air strikes or even a ground war at any time. 
>> Well, I don't know if you can hear it, or you can see it in pixelation on the camera, there are still israeli drones in the sky. There are still israeli troops on the northern border of gaza and along the eastern border of gaza. So the possibility that a ground war could take place is still a possibility. Clearly, israel didn't want that. Part of the reason israel threw this in the united states' lap is because it's more palpable to the israeli people to say, look, we didn't want to do this. It was forced on us by the united states or this was the united states' recommendation. But also because the israelis aren't entirely confident this is going to last very long. But something that isn't being talked about that is significant here, something that the israelis have gained from all of this, they have managed to put gaza in the egyptian's lap. They have basically managed to foist this entire problem, this horrible place where I am standing right now, when you were going through your list of what you are thankful for, I am thankful I don't live here. It is one of the most difficult places in the world. It is desert, it is populated by 1.6 million people. They don't have a nation. They are run by hamas. They hate their neighbor, israel. Israel, their neighbor, hates them. Most of the area is very, very poor. There is a degree of hopelessness here. They have managed -- the israelis have said to the egyptians, with this deal, now gaza is your problem. If rockets come out of here, the egyptians are going to be responsible for talking to hamas. Both of you are sort of from similar parties. The islamic hamas group, which is an offshoot of the muslim brotherhood, and the muslim brotherhood in egypt, israel managed to say, okay, you two sort things out together, and we'll see how this goes. 

[00:28:19]


>> Richard, one of the other things I was struck by is how vak what everybody agreed to is. Both sides have agreed to not perform acts that would breach this understanding. It's almost like a fortune cookie, meaningless vague. Does that vagueness make a stronger agreement or a weaker one. Does that say anything to you? 
>> Well, I think it was -- this got lawyered pretty hard. What that means is that israel is not supposed to carry out any sort of targeted assassinations. And when you start talking about targeted assassinations in international public documents, you could paint yourself into a legal corner. But there are a lot of -- yes, deliberately, deliberate vagaries in this. What hamas wants and what hamas feels that it got was a commitment from israel to stop carrying out targeted assassinations. In exchange, hamas won't fire its rockets. But hamas, even more so, feels, look at this, look where we have come. That we are almost negotiating, not as equals, but negotiating with the israelis like a country. There are some people here, by the way, not everybody here supports hamas, although that would be something for people in gaza not to say publicly these days. If you remember just yesterday, hamas was dragging behind motorcycles, people who were accused of being collaborators here. This is a, at times, ruthless government. There are people who say what this agreement has created is hamasastand. It has created a small, very poor, failed state that egypt now has to take the responsibility for in the gaza strip. So this is, this is a temporary cease-fire. Hamas feels that it has been legitimatized. It feels they have some, as you say, vague commitments from israel not to carry out any targeted assassinations. Will this be the end of the conflict? Absolutely not. When we were out in these celebrations, all the people were yelling is, death to israel, death to israel firing guns in the air. So the larger goal of bringing the people who are firing rockets and having them stand victorious in jerusalem, which is what hamas wants to do, ultimately, that objective has not gone away. 

[00:30:41]


>> Fascinating, fascinating perspective on this. Richard engel, nbc's chief foreign correspondent, live from gaza in the middle of the night, seven hours later than it is here. Richard, thank you so much for your time tonight. It's great to have you on the show.

>>> The people of this region deserve the chance to live free from fear and violence and today's agreement is a step in the right direction that we should build on. Now we have to focus on reaching a durable outcome that promotes regional stability and advances the security, dignity, and legitimates a separations of palestinians and israelis alike. 
>> Seeing secretary of state hillary clinton in egypt today, announcing the cease-fire agreement between israel and gaza was not exactly something that could have been predicted when this week began. Hillary clinton turns out to have been critical to resolving this middle east crisis. The united states being cited specifically for playing a crucial war in getting the cease-fire. And hillary clinton physically being there and making the announcement about this cease-fire after eight days of fighting between israel and gaza. It was frankly a testament to the power and to the necessity of american diplomatic leadership in the world. But the cease-fire would happen was first reported at about 12:15 eastern time this afternoon. Less than an hour after those first reports that it was going to happen, we got our first response from the republican party in this country. The republican party's response today came from, naturally, their foreign policy guy. There's only one. john McCain. john McCain, along with his shadow, lindsey graham, and their new third amigo, new hampshire senator kelly ayotte, they released a joint statement today, praising the cease-fire declaration, but then adding were for good measure, quote, what happens in the middle east will impact america's vital national security interests for the foreseeable future and stronger, smarter american leadership is desperately needed. Smarter leadership! TAKE IT FROM john McCain. REMEMBER, john McCain's big idea on foreign policy at the moment is that we should not have a secretary of state at all right now. john McCain suggesting that he will personally block anybody from being confirmed as secretary of state in the second term of the obama administration, because ACCORDING TO john McCain, u.N. Ambassador susan rice, who's a likely candidate for secretary of state, she once said something wrong on the sunday shows. In the days after the attack on the u.S. Consulate in benghazi, back in september, susan rice went on the sunday shows and gave the administration's intelligence agency-approved talking points, explaining what the administration thought at that time had happened in benghazi. AND THAT, IN john McCain's view, is unforgivable. 

[00:39:46]


>> Maybe she could start out by publicly coming back on this show and saying, I was wrong. I gave the wrong information on your show some several weeks ago. That might be a beginning. 
>> BUT UNTIL THEN, john McCain will block her potential nomination. And anybody's nomination. No secretary of state for the united states of america until john McCain is satisfied. Susan rice, for the record, did not give wrong information on the sunday shows. She described accurately what the intelligence agencies were advising her to say at that time. None of which turned out to be particularly wrong. A spokesman for the director of national intelligence came out yesterday and said, the intelligence agencies wrote and edited her talking points. Late tonight, susan rice RESPONDED TO john McCain publicly ctigating her over and over again. 
>> I have great respect for senator McCain and his service to our country. I always have and I always will. I do think that some of the statements he's made about me have been unfounded, but I look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to discuss all of this with him. 
>> You know, even if it were true that susan rice had said something wrong on the sunday shows, which is not true, susan rice saying something wrong on a sunday show is the grave alleged SIN THAT john McCain has single handedly decided should be the basis for the first big fight that he wants the republican party to have with newly elected -- newly re-elected president obama. This is the grounds for him blocking america from having a secretary of state at all right now. He will not confirm anybody to replace hillary clinton, because he's so angry that susan rice, he says, supposedly said something wrong on a sunday show. I mean, if you say something wrong on a sunday show, if you say something wrong on a sunday show, obviously, that's the end! Your career is over. The world has to come to a halt, right? 
>> I believe that it will not be nearly as difficult as some allege. I believe that this conflict is still going to be relatively short. We're going to prevail. We will win. And it will be one of the best thanks that's happened to america in the world for a long time. Because it will reverberate throughout the middle east. Once democracy works in iraq, the days of the religious extremists and the despots in the middle east are gone and the breeding ground for terrorism will be -- begin to dry up. 

[00:42:15]


>> What's our timetable? How much time do we have for iran to stand down? 
>> I don't know. I would think we're talking about a matter of months rather than years. We're doing fine. We have closed in the last week. If we continue this closer next week, you're going to be up very, very late on election night. I guarantee you that two weeks from now, you will see that this has been a very close race and i believe that I'm going to win it. 
>> If it's sunday, it must be john McCain on television, frequently saying things that are wrong. Being wrong on the sunday shows is obviously not a disqualifying thing in washington, right? You don't have to stop being a senator or stop being a presidential candidate or stop being a major administration official, just for saying something wrong on a sunday show. It may be should mean that you don't get to do the sunday shows so much, though, right? This is all of 2012, right here. We are obviously mid-november right now. All of the dates in red on this calendar here, those are all of the sundays we have had this year. This is how many times john McCAIN HAS BEEN ON THE SUNDAY Shows in that time. Uh-huh, yes. Wlisten, people are sometimes wrong. It happens. But that is not a reason for us as a country to not have a secretary of state, right? I mean, when you are wrong a lot on the sunday shows, it may be a reason to not keep putting that same old wrong guy on the sunday shows, but not having a secretary of state, no. Actually, there's no reason not TO KEEP PUTTING john McCain on the sunday shows. Look, this sunday on fox news, john McCain appearing exclusively to share his views on benghazi. All things foreign affairs. john McCain on a sunday. Again, wow, I can't believe he was available. ] day news starts with arthritis pain and a choice.

>>> As a senior u.S. Diplomat, i agreed to a white house request to appear on the sunday shows to talk about the full range of national security issues of the day, which at that time were prarily and particularly the protests that were enveloping and threatening many diplomatitic facilities, american diplomatic facilities around the world and iran's nuclear program. The attack on benghazi, on our facilities in benghazi, was obviously a significant piece of this. When discussing the attacks against our facilities in benghazi, I relied solely and squarely on the information provided to me by the intelligence community. I made clear that the information was preliminary and that our investigations would give us the definitive answers. I have great respect for senator McCAIN AND HIS SERVICE TO OUR Country. I always have. And I always will. I do think that some of the statements he's made about me have been unfounded, but I look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to discuss all of this with him. 
>>> Susan rice, u.S. Ambassador to the united nations speaking late today about her comments after the attack on the american consulate in benghazi in september, comments which john McCAIN WOULD LIKE TO TURN INTO The basis of a first giant confrontation between his republican party which he believes he speaks for on foreign policy. And the newly re-elected president obama. Joining us bob, great to have you here. Happy thanksgiving. 

[00:49:20]


>> Great to be here, rachel. 
>> Could susan rice be secretary of state if the president wanted her to be? IS THIS SORT OF john McCain spectacle trying to make an example out of her over now? 
>> You know, I don't know if it is over. I think he is going to keep on trying. I personally don't think that McCAIN CAN BLOCK THIS Appointment if the president decides to make it. You know, it is really weird. You watch these clips and you WATCH ALL THE TIMES that McCain has been wrong and it is almost like slapstick, like this kind of hapless approach to foreign policy. It would be really funny if it wasn't so tragic. Because the republicans are not just wrong on foreign policy on sunday morning. They're profoundly wrong in terms of their policies going forward. So we have this debacle, this tremendous catastrophe in iraq. And they took their eye off the ball in afghanistan, which is why we're still there after a decade. They ignored the initial warnings on osama bin laden, so it is really horrifying that scores of thousands of people are killed and yet they just keep going at it, wrong, wrong, wrong. 
>> Can you think of a way -- i wanted to show that calendar of THE NUMBER OF TIMES john McCain appears on the sunday shows to show in that sort of, I guess, blunt measure how much credibility he has on this issue despite his manifest failings on this issue. Can you think of a way that america can draft like a jon huntsman or somebody to be the republican party's new mouthpiece on foreign policy if john McCain needs to be replaced? 
>> This is an interesting pot. I am not generally big on bipartisanship. I think it is too much attention in the media. I would like the parties to just fight it out and be forced to come up with some kind of solution, let one or the other side win. This is, though, is where i think bipartisanship is important. When you start talking about foreign policy, when you're talking about war, when you're talking about matters of life and death in israel and gaza, for example, you need the united states to be an honest broker to try and save lives and bring peace. That's when you do want a united front with leaders from both parties in this country. If you had a serious person like jon huntsman who could sit down with president obama or whomever the president might designate, and they could discuss these things seriously, and come up with a united front, it would really be extremely helpful. 

[00:51:48]


>> I don't want them to have a united front. I want them to have a big fight. I just want it to be a quality fight between informed people, even if they have wildly different perspectives, but where they actually might reprent some other people because they're speaking truth. They've earned it. They haven't been given that job and failed at it, and they might have -- I am happy for them to have a clash. 
>> You can have a fight when you're trying to determine or put forward your foreign policy, but when you actually get to the crunch, when you're actually going to war, when you've been at war in afghanistan for such a long time, we had iraq, and then we have what's going on in the middle east now, in those crisis moments, I think it is important to try and have the united states be the honest broker and to have, you know, as much agreement as possible. 
>> I just want the debate to start -- 
>> right. You want it to be a serious debate, not silliness. 
>> I WANT john McCain to be replaced as the person who gets to talk about foreign policy. 
>> Maybe you will get your wish on jon huntsman. 
>> Maybe. I don't think so. Me wishing it isn't going to make it happen. Thank you for coming in.

>>> From the beginning thanksgiving has been complicated, geopolitically, morally complicated. The native people showed the colonists how to survive in this new place and so the colonists threw a harvest feast of deer and fish and ducks and potatoes and corn and eels. Yay, thanksgiving eels. And then things got ugly more or less for the next 300 years. Thanksgiving has always been complicated. This year in space commander kevin ford is celebrating a holiday as the only america out there. Commander ford is preparing a wonderful meal for his russian space mates, they're having irradiated smoked turkey and thermostabilized yams, and some nasa issued cornbread dressing. You, if you're lucky, you can have thanksgiving back here on earth with friends and family which is also complicated often. At some point your giant uncle, any one of them, is going to set off his giant hands on your thanksgiving table and say a two-word phrase that starts with fiscal and ends with cliff. Your uncle at thanksgiving will sawe have to do something about that fiscal cliff and really we got to do something to fix our skyrocketing deficit. Our national deficit that he will tell you has been going up and up and up like a rocket and spiraling out of control like a something going out of control and paul ryan is just so right and if congress and president obama do not do something to stop the skyrock edding deficit, to sop up the red ink, if they don't do it by new year's or sometimes whenever the emergency is supposed to happen, we will go flying off the fiscal cliff. And not like these guys who mean to do that, but more like cliffhanger cliff on "the price is right" for whom going over the edge is really a dire mistake. Beware the fiscal cliff. You will hear this at the thanksgiving dinner table. When someone inevitably brings up the fiscal cliff and how our sky rocketing deficit is a huge danger to usdo not crawl under the table. Do not give up on thanksgiving. Help your giant uncle understand that what he is freaking out about is not true. It is easy. There are visual aids that might help. Look. First of all, the amount of money borrowed by the government has been going down, not up. It has been going down. Our own steve bennett made you this chart. The red bar is the deficit in '09 when president obama took office, and inherited the big deficit from president bush. Over the next three years president obama cut the deficit. He cut it by $200 billion just from last year to this year. So the deficit isn't growing. It's shrinking by a lot. Seriously the folks at investor's business daily calculated that the deficit is falling faster than at any time since the end of the second world war. The deficit is falling so fast it might not be able to fall any faster without sending us back into recession. When president obama started, the deficit equalled 10% of the whole economy and now it equals just 7%. So go ahead, boggle your uncle's mind with this chart. The bars below zero represent years when the deficit grew. These bars above zero represent years when the deficit shrunk. We're here right now in the deficit shrunk portion of the chart. The point of the shrinkingest shrinking on the whole chart back to 1950. When somebody stops inevitably nattering about the fiscal cliff and the skyrocketing deficit, they don't know what they're talking about and they probably don't know it is wrong but you can help with visual aids. We have posted both of those charts we just showed you on our blog and you can load them on your smartphone or ipad to pass around the table and print them out on paper in case your uncle doesn't look liking at these new fangled screen things. Those are waiting for you now. Maddowblog.Com/thanksgiving.

Fearless attitude helped him overcome a broken neck, a basketball player who wins national awards in spite of chronic illness, a soccer player who goes from being a troublemaker to being a role model. It's celebrities who let you know what it takes to win in life. Jeff gordon, tamika catchings, and tim howard. This is how to overcome. 
>> ?????? As long as it's all right I know there's a way ?????? 
>> I'm apolo anohno. See how you can overcome when life gets tough. 
>> Hi. I'm lisa leslie. Find out how to have the real winning edge over life's challenges. 
[Captioning made possible by challenger films] 
>> ?????? I finally see what I can be now I'm alive ?????? 
>> flying in the sky after a broken neck when we return. 

[00:03:13]


>> Hi, I'm jeff gordon. When you're involved in a dangerous sport like auto racing, you rely on someone bigger than yourself to keep you safe and overcome adversity. Today, we're gonna meet someone else who competes 
in a hazardous sport: Skydiving. He has also found a way to have extreme courage and deal with the challenges that could keep him from his goals, to have the real winning edge. 
>> Ready. Ready, set, go. 
>> I was playing linebacker, made a collision with our fullback and just had a sharp pain go through my neck. I got an x-ray and they just flipped out because they saw it was broken. But I knew I could never play football again. At the same time, it was like, am I gonna be able to walk again? Somehow still, miraculously, went from having a broken neck in that fall to recovering and being able to play baseball and skydive. But it's just such an amazing feeling. It's so much fun. You treat it with respect, it's gonna respect you back. Up in the sky, you can't really make too many mistakes. As you're with people who are better than you or a coach and--and you progress, there's a lot that goes to it that you learn step-by-step how to control your body in the sky, from the wind to every movement you make puts you in a different direction, different situation, and you're literally just learning how to control that, your body in the sky, how to fly, and it's just a blast. 
>> We used something called a wind tunnel a lot, and it's basically just a vertical tube that shoots air up to simulate skydiving. That's the easiest way to learn because you can communicate back and forth while you're flying. So, when you get in the sky and you actually have to survive, it's a lot easier to learn that way. 
>> There's a few different styles of skydiving. The main one is belly, and that's what you first have to learn, is all your basic skills that you'll need to know forever. The style I chose to do is free flying, where you're flying, uh, in like a sit position, stand position, or on your head and just speeds are much more accelerated at those speeds. Anywhere from the 120, which is your belly flying up to, uh, 230 miles per hour. What we do to prepare for a jump is we like to check our gear. Before I do anything, before you jump, you go over safety procedures, so, it's all in your mind and you're ready to go to be as safe as possible. You don't want to lose control too close to someone. You don't want to go too fast too quick because you'll be doing something that you're not ready for. You just have to be smart about it and progress slowly. What is it about skydiving I like the most? Would have to be just the freedom of it. I like to think about god and think about--it's kind of my--my peaceful place to be, and I feel free up there and just relaxed. Playing for fsu baseball is a dream come true to me. 

[00:05:58]


>> This one driven deep to left field off the bat of justin gonzalez, back goes to tagliani, gone! This one is lifted to left field, and tagliani going back. This one to the wall--it's over. 
>> First day of practice go out there, I see a ball, going for it, I'm going for it, I dive, land, felt extreme pain in my shoulder. Uh, it dislocated again. This time, it didn't go back. I was like, "god, why?" But I just said, " you know what? I am going to trust in you. I didn't bring myself here, so, I'm gonna trust in your an." I had surgery and it--when they went in there, it was actually a lot worse than they thought, too. My bicep was 
>> he actually had a tear to his labrum and his bicep's tendon, which you don't usually see from a fall on one occurrence like he had. So, there was definitely a question of whether stephen was going to be able to come back this season. 
>> Going through, uh, the process of recovery, um, I was told that once you start throwing that the first weeks, i won't even think I'll be able to ever play baseball again. And i just started going through it. When I got to that time and it was just--i didn't have any doubt still. I said, "i'm gonna make it through this." I said, "there's no way. Nothing's stopping me." Right before the season, it was fan day. So, I'm all excited for it. My shoulder is doing pretty well. I'm able to swing the bat. Everything's going good. It looks like--it seems I'm gonna start. I'm gonna be able to be playing, swinging, then I take a swing. My knee locked up and dislocated on the rotation. It was just devastating. I went and--straight to the locker-room, got onto the, uh, the table and just broke down, covered my face, didn't want to see anyone. I was angry at first. I was asking, "why, god? Why is this happening to me again? I never am ready." I was so frustrated and then it turned into emotions and--and I was covering my face as tears were coming down. I just had great--great support from coaches. 
>> When the injuries start piling up, there were a few moments where you could tell he was struggling, and some thoughts like "why does this keep happening?" And "am I ever going to be able to get back out there?" But that was very short and it shows stephen's character. Stephen, honestly, has a lot of talent to play the game of baseball, which is why the coaches brought him in here, but outside of that, he also brings a very upbeat and positive outlook on a day-to-day basis. He was--he was a hard worker in his rehab and showed up every day and did what we asked him to do. So, uh, he was successful beyond some expectations, for sure. 

[00:08:28]


>> What inspires me about stephen is his work ethic to dedicate himself equally to me and his other friends. The skydiving is pretty awesome. How passionate he is about his faith. That's--that's pretty amazing. 
[Ball clunks] 
>> he's been through a lot of obstacles and his faith is what has really got him through it. It's because of his determination and his drive. Those are the big qualities that I think he brings out on a daily basis. I think he's broken every bone in his body. When he broke his neck, he had to walk around school in this big, white cast. It's a pretty serious injury. It was a pretty traumatic time. For him. 
>> I went from just praying and not knowing if I was going to be playing ball anymore to getting to play in the college world series, which is every baseball player's dream. It's just the most amazing experience you can have and the only way to explain that is god. Injuries that have happened to me, I think have only made me stronger because I've learned that those are weak spots, so I trained even harder and actually made them strong spots. I think I'm only getting stronger and better. My advice to young people out there and anyone else who's trying to follow their dreams or just going through life, period, is to just trust in god through it all. These are just things in life that we go through. Do i think that, where I am now, that I'm not gonna have any more adversities, any more things come at me? No, I know they will, but I know I can get through anything 'cause I have a great, big god. 
>> Next, they told her she couldn't play basketball anymore. 

[00:12:09]


>> Tamika catchings. 
>> See thomas trying to call a play there, trying to get her hand up to call a play and catchings just plucked it out from behind. 
>> Hi, I'm tamika catchings. When I was a young child, every day was a challenge for me, but I didn't let that keep me back or affect the vision I have for my future. In fact, I think the challenges I had helped me get to where I am today. The basketball player I'm introducing today also didn't let her challenges hold her back, and she became one of the top scorers for the ncaa. She showed that there's a way to get through and even become a better person. That's having the real winning edge. 
[Indistinct chatter] 
[audience cheering] 
[indistinct] 
>> initially, when I was diagnosed with fsgs, it--it affected me and I was extremely distraught. 
>> We were wondering why she was so fatigued early in her career. It was really--i felt like i could never get her in shape. You know, as much as she ran. And when she was diagnosed, it was one of the most painful days in my life. 
[Indistinct chatter] 
>> d dn--dawn's lack of size probably is the reason we got her. Uh, so many of the bigger programs, go out and inspire everyone else and to play well has been tremendous for us.Iving us great pas seeing us make a great shot. 
>> I try to have personal conversations with each player who's down and--and encourage them that everybody can fight through it, that they could be that player that they strive to be as long as they work hard and do the right things. 

[00:14:09]


>> She's broken so many records here at james madison and deservedly so. She's one of the best players, if not the best player, I could ever play at this university, but, you know, she's just been a treasure for us to have. She's meant the world to our program, and a program that has a lot of history of winning championships. She brought that back to us, which was very, very important. 
>> I received, um, a player of the year honor, mvp of my tournaments, and the conference awards one player the john randolph award, which is an inspirational award, and igoes out to one player who played 
[indistinct] throughout that conference, who's able to face adversity and fight through it and still play basketball. And that one, you know, really meant a lot to me just because people noticed that I was able to fight through something so hard. I started out with some pretty intense headaches, so, I went to the doctor and told him that something wasn't right, and so, he ordered some blood work, and the blood work showed signs of kidney disease. 
>> Dawn has focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, fsgs. That is a kidney disease amongst many kidney diseases that causes some scarring, and as the scarring progresses, you--the kidneys don't do what they're supposed to. So, in effect, things start to shut down. So, she had lost about 2/3 of her kidney production. 
>> Monthly, I have to visit a local doctor just to get my blood drawn. I have to take up to 12, 14 pills a day, depending on, you know, which day of the ek it is. And it's been hard. You know, because some of those medicines have make--make me sick. When the doctors told me i wasn't going to be able to play basketball anymore. I was devastated. You know, I tried to stay strong. I told the doctor to his face, "you don't--you don't make the final call. God makes the final answer." But when I went home, in the called on god, I called my parents just asking for somebody to give me answers that nobody could really give me. I tried to be a strong person, but then, i was extremely weak and vulnerable and hurt and i somehow found my way to fight out of that. But it took a lot of time and it took a lot of courage and it took a lot of people around me to support me. 

[00:16:11]


>> After--after a while--it was very emotional in the beginning, but then she looked at me and she says, "i'm gonna beat this." And I had no doubt. I had no doubt, because if anyone can do it, dawn evans can do it. 
>> I'm impressed only--not only because she's young and she has such a strong motivation about her, but just her determination to succeed and do well and give her coursework her best is really impressive to me, and that's hard to find all the time among all students. I had her as a student in human disease, my human disease course, and she actually gave a presentation, a group presentation, on her disease, and I think, at that point, her peers looked at her in a different light, such as, "wow! You know, if she's coming to class every day, she's earning high grades, and--and, you know, continuing to do the work that's required, why can't I do that?" And I think just knowing a little bit more about her disease helped me to understand, wow, there's no limits for dawn. She just--she's boundless. 
>> Dawn is an ambassador for the nephcare foundation, and she's always willing to, um, put a hand out to help, um, other children that are going through the same disease--that have the same disease. 
>> She's just an exceptional person when it comes to just trying to help other people. Like, a lot of times, you'll see her just going out of her way, taking time to really talk to people because she knows how it is to have to fight through adversity, 'cause she can really relate with people because, i mean, she really is pushing through, and that gives a lot of people hope and just gives 'em determination. 
[Indistinct chatter] 
>> she's amazing. For the level of kidney function she has, to be able to compete, and compete at a high level, is absolutely amazing. 
>> What dawn does to, uh, inspire others around her is that she goes out and doesn't use it as an excuse. You know, her--her teammates really don't know the severity of her situation because she doesn't talk about it very much. As a coach for her, you know, I'm supposed to lead her and inspire her. There's been so many days that she's inspired me because, you know, if I don't feel like being out there or I'm tired, and I look over at her and she's leading the sprints and she's doing whatever she can and dealing with her situation, that's very inspirational and, uhuh, so she's really helped everyone. 

[00:18:41]


>> No matter what life brings you, don't let anybody tell you that you--you can't do anything. Don't let anything discourage you enough to stop your fight. God doesn't place anything on you that you can't handle, and, at first, I asked, you know, why me? Why is it that I was diagnosed with this disease? But soon, I realized that he orders my steps, and there's a reason why he's placed this on me, and maybe to probably encourage others and, you know, I'm going to do exactly what I'm here to do. 
>> Coming up, getting kicked out of preschool was only the beginning.Q q 

[00:22:05]


>> hi, I'm tim howard. Today, I'm introducing you to another soccer player. We both have a lot in common. Soccer has helped us both. This player you're about to meet has had a lifelong struggle with anger and self-contrtr, and when I was 10, I was diagnosed with tourette syndrome. It gives me verbal and physical tics that I cannot always control. We have both found strength and a way to be in control through our athletic gifts, a way to take back what's out of control in our lives and use it for a greater purpose than just ourselves. We both believe that it's this strength that has given us the real winning edge. 
>> Uh, my--my younger days were, uh, probably not my best. Um, i was out of control. I had a huge problem with self-control and controlling my urges. I started soccer when I was very young, about 5 years old. Soccer has been there for me throughout my life. It's been a backbone for me, um, to sort of vent out any anger, any--any control issues that I have because it will always be there and I have such a passion for it that it does--it helps me a lot. If i get frustrated, I play soccer. I forget about everything. 
>> All right, guys, [indistinct] 
>> light it up. 
>> Reds on 3.1, 2, 3. 
>> Reds! 
>> We knew that benny was going to be different. We knew that--that he needed some outlet to--to use that energy and direction with him. So, for him, it was always sports, so he played 2 or 3 sports at a time just to keep him--him busy. 
>> This was a big season for benny. He scored a lot of very big goals for us. We've been able to focus a lot of our lineup, a lot of it around what benny does, and we've been able to base a lot of what we do off of his strengths. 
>> Right. 
>> We all know how important this game is. We all know that if we, uh, we go to nationals. Play like we did yesterday. All right. 
[Yelling] all right! I'm the academy, which is the highest league in--in the nation right now. It's a league that involves the whole united states. Every team I play is tough. It's meant to train me for the next level, which is llege, and then, after that, maybe professional. What I had to do to get to that point was hard work. A lot of nights, i would--i would stay in while all my friends would go out because I had a game the next day and i needed to prepare for it, and get my mind and body rested so i could do well in those next games. 

[00:24:41]


>> As you watch benny, he puts everything into his game, and you know that when he's off of the field, he's gonna be, you know, a perfect role model. 
>> When I was youn very angry. What caused my anger was the fact that I didn't get my way a lot of the times and i still have that problem today. If something doesn't go how i think it should go, it's very hard for me to accept and when i was younger, I just--i wouldn't accept it. I would just do what I wanted and that would cause problems to me, it would cause problems for those around me. 
>> With benny, it was--you could just see the frustration in him. Many nights, I would almost cry myself to sleep because I was so frustrated with the activities of the day. 
>> I was with benny as a center director when he was in pre-kindergarten and preschool years. Benny had a hard time controlling his, um, his anger. The other children loved benny, but they knew that if, uh, there was any confrontations that--that benny would act in a physical way. 
>> It was hard for me when I was younger, but now that I'm older, I can control myself a lot better. One of the best ways i found to control it is to take a step back and look and evaluate the situation. Say, "why am i doing this? Is it the right thing to do?" My faith has--has played a big part. So much of who you are and who you become has to do with who you surround yourself with. You're gonna be influenced by them because you're with them a lot. Luckily, i--i found, uh, the friends i have now and they back me up. I hang out with them and they support me with my decisions. 
>> Benny and I hold each other accountable. We'll also go in depth about our problems and those things that we're seeing that are getting in the way of our lives, and we'll basically listen to each other, saying, like, what we're doing right and what we need to work on. 
>> Benny is a really down-to-earth guy. He always knows the right thing to do and he's a really great friend. He's always very supportive. 

[00:26:45]


>> Benny was in my kindergarten class and we were friends since then. The changes in benny from second grade to the present, i mean, he had his ownehavior contract. Now, I mean, he's just the greatest guy. He'd--completely opposite change from, you know, naughty kid to a great kid. 
>> When I'm older and I look back, I would have liked to have accomplished having an influence in other people's lives that i can say I helped them, whether that's through sports, through just being their friend. My advice would be to just surround yourself with the right type of friends and find that passion in your life that you can funnel and that god can use you to--to make a difference. For me, it was soccer that--it helped--it helps so much.

Room" with joe johns is coming up. 
>>> You're in "the situation room." After cease-fire celebrations in gaza, the middle east faces enormous challenges. This, how we'll look at the ways the israeli hamas truce has changed the region. And wolf's interview with perez on president obama's role in the negotiations and whether he ever threw israeli under the bus. 
>>> And during this busy holiday travel season, we go behind the scenes with airport pit crews. You'll see what it takes to gets flights turned around safely and on time. Welcome to our viewers in the united states and around the world. Wolf blitzer is off. I'm joe johns. You're in "the situation room." ???????????? 
>>> it's been a historic week in the middle east, but the cease-fire between israel and hamas was only a first step toward seeking a broader piece in a very volatile region. And now one of the crucial players in securing the truce is under fire in his own country. In egypt, we've seen huge protests against president mohamed morsi and the new powers he assumed just a day after the truce. He's insisting he's committed to democracy, but opponents are calling him a dictator it could be a complication for the cease-fire between israel and hamas negotiations moving forward. Let's go to cnn's reza sayah in cairo. 
>> Reporter: Joe, the coming weeks here in egypt are going to be fascinating when it comes to politics. That's because there is an intensifying faceoff between egyptian president mohamed morsi and his opponents. Outrage aimed at mr. Morsi after the announcement of a number of controversial decrees earlier this week that give him sweeping powers. They make him at least temporarily the most powerful man in egypt. Also seems to be an effort to push through the all-important drafting of the new constitution and putting in place the formation of egypt's new parliament want. One of the decrees bans anyone, even the judiciary, from appealing, overturning, questioning any decision mr. Morsi has made since taking office in june. That order is to be set in place until a new parliament is formed. So technically, he's going to be the most powerful man essentially he can do whatever he wants, without any oversight. That's one of the decrees, john, that has a lot of his opponents describing this as an undemocratic power grab. 

[00:02:42]


>> And do these changes affect both his creditics and opponents or just his opponents? 
>> Reporter: Well, look. Right now, the political landscape favors mr. Morsi and his political movement the, the muslim brotherhood, and certainly these decrees, when they went into place, make things look good for them taking power for the constitution, when it's drafted to favor the muslim brotherhood. One of the decrees pushes through the drafting of the constitution. The panel that's charged to draft them is 100 members. Many of these members are liberals who are protesting the drafting of the constitution. Some have quit in protest and one of these particular decrees, mr. Morsi, says no one can dissolve this particular assembly. They're going to push through. And if this assembly stands the way it is right now, which is dominated by islamists, many of mr. Morsi's critics will say the constitution will favor the islamists and sideline the liberal factions, the women's rights groups, the youth groups, the christians. That's why people protested this week. John? 
>> Reza sayah reporting for us there in cairo. Thanks so much for that. 
>>> Now to israel, where even though there's peace, millions of families there and in gaza are still dealing with the aftermath of the fighting. Cnn's senior international correspondent sara sidner joins us from jerusalem. Sara? 
>> Reporter: Joe, mothers, fathers and children all dealing with the aftermath, whether they have lost homes, been dealing with the trauma of having rockets coming into their homes. But there is a place where they're being healed, a place that's really a zone of peace 4-year-old joseph is listening to an age-old bedtime story but he's not at home safe in his bed. He's in a hospital, a victim of an age-old conflict that has shattered his family life. He and his parents were staying inside this apartment building in southern israel when a rocket from gaza slammed into it. The blast sheered off several of joseph's tiny fingers, badly injured his father and took his mother's life. She was among the first to die on the israel side of the border. She is saying, my mother is not here. She's with god. He knows it will be a hard time, his grandmother says. Hard is putting it mildly. He has just been through a second surgery. Doctors at the sheeba medical center at the hospital reattached four of his fingers, but in the end, they had to reamputate two of them. 

[00:05:18]


>> He lives in the south, and there are rockets all of the time in that area. Hamas doesn't think about where the rockets are going, she says. 
>> Reporter: While joseph is being treated in this hospital room, one room away there is another child with the same kind of war injuries, except she is from the other side of the conflict. She's from gaza. 8-year-old bison lost three fingers when the war came to her home. 
>> Translator: I heard the sound of a missile that hit. I didn't even have time to ask what happened, and then the second one hit. 
>> Reporter: When the dust cleared, she could see the bones of her child's fingers in small pieces on the floor. She was taken to el shifa hospital in gaza, but it was too crowded and they couldn't give her the best care, so the family asked israel for permission to cross the border. Initially, her mother was terrified. Terrified at the prospect of people considered an enemy in their country putting their hands on her wounded daughter. 
>> Translator: It's a strange situation, and it's my first time entering israel. I was afraid. But they treated me and my daughter in a very nice way, and I understand that medicine has nothing to do with politics. 
>> All the tension is blocked outside the hospital. Here there is an island of sanity in the middle east. Here we treat people who don't actually look where they are and what they do and what they did before coming here and what they're going to do after leaving us. 
>> Reporter: Dr. Yafeh is treating both children. 
>> It will never be normal. It will affect her life from now on and his life from now on, and choice of profession and choice of hobbies and choice of a future partner for life. Everything. 
>> Reporter: She has worked in this tel aviv hospital her entire career. Treating everyone from soldiers to suicide bombers. And the civilians in between. 
>> What is it in this piece of land that everybody is fighting about it all of the time? This is what comes to my mind, whether this is our eternity from now on, always have injuries on both sides? Always fighting? What's the point? 

[00:07:27]


>> Reporter: If there is a point, it is lost on a 4-year-old boy and 8-year-old girl from either side of the israel-gaza border who just want to be children but now share a similar fate. Their innocence interrupted by a war they had nothing to do with. For the families and staff in that hospital, they say it's just too bad that island of peace doesn't extend to the rest of the region. Joe? 
>> Thank you, so much. That's sara sidner in jerusalem. 
>>> We saw secretary of state hillary clinton play a very public role in helping to secure the truths between israel and hamas. And behind the scenes, president obama was credited with sealing the deal, and now they're dealing with the question of what will happen next in egypt. Our white house correspondent dan lothian is standing by. First to our foreign affairs correspondent jill dougherty. There's concern about what's happening in egypt right now, jill. 
>> Reporter: There is. They're watching it, joe, very carefully. The state department wants to have more details, because after all, remember, just this week, he was being referred -- mr. Morsi was being referred to as a statesman and there was a lot of responsibility put on his shoulders. He was praised a lot by president obama for coming through and helping to clinch this deal. Now if there is some question, if he could be taking some power that would concern the united states, they want to know more. 
>>> And also don't forget that while secretary clinton was in cairo, just this past week, she was meeting with mr. Morsi and in those discussions, she talked about the constitution that they are writing, and about the concern that they want many different groups included, including women and others, other minorities, and most importantly, not to go back on one of the goals of the revolution and that was not to concentrate too much power in the hands of one person or any one institution. So there is some concern can. 

[00:09:29]


>> And dan lothian, let's talk a little bit about the president's involvement. It seems he was very involved, even though he was behind the scenes. 
>> Reporter: You're right. The president was very engaged in the process, and remember, this was a week where the president was in southeast asia, focusing on building democracy there and expanding not only business ties but also military ties in the region. But the president working the phones to get this deal done is one official saying the president actually closed the deal in phone conversations, not only with benjamin netanyahu, which he spoke with him just about every day, but also with president morsi, spoke with him frequently, as well. In fact, the president left the summit to get a phone call with president morsi, told his advisers that if morsi called back they should wake him. He did call back at 2:30 in the morning. The president took that call. The president also speaking with him on returning to the united states aboard air force one. And so there were a lot of conversations that the president conducted behind the scenes on the phone. The white house giving a lot of credit to secretary of state clinton. But also pointing out the president played a very important role, joe. 
>> I would like to ask you both, starting with jill. Did we know behind the scenes there were very good chances of success in this when hillary clinton first set out on this trip, or was this more of a role of the dice? Jill? 
>> Reporter: Well, I think it's kind of a combination of both. After all, the president had been on the phone, secretary clinton had been on the phone. And as you just heard, the white house is saying that basically the president, you know, clinched the deal. But in that part of the world, clinching is not a word that's used very frequently. So there was -- there was a lot that could have gone wrong, and I think for the future there are things that can still go wrong. These cease-fires, and there have been others, don't always last. And you've seen president obama jump fully into this, secretary clinton very directly involved in a way they haven't been for quite some time. You know, in this middle east con nun drum. So down the road, how will this all turn out? Not totally clear. 

[00:11:42]


>> Dan, do you think the white house viewed this as a bit of a risk going into it? 
>> Reporter: Well, look, there is always a risk when you're dealing with this kind of situation in this region where you've had this conflict going on for so long. But there had to have been some indication it was moving in a positive direction or they probably would not have sent secretary of state clinton there to sort of seal this deal or get it all tied up. They did have these phone conversations that I pointed out, and the white house saying that the president developed sort of a relationship of trust with president morsi. And that's kind of interesting it, because you look back, it wasn't just a short time ago where the president was saying that egypt was no longer an ally. There were a lot of concerns about president morsi's ties to the muslim brotherhood, and now you have them using words like this relationship of trust. So clearly, they had some kind of understanding that this was moving in the right direction. Now they believe this will be critical in terms of dealing with some of the big issues in the region in the future. 
>> All right. Dan lothian at the white house. Jill dougherty, thanks so much for that. 
>>> The events of the past few days could change the course of the future of the middle east. Stand by for wolf's interview with israeli president perez. introducing 12. Part of a whole new line of tablets from dell. It's changing the conversation. ?????? ?????? reyes, officer. I LOVE THE FACT THAT Quicken Loans PROVIDES Va loans.

Fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more. 

[00:15:58]


>>> Before the israeli-hamas ceasefire took place, wolf blitzer spoke to shimon peres, including the civil war in syria across the israeli border. 
>> Syria has a concentration of chemical weapons. 
>> Are they secure right now? 
>> They're under the control of assad. I'm not sure they are secure. I wouldn't trust them very much. And they get missiles from iran. And some people say it's okay. What do you mean, okay? They're not collectors of missiles. They fire them. They shoot them. Civilian life in tel aviv and jerusalem. The world must take a clear position. It is the israeli reaction, and shooting at israelis. After they left gaza. How long can they destroy any chance f peace? 
>> What's the role of iran that is playing right now behind the scenes in gaza? 
>> Iran is competing with egypt. They want to win. Their chance is to have more extreme on the outside. So they support not only hamas, but also the jihad. 
>> Islamic jihad. 
>> Islamic jihad in gaza. So the islamic jihad forces them also to be more extreme. One of the problems in gaza is there is nobody to really -- there is a competition among four or five different groups. The sell afterists and the jihad and many other groups and they're competing and iran is supplying arms to all of them. 
>> So who do you negotiate the cease-fire with? 
>> Look, hamas has to take charge, otherwise they don't have a future. 

[00:17:59]


>> Can they? 
>> I think yes. They don't have a choice. Not only them, but the others, too. If hamas won't take a position, the people in gaza will say -- to those others, stop it. What are you doing to? There are people in gaza too. And none of us want to see them suffering. It doesn't give us any pleasure. 
>> We'll have more from wolf's interview with shimon peres in a little bit. Among other things, peres has some advice for everyone about staying active and vital when you're approaching the age of 90. 
>>> Huge celebrations ron on the streets of gaza in the hours after the cease-fire was announced. Now a longer list of diplomatic winners and losers is emerging from the conflict. That's next. You're in "the situation room." sitting gas. There's natural gas under my town. It's a game changer. ?????? ?????? it means cleaner, cheaper american-made energy.

>>> Ever since the israeli-hamas ceasefire took effect, we have seen huge victory celebrations on the streets of gaza city. But there's a much longer list of winners and losers. Here is cnn's paula newton. 

[00:22:22]


>> Reporter: However crude the calculation, especially amid the civilian casualties, there are winners and losers in this truce, and they are already reshaping political alignses in the region. We begin in egypt, and its president, mohamed morsi. Clearly underestimated, his deft handling of what is a mine field of competing interests has given him much needed political capital in both the arab world and the united states. 
>> First civilian president in egypt perceived as a weak leader has much to everyone's surprise delivered. 
>> Reporter: Then there's israel and its tenacious prime minister, benjamin netanyahu. After israel targeted and killed hamas' military leader, he launched air strikes, hitting more than 1,500 targets in gaza, dismantling some of hamas' arsenal of weapons. And israel had a successful come bait debut of iron dome that kept rockets from hitting israeli civilians. But the counter point is ironic. Hamas emerges as a big winner from this conflict and its truce. 
>> Hamas has consolidated control over gaza and gained more legitimacy. 
>> Reporter: In the eyes of the palestinian people, the militant leaders of gaza took on israel more boldly than ever before. Firing rockets further than ever before. And they may yet manage to get an easing of the gaza blockade if a more comprehensive deal can be done. 
>> Look what they have accomplished. They, rather than abbas, has put the palestinian issue back on the international stage. 
>> Reporter: And that brings us to those who have lost much in this conflict. Mahmoud abbas and his fatah faction. The palestinian leaders were supposed to be the moderate peace brokers. Now they can't even claim to speak for all palestinians, and proved they have no leverage with hamas. 
>> This is not a good outcome for abbas and not a good outcome for the pursuit of a two-state solution. 

[00:24:29]


>> Reporter: And always a player, iran's hand is arguably weakened after this episode. Iron dome shot hundreds of its missiles out of the sky. What if israel attacks iran? Can it still call on hamas to retaliate? One week with one truce, with allies and enemies in the region have shifted again. And this will have an impact on any peace negotiations going forward. Paula newton cnn, atlanta. 
>>> Hamas is touting itself as the big winner in the more than week-long battle against israel, but it may have suffered a mainly game-changing loss in the violence. Our brian todd is joining us now with details. We're talking about a loss of leadership here. 
>> That's right, joe. You know the irony here is hamas' loss at the hands of the israelis could also be israel's loss. Last week they took out ahmed al jab re, the military genius, but a man who could have reined in radical militants during the cease fire. Hamas' ability to hold up its end of the ceasefire depends on how much control it has over its most dangerous militants. That control might have diminished in the flash of an air strike, when israeli forces killed ahmed al jaberi last week. You believe it was actually a mistake for israel to take him out, right? 
>> I do believe it was a mistake for israel to take him out. I think that the core objectives that were stated by israel for taking him out will not be met by his death. I think, in fact, it will lead to the proliferation of extremist groups and less control, actually, over rocket attacks and increased violee against israel. 
>> Reporter: Elizabeth owe baggy and other analysts admit, jaberi was a formidable enemy for the israelis but also was able to keep hamas' most radical allies from attacking on their own. 
>> People are surprised there were people were in hamas jails for firing rockets at israelis. Not for the act of firing rockets, but for firing rockets at the wrong time and ahmed jaberi put them in jail. 

[00:26:35]


>> Reporter: He was a leader unlike hamas had ever seen before. Driving the palestinian fatah faction out of gaza. 
>> He changed the military structure, after the takeover turning this ragtag force into a mill litscha. 
>> Reporter: Organizing them into companies, battalions, brigades. And with iran to coordinate training and the shipment the of weapons to hamas, including those that can strike tel aviv and jerusalem. He was instrumental in the abduction of gee lad she least in 2006. He negotiated the release of shilit later in exchange for more than 1,000 palestinian prisoners. Now -- 
>> not having somebody like that, somebody who can be an enforcer of peace as well as an enforcer of war, can make it not only hard to reach a peace agreement, it can make it hard to avoid war, because whenever somebody decides to take a pot shot, they take a pot shot. 
>> Reporter: So now all eyes will be on the surviving hamas leaders and whether they can bring those more fanatical elements of the group in line to keep some measure of peace within israel. It is believed that a man named mohamed dafe who worked behind the scenes, the public face of hamas' military leadehip has at least taken jaberi's place, but he himself is physically impaired by two assassation attempts by the israelis and it's not clear how much control he has. Joe, this is possibly a leadership vacuum militarily for hamas.

[ Male Announcer ] BOB HAS AFIB: Atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem, a condition that puts him at greater risk for a stroke. 
[ Gps ] turn left. I don't think so. 
[ Male Announcer ] FOR YEARS, BOB TOOK WARFARIN, And made a monthly trip to the clinic to get his blood tested. But not anymore. Bob's doctor recommended a different option: Once-a-day xarelto????. Xarelto???? is the first and only once-a-day prescription blood thinner for patients with afib not caused by a heart valve problem, that doesn't require routine blood monitoring. Like warfarin, xarelto???? is proven effective to reduce the risk of an afib-related stroke. There is limited data on how these drugs compare when warfarin is well managed. No routine blood monitoring means bob can spend his extra time however he likes. New zealand! Xarelto???? is just one pill a day, taken with the evening meal. And with no dietary restrictions, bob can eat the healthy foods he likes. Do not st taking xarelto???? rivaroxaban without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping may increase your risk of having a stroke. Get medical help right away if you develop any signs or symptoms of bleeding, like unusual bruising or tingling. You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take xarelto???? with aspirin products, nsaids or blood thinners. Talk to your doctor before taking xarelto???? if you currently have abnormal bleeding. Xarelto???? can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. You are likely to bruise more easily on xarelto????, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop. Tell your doctors you are taking xarelto???? before any planned medical or dental procedures. Before starting xarelto????, tell your doctor about any conditions, such as kidney, liver or bleeding problems. Ready to change your routine? Ask your doctor about once-a-day xarelto????. For more information including cost support options, call 1-888-xarelto or visit goxarelto.Com.

>>> Cnn's anderson cooper was reporting as israeli missiles rained down. He talked about that with wolf blitzer. 
>> Anter son cooper is here in jerusalem. You spent the last few days there. What was it like? 
>> It's obviously intense. You can't help but go there and notice there is no such thing as regular life. And shops are closed, people are hiding indoors. And it's, you know, for everyday people, they just want it to end. They're not necessarily hugely supporters of hamas, even though hamas was democratically elected. There's a lot of people who just want a solution, and want the to get on with their lives and be able to feed their families. Unemployment is ridiculously high, 40%. It could be a great city, a coastline, beaches, and yet it is -- there's just no such thing as regular life. 
>> So when we see them on the streets right now with celebratory gun fire, so happy, they're smiling, they're relieved this is at least for now over. 
>> To even relieved to be out of their homes. I have not seen those streets crowded like that. There was -- streets were virtually empty at night. You could drive -- if you drive at all at night, extremely fast. And, you know, you never know where a rocket is going to go, because you never knew where hamas may be, where they have an installation, where they have an office. And I think one of the most disturbing images I saw -- and i want to warn viewers, we have images we'll show you, but it is very disturbing to watch. A group of hamas men on motor vehicles dragging the body of an alleged collaborator down a main street in gaza city. 
>> An israeli collaborator. 
>> Allegedly, yes. 
>> Palestinians -- somebody they accused of working with the israelis -- 
>> clearly, israel has a network of spies who give the on the ground information. That helps them in their targeting, you know, tracking people's movements and who owns what houses. But to see this person being dragged down a main street while these men on motorcycles are yelling "god is great" and yelling out that he was a spy, it brings home that this is a place that, you know, there is not a rule of law, and it is -- it's obviously, you know, the divisions are very clear. 

[00:34:13]


>> We saw explosions, literally not far away from you. We saw you ducking. We saw ben wedeman, arwa damon, sara sidner. They were close to you, these bombs. 
>> Very close. We were standing in front of an open window like this and you could feel the shock waves through your body sometimes. The windows would rattle, the building itself would shake. And we're talking, you know, a block away, two, three, four, five blocks away. And it's startling. Ben wedeman is made of sturdier stuff than I and was able to stand there without ducking as i did did. But it really brings home to you what it's like for gazans. 
>> Can only imagine the terror these people are feeling. 
>> Right. And they have nowhere else to go. I'm able to leave. There for three nights, able to leave and back here now. They don't have any other place to go. 
>> When you got out, you got out through a crossing into israel. 
>> Right, a very laborious process. 
>> Tell us about that. Because it's very restricted. 
>> Yeah, it is. You give them -- the hamas official your passport, he writes it down in a little spiral notebook, that's about it, no stamp or anything. You take a series of taxis to the border, where you get out, and you go through a series of checkpoints, where you don't -- there's no people you interact with, because they're afraid, obviously. Israeli officials are frightened or concerned about people bringing explosive devices in, so it's a step-by-step process. There's all these surveillance cameras around. You lay out all your bags, they get a sense of who you are. They electronically open a door. You walk into another room and move all your bags into that room, they get a closer look at your bags on the ctv camera. You take off your belt, go through -- you put your bags on a giant conveyor belt, a giant x-ray machine, they disappear. You then basically strip down, your belt, several metal detectors, full body scanner, and you're gradually systematically allowed to cross over into israel. They then hand go through all your bags. 

[00:36:20]


>> The israelis do. 
>> At gunpoint going through your bags, very methodically, very carefully, after it's been through x-ray machines, every piece of equipment is gone through. They then hand it back. You get your passport stamped and you're on your way. And all the while, you hear rockets going off very close by in some cases, some being fired from israeli positions, some fired towards israel. 
>> So it's not as if they're a united nations personnel monitoring this border crossing. 
>> No, it's a very surreal system where you actually don't run into any human beings for several steps of the process. It's all done through surveillance cameras, through doors being electronically opened for you and gradually, you know, as -- the closer you get with each door you go through, you're one step closer towards israel and one step -- they have examined you one step further. It's a fascinating system to see up close. 
>> Yeah, but at some point, and you were there for what, three, four, five days? 
>> Right. 
>> Must have been scared out of your mind. 
>> You're definitely in a heightened state of awareness. I wouldn't say scared, because I've been in a lot of areas over the years. But it's always shocking to see the conditions that people are forced to live in, in a war zone. And to see what life is like for somebody who is the only difference between them and myself is the accident of birth and what zip code they were born into, and what -- that has determined what their life is like and what their ability is to get a job and to move upward. 
>> Now, you're constantly hearing shells going off, rockets -- it's loud, thunderous noise. Could you get any sleep? 
>> Yeah, actually -- I've been in, you know, starting way back in sayer of a owe, and after a time you ignore it, you cannot let it get to you, because you'll be paranoid. Unlike sayer of ao unlike what's happening in syria where bashir al assad is indiscriminately lobbing shells, there is targeting involved in where the israelis are striking. You can make arguments about whether it's effective or not or people will take me to task for this, but even gazans will tell you, I stood with many gazans watching bombs go into buildings, and they were taking pictures. They had a sense of this is not indiscriminate shelling, there is a specific target, whether it's the correct target, whether women and children are going to get killed in the process, that is going to happen. But it's not that sense of, you know, indiscriminate. The flip side of that is, you never know where a hamas or an alleged hamas person may be. Where they may have an office in a building like this, where, you know, do they have an office on the floor below you? You don't know. And so israel considers that a target and so they're going to -- if they fire missiles into your building, you can can very easily get killed. 

[00:39:15]


>> One final question. Did they have any clue when you walked around the street, you were wearing body arrest more and a helmet. Do these folks know who you are? 
>> Some people do. 
>> Is cnn in gaza? 
>> A lot of people didn't have electricity, some people have satellite dishes, they're able to see it. But, you know, I actually don't -- you try not -- i actually didn't wear body armor all of the time. 
>> I saw some pictures of you wearing it. 
>> Yeah, in some cases you would wear body armor, other times you didn't. A lot of it had to do with I was interacting with people, just regular people, I generally don't wear body armor, because i think it sends the wrong message if'm asking people to tell me their story, I feel like i should be taking a risk with them. 
>> Anderson, thanks for the excellent work.

>>> The obama administration clearly played a crucial role in encouraging israel to agree to the ceasefire with hamas. Wolf spoke with shimon peres about relations with the united states and peres' longevity on the world stage. Here is some of wolf's interview in jerusalem. 
>> You remember during the american presidential campaign the republican nominee, mitt romney, accused president obama of throwing israel under the bus. 
>> Well, let's look at the facts. Israel is not under the bus. The fact is that president obama, and we shall not forget it, helped us to find us those missiles. And security -- we asked them. They responded positively. And is the president of the united states. We enjoy the support of the two parties. And it is -- and I don't want to say anything against candidate romney any time. But we are not taking parts in the american campaign. And we are lucky to have the support of the two parties. And until -- it's hard to become the president of the united states. And I met all the presidents for the last 50 years, republicans and democrats. I must say, most of them are exceedingly friendly. Exceedingly. 
>> So what about you? You're getting close to 90 years old. That's hard to believe. You look so great. How do you feel? 
>> I feel that I am too young to do the job. What can I tell you? 
>> Because you still have some energy left. 
>> I think that everybody can be like me. And I think I'm lucky to show my people. I'm here not to woo the people. Someone here to woo should not be a representative of the people. But if I can help my people in any way, I'm glad to do so. And if I'm in good shape, i don't have reasons to protest against it. It's acceptable for me. 

[00:45:40]


>> I read in the israeli press there was even some ideas that maybe you should cllenge benjamin netanyahu in the upcoming election. 
>> Don't you think I'm too young for the job? 
>> I think you look great. Is there -- 
>> thank you. 
>> Is there any truth? 
>> I don't -- I have responsibility to the constitution. I am the president of the israeli people. I have to fulfill my town, which is another year and eight months. 
>> Finally, is there one piece of advice for viewers watching right now that you want to share on how you've managed to stay so youthful, so energetic, so alert all of these years? 
>> The first thing is self control. Before I try to control anybody else, every person is the best doctor of himself. He knows how much to eat and how much not to eat. How much to work. And use your own experience to control urself. Secondly, be engaged. If you ask me, don't go on vacation -- I don't take vacations. I don't know what people are doing during vacations. It's a waste of time. The best vacation is to work. To work. To be engaged. To be curious. To care. To love people. And to be an optimist. You know, people are saying I'm too optimistic. My answer is that optimists and pessimists pass away the same way. They live differently. And people say optimists are wrong. May I say ssimists are wrong, as well. And I believe that you really have to sell, to be positive, to try and help. I believe generosity is stronger and wiser than cruelty or indifference or trying to control somebody else. The real secret of life is goodwill and not the macho process, to be powerful and strong. And also, the highest degree of wisdom is the moral call. There is nothing wiser in life than to be an honest man. I am trying to. 

[00:48:15]


>> Mr. President, thank you very much. 
>> Thank you.

>>> in israel blaring sirens are usually the first warning that a rocket is heading your way. But one teenager came up with an app for that. 
>> Reporter: When rockets from gaza come flying towards israeli towns, time is of the essence. People have to run for cover and this new app can buy them a few additional seconds. It's called color red and sends out an alert when a rocket alarm goes off. Believe it or not the idea for the color red app comes from a 13-year-old. He lives in a town near the gaza border that's often targeted by rockets. 
>> Translator: There are people that need to know what is happening and the regular services don't help them enough so I wanted to be the one that gave them the right information. 
>> Reporter: And just then another alarm goes off. Israel has a sophisticated warning system for impending rocket strikes. With sirens alerting citizens to take cover. But people inside their homes or in office buildings don't always hear the sirens. We got caught up in several rocket alerts while shooting this story. We have to get under shelter because there's another air siren alarm. But thanks to this new app some people at least have more time to get to shelter because they get day letters really quickly. Let's go. The app created by an application developer is free. It seems to work so well it's been downloaded more than 130,000 times since the conflict began. How many of your friends have this as well? 
>> All. Soldiers too and the police do. All. 
>> Reporter: Israel's government even sent out a notice urging news people to download the color red app. The army says any application that warns people of rocket strikes helps in the effort to keep citizens safe. 
>> The time that people have here to run shelters is between 15 and 50 seconds. Any mobile device that can help it's a good solution. 

[00:53:51]


>> Reporter: And leon says he thought up the application in his little room at his parent's home. 
>> Translator: I'm very proud of myself. A very small thing that I did is doing a great thing for the people in the south of this country. 
>> Reporter: He spend as lot of time updating the color red facebook page these days. He's got plenty of time. His cool is closed because of thongoing rocket attacks.

>>> It is crunch time at airports across the country. Cnn went behind-the-scenes for an exclusive look at what i takes to get flights turned around safely and on time. 
>> Reporter: It takes a team of people to make sure flights coming in get prepped and ready to go right back out. We got exclusive access to a ground crew team at united airlines to see how they get it done under deadline. At the gate the action starts when these wands stop the plane. We got an exclusive up close look at united airlines highly choreographed ground services grew at houston's bush continental airport. First unloading a flight from amsterdam. These metal containers are filled with luggage. 
>> People don't realize there's a lot of processes going to get the bag from one destination to another. But we do it proficiently. 
>> Reporter: Timing is everything when you turn a plane. You can see up there catering is restocking the plane with food. There's refueling. Filling the water tank. And replacing pillows and blankets. He watches over it all from a krol center at the airport. 
>> I like to think of myself as a orchestra conductor. Ate very complex operation. Everybody has a sponsibility. Everybody has a critical part of the mission. 
>> Reporter: You have cleaning crews and maintenance checking to make sure everything inside the plane is ready to go for the next flight. The pilots arrive while as many as 35 employees continue to ready the aircraft forde par tur. Workers can see just how long they have to complete their task by the countdown clock over there and typically it ranges, depending on the size of the plane, from 40 minutes to about an hour and a half. I got to climb inside a cargo hold being filled with bags for the flight back to amsterdam.

=======================================================

>>> Hello from new york, I'm chris hayes here with lincoln's screenwriter, the chief medical officer and jacob hacker, professor of political science at yale university there is a whole lot of news this week about the affordable care act. And I think one of the things we can all agree on about the election was that it was in many ways, it ended up being whether explicitly or implicitly a referendum on the affordable care act. This was the signature domestic achievement of the president. It was the precipitating event of the backlash in the republican party embodied by the tea party. And its fate was determined on election day in so far as whether it would stand or fall. In reelecting president obama, we're going to now have the act in some form. The reason I wanted to keep you around for this conversation, tony is your film changed the way that I think about the affordable care act. I'm in support of the affordable care act, and I think the outcome is really going to increase the net like joy of human beings in the country. I'm serious, by a significant amount and reduce suffering. That's what we're all in the game for, okay. At the same time, there was part of me that felt that the corrupt -- the process that produced it and the way the process was tainted, you're cutting this deal with pharma, you're cutting this deal with the device manufacturers, then you have to say to the unions, don't worry about the tax on the so-called cadillac plans. You're dealing everybody in because if you don't dea everybody in, the thing falls apart, that there was something about the way in which that process unfolded that ultimately tainted my judgment of the final product, right. That it's the fruit of the poison tree, that you can't be an ideal piece of legislation. It can't be something that I can really, really get behind because I know all the dirty details of how it came about. And watching the story of how the 13th amendment was passed in which there is essentially a bunch of hacks bribing congressmen made me think well i guess you can separate means from ends. 

[00:02:11]


>> Well, you know, one of the interesting things about democracy is I don't think means and ends are neatly divided. The means are the ends. I mean the whole process of haggling through one of these bills is democracy itself. I mean you're sort of achieving your ends while you're doing it. The affordable care act when we were working on the film during the -- at one point we were in washington, I forget why, and obama was meeting with republicans at blair house. Everything sort of came together for us then. The moment with the public option, it felt like history happening all over again. And it seems to me that it's essential, you know, that accepting compromise is essential. Because it advances us in terms of actually being able to cover more americans and giving us health care. It also shows that it's possible to break through barriers that we were -- I mean, the idea that this first term president, first term african-american president was going to go to health care, which is supposely undone clinton was an astonishing thing. Everybody said that's a big mistake. And then he did it. As you say, I think the election was a referendum on that. 
>> You're both health care wonks who watched this unfold. You're an actual doctor and you're a provider. You drew up the original plan for the public option. Now that we have passed the election, what is the way that you go back and think than process? 
>> Well, you know, I guess as politicians will say, being a pragmatist, being in a position to take care of patients, that i am not a good judge. I feel that he compromised in the wrong places. You know, I think that he gave up too much too soon. My father was a labor union organizer, and he taught us that you never compromise until you get the other side at the table and you're looking eye to eye. And I felt like he didn't even consider single payer. My daughter jokes that single payer was off the table and on the floor. But if it had been in the room, then the nature of the compromise we got would have been quite different. 

[00:04:34]


>> This conversation ends up -- what ends up happening is there are two conversations there is a conversation about what are the best substantive outcomes. And then there is a conversation that is basically essentially our own individual subjective judgment of the wisest political choices. 
>> Right. 
>> And I think sometimes we can kind of conflate those. We kind of put a moral overlay on our own subjective judgments what could have happened. 
>> Of course. 
>> At what period of time. 
>> And I think it's a mistake to think that the compromising only came after president obama was elected. The biggest shift in thinking about health care reform occurred prior to the election among democrats. After all, they were pushing a proposal that had been pushed by romney in massachusetts, that had this public option, which i had pushed, but alongside a competitive market exchange structure. And that really structured the debate. We should be clear that the compromises that occurred were really want the democratic party in a certain sense. There was hope to get republicans on board, but in the end, there was only one republican in the househat supported the legislation. They weren't able to get any senate republicans, despite the fact that they had really adopted an approach that borrowed heavily from republicans. So that was the really crucial moment. And my own view about it is that the public option was essential to kind of keeping the debate focused overall on how consolidated the insurance industry had become about the need to contain costs, about the fact that medicare actually does a good job controlling cost, and it covers people. I got a lot of flak from both sides. Mean this is -- I don't consider that a sign of virtue. I know both sides attacking, you must be in the right place. I understood why that was. But I think that the really sort of critical period in the debate occurred in deciding what the initial approach would be. 
>> That's interesting. 
>> And then of course during that period ran roughly from late 2009 into 2010 when, you know, we went through four near death experiences with the bill. 

[00:06:40]


>> That made me think also about -- let me just say for the record, the 13th amendment is a much, much, much bigger deal in the affordable care act lest anything think I'm equating the two. Much bigger deal. 
>> Absolutely ending slavery is a much bigger deal than anything. But the affordable act is immensely important. The difficulty here is to -- and I think this is the difficulty, it's for progressive people, how do we develop a way, I mean, this is again, you can borrow this from the history of lincoln and his relationship with the radicals in the house and the senate. How do we continue to -- how do we keep a public discussion alive about the things that are being compromised and what is being lost and things like public option while at the same time not undermining kind of a larger project, which is to rebuild politically effective progressive community in the united states. That seems to many to be in one sense what obama has taken on as president. It's going to be a big issue in the second term because I think he is a builder. I don't think he is going to immediately become everybody's dream left president this time around either. So I think the question is how do we talk about this stuff without, you know, undermining the attempts to build. 
>> I think I must have come at all of this from a much more cynical angle than you, chris. I don't expect any big legislative debate, especially one that involves so much of the federal budget like this one not to look like -- 
>> that's true. 
>> To please all the various financially interested groups, or at least enough of them to build a coalition to pass it. I think on that the affordable care act is a good thing. I think there are a lot of problems with the way it's structured, and there aren't enough measures to control costs. I think that is something that will get fixed in the future. I don't think it was reasonable to expect a law that would have been a lot closer to perfect to come out telephone process, especially given the republican approach on health care for last 15 years is basically consisted of entirely consisted of concern controlling, with the exception of governor mitt romney. 

[00:08:52]


>> So one person delivering. 
>> Right. 
>> I was also heartened i remember in the midst of it. I think if process of producing the bill, this is a fact, you know, people hated it. They hated watching this process unfold. And it probably unfolded in some ways with more transparency than any other similar legislative battle in history. It was the most covered. There were more outlets. I remember going back reading about the number of labor member of parliament, one of the cheefr architects of the national health service in britain. Of course, if you dive into that story, the same interest groups are fighting there. In that case it's the doctors. And at one point he declares, the doctors won't shut up because they hate this. And he says we shall stuff their mouths with gold. The way we're going to get them to shut up is carve all sorts of things into the legislation that essentially pay them off. It's the same kind of deal making that is in your film and that we saw in the affordable care act. 
>> I think it's right that obama did frame the discussion. He could have framed the discussion around medicare and looking at an improved medicare for all. But he decided to go with the market, because he thought that would draw the republicans in. So he basically went to their side and failed in that regard, because he wasn't able to -- 
>> to draw any of them off. I think the other interesting lesson that I take away from "lincoln" is there are some fantasy you have that the dispute will be resolved, declare tend, right. Okay, well, that's it. And what we have seen, and we certainly saw this with the civil war, the noble cause lives on, and resistance, resistance, resistance. And that's just true of all politics, right? The matter is never settled. And that's what I want to turn to next, because we have the affordable care act, but there are still a tremendous amount of interests that are fighting and fighting its implementation.

>>> I want to welcome now to the table msnbc contributor joy reed, also managing editor for our sister website, thegrio.Com. We also have dr. Donald berwick, formerer administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services, happy thanksgiving, don. It's good to have you here. Nice to be here, chris. Thank you. 
>> So some big news this week in the world of affordable care act and implementation. One of the things that is really important. The matter is never settled. There is going to be battles at every step of the way in the implementation and how the implementation goes is going to affect whether the legislation is successful, the regulations that are promulgated, et cetera. One place that we've seen a lot of resistance from the beginning is the business community, and of course the national federation of independent businesses was named as a plaintiff against the affordable care act. And the kind of person who has become the figurehead for this resistance is the papa john's ceo, john schnotter. He said before the election and actually in a collection after the election, well look, our franchisees are just going to reduce people's hours so they fall under the 30 hours that's covered by the employer mandate in the aaffordable care act. He then kind of walked that back a little bit. He said in an op-ed, he said, look, what did he say? Here he says papa john's like most business series still researching what the affordable care act means to our operations. Regardless, the conclusion over analysis we will honor this law as we do all laws, and continue to offer 100% of papa john's corporate corkers and corporate owned stores insurance as we have since the company was founded in 1994. The question though is the franchises. And that's where he says the average papa john franchisee owns three to four stores. Since the franchisees own the stores they operate, how many hours they give each employee and what they pay each employee is up to them, not me or papa john's. Like any small business in these economic times, our franchisees are under tremendous amount of pressure on costs. I think the first big question is are we going to see lots of businesses dropping health care because of the affordable care act? That is the threat. And I want to hear from you guys how credible that threat. 

[00:16:07]


>> There are two issues here. One is dropping employees down to part-time such that they under the law don't have to pay a penalty if they don't offer them health care. And also those employees will lose income. And the other issue which is not necessarily so bad for the employees is the company says it's cheaper to pay the $2,000 penalty. So I won't offer a health care plan. 
>> Only over 50 employees this penalty applies to. You either have to offer them health care insurance, or they have to be making enough money that they could buy it in the individual marketplace unsubsidized. If you don't immediate the criteria, you pay a $2,000 per employee fine. 
>> Exactly. To the extent companies decide I'm just going to pay the fine, I think that's a perfectly outcome for workers. In the aggregate, you're going to have a problem where the aaffordable care act will end up being more expense than it was projected to be if a lot of companies elect to go that route. The real threat is reduction to part-time for a lot of employees. And I think, you know, I'd certainly expect some companies to do it. They're responding rationally to incentives that they can save money and operate their business more profitably this way that. 
>> Might well. 
>> Two quick points. One is that employers are already dropping coverage. 
>> That's been the trend. 
>> Will there be employers dropping coverage because of the affordable care act? Now the first part I think is almost certainly true, that we will continue to see a decline in employment-based coverage. Over the course of the last decade a 10% decline in the share of employers providing coverage. But whether the affordable care act will accelerate that, it's difficult to answer. If employers are required above 50 are required to pay some modest amount, that could actually create a more level playing field, particularly among these sort of service employees. 
>> Right. 
>> Who are not in international competition. 
>> Don, is this something you thought about when you were at cms when you were thinking about how you design the regulation, how the decisions are going to be made at the margin by particularly smaller employers? 

[00:18:10]


>> Yeah, at the margin it was very hard to predict there will be some dust settling here. And we'll see some shift in the balance between public and private financing of health care. But the real key point to me is that the affordable care act isn't just about coverage, it's about delivery system reform. The reason why they're dropping back from coverages is interest costs are out of control and the system needs to increase its quality. The whole part of affordable care act that moves towards changing the way care is given, that will benefit employers and in the long run make it more possible for them to continue to offer the insurance directly. 
>> You're saying if it uses the mechanisms that are in place in the law, particularly using medicare and medicaid payments to reform the ways that health care are delivered to put an emphasis on quality as opposed to essentially quantity, that that's going to bring costs down and help everyone. 
>> Should it if we follow through with the implementation of the affordable care act on the delivery system reform side. The coverage part of the affordable care act is the charismatic, more visible part of the law. People are debating who gets covered and who doesn't. But what is actually really crucial for the future of the system is the changing of care delivery through the mechanisms of the affordable care act. 
>> I think it's interesting. When there is a surplus of labor, then you can sort of have guys like the guy from papa john's making this declaration, I don't like the law so my franchisees won't provide their employees with health care. But as the economy improves. 
>> As it tightens. 
>> Now if you have more scarce supply of labor, offering health insurance becomes an incentive for businesses to hire to get quality employees. Thing is an argument that we can have now because of the surplus of labor. But as the economy improves, which it inevitably will, there is always a rebound from the recession. I think the calculation will be less political and it will be more about your business. 
>> And there is economic logic as to why employers even before the affordable care act. 
>> It's where it came from in the first place. It came during world war ii, the whole notion of linking your health insurance to the employment was the way to engender loyalty and circumvent the wage and price freeze that the world war ii economy demanded. But make no mistake about it. The majority of people uninsured in this country today are working people. 

[00:20:20]


>> Right. 
>> And that's been a trend. 
>> I want to talk about the people who are uninsured, half of whom, approximately 15 million are going to be added to the roles for medicaid. This is a real big open question. Are we going to see states run by the republican party take the federal government up on its extremely generous deal to get people on the medicaid roles, right after this. ] season your mouth has been sipping, snacking, yellowing.

[00:23:49]


>>> So a huge part of the affordable care act's way of expanding coverage, the big thing, right, travesty, economic and moral trav industry city in this country, people are uninsured in one of the wealthiest countries that ever existed in human history. Half of the people are going to get the coverage through exchanges and half through expanded medicaid. One of the less noticed parts of the affordable care act came from the supreme court was essentially the federal government could not force states to participate in the medicaid expansion. In fact, states could opt out. And we have seen a number of republican governors say we're opting out. The latest is governor mary fallon. She is rejecting oklahoma's participation. This is what she had to say about it. 
>> I've always decided that oklahoma will not be pursuing the obama administration's proposed expansion of medicaid. Such an expansion would be unaffordable. It would also further oklahoma's reliance on federal money that may or may not be available in future years out, especially given the dire fiscal problems facing our federal government and certainly the discussion about the fiscal cliff in washington, d.C. 
>> Now just so people are clear here, the federal government will assume 93% of the costs of medicaid expansion from 2014 to 2022. That share will decline slightly after that. But this is a pretty good deal in terms of the amount of people you can get covered for the amount of money that you as a state are going to have to pay. Don, after the aca decision, there was a lot of debate about basically, will republican governors be that craven to turn away the money for the sake of political posturing. A lot of people said no way, obviously they're all going to come in line. I'm curious if you are surprised by these decisions or if this is more or less what you are expecting. 
>> I'm surprised. It did take six or seven years i think when medicaid was first passed for all the states to sign on. We may be in some process like that. But it just doesn't make sense to leave this money on the tail. These patients don't go away. A state that chooses not participate in the medicaid expansion still has to somehow meet the needs of those people, free care pools or some forms will end up being bills to the states. And as you said, chris, for the medicaid expansion portion of this, it's almost 100% federal dollars for the first few years, and it goes down to 90% federal dollars. It just doesn't make economic sense for a state to leave that money on the table. And as I say, the patients are still there. They're still going to come. 

[00:26:28]


>> I submit to you that a state like oklahoma may be able to get away with that. They have relatively low medicaid roles. States like florida, they're going to take the money. Because what is going to happen is the hospital interests will demand that they take the money. 
>> A very good point. 
>> We'reoing to stuff their mouth with gold. Hospitals will go bankrupt. I know in miami right now -- 
>> it's a lifeline there. 
>> Are hospitals on the brink of bankruptcy right now without the federal money. If they don't take the money, and hospitals are now corporations. 
>> You work in a hospital. 
>> And we may actually just last month got a medicaid waiver, which will allow us to start in 2013 enrolling people. And, you know, so people -- 
>> meaning ahead of schedule? >>hA YEAR AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. Medicaid, you can't just be poor. You have the poor and. Poor and blind, or poor and pregnant, or poor and disabled. This allows them to enroll people just on the basis of their interesting. 
>> Interesting. 
>> For us it is a lifeline. 60% of the people in our hospital are uninsured. 80% of our outpatients are uninsured. And the idea that we can begin to get paid for these people is going to be about our survival. Because the way the expansion is paid for is decreasing the funds per portion per hospital. 
>> Explain that. 
>> Hospitals that take care of a large proportion of people who are uninsured, indigent in this country, receive funding from the government called disproportionate share. And so it's not that there is new money or free money. 
>> They're shifting the money from there -- 
>> we made the decision, we made the decision. Instead of paying the institutions, we're going to put the money in the hands of the individuals, and the individua can make choices about where they want to receive their care. And it will be up to the hospitals who take care of these patients to continue to attract them. Because now they'll have medicaid, and they can go have other options in terms of where they receive their care. 
>> Interesting. We have made the decision instead of funding the institutions, we're now funding the individuals, and then going to see if those individuals will continue to receive their care at those institutions or at other places. And I'm going to say that in a city like chicago, which is highly competitive health care market, you know, they may have other hospitals or other places that they'll take care of them. But we also have a lot of people who won't accept medicaid. 

[00:28:47]


>> Right. 
>> And so therefore it's sort of like I said before to you like giving someone a debit card with no credit on it. It might be like giving you a library card where there are no books in the library, where you can receive that care thinking leads to another point. Not only is this a very cost-effective way for expanding coverage for the states, it's a very cost-effective way of expanding coverage overall. It's one of the biggest bang for the buck ways to get people covered because medicaid's payments are relatively low there is just some new studies, though, that suggest medicaid beneficiaries, although they have slightly more difficulty getting care than do privately insured patients, do so much better than people who don't have coverage at all. So my hope is that this is the a high stakes game of chicken, the states trying to extract more concession. 
>> Don? 
>> And it is the states they're talking about leaving the money on the table that have the higher proportion of uninsured. 
>> That's the scary thing. 
>> Among potentially eligible medicaid people. 
>> That's the strange aspect of the politics of all of this. It is the states, and we have a math of some of the states that are on the record saying it's oklahoma, texas, louisiana, mississippi, alabama, south carolina, georgia, speaking of the civil war. Josh? 
>> I just think the politics of this are going to slip phillip so fast once the program goes into effect. Arizona did hold out for 17 years on medicaid. 
>> I SAW, THAT 1990s. 1982 or '83. But they were alone for a substantial period in that. And that was -- the federal government only pays for 57% of medicaid on average. They'll be paying for north of 90% expansion. And the states will still be paying federal taxes to finance obama care benefits in new york and california. So youe going to be able to say to people basically, look, we're paying for this. Do you want this nearly free money or not. And I think the mind-set they have right now, it's this denial thing where we can repeal it, we can repeal it. And they're trying to throw as much at the law as possible and try to make the implementation as bumpy as possible. But eventually that game is going to run out. 

[00:30:54]


>> Don, there a ledge mitt concern of unfunded liabilities in the future? This is the way the federal government drug dealer gets you hooked? They give you some free samples of medicaid, and then you start jonesing for it, and they jack the price in the future? 
>> There may be. There are two things going on there is a subtle thing at the margin here, if a state can figure out a way to get a potential medicaid beneficiary instead on to the premium tax credit through the exchanges, that's 100% federal dollars. And I think there is a little bit of that arbitrage going on. I think on the whole, though, states will be far better off if they get into. This and I think they will. They'll realize their own self-interest lie there's. And if they don't, the hospitals and doctors are going to insist they do. 
>> Exactly. What is happening in florida right now, and rick scott is the ultimate tea party governor, but he is engendering the rage of the tea party because he is using this money to bargain with the federal government for ways to do experimental public/private weird partnerships with the way that they cover people. So they're getting waivers from health and human services experiment with the way they control coverage, which gives them more control. But the one quick note I give you, a lot of the same states are saying they don't want to run their own exchanges. They're anti-federal government, but they're going to hand over to the federal government. 
>> It's a very federalist law. There is a fair amount of room for experimentation and latitude. And josh, you just sort of mentioned the idea that it could be repealed. It is people calling for the repeal of the affordable care act is at an all-time low. It's at 33%. This is the lowest it's been, this is from the kaiser polling, which has been doing polling. You see that line dips down there. I think there was a conventional wisdom particularly on the left among democrats. It was articulated by bill clinton. Look, once this thing passes, people are going to love it. That wasn't true. It does seem the public opinion battle has moved decisively. I want to talk about the politics of continued resistance right after we take this quick BREAK.it work? You just have to eat it as part of your heart healthy diet. Step 1. Eat t soup.

[00:35:56]


>>> Tom berwick, who used to run cms, implementing the affordable care act, there was something you wanted to say right before we went to break. 
>> You were talking about gaming. And I want to point out one subtle thing around the fiscal cliff right now. 
>> Please. 
>> I think the states are watching right now very carefully to see if this administration is going to stand behind the medicaid portion of the affordable care act or signal that it's willing to back out the federal share, because i think they really need a strong signal that they can rely on that federal match rate for a good long time. 
>> That's a great point. We do have some reporting about the last standoff around the debt ceiling in which jack lou is now the chief of staff. During negotiations, the republicans kept trying to chip away at the funding. And he said no, no, no, no means no. John boehner is making this exact same point. John boehner after the election said look, guys, it's the law of the land. And that occasioned some historionics from his caucus. He now has an op-ed saying the president's health care law adds a massive, expensive unworkable government program at a time when our national debt already exceeds the size of our country's entire economy. We can't afford it, and we can't afford to leave it intact. That's why I've been clear that the law has to stay on the table as both parties -- the republicans want to keep this in play. It's a real question about whether it's going to be in play. 
>> The nutty part of this, obviously health care entitlements on a whole need on on the table, not in the fiscal cliff discussion we're going to have this month, but this the ultimate fiscal adjustment we're going to have in the next few years where we shrink the deficit. But medicaid is the most cost-effective part of our entire health care structure. If you're going about to be cutting, maybe you should be cutting in the exchange subsidies. Medicaid is the last place to go to look for the dollars. 
>> An administration official after this op-ed from boehner said on wednesday the president would oppose involving the aca in the negotiation. 
>> It's also nutty because the aca reduces the deficit. If you look at ten-year projections, it brings down the overall costs. So the subsidies in the medicaid expansion are costly, but there is also the savings in medicare and the new taxes that are going to be used to fund it. So it actually on balance is deficit-reducing. 

[00:38:16]


>> Claudia, I'm curious. One of the things I think is interesting is the single payer people and the conservative people, conservative opponents of aca and the conservative skeptics have critiques about cost control. You see these sort of mirror images in which conservatives say the cost control is never going to materialize, and single payer people say no, single payer is the only way to get the kind of cost control you want. I'm curious, whether you think we're going to see the cost controls that steelerize that are being projected. 
>> Well, I'm very skeptical that the aca cost controls are going to be effective. You know, we could save $500 million if we just did an expanded medicare for all, which would allow us to cover everyone, including the people we're leaving out. The cost control that we're -- the infrastructure isn't in place with the aca. 
>> You're saying on the delivery side? 
>> On the delivery side. 
>> And don, this is what you have worked on, right? This is what you have done your life's work on. But also at cms is making sure the infrastructure is developed or in place to get the cost controls that are being projecd? 
>> Yeah, that's right. There is no question that a simplified system of payment would save money right off the top. But politically we don't seem to be able to go there right now. The country is committed to a pluralistic system. I think the good news in the aca is the pleurism approaches to cost state by state is rather exciting. Oregon with coordinated care organizations, massachusetts is trying a global cap, arkansas is pushing bundled payment to the limit. It's really exciting to see what they're going to do if their new state legislature lets them proceed. Maryland has an all payer system they're going to experiment more with. Vermont may go single payer. So we're going to see quite a bit of learning in the next few years as the states struggle with costs reduction. 
>> That is really interesting there is a lot of room for experimentation at the state level to see what is going to get the costs down. 
>> I mean -- 
>> a ton, yes. 

[00:40:16]


>> The one nice thing about having by far the highest health care costs in the world is that it seems like there are a large number of options that you could pursue that would produce a better cost outcome than we have now there are lots of countries that have significantly lower costs than we do. There. 
>> Is a lot of space in between too. 
>> Everyone has lower costs than we do. 
>> One more reason I think that medicaid is actually probably going to survive more than people think is the biggest sort of pot of money where you think the cuts are going to go, because no one wants to touch social security is probably medicare. And if you do things on changing the amounts of benefit that people get in medicare, people forget one of the big things medicaid does is it helps poor seniors. And seniors are the most expensive to care for. So you're going to wind up having to have more medicaid money to cover those seniors. 
>> I want to ask about where you think the politics of this will go as we start seeing implementation. Because that's the real question there is this window where we pass the law, but it hadn't been implemented. So people still have their feelings about the law, basically based on the process that passed it, as opposed to the thing it was delivering. And I'm curious to get your thoughts at the table about what is going to happen once it starts being part of people's lives, right after this break. on Home Depot, think again.

>>> One of the effects of the affordable care act I think from the political perspective is a it begins to be implemented, the democratic party, barack obama in the short-term and the democratic party I think in the slightly medium term will own everything that happens in health care, right? You guys did this thing. You passed the affordable care act, and then if you're not liking your insurance company or your doctor. There is a big risk that has been taken politically here, which is that you made this great point before, jacob. Look, employers were shedding the trend of shedding coverage was happening before the act. But after the act, people are going to say that's the affordable care act. Health care inflation was going up way above regular inflation before the act. If that conties, you passed the act, it didn't work. I wonder what you think the politics of this looks like as it begins to become implemented. 
>> I think the democrats, they've been waiting to have something to crow about. There has been small aspects of the law that have gone into effect. But now there is going to be big steps. It's true there are going to be messy moments. But people will be getting coverage. Medicaid will be expanding there will be achievements to talk about. The irony is that everything that made it really hard toass the act may now shift to be favorable toward implementation. So the gridlock, the difficulty of changing law works in favor of the affordable care act, the fact that we had these insurance companies spending millions and providers groups spending millions, now they're going to have vested interest in key elements. It's not going to be pretty, but it's going to be very different. The fact that the president was reelected means that there is a real change. This is a momentous shift in the politics of the aca. 
>> I think also if you look at a state, like let's say a south carolina. Let's say they don't participate in the exchange, and the federal government directly runs them. If people have a positive experience of the affordable care act, they're not going to say well my governor did a great job. They are being directly aided by the federal government. So I wonder if conservatives are not undermining their own argument for smaller government conservatism by letting the federal government take care of people, federal. 

[00:46:39]


>> If you set up the exchanges well and people have a good experience of it, then they're going to be popular, and if you don't that. 
>> Won't be. 
>> Yeah, there is a lot of good for people in the law. Coverage under age 26 for kids, the prevention benefits I think over 30 million people have used these now. Insurance companies under much more restrictions to reduce the overhead costs. These should be noticed. I think the biggest vulnerability here, chris, they have to do with the exchanges. They are really difficult to set up, new information systems, complex enrollment procedures. I think one of the attacks is going to be trying to starve them. I hope that goes well. 
>> That's a really good point. 
>> I think the big challenge is going to be on the cost side. 
>> Yes. 
>> This law takes even more of the responsibility within the economy of health care costs on to the federal government's books. Over time those costs are going to be unsustainable. The cost control parts are going to become more and more important over time. As it goes forward, we're going to have more and more of the don berwick show. And I like the don berwick show. But I think a lot of people don't, because that's the part where they're saying we're not going to give you this test because really, you know, the test isn't useful for you. 
>> And there is peer reviewed evidence that shows this test is not useful. And you say gosh darn it, I want the test. 
>> Exactly. That's the change we're going to have to have. We would have needed it even if we didn't take on a greater government share of the costs. 
>> We shouldn't kid ourselves that isn't going to be necessarily popular in all moments. 
>> Oh, I think it's going to be unpopular. 
>> Donald berwick of the don berwick show, the man who just stead on our air, they're really pushing bundled payments to the max, that's super exciting about the arkansas, former administrator for the centers of medicare and medicaid services, joy reid, josh baro from bloomberg review, that was a great conversation. 
>>> Final thought on what I am grateful for this thanksgiving, up next. from Is bigger than we thk ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold? There's something that works differently than over-the-counter remedies. Prescription TAMIFLU attacks the flu virus at its source. So don't wait. Call your doctor right away. TAMIFLU is prescription medicine for treating the flu in adults and children one year and older whose flu symptoms started within the last two days. Before taking TAMIFLU tell your doctor if you're pregnant, nursing. have serious health conditions, or take other medicines. If you develop an allergic reaction, a severe rash, or signs of unusual behavior, stop taking TAMIFLU and call your doctor immediately. Children and adolescents in particular may be at an increased risk of seizures, confusion or abnormal behavior. The most common side effects are mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. The flu comes on fast, so ask your doctor about TAMIFLU. Prescription for flu. ] day news starts with arthritis pain and a choice. Take tylenol or take aleve, the #1 recommended pain reliever by orthopedic doctors. Just two aleve can keep pain away all day. Back to the news. 7??fV$ ????????????

>>> in just a moment, what I'm grateful for this thanksgiving. But first, a correction on something I said during my story of the week last sunday. While detailing the growth of the surveillance state in the context of former cia director david petraeus's demise, i showed a graph illustrating the rise in u.S. Government requests to google for user information. I said that the 7,969 requests google received from january to june of this year did not come with a warrant. That is not entirely accurate. Google does not break out the number of government requests it receives by type or by how many come with a warrant and how many do not. It's likely that several types of the requests google gets such as court or wiretap orders would come with a warrant, while many other requests would not. I regret the error. 
>>> Usually we do now we know in this portion of the show. But since we just celebrated thanksgiving, which also happens to be my favorite holiday, i thought I would take a moment to observe the very important ritual of expressing gratitude. One of my favorite people on twitter, feminist hulk captured the potential of giving thanks this way. Gratitude is first step in recognizing privilege. The next is battle oppression that prop it up from hulk's companies beginnings to now. To say I'm thankful I have a job and health insurance is to force us to question why that is a blessing at all. And so with that in mind, I am thankful for the opportunity to have spent thanksging with my wife and my child and my extended family, a source of joy unavailable to many of our troops, including 68,000 americans currently serving in afghanistan and the families both american and afghan of those who have died in the 11 years of war there. I'm thankful to live in a place where we have access to clean water and electricity, and we do not sleep away are the windows for fear of stray bullets. And we do not worry about the rocket fire overhead or a mortar shell, or a mortar strike destroys the home we have fled. I am thankful I can feel some measure of control over my life and my future and not feel as though my fate is in the hands of remote powerful forces armed to the teeth pursuing their own objective and wreaking havoc in my own life. I'm thankful for all of the civil servants who day in and day out work to provide the kind of basic goods that are the underpinning for other kinds of human flourishing. From those at the federal aviation administration who oversee commercial air travel that keeps 25,000 flights a day safe and hasn't had a fatality in three years to the tax processors of the internal revenue service who quite literally make the rest of governance possible, to the men and women who run our municipal water treatment facilities, and the unionized workers of the new york subway system who somewhat miraculously got the system back up and running in astonishing short order after sandy flooded many of the subway's stations and tunnels. I am thankful for this job, which I love, and the opportunity to do this work. And I am inordinately grate to feel the crew here with "up with chris" as well as the staff. Jonathan larson, kim harvey, todd cole, sal genteel, allison koch, tera metzer, diane seamus, matty fox, henry melcher, katie guthrie, and scott rocco, al of whom do imaginative, rigorous uncompromising journalism ea and every week. And finally all of us that work on the show are extremely grateful that there are viewers out there like yourselves who watch the show and argue with it and send me e-mail and tweets, both complimentary and occasionally enraged. I'm genuinely thankful to live in this stranger ra in which technology puts us in close contact with our critics, and their occasionally brutal criticism forces to constantly think hard what we're doing here on this show, and whether we are living up to the potential of this medium and the wonderful privilege of being able to talk to you every weekend. So thank you for being so engaged. And thank you for joining us today for "up." Join us tomorrow, sunday morning at 8:00. We'll have democratic congressman steve cohn. We're also going to be talking about the situation in israel and gaza, and the crazy news out of egypt, mohamed morsi who is the new prime minister there emerging as one of the most fascinating world figures in the world. One day he helps negotiate a that. Look at the outcomes of winners and losers from the gaza situation, and we'll be talking about susan rice and the future of foreign policy in the second term. We'll see you tomorrow at 8:00. Thanks for getting "up."With the 2-in-1 swiffer sweeper, a great clean doesn't have to take long. I'm done. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? ??????

It was a written commitment to the people of georgia that he would go to washington to reduce government spending and reform government, not raise taxes. If he wants to change his mind and become a tax increaser, so we don't have to reform government, he needs to have that conversation with the people of georgia.

She claimed the gun belonged to her husband and she brought the gun by mistake because it was in a bag they share. 
>>> To the middle east now and the cease-fire is holding for now between israel and hamas in gaza. There have been reports of random gunfire with no consequence. The tensions and the prospects for the lasting peace is our focus this morning. Joining me is a professor of middle east politics at the london school of economics and political science. Good morning, professor. Last week you said that the battle and the struggle to stop it showed that there's a new strategic land skip in the region and how israel is more isolated than it had been in the past. How did those factors play out with the peace negotiation? 

[00:13:22]


>> Well, I think they played a major role because neither hamas nor israel had the epithet for all-out war. The israeli prime minister i think recognized the gaest of a ground invasion of gaza and hamas also recognized that a ground invasion of gaza would deliver a hard blow, and both egypt and the united states played a pivotal role. Egypt because it is exercises tremendous influence over hamas and the united states basically impressed on prime minister netanyahu the need to basically deescalate as opposed to go for a ground invasion. So both the geostrategic realties on the ground between israel and between hamas and also in the region and the international system. The question is, as you said, how do you build on the cease fire? How do you as secretary hillary clinton said, this is just the first step. What comes after this first step is very critical for both israel and the palestinians and for the peace process. 
>> What about though, in terms of who really deserves the credit for getting this deal done and getting the cease-fire agreed upon? Does that is lie squarely with egypt's president? I mean his skill, mohamed morsy's skill at navigating this minefield between the two was certainly impressive. 
>> Well, I would say that the winner was morsy. The winner was egypt because egypt was able to play a major role in convincing hamas and also in trying to impress on israel that any major ground invasion would have serious repercus in the word of morsy on egyptian, israeli relations. Egypt was pivotal, the first state to sign a peace treaty with israel, the camp david peace accords. Even the israeli prime minister recognized the pivotal role of egypt. Yes, egypt is pivotal but don't underestimate the role of the obama administration analyst ability to put all the pieces together. Without the united states, i would argue there will be no political horizon, that the peace process will not be revived. That's why I'm hoping that president obama in his second term will invest political capital in bringing about and helping to bring about a two-state solution, a secure jewish state and also as independence and viable palestinian state that deals with the root causes of the fighting between hamas and israel. 

[00:15:59]


>> And getting back to mohamed morsy and egypt, morsy may be getting pats on the back from the international community but at home certainly much different right now, declaring a whole lot of power. Did he use the cover of the israel, ga zag conflict do you think to enact his new powers? 
>> I have no doubt in my mind that egyptian president mohamed morsy has proved to be very shrewd and calculating. Using this particular moment that basically everyone praised morsy is, the americans, israelis, europeans. He used this particular moment to really make a coup. He anointed himself a supreme leader with absolute power. He's basically trying to re-create an imperial presidency in egypt. Remember, what he has done is that there is no authority, no authority in egypt that can override any decision that he has made. And yes, you're absolutely correct. Unfortunately for the egyptian people, mohamed morsy's behavior does not differ very much from that of mubarak. That's why what he done basically has I would argue exacerbated cial and political tensions and widened the cleavages between morsy and the various political groups in egypt. This is why egypt is in turmoil and unfortunately for the egyptian people, I think egypt remains I would argue a work in progresses in terms of democratization and. >>Ization. 
>> Amazing to see the protesters holding signs about morsy calling him a dictator. We'll continue to watch this. .Next hour, more on the prospects for lasting peace in the middle east. We'll talk about iran's role in the region. Be sure to stay with us. 
>>> Well, it is one of the hardest decisions a mother could ever face. Now the mother of champion boxer hector ma cho camacho must decide whether her brain dead son should be taken off life support. 
>> And was yasser arafat murdered? The body will be exhumed within days. We'll go live to the west bank. ?????? ?????? ] health role throughout our lives.

A gunman shot the 50-year-old puerto rican champion in the face on tuesday. Police are looking for the shooter and another suspect. 

[00:22:01]


>>> This is like something out of a james bond movie. An unexplained death of a world leader and allegations of foul play and poisoning. Was palestinian leader yasser arafat murdered? His body is set to be exhumed from this mausoleum eight years after he mysteriously died. K pleitgen joins me now from the left bank. What are investigators looking for here? 
>> Reporter: Well, they're looking for the substance pel loaniam which is a radioactive substance that in the past has indeed been used for assassinations. If we look back a couple of years ago, the case of the former russian spy murdered with that same substance probably by the russian secret service. That's something that's still under investigation. What the investigators are looking for, traces of pel loaniam in his body. That could be quite difficult to find because keep in mind that yasser arafat died eight years ago. However, there's been a separate investigation with objects that belonged to arafat where apparently increases levels of polonium have been found. That set this whole investigation in motion. Now you have teams coming in from russia, switzerland and france under the mantle of the palestinian authorities are going to open the grave this coming week. They're going to take samples and shut the grave again on the same day. It's a very emotional day for palestinians because he is this overarching palestinian figure, but also a very, very interesting and almost exciting forensic case as well, victor. 
>> We know that the investigative committee held a news conference a short time ago. What more are we learning about how they're moving forward? 
>> Reporter: Well, they said they're moving forward in a way that, first of all, they pushed back the date for when the grave was going to be opened. They then went through the motions how all of this is going down. They said there's going to be a very ceremonial opening of the grave, then they're going to take the samples and then arafat is going to be laid to rest again with a religious ceremony and a military ceremony as well. That's sort of the process that's going to go on. What's going to happen is these three forensic teams, the russian, french and swiss one are going to separately take samples and take their samples back to their home countries and analyze them there so that there are three separate investigations into all this to get different sort of sample sizes. What's going to happen then, how long this is going to take especially is something that the palestinians have left open. But one thing that they will said is that if of course, it comes to light that indeed arafat was poisoned with pelonium, that is going to cause massive emotional reactions here in the palestinian territories and then of course, the big quell is who murdered him, the palestinians or most of them say they believe that israel did it. Israel denies this. It's not going to show who did this, but if it does show that yes, he was murdered that's going to lead to a massive investigation and, of course, very, very emotional and angry reactions here in this part of the world, victorier. 

[00:25:10]

He smoked for 24 years, gave it up and became an anti-smoking activist and spokesman for the american cancer society. 
>> I met at least 30 or 40 people that said they quit because of my personal involvement, which makes me feel really good. 
>> Reporter: He stopped drinking in 1995 when he was diagnosed with liver cancer and underwent a life-saving transplant. 
>> We won in vietnam, we wouldn't be having this conversation. 
>> Reporter: In recent years, he appeared on the big screen in films like "nixon" and "primary colors." But it is his role as the charming and conniving oil man that audiences will never forget. colleen McEdwards, cnn, atlanta. 

[00:34:19]


>> And we will of course, continue to follow the life and career of larry hagman. I'm a big fan of his. 
>> Great roles. I loved him in "primary colorses," but, of course, "dallas." 
>> They're going to having to write him out of the script, sadly. 
>> We will see how that changes the plot. 
>>> Amid fears the cease-fire between israel and hamas won't last, we found a place, let's call it a zone of peace where victims from both sides of the border can find some common ground. This is tel avivs hospital. In one room lives a boy whose mother who when a rocket slammed into an apartment at the start of the conflict, and right next door to him is an 8-year-old palestinian ghoirl lost three fingers of her own when the war came to her home. As many as a quarter of the palestinians -- patients are palestinians, many from gaza who are getting treated side by side with israelis. The hospital tells us they just treat people. They don't look where the patients come from. 
>>> Regardless of what happens next in the is conflict, let's consider this. Let's ask this question. What do these two sides continue killing each other and why are they perpetually on the brink of war? A new film from lorraine levy challenges the differences. The plot is two young men, israeli and palestinian, discover they were switched at birth. Essentially each man was raised as his enemy. Producer rafael verdugo joins me now. Thank you for joining us first. How did this idea for the film originate? What's the message here? 
>> Thank you. The idea came with short treatments years ago that my coproducer received, and she found the idea very interesting, and she developed the script with an author and then we contacted levy who was enthusiastic about the idea. And the idea came like this. There is no -- there is obviously a message of peace in in film, but after all it's a message of love, you know. This is not a political movie. It's a humanist movie. 

[00:36:39]


>> Well, essentially, because we're talking about gaza and israel, there is also a political interest in the movie. And you focused on this area, focused on this conflict. What do you think the role of this movie can be in the conversation that we're having about what's happening right now in the middle east? 
>> It's difficult to answer. A movie can have an aspect or influence in a conflict. It's a 60-year-old conflict. But after all this movie's demonstrating that any conflict is a result of the thought each party have of the other party. With the switch of the baby, each is forced to reconsider the other. It is clear that any war is limited. Any war can be solved by the change of the image of the other. It has to be said -- deeply in films by a famous israeli author. And she actually asked us to read one of his books before the shooting. The shooting was made with a mixed team you know between palestinian, israeli and french people. And the atmosphere was extra naefr positive during the shootinging. 
>> In this movie, these two young men who were switched at birth get to know each other and the endingcene is the two of them smiling with each other on a beach. I want to show you something related to "the l.A. Times"" review. They wrote the other son which is the name of this film, quite simply political correctness got the best of it. The french director is so focused on covering all the bases and insuring a sense of equal empathy and screen time for the plight of both families she leaves the film struggling to get beyond a log jam of life lessons. Is this film maybe a little too politically correct? What's your response to that criticism? >>, Of course, the film is an ideal vision of the situation and there is no way that lorraine can be accused of certain naivete of this story. But it is -- the purpose was not to make a demonstration of what to do. You know, you have to understand that these two families are not extremist families. This is important. Personally I feel this could personally happen. Testimony depends of course, on the context. But if you take a moderate israeli family and moderate family from palestinian, you can perfectly achieve this goal. I don't think it's so so irrealistic. 

[00:39:25]


>> Rafael berdugo. We foe a movie can't change history of decades but this can change our conversation abouting that. Thank you so much.

>>> Good morning, washington, d.C. Nice to have all you early birds awake. And starting your morning with us here on early start weekend. 
>> Black friday sale signs competed with those held by protesters on friday. Hundreds speaking out against walmart, calling on the company to provide better pay, better hours and health care for employees. Walmart says the strike did not hurt its sales. 
>>> Hostess the company that makes the treats like twinkies AND HOHOs HAS BEEN CLEARED FOR Liquidation by a judge. The company ceo says it plans to lay off 15,000 workers this week. The sweet treats will likely survive. Hostess is searching for buyers for its 30 brands and other assets. 38 days. 38 days and we could be heading right over the edge of that fiscal cliff. While going over that cliff could mean billions reduced from the nation's debt, it could mean another recession and massive unemployment. Joining me now is ron hart, managing direct are of wealth management from morgan stanley smith barney. Let's talk about the bottom line here. A middle class family of four, why should they worry? Why should a family liking that worry about the fiscal cliff? 
>> A family in arkansas that makes $55,000 a year will pay $3,000 more a year in taxes if it's fully implemented. That's a pretty big amount of money for an average family to absorb in a year. It slows the economy and ripples through all parts of the united states. We don't think it's going to happen fully. If it were, it would be pretty devastating to the u.S. Economy. 
>> That is a lot of money for these families. But is everyone affected by this? 
>> Yes 121 million taxpayers, 90% of america is affected. The lowest tax bracket goes from 10% to 15%. That's a pretty big rise. 
>> Businesses certainly watching the cliff closely. How would it affect american business if we did go over it? 

[00:45:29]


>> We think we would flirt with recession. Probably 1% off the gdp would come from it. It would cause unemployment to go higher which would hurt the nation. So goes business so goes america as the saying goes. It would hurt families in ways that are untold if american corporations laid off more people. 
>> Do you see any benefit at all? 
>> Getting our fiscal house in order. We can't spend money like this forever. We will have $16 trillion in debt. 99 trillion in unfunded liabilities with medicare and social security. At some point, now or later, right? 
>> Absolutely. Clearly though concessions will need to be made on both sides in this negotiation. What would you say each side needs to give up to make this happen to get this done? 
>> Obviously, the democrats have to give up entitlements to some degree and the republicans have to lighten up on its defense. We spend more than the top ten countries in the world on defense over $1 trillion. So I think we spend six times more than china currently. Like russia may have done in the old days, we may spend ourselves into obsoleteness. 
>> If we avoid the cliff are we putting a band-aid on bigger issues such as social security spending? Obviously, something needs to be done to fix this for the future. 
>> Right. The priorities of our country, who pays for it and how much government to we want? That's lining up republicans on one side, the democrats on the other. The differences have never been so stark. It's kind of a shirts and skins game in washington, as you know. 50/50 and this election was not exactly a mandate. You've got the same players in place, boehner and can'ter and pelosi, obama and reid. 
>> You're confident that we'll get it done? 
>> I'm positive about the american people. At some point in time we have to do this. I'd rather ease into it than have an event that makes us have to do it. We're thinking along the right ways right now. We've got do it at some point.

>> Ron hart, thank you. 
>>> A four-hour run or 17 hours of yoga. Sound fun? Not to me. That's what experts say you would have to do to burn off the thanksgiving calories. Does that sound fun?

[00:51:17]


>> By some accounts, you would have to do some serious and i mean serious exercising just to burn off the calories packed into most thanksgiving day meals. 
>> But that's why our buddy EXPERT mark McDonald is here. 
>> This is pretty heavy information. According to the american council on exercise, we cannot believe this. If you packed in about 3,000 calories for your thanksgiving day meal, twice what most women should be eating. 
>> Exactly. 
>> To burn off that, you would have to run at a moderate pace for four hours, swim for five -- swim for five hours, walk 30 miles. 30 miles to burn off those calories. The other option which I love as a yoga fanatic is 17 hours of yoga to burn that off. 
>> Crazy. 
>> There has to be another solution. 
>> Who wants to do that. That's what happens. We feel bloated. We just want to burn it off. But no one wants to do 17 hours of yoga. 
>> Nobody. 
>> We all say I'll start on monday. Get on plan now. Make this week and get on plan. Instead of focusing on burning off everything now, if you get on plan, you'll burn off the calories and the below the will be gone and you'll feel great again. Just don't wait till monday. 
>> That sounds great. Aunt bessie is staying with you. You've got to get the sales. How do you fit all that in now?

>> That's a lot, right? 
>> That's what he it feels like. 
>> Working harder. 
>> What is the one biggest mistaking that people make? 
>> The biggest mistake by like 1,000 fold is skipping meals. People starve themselves all day and then they overeat. When you skip a meal, you burn muscle which slows down your metabolism. You go into the next meal craving carbohydrates. Eat in threes. Every three hours, divide your plate in threes. If you do that, you're going to rock your body. 
>> We were talking about this during the break that you skipped meals till 2:00 yesterday. 
>> That's how I know I've overeaten. Sharing all my dirty -- no, it's true. I knew I had overeaten the day before because I wasn't hungry till 2:00 in the afternoon. 
>> You just take a half a meal and what will happen is your metabolism will start humming again. Skipping meals is the biggest mistake. If you don't skip meals, i guarantee you you'll burn more fuel. 
>> Good to know. Mark as always.

>>> Moving to the middle east now, life is returning to normal in southern israel and gaza. Schools are open in gaza for the first time since the fighting began last week and both sides agreed to a cease-fire. We know that happened wednesday. Shootings and rocket fire have stopped for the most part except for one incident yesterday. We'll have much more on the end of the hostilities there in just a few minutes. 
>>> And let's move to egypt now where protesters had gathered in cairo's tahrir square calling for the ouster of president mohamed morsy. Opposition leaders say new powers grabbed by morsy make him look like a dictator. Reza sayah has more on the massive protests. 
>> Reporter: Outrage, clashes and anguish in tahrir. Thousands of angry egyptians back in a public square that has become the arab world's emblem for the democratic right to protest. This was where egyptians demanded the ouster of former president hosni mubarak last year. This time the fury aimed at current president mohamed morsy. 
>> We're here because we don't want morsy to rule us anymore. 
>> A one-man show. He wants to do everything. Nothing at all of what we want, you know? 
>> Reporter: On thursday, the new president made himself the most powerful man in egypt by announcing sweeping decrees he says will designed to push forward the drafting of egypt's new constitution and speed up the formation of a government that's still missing a parliament. 
>> One of his decrees bans anyone from overturning any of his declarations since he took over office in june. That order is to stay in place till a parliament is formed. Technically it means for now, he can do whatever he wants without any oversight. 

[00:04:16]


>> Just felt he was telling us, you guys don't exist. It's just me and my people. And there's no place for anybody else in egypt. 
>> We're not allowing for a dictatorship again. 13 is enough. Egypt is not going into dictatorship once again. 
>> In a separate decree, morsy banned the breakup of the constitutional assembly, the 100-member panel assembly designed to draft egypt's new constitution. Protesters here say the panel favors islamist factions and ignores demands by liberals, christians, youth groups and women's rights groups. Some have sued to dissolve the panel. Morsy's decree for bids that. As nightfall approached, anger turned to violence and seemed similar to the egyptian revolution protesters clashed with police. We're along one of the major arteries leading into tahrir square. Clashes between security forces and protesters, tear gas. And we're moving away. As the protests intensified, mr. Morsy appealed for calm. In a speech to hundreds of supporters who gathered outside the presidential palace in cairo, he defended his decrees and rejected accusations of a power grab. 
>> Translator: I didn't take a decision against anyone or pick a side against another. I have to put myself in a clear path, a path that achieves a clear goal. 
>> Reporter: Several hours after mr. Morsy's speech, his critics were still out here in tahrir square protesting throughout the night, setting the stage for what seems to be an intensifying face-off between the president and his opponents. 
>> And let's bringing in reza sayah from cairo. You filed that report hours ago. As we look at live pictures of tahrir square, tell us about the scene there now. Are there still protesters? 

[00:06:20]


>> Reporter: They're still there but things have quieted down considerably. There are some demonstrators still out there, those who pitched toents stay overnight. But nowhere near the numbers we saw yesterday. Yesterday was probably one of the most intense and violent days of demonstrations we've seen over the past couple of years. 140 people injured according to the health ministry. Several injured with gunshot wounds. More than 200 people have been arrested. And this face-off between the president and his opponents is starting to take shape. One of the presidential advisors has resigned today in protest and the judges club, this is an organization that represents the top juds in egypt, the supreme court judges has called for a meeting in an hour. There are rumor of a possible judge's strike that could be very disruptive to this country. So critical days ahead for this country, randy. 
>> Of course, we're talking about the fact that morse sill effectively stripped the judge the -- judges of their power. Is that the only recourse they have? 
>> Right now there doesn't seem to be any political mechanism for his opponents, these political factions opposing him to do anything about this. But keep in mind, one of the things that they are rely on is the power to protest that exploded onto the scene in the 2011 egyptian revolution. They say they're going to keep demonstrating and protesting till someone heeds their call. All eyes on mr. Morsy. What will he do to defuse the situation? Is he going to lock horns with his opponents or macon sessions? If he does macon sessions, is that a sign of weakness? A lot of questions that remain unanswered. 
>> Certainly so. Reza sayah in cairo for us this morning. Thank you. 
>>> And we've got much more ahead on cnn this hour. 
>> Here's what's coming up. 
>>> So far so good. That cease fire between israel and hamas is holding for now. But there are real fears even the slightest flare-up could kick off chaos. 

[00:08:29]


>>> Plus, hurricane sandy's long gone, but did the storm leave behind more than just a mess? 
>> It's sort of like nevin. At this point, who knows?

>>> This cease fire between israel and hamas is holding after eight days of fighting. Now, here's the deal. Israel is loosening their grip on gaza and the blockade and hamas has agreed not to fire rockets into southern israel. Joining me now is john alterman, director of the middle east program at the center for strategic and international studies. Thanks for joining us this morning. 
>> My pleasure, thank you. 
>> Did either side make out better than the other in this agreement. 
>> It's much too early to tell you about what seems to me is there's a military side of this which israel clearly won. There's a political side. I'm not sure who won, whether hamas won, whether israel is going to win. It seems at this pointt mahmoud abbas looks like he's losing. If he stays irrelevant, this may be the beginning of the end of abbas. 

[00:13:00]


>> There's also a story this new egypt story for president morsy, clearly the forefront of brokering this deal. What is america's role now dealing with morsy in this is conversation of keeping the peace was israel and hamas? 
>> I think the united states has realized for a long time that it can't dictate to morsy and that there's going to have to be new u.S./Egyptian relationship. What's very unclear is how much we're going to be working with the egyptians, how much we're going to be working to try to limit a potentially negative egyptian role in regional fairs. I think morsy at this point is not sure where his presidency is going to go. Certainly a lot of people in washington who had been feeling reassured a couple of days ago woke up yesterday and said what is this about. This can't be good. 
>> Let's talk more about that because -- and I want to get back to what's happening at the border of gaza and israel. But you brought up what's going on in egypt. We got this statement from the spokesperson for the secretary, secretary clinton says what happened on the 22nd raised concerns. They're calling for calm. All parties should work together. An understated statement. This has to complicate the relationship between the state department and president morsy. 
>> Look, we've had a complicated relationship with egypt for a long time made less complicated by having an egyptian president who decided that the most important thing for egypt's foreign relations was the relationship with the united states. You now have an egyptian president who has decided he wants a more diverse set of relations in the world, in the region. He doesn't want to be subservient to the united states. What the americans find very dangerous that what morsy's done is taken away all the potential breaks on his power. He pushed the military out, the parliament's been resolved. Now he's been pushing out the judiciary. And there are no counter veiling forces in egyptian politics, and whether or not mohamed morsy wants to become a dictator, one of the signs of being a dictator, there are no counter veiling forces. You could say he's trying to do it because he wants to get through the constitution. He's doing it for good reasons, but I think if you're going to be serious about politics, you have to be successful politically convincing people not destroying other institutions that might stand in your way. 

[00:15:23]


>> Considering how aggressive the president and the state department were in the latter days of the arab spring as it relates to egypt specifically, are we expecting as muted responses as we move forward with what's happening now with morsy and these declarations and decrees? Will it stay these concerns and calls for calm? 
>> I think there's a reason that the state department is often measured when things initially happen and that's because things often turn out differently from the way people expect them. So I don't think they're being muted. I'm sure what they are saying privately is much sharper than what they're saying publicly, but there's also a sense that for people in the egyptian government, this is a life and death issue. This is what they do. Anton constantly come in and try to publicly criticize them, humiliate them, doesn't help you get what you need to go. I think the issue is, if you want a constructive relationship with the united states and i think egypt wants a constructive relationship this makes it harder. Egypt needs american capital. Egypt needs the united states to help persuade other countries and coordinate other countries ging money to egypt to help the economy, and these kinds of steps makes it harder for the united states to do that. I think mohamed morsy understands that. I think he's looking at the u.S. Reaction. And I think a measured but strong response is better than trying to shift the tides of history because I think ultimately, you can't shift tides but you can do a constructive set of steps that help people think more clearly about what they're doing. 
>> I know we're bouncing around a bit but I want to talk more about what's happening on the border with gaza and israel. This week, when the leader of hamas said that israel waved the white flag, he also said he was grateful to iran for their support. What is iran's role moving forward? 

[00:17:25]


>> Well, nobody really knows that. I think if you thought that you saw spin rooms after the presidential debates I think you're seeing much more high-powered spin rooms after this. Iran certainly was providing weapons and support to hamas. There are people in the middle east who have argued to me that when he acknowledged hamas, when he acknowledged iran, he was waving good-bye to iran, that there is an effort to bring hamas over to egypt, qatar to more moderate forces and not now hamas is going to try to mainstream itself. I don't know. I'm not sure he knows. He may be searching for a deal. He may be trying to send a message to the iranians. There certainly are I think two things that are important. One is that palestinian jihad was present in these negotiations in a way we haven't seen before. And fatah, the palestinian liberation organization, was not present, and that could shift -- could mean a real shift in the palestinian leadership. 
>> Very delicate times in egypt and this fragile cease fire that we're in the third day of now. Hopefully this continue and we'll continue the conversation. Jon alterman from the center for strategic and international studies. Thank you very much for joining us. We've got much more coming up.

Almost $30 billion in just new jersey alone. That's according to governor chris christie. He issued a preliminary damage assessment.

>> That would probably be the best guess. 
>> Reporter: The commander stresses it's unclear how many cases are linked to people with chronic conditions being worsened combined with the fact that access to their regular medication has been tough. Some of those questions are in the hands of the long beach medical center, which is taking over now that it's been able to set up a makeshift emergency room in its parking lot.

>>> A big gas explosion obliterated a strip club in massachusetts. You can see the blast in this video. It caused a massive fireball and jolted people ten miles away. Luckily some people smelled gas beforehand so everybody got out in time. Here's what the area looks liked to. 18 people were hurt in the aftermath. Most of them were firefighters who were called into the scene and gas company workers who were trying to cut off utilities. But the explosion scared many people in springfield, even those on the other side of town. 
>> I jumped. I could feel the garbage cans move next to me. I could heart windows shaking. Automatically I knew where it came from. I could tell it came from this part of the city. 
>> Explosion damaged about two dozen other buildings nearby. Investigators are still trying to figure out how this happened. 
>>> An alabama sheriff's deputy was shot and killed responding to a family dispute. Scott ward was a 15-year veteran of the baldwin county sheriff's office. Another deputy was hurt. It's believed that this man, michael janzen, pulled a gun and started shooting. He was also killed. 
>> Everybody's pretty tore up. It's a difficult situation. And the sheriff's office in some respects is a large agency, the largest law enforcement agency in baldwin county. We're still small enough that everybody's very close. I had personally worked with this deputy a majority of my career. I knew him very well. 
>> Wkrg reports the wounded deputy is in critical condition. A third deputy was with them but was not hurt at the shootout. 
>>> Walmart is calling its black friday events the best ever. The retailing giant says the crowds were larger than last year and scenes like this seemed to back that up. This battle for what appears to be video game consoles was in tucson, arizona. Walmart stores across the country open at 8:00 on thursday night. In the first four hours the company says its cash registers were ringing up 5,000 items every second. Walmart was also targeted by protesters. They say the company needs to give workers better pay and benefits. At least some walmart employees took part in the demonstrations. 

[00:04:35]


>> They say do this, do that, none of it works. This is the only way we can get our voice out there is speaking with the media, speaking to the public. 
>> Just a matter that they have to do things right for the employees. That's all. 
>> If doing things right for the employees means you have to pay more for your tv what do you think about that? 
>> That's something else, you know? When your pay is low and everything you charge up high, that's something that's not going to work. But that's a country problem. 
>> Nine demonstrators were arrested in california for failing to disperse. Union backed organizers claim thousands of supporters showed up in 100 cities, but walmart says it knew of only a few dozen protests. The company called them a made for tv event. 
>>> All this fuss over some yoga pants. Women were screaming at a victoria's secret in kansas just after midnight on thanksgiving. Nearly 100 people showed up for the deal. There were no major incidents, though. For those pants were on sale for $12.95. Normally they go for about 50 bucks. 
>>> A stash of cash that ended up at a goodwill by mistake is back with its owner. A store in st. Louis found more than $14,000 in a donation bin. The manager wanted to return it, but 15 different people said it was theirs. So goodwill let a judge decide. 
>> Not only am I delighted that there was resolution, but I'm delighted with the resolution. Because clearly from everything we can tell, this lady whose parents had hidden the money deserved that money. 
>> The money went to a woman who had hired a company to sell her parents' things. She said that her mom had a history of hiding cash. 
>>> Super storm sandy could hurt new york well into the holiday season. That's because the city could lose a lot of tourism dollars. The statue of liberty is closed and some museums are still cleaning up after the storm. 

[00:06:36]


>> I don't think that the impact on tourism will be felt only in lower manhattan. We have some museums and attractions that are not yet open and some that are partially open. So I think we'll have to see. We had almost 10 million last year as you know. And I'm hoping they will still come to see what is here. 
>> We knew that the statue of liberty would be closed. But that obviously didn't deter us from coming out here. 
>> New jersey, on the other hand, is more worried if the shores will be ready for tourists this summer. 
>>> A big weekend for college football rivalries, tom. You know that. There's some important matches across the country. What kind of weather can fans expect? 
>> Depends on where they're playing. Most cases cooler than normal temperatures. We had some games in snow, some games yesterday wind chill in the teens. You can see it's rivalry weekend. Notice the rain oregon and oregon state. Other places, too, rutgers at pittsburgh, south carolina at clemson, georgia tech at georgia, florida-florida state. There are a number of games. But it looks like the best is number one notre dame. Usc 70-degree weather and sunshine. That's after the morning fog starts to burn off. Here's our look across the country. What we can expect, you can see a little rainfall the rain for the oregon game. Pacific northwest there is some snowfall. Parts of idaho, wyoming, montana, too. We've got some advisories and watches in effect there. The rainfall continues, not so much in the seattle area but another cold front again with blustery conditions move in. The wind's picking up. We still have lake effect snows. We won't seat high totals that we had in minnesota, wisconsin and michigan. But I wouldn't be surprised to see a 7 to 9 inch total in some areas. Advisories for the lake effects snow. That's accompanieded with winds, too. We're right into winter it seems like after a very mild thanksgiving day. As far as travel is concerned if you're waiting for tomorrow some of the best conditions many areas of course in the cold. First hard freeze across the deep south. High pressure in the middle of the country. This is the cold front that brought in the winds of change. We've got another one on the way that will be dropping in from the north. In fact with this one we're looking at temperatures to be even cooler. The wind kicking up. I don't think this one's going to make it all the way across the u.S. Really no severe weather anywhere in the country right now, natasha, very good news. Just a little cold and blustery. 

[00:09:02]


>> I guess that's still shopping weather if you bundle up. Just hard with all the bags to peel layers off. So much to carry. Thank you, tom. 
>> Sure. 
>>> A new book gives us a glimpse of jfk's presidency through unforgettable pictures. Best-selling author kitty kelly joins me to discuss her new book. 

[00:12:10]


>>> A groom to be in south carolina is about to get a new kidney from his fiancee's best friend. Andy is just 27 and didn't think he had health problems. He found out his kidneys are failing. He would have to wait two years for a donor kidney. He started looking for live donors. His fiancee's bff was the first to offer. Turns out she's a perfect match. 
>> This gives me a chance to live a more normal and healthier life because someone is being so selfless in giving up a vital or organ like a kidney. 
>> They love each other so much. It's a great example of a relationship. You're like why them. But I think that god gives the biggest burdens to the people who can carry the weight. 
>> Allison and andy's fiancee brittany have been friend since their freshman college year. 
>>> John f. Kennedy's presidency is known as the camelot years. Many people are fascinated by the kennedy's families triumphs and tragedies. Some of those memorable moments are in kitty kelly's new book "capturing camelot." Kitty joins me now. You have a funny story about how you got ahold of all these pictures. Tell us about that. 
>> The photographer, stanley treddick is the photographer who took that iconic picture of john john under his father's desk, which is probably -- probably the best-known picture ever taken in the oval office. Stanley was a very good friend of mine. And I took care of him in the last years of his life when he had a stroke. And he left me all of these pictures. I used to visit him at his house. And I'd say, he had this marine corps locker that he used as a coffee table. I said,stanle what do you have in there? And he'd look at me and wink and say, nude photos. And after he died, the trunk was delivered to the house. And my husband said, what's in there? And I said, nude photos. He said, open the trunk. I said no, I don't want to remember stanley that way. So we opened the trunk, and instead of nude foe photos it was the most sentimental, precious collection of letters from the president, notes from jackie, a tea towel, inscribed pictures, diary excerpts, memos from stanley to his editor talking about how he got these exclusive pictures. So because it had been a gift to me, I did nothing to earn it. I decided to give it back. And I am doing that with this book. And all profits and proceeds will go to the public libraries in washington, d.C. 

[00:14:53]


>> Jackie kennedy was particularly protective of her children. What made her give stanley access to the family, especially of the kids? 
>> Well, she didn't really give access in the beginning. In fact, that famous exclusive four days that stanley got with the president and his son, he got that only when jackie left the country. She was very protective of the children. She refused to have them exploited in any way. So stanley frequently worked at cross purposes one time to get pictures. He was at hyannisport photographing the shrivers and he sent caroline into the compound with a little brownie camera. He said, now you want to learn how to take pictures. You take pictures of your mommy, of your daddy and your little brother and then you bring them back to me. found out, he nearly removed stanley's white house press credentials. But in the end -- 
>> it all worked out, didn't it? Some compelling photographs you share in this book, kitty. 
>> Jackie said to stanley that she was so happy that he and the president had gone against her wishes. She said this to him after the assassination. Because she

>>> you know that hit song "gangnam style" check out this holiday lights display in texas. ?????? Gangnam style ?????? 
>> john storm decked out his house with thousands of lights. He did a great job syncing them up to the song. 
>>> Now, being a teen isn't always especially easy especially for kids with certain challenges. But one young woman is using her love of theater to give I all kids a chance to shine. Here's today's break through woman. 
>> These kids are members of unified theater, a performing arts nonprofit that brings students with and without disabilities together. 
>> Are you guys ready? 
>> Michaela conry started the organization as a club in her high school in connecticut. She was inspired by her cousin kelsey born with multiple disabilities. 
>> I remember getting to high school and saw no kids with disabilities in my classroom. So in unified theater we pull in all kids from every walk of life and we give them a place to belong where they're going to be both empowered and supported. 
>> I can always act with a specific talent. 
>> More than a decade later the unified acting program is offered in more than 40 schools across the country. Michaela trains students to carry her vision back to their schools.

>> What happened to stepha stepha? 
>> There are pockets of wild areas. Those are areas that if someone were to get in the middle of no one might find anything in there for months. 
>> I recall when I first learned that 22-year-old stepha henry had gone missing. And what disturbed me immediately is that the stories we were told did not jive. And when that happens it bodes ill. And stepha was a brilliant young girl. And as I said was 22, had just graduated from john jay college in new york, and had traveled down to the miami area to be with her sister for her sister's birthday. It's kind of a celebration, it was a holiday. And she had a monday off. She was going to use that to be with her sister. She was excited because she had just gotten out of school. She was planning to go forward to law school. And had such a bright future ahead of her. 
>> It's very hard knowing that stepha is not around. Getting up that's the first thing I do, think about her. 
>> Stepha henry a beautiful 22-year-old recent graduate of college, graduating with honors. She wanted to go on to law school. She wanted to either be an immigration lawyer or perhaps a criminal lawyer. Really a bright young girl, had her entire life ahead of her. And then she disappears. 

[01:02:22]


>> She was very responsible. She's honest. She has her goal sets in mind. She has everything in order. She does her thing the way that you would expect a young lady to do it. She has fun, and she also does her school work and she also works diligently at the president's intern office in john jay college. 
>> Stepha henry went down to miami for memorial day weekend. It was her younger 16-year-old sister's birthday. And they planned to go down to miami, which stepha did almost every year would go down there to spend the memorial day weekend with friend and family that lived there. So she took her sister this time. They were going to do a bunch of just sort of girl stuff. They were going to get manicures, they were going to go shopping. They went to a couple of concerts together. And they also spent a lot of time with stepha's best friend who lived down in the miami area. Now, stepha had just graduated from john jay college. She'd majored in criminal justice. And she was studying for the lsat. She planned to take the entrance exam for law school, pursue her career as either a criminal attorney or perhaps an immigration lawyer. So that's what was ahead of her when she went down to miami for what she thought was going to be a fun weekend with her younger sister. 
>> At a homemade shrine on the dining room table. 
>> I look to the mountains. Where will my help come from my help will come from the lord. 
>> Her parents are praying police will find their daughter alive. 22-year-old stepha is still missing after vanishing nearly three weeks ago. 
>> I think she's being held against her will. That's what I think it is. 
>> Why do you think that, mr. Henry? 
>> Because stepha would never go off on her own like that. Never. 
>> Stepha henry was in florida because her sister had just turned 16. And it was a celebration time. And stepha normally had gone to florida during memorial day weekend time, but this time it was extra special because she and her sister went together, celebrating her sister's birthday. And they were involved in memorial day activities. Barbecues and just fun times with her family members that lived down there. Shortly before she disappeared. 

[01:04:41]


>> Stepha went down there to see her best friend who had been her friend since high school. They'd stayed in contact even though the friend moved down to miami. All through college stepha had stayed in touch with her friend tamara. They got to know each other's families. One of the people stepha met through her friend was her friend's brother-in-law who played a willing role in her disappearance. She was down there to have some fun with her sister and visit family an friend down in miami. 
>> The honors grad from john jay college of criminal justice in new york, who worked as an alum in the president's office, was in florida with her teenage sister for memorial day weekend. Police say henry left her aunt's apartment very late at night, told her she was going to a nightclub. Her aunt saw her niece get into a car with a family acquaintance. And that's the last time she saw her. May 29th was a day that should have had a lot of joy and fun for stepha henry, but it was the last full day that people spoke with her and even saw her alive. She started out the day by going to a barbecue. And this was a barbecue of a very close friend of hers who had moved down to florida and this very close friend had a sister who was hosting the barbecue. Now, the sister happened to be a newlywed. She was married. She was marry today a man by the name of kendrick williams. But the day turned out just very simply and joyously as memorial day barbecue. Stepha henry did go to a nightclub's private party. Luckily the owners were shooting a promotional video. Here's henry in a freeze frame released by police. But what about the friend who took her there? 
>> He said that he left the club early, that when he left the club she was still there and with some other people that he did not know. 
>> To this day, she's never been found, alive or dead. But this is what we know about the night she goes missing. She was down in florida, as i mentioned, to see her sister. She was staying with an aunt. And when the aunt got up that morning she realized stepha had not come home. She did the right thing. She immediately called police. She called police and she called stepha's parents, who immediately hopped on a plane and came straight to florida to start looking for their daughter and publicizing her disappearance. And it was in those hours the night before began to unravel. You know, I used to tell juries nothing good happens after midnight. And I still stick by those words. Stepha had gone to a party, was supposed to go to a party. Get together with friends. She left the party, according to several witnesses, with 37-year-old married man kendrick williams. 

[01:07:54]


>> Police say he also told them he drove henry to the club that night in a borrowed late model accura integra. 
>> Now, he tells his wife he went to the party, a party, but he didn't like the vibe. Those are his words, not mine. The vibe at the party. So he left and went to a strip club. Now let's just analyze that. You don't like the bad vibe at a party so you go to some sleazy strip club? All right. Right there I've got a problem with his story. But that's what he says happens. Here's the kicker to kendrick williams' story. He's photoed in a promotional shot outside a bar later that evening with stepha henry. He says that's not true. But there's photographic evidence. 

[01:14:01]


>>> Now, police wisely tried to obtain video surveillance. Our reports are that they did not get video surveillance at the bar. But we do have that promotional shot for the bar taken outside the bar at the bar that night after they've been at the party earlier. And here they are at the bar. So we know this married man was with her, and that he lied to his wife about it. What else do we know? We know that he had a business of sorts where he would buy vehicles, cars, in the new york area, then bring them to florida to fix them up, soup them up, clean them up and resell them at a profit. We know that at some point the car he was driving ends up with, when it was processed, stepha's blood anytime. And according to our reports, the blood was of such an amount that police are convinced that 22-year-old stepha is dead. He's never cracked. He's never changed his story. But we've got her blood in his car. We've got a promo shot of him with her in front of this bar in the miami area the night she goes missing. But where is stepha? 
>> Police suspect henry last used her phone to check her voice mail around the time the club closed. 
>> Stepha, we love you. And everyone else loves you. And we would love to see row home. 
>> Henry was planning on law school next year, and loves legal mysteries. 
>> He will protect you as you come and go now and forever. Amen. 

[01:16:03]


>> Law enforcement was very much centered on this car, this dark-colored accura that stepha was seen getting into with a man that night going to the nightclub. 
>> God bless you and be blessed in the lord. 
>> They prayed for stepha henry today and they comforted her @@,;8????0y0y3??o????????y@, OF A VERY GOOD Girlfriend of stepha henry. 
>> Nobody who knows her thinks she would just walk away from a life that seemed so promise. 
>> She's one who you can always depend on. She dependable. She would take charge of the other. 
>> She's like my mom to me. We do everything together. She helps me with my homework, social life, academic life, everything. She cooks for me when I'm hungry, everything. 
>> There was an extensive search for stepha henry. In fact, her mother, when the mom came down she left her job at a bank. And had spent five straight months in florida looking. She finally had to take leave from her job so she could do media interviews, radio interviews, handing out fliers. The whole family, not just the mom. Waterways were searched. Wooded areas were searched. Ravines were searched. Volunteers searched. It went on and on and on. It was really about a year, maybe over a year, before his car, an accura was finally found. Interesting when kendrick williams' accura was finally found, another woman had just bought it. Not from him. I don't know how many hands the car had gone through by the time she bought it. But over a year after stepha goes missing police finally track down the car. Probably one of the reasons they didn't find it is because it wasn't abandoned in the airport parking lot, begging somebody to steal it. It wasn't burned up. It wasn't left on the side of the road or in a wooded area or down a gulch. It had actually gone through several hands. And a woman thought she had rightfully bought the car. So here it is parked probably in somebody's driveway. Police wouldn't think to look there. But they did in fact find the car. And miraculously, it still had stepha's blood in it. Of course, that will be a nightmare at trial to show the chain of custody in the car. But the reality is, stepha henry's blood was still in kendrick williams' accura over a year later. sis, it's so great to see you. You, too! Oh, cloudy glasses. You didn't have to come over!

>>> What a precious, precious beautiful black angel she was. 
>> And then the phone rings, every time the door opens I'm thinking it's someone coming to say that someone brought her home. 
>> With her school education, even her job, she's very persistent. She would never give up faith, she would never give up hope. 
>> If she goes to the club at night, by then, anytime she's ready to come home she would usually call me. When she's in new york she would call me and let me know I'm leaving now. 
>> Even sometimes she was knocked down, she would just raise right back up. 
>> She never disappears. She always keeps in touch with us when she's outside. She always calls. She loves to pick up her cell phone and call me and let me know if she has any problems. When police first find the car, you can find it by the vin, the vin number. Every car has one. To the naked eye, to the casual observer you couldn't see the blood. The car in fact looked like it had been through a professional cleanup job. But police didn't stop there. They ripped up underneath the floor board. They pulled off the seat covers. And there was such a profuse amount of blood that was invisible to the naked eye. But once you put down the floor board and the carpet, you don't see what's under the carpet. You don't see what has drenched qND TRICKLED AND DRIPPED THROUGH The carpet, the floor board carpet of that accura. You don't see the blood that has soaked back behind the seat cover. Sure, you can sanitize the seat cover and you can wash the carpet. But you can't see the blood that has dripped and pooled underneath the carpet and behind the seat cover.

>> This investigation now involves dozens of officers from miami-dade county and areas north, detectives from the aviation and homicide units canvassing a several hundred square-mile slice of south florida. 
>> This I any parent's nightmare. 
>> Stepha's family, once they got word that she was missing, immediately came down to florida and searched for her. They put posters up, got the word out, did interviews with the media, speaking to anyone to keep story alive, to keep the search alive for their daughter stepha. As a matter of fact, her mom was there for five months, took a leave of absence from her job at a bank, just to search in some hopes of trying to find stepha. 
>> We have a tremendous amount of water in southern florida. So we're checking the canals, the lakes and those sorts of things. 
>> If it gets late if she was shopping she would call and say mom I'm coming home now. She knows I'm very worried. 
>> In fact, the police were so meticulous, they have reason to believe that 22-year-old stepha henry was stabbed in the upper torso. Because the blood trail starts in the upper third of the passenger car seat in that accura. In kendrick williams' accura. So she apparently stabbed either in the front or the back or somewhere in her upper torso up to the top of her head and is sitting back and the blood starts flowing behind the car seat and down. So they believe, with good reason, the girl was stabbed in the upper torso. And there was a massive amount of blood, stepha's blood, that then pooled, soaking through the carpet on the floor board and pooling beneath the carpet. 

[01:30:13]


>>> A male friend picked stepha up from her aunt's house around 1:00 on may 29th and drove her here to this club in ft. Lauderdale. Once here he told investigators they went their separate ways.

An arrest warrant was obtained charging mr. Williams with second degree murder and tampering with evidence. 

[01:32:50]


>> We're pleading with you all to please send our daughter back home. Because we love her. And everyone else who is listening, please, you see anything, please call the police. 
>> While we feel that this is a piece of the puzzle that we'd like to take a look at, we did speak with the acquaintance that took her to the club. He told us that he left her there and that she stayed late. We don't know at what time she left. We don't know who she left with. 
>> Have you spoken to the friends that she was with in the club? 
>> We have spoken to several people at the club. Again there were a lot of people. This was a promotional party. This isn't a club that they were having a regular night where the regulars might be there. There were people there for this specific party. So we're asking people that did attend this party to please give us a call. They might have some information that may not seem important to them but would be important for our case. 
>> He denies ever having spent time with her at all. But then there is the promotional video shot, the photo. The promotional video taken at the bar the night she goes missing. And they're standing there together. And he goes, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I did meet her but I never spent any time with her. I really didn't get to know her. Everything he said to police he lied about. And his lies were very easily detected. 
>> Sir, a warrant was issued for your arrest for the charge of second degree murder and tampering with physical evidence. The bond amount established in the warrant issued by the judge is no bond. So you will be held no bond on these charges, sir, do you understand? 
>> Now, we all know that in many jurisdictions judges, trial judges, do not give jury instructions on flight. Flight is when a suspect or a person of interest takes off, when police are pursuing them or after a crime. In this case, kendrick wiloiams was in the miami area when he met stepha and everything went wrong. He was ultimately found in new york, living in his car, surrounded by blankets, clothing, and body lotion. Yeah, I don't know what that means. But that's how he was found. Prosecutors, if this ever goes to trial, would argue that this was flight. Why would you leave your wife at home in florida and go live in your car in the new york area surrounded by blankets, clothing and body lotion? I would argue that that was flight. Now, maybe the defense is going to argue he wanted to live in his car. I don't think a jury's going to believe that. 

[01:40:28]


>>> I just want to say to the public that if anyone was at the club on that night, that pepper's club on may 29, 2007, and saw stepha henry and saw anything, any clue that would help the detectives to close this case, please call crime stoppers. 
>> At this hour, as we go to air, kendrick williams is sitting behind bars waiting for trial. Believe it or not he's never been tried. But before you point the finger at the prosecution, they're still hoping to find stepha's body. He's currently charged with second degree murder and tampering with evidence that likely be the cleanup of the car. Why second degree? Not first degree? Malice murder? We really don't know how stepha henry died. If we could find her body, maybe there could be a prosecution for murder one. Now he absolutely has a right to a speedy trial under our constitution. 
>> Stepha's family does still hope that she'll be found alive. They know about the blood in the car. Though know that authorities have said they don't think that stepha could have survived whatever injuries caused that blood loss in the car. But they've said it's our daughter. They're not going to give up hope. They would still love for her to be found alive somewhere. So they haven't given up. 
>> This began with a trip to the miami area for a concert with her younger sister to celebrate her younger sister's birthday. The family is from brooklyn, new york. They traveled to miami. They were staying with relatives. They went to the concert. Stepha decides she's going to go to a nightclub at night. She he's the little sister with the relatives. Shoe gets into the car with the acquaintance. This is the black accura in question or dark-colored accura in question. She goes to the club, she's photographed inside the club which is closer to ft. Lauderdale. And the person who drove her there went home early and never saw her again. And no one else heard from her, either. 

[01:42:49]


>> Prosecutors intend to go forward in this case, even though they have not found a body. They found the car. And they found massive amounts of her blood. So that is the body in this case. They can prouecute without a body. They don't need a body. And they've got the link because this was the car that not only picked up stepha the last time she was known to be alive, but this is the car that was owned by kendrick williams. 
>> Detective williams, the photo that was taken of her at the club, pepper's that night, why was that photo taken? What is that? 
>> That photo there is a photo from promotional video the club was doing. We pulled that from it to find her there at the club. 
>> That was good police work, detective. Do we have any idea what time? Was it time stamped that photo? 
>> No. The time was not stamped on that photo. Contrary to popular belief, people are saying it was a surveillance video. But no, it is a promotional video and there was no time stamp on it. 
>> Did she meet friends there at pepper's? 
>> The acquaintance or the person that took her to the club in that dark-colored accura is telling us that he left her there at a certain time but he left her there with other people that she knew that he did not know. 
>> Okay. So if she was meeting friends there, didn't they see her leave? 
>> Like I said, he's given us that account and we're still interviewing. Still interviewing numerous people, patrons and also employees at that club. 
>> Kendrick williams' trial has been delayed several times throughout the years. It's been almost four years. It will be almost four years from his arrest until he finally goes to trial in january of 2013. There's been a number of delays, both requested by the state and by defense. But kendrick williams should face charges in the early part of 2013. 
>> Mrs. Henry, you have actually gone out on the street yourself trying to get leads and find your daughter. What have you been doing? 

[01:44:54]


>> I have been going around giving out fliers to people and talking to people who might have seen her on the night. Some said they saw her, some said they don't think so. And I'm just still there searching and looking around and trying to find out any information I get at all on my daughter. 
>> Mrs. Henry, where all have you been? 
>> I've been to different malls in the miami malls. I went to the hotels and hotels on biscayne boulevard. I've been tper's more than once. I was there at a party on saturday night giving out fliers in the parking lot. I went to different parties that they have all over in miami here and give out fliers to the people who are going to the party, especially the young folks. And I'm giving it out in public and different areas I go to outside. 
>> Won't you help us tonight? Here is a mother out on the streets handing out fliers trying to find her girl. This is a good girl, an honor student, wanting to go to law school, her whole life ahead of her. One night, one night she goes to a concert at a local bar restaurant there in miami and is never seen again. The last clue that we have around 4:00 a.M. That morning, 4:13 to be exact, someone, maybe her, checked her own voice mail on her cell phone. 
>> Stepha henry's body has never been recovered, yet prosecutors are going forward with second degree murder charges here. And they're going to rely upon the forensic evidence, specifically the blood that was found inside that accura. Trial for kendrick williams is NOW SET FOR JANUARY 7th, 2013. Kendrick williams was arrested in january of 2008 and charged with the second degree murder of stepha henry. He's currently incarcerated on no bond waiting for his trial. 

[01:47:01]


>> There's so much that we know that a jury will never know. Under our constitution, a jury cannot know about a defendant's previous criminal history unless it is introduced as, for instance, a similar transaction to prove the case in chief. But what we know is that kendrick williams had a very long history of domestic violence, even when his wife had a restraining order. She says he would break into the home. She believes he slashed the tires of her sister's vehicle. And we know that there are many allegations of violence on the mother of his children. Now, does this prove he's a murderer? No. But when you don't know a horse, look at his track record. 
>> I just laugh at something she might have said, or simple things that she used to do on her way home after work. I still remember on sometimes that brings a smile to my face. Other times a tear. 
>> I got into it pretty young. By the time I was 15 I was using pretty serious drugs. When I got sober, I lost my group of friends because they were still out drinking and using. I got into boxing, triathalon, climbing. I had this new group of friends that had completely redefined myself. So I thought how can I give this to other people. I'm scott strode. I want to help people find a better life being sober. 
>> Welcome to friday night climbing. That's good to see all you here. 
>> We offer about 50 events a week. All the programs are free to anybody that has 48 hours sober. 

[01:49:03]


>> Look good, zach. 
>> You can see that you're capable of whatever you put your mind. To we have this common connection. So it's easy to make new friends. We do bike rides, hiking, triathalon training, strength training. It really is just a new community of folks to hang out with. I'm an example of hitting rock bottom. I had a heroin overdose. They had to jumpstart me with the paddles. 
>> Roll it over. Drill it in there. 
>> Going out boxing, biking, hitting the bag really fills the void. It's the best sport I could imagine having. 
>> We're having fun and we're proud of being sober. So come out and go climbing with us. Stepping on, it doesn't matter, he's doing the right thing, as my colleague said and more republicans should follow suit. Democrats have to be willing to give up some of the things have friction on our side. 
>> You talk about sacred cows. Should that be on the table in the fiscal cliff negotiations? Will it be? 
>> I think the president would be open to that. The idea where which he would rewrite the whole program. Clearly they have tried to litigate this and the american people agree. It's very clear that the american people agree however t. I think the president would be open to that. 

[01:51:08]


>> Another burning between governor would that be like a pay-per-view boxing spectacular? 
>> It could have been. 
>> Wait, you're already talking about it in the past. 
>> I really think that cory booker has lost an opportunity right now better sandy, governor christie had a edge on him. If cory booker in essence has lost his window, not out there fund-raising, he had a horrible plowup at city council where cops ended it with pepper spray, so I think he's in a bad position. Remember george h. Bush the father was high in the polls. 
>> H.W., Yeah.

It's time to savor. from Is bigger than we think ... like the flu. With aches, fever and chills- the flu's a really big deal. So why treat it like it's a little cold?

>> All this and more on "wild about animals." Harassed stand up to 20 feet tall. They are majestic and beautiful creatures moving in almost slow- motion. There is one giraffe at the topee kazoo that stands apart from the rest. Just 65 miles west of kansas city, it is the topeka zoo. Thousands of people come to the zoo and like many zoos they have a particular animal that stands out. In the case of the topeka zoo, the animal that draws the most attention is the giraffe called hope. When pope was born three years ago, people did not think she would live. Her condition was so bad it required an entire team to help her survive. Hope received a second chance at life that -- thanks to the effort of the zoo's staff. The staff receive just as much from hope. 

[00:02:01]


[Inaudible] 
>> it was a crazy birth. She gave birth in the middle of the afternoon which is not typical. Her back legs or bent up in the forward position. In a sense, it would be like if you are tried to walk on your breast. 
>> Win giraffes are born, they will cry and stand. Wild animals must be able to do this, otherwise they become prey. With hope, something was not right. Fortunately, she was not born in the wild because her leg looked like a vest. As a condition known as hyper extended. It was serious. They call the doctor to the same to analyze the condition. 
>> There were able to distract the mothers like to briefly go in and look at the baby and manipulate the feet into a different position. 
>> This is not something that dr. Season I daily basis. He did a comparative study. He compared this condition with cases from similar animals. 
>> What the main parts of veterinarian school, these types of abnormalities occur frequently in horses. I had to take what was done with forces and figure out how to get it on a cloven hoof avenue that has two two's instead of one. >>Hope's legs were straightened ancaster remain in the correct position -- and cast. The cats were removed for the first time to check on her progress the casts were removed for the first time and they were working. 
>> We had zero complications. 
>> The casts were reapplied to hope's legs. That would have to be changed and 5-10 day intervals over the next three months and each time a virtual army of people were there to hold her down. 

[00:04:14]


>> Everybody had a position and their parts of it became very proficient to do these procedures. Everybody knew what they had to do. 
>> The doctor attached extended heel shoes he had made. Giraffes feet are different from a horse. You could not mail them on. Since they could not be nailed on, the doctor decided it would be best. The staff on the together to save this animal's life. As the lakers stronger, but calf got stronger and such -- got smaller they were able to reboot the shoes completely and hope started to walk normally. When visitors stop by the enclosure, vacancy hope galloping around. They can see hope galloping around. 
>> In the middle of july, along comes a little giraffe that when she was born, we thought there was no chance she was going to make it. 
>> Hope got her name from which she brought to the community, the zoo, and this step. 
>> If you can have hope, you never have to underestimate what you can achieve. Half combined passion with the motion and the animals' best interest in art, amazing things happen. 
>> Coming up, when profits are raised in cages or by humans and they become dangerous in de. 
>> If you love wild life and love them where they are, you need to help them survive there so they can live their life naturally. ptpvN??@g@g<r ???? ?? >> IN ANY ZOO OR PRESERVE Or sanctuary, the goal is to create an environment as close as possible to the animal's natural habitat. It is present at the born free primate sanctuary, that is put into practice. 

[00:08:12]


>> Tai was raised from a tiny infant, stolen from his mother and stolen -- and raised. He started to attack. 
>> The born free u.S. Primate sanctuary, he has seen this since that story before. 
>> They are absolutely cutest little bundles you could imagine. They are touching your face and they are very affectionate. They are taken home and raised. 
>> The problem is that monkeys are not human and as they grow, they become bigger and stronger and harder to manage. 
>> They start becoming more aggressive. Typically, they start attacking spouses and you put them back in a cage and they go crazy. 
>> The born free sanctuary was founded to provide monkeys with a say preserved or they could live out their lives as freely and naturally as possible. It was started in 1972 as a refuge for a troop of displaced japanese snow monkeys. Now they have more than 500 primates. Many were rescued from harsh and abusive situations where they were kept in small prison-like cages like alice pierre. >>It is a hard life for a monkey inside of a small confined area. Alice was kept in substandard conditions and being a case from the time she was an infant and unable to move about, she literally went crazy in the cage. 
>> She was raised by humans, she is too dangerous to be around the many more. 
>> She is extremely aggressive with people. She is not afraid of us either. If she were in direct contact with a person, she would hurt them badly about alice cannot be too close to her own kind either. Mondays are social animals live in troops. Raised by humans, she has never learned. 

[00:10:17]


>> All the facial expressions and the proper social etiquette they learn, there is a social hierarchy involved and she does not know any of the language. They recognize instantly something is wrong. We are able to improve the quality and conditions of her life but we were never able to totally fix the problem. We cannot undo the damage. 
>> For a two-year old snow monkey, the future is brighter. He is young enough to learn how to be a monkey again. He can pick up some of the social skills he is lacking. He still has a chance to become a member of the troupe. Tai has been placed in an enclosure where there's plenty of light -- room to play and observe the behavior of the monkeys next door. He is learning grooming. For premise, grooming is an important social activity. Monkeys spend hours each day cleaning each other. It is not just about good hygiene. Grooming helps members of the troop bond with each other and reinforces the all-important social hierarchy of the troupe. 
>> He gets to be around much consider interacting on a normal basis every day. He is learning and learning and absorbing and he now groans some of these monkeys through the fence. 
>> When he's ready, you will be integrated into one of the sanctuary's troops, free to be a monkey at last. With acres of land to rome. 
>> There is no good reason to have a monkey isolated. It is not good for the individual animal or the owner. If the love wildlife in to help them survive in the wild so they can live their life naturally 
>>> when we return, see have local shoe company came to the rescue of a local bank and. 

[00:12:20]


>> We were aware that this would make life possible. What happens when there is a crisis at the santa barbara is there? 

[00:14:47]


>> Just a few minutes from the beautiful california coast, the santa barbara zoo. All the animals enjoy the california climate especially the humboldt these pigments hail from south america and to enjoy basking in the sun. This is penguins live together like the wood in the wild. One penguin could not invention. When lucky was born at the zoo, there did not seem to be any problems. When he was taken to the pool for his first swim, they noticed something was off. His foot was not developing properly. When he was two months old, he got a sore on the bottom of his foot that became infected. This was a direct result from walking on this flood. The infection went into his joints and it was serious. The infection would have made it so he might need a leg amputation. There is no record of a penguin in the wild that survived with one leg. To find a solution, the infection was threatening his life. Something was needed to protect his foot and fast. Rachel, the curator of birds at the zoo, decided to contact a well-known shoe company in santa barbara. The vice president of business development at teva met with rachel to find a solution to the problem. 
>> We first saw him, the first thing we think about is what can we do to correct a vest. 
>> Teva designed boot for lucky to wear when he was not in the water. 
>> He was putting all his weight on that. He said this is not the right product theme he was an important participant in the creation of his boot even though he did not speak the language. He could still communicate how he felt. Although the bush was clearly uncomfortable, teva believed they were on the right track. They were determined to design a more comfortable boot. 

[00:17:14]


>> Were determined to get it right because we make products that make life better. It quickly became apparent that this product was going to make life possible. One of the most important features about this adventure with lucky is that we had to make this rounded heal. He will hit and roll forward as he is walking rather than clumping or dragging his foot. He is not going to pick it up like you or I would. The shape is very important to making this boot function correctly for lucky. 
>> After the final the additions were made, something magical happened. Lucky tried his boots on and he took off running. Thanks to teva and of the new boot, lucky was able to join the other penguins at the zoo. 
>> He has been integrating were really well. Wh he gets in the water, he is like any other bird. He is starting to mate with one of our female birds that was single and he gets in there at mating time. He is living as close to normal as you can possibly imagine even though his foot did not feel correctly. 
>> When I think of lucky, i think of rudolph the red nosed reindeer. He was able to go out and play penguin games because of this boot. That is what everybody at teva wanted, to give him a normal life. 
>> After the break, would you rescue a dog you knew would -- was about to die? 
>> With a one enamel to die alone. 
-- We don't want an animal to die alone. 

[00:20:42]


>> An animal shelter is not the ideal place for an animal to live. By necessity, these creatures live in cages which can be depressing, and demoralizing. One couple in pennsylvania decided to do something about this, taking in a shelter animal near the end of its life. Every day, abandoned dogs at animal shelters like this one, life in a cage is awful. Believe they will be adopted but that -- if the dog is old or suffering a terminal illness, the chances of landing in a loving home is almost nonexistent. Doug and christine williams represent a ray of hope for the most hopeless abandoned dogs. For the last eight years, they have adopted old and terminally ill dogs. You might say it is their mission in life. 
>> We know what the animals to l like it is love and had somewhere to live. 
>> No animal should be left to die in a cage all alone and sad and suffering. 
>> Hi, we wanted to let you know that doug and I were on our way. We want to pick up our new puppy. 
>> This is a newfoundland estimated to be -- he came in as a stray. He had a tumor and it was staged to cancer so he is harder to place. Luckily, we found a nice couple that was willing to take on that responsibility >> the williams already own four daughters but they feel they have room for one more. Today, there are coming to adopt wilma. 

[00:22:56]


>> Most of your dogs that have severe or terminal problems tose people are afraid of it. I thank it is the emotional attachment that they know they will have. 
>> It is estimated that will not -- wilma has only six months to live. This does not seem to matter to the williams who are excited to greet their new dog. It could not have ended any better for wilma. I am in and are willing to adopt her. We need more people like them, for we're almost home, wilma. 
>> At journey quite a bit ride, wilma has found a home. 
>> There you go. 
>> Besides wilma, the williams have three german shepherds and a loss of so. 
-- Lhasa apso. The german shepherds are kept outside for now. 
>> Why don't you go sit with money in the living room? 
-- With money in the living room? 
>> One by one, the german shepherds are brought into check out their new house mate. 
>> You know who that is. 
>> Sniffing is where they check things out. Her, they can tell she is sick. Also because she was at the pound, they have all been there and they know what it smells like. 

[00:25:07]


>> It is not easy taking care of six elderly dogs. The williams find it rewarding. 
>> Older and suffering, they would have died in a cage alone and frightened. That makes us feel like maybe the world is a little better place for what we are trying to do. e prevalence of food allergies is on the rise Especially among children. 
[Ambulance Sirens] In fact, food allergies result in more than 300-thousand Ambulatory care visits each year for kids under 18.

Well, it's not only the secret to a happy life, it's critical to your health, and like everybody pillows, got migraines in the morning from sleeping on poor pillows and what it is, what I found in my studies over the last seven years is the 

[00:02:01]


cervical nerves on each side of your neck need to be held straight in order to get that deep rem sleep that we all need. That's our healing sleep. Healing is critical to one's health and pillows are the problem. There is no bigger problem than pillows. Mike, I hear what you're saying. According to the national sleep foundation, the average adult purchases 58 pillows over their lifetime, they own six different pillows at any given time-- and this is what blew me away-- 70% of us do not like our current pillow we sleep with every night. What's going on here? Well, I just happen to have some here. [Laughs] these, these pillows, uh, in the last 30 YEARS, IN THE 1970s, Pillows kind of changed forever and we've all slept with this pillow here. This pillow here is, uh, it pushes back. You know when you sleep on your back, you feel that pillow. Yeah, yeah. It's like spring, it's like pushing back at you. Oh, right. You're on your back and you're like this with a tilted neck, you wake up in the morning, you've bent your vertebral arteries and you're gonna get headaches. This is no good. [Audience laughs] okay, this pillow here, it becomes a hard surface. We've all slept in that, with the curve. The problem is pillows give you support here and here, nothing where your c1 and c2 is-- your axis and your ulna. Those are critical to snoring, central sleep apnea, all these different things that you need support in your neck. This one here-- and you also need to be kept cool. This pillow here will heat up, will also become a hard surface and it's no good. [Laughter] what about this one? This one here has ruined america. We've all slept on this. There's no support. This has done more for bad sleep deprivation than anything anywhere. And another thing too, when you wash these pillows, you know they ball up in a washer and dryer... The big pillow company wants you buying more and more pillows and they don't care about your health. They don't care about our sleep. They don't care that we keep buying pillows over and over and over again. I just wanted some sleep and I did something about it, and this pillow here things about, but it's terrible. Mike, I love your pillow. It has a great warranty. 

[00:04:01]


I love that it's made in america. The best thing you're gonna like about this pillow is I get rem sleep, the deep-healing sleep, the sleep that helps all your, your health, how you feel the next day. I have a patent on this pillow, and what it is, is all three sizes of my fill a this stuff was warrantied 10 years, it won't go flat. It's the healthiest thing ever invented. It's got... It's non-allergenic, it's anti-microbial, but the best thing it does... Wherever you set this, okay, until you first get comfortable on your pillow and you're like this and you go like this and... Now, tonja, I want you to feel that. You see how that holds? Oh, my gosh. That will not migrate. Wherever you set it, you get exactly what you need for your individual neck support, okay? You can trim this any way you want. You can make little balloon animals out of it. [Laughter] it's gonna hold. Okay, it takes six pounds of pressure to hold that in position. Your average head weighs 12 pounds, so wherever you set that, you get exactly what you need for you as an individual. It's amazing, it will change your life. There's nothing like it on the planet. It's just amazin now, if you're on your back... We've all seen that curve pillow. I think we just threw one away a minute ago. Okay, that curved pillow like that only fits one in 30 people. Remember, we told you that. It gives you support here and here, nothing here. Well, you could be that one in 30, tonja. You take the pillow, you do like this, you tuck it, and you know what? No more snoring, okay? The reason is you're supporting your c1 and c2, your breathing is better. Other companies have said, "oh, yeah, we have this amazing cure for snoring." This will really work. From the testimonials i have from all the pillows I've sold, about 70% of the people don't snore anymore at all. [Applause] what mike hasn't told you is that, already, hundreds of thousands of people have benefitted from sleeping on my pillow. I give 'em a 60-day money-back guarantee 'cause people, quite frankly, are tired of buying pillows that they can't return and get their money back. Yeah. And we have... Our customer service is the best in the country. We have an a+ rating with the better business bureau and we have zero complaints out of all the seven years I've been in business with the better

[00:08:04]


benefits you can only get from the world's most comfortable pillow, my pillow. We started with one or two and then, all of a sudden, kids realized that, the kids... I think kalli borrowed mine for the first time, and she said, "i want one of those dad." So I got her one of the pillows, and ever since then, our whole family has 'em. Healthy, normal people need to go to bed, stay asleep and wake up feeling good. When somebody's changing, um, anything in their lifestyle, um, you want to make sure that you're prepared to adapt to stress, and that's what sleep does. It prepares you and improves your ability to respond to stress, and so, right out of the chute, easiest thing I can recommend is my pillow in order to get a good night's sleep we need to be in a position that is comfortable. If our body is contorted in any way, we can impinge on nerves that would lead to tingling, numbness, discomforts of various sort. If you could position yourself with a pillow that is comfortable, then these motor and sensory signals that you get in a restless state don't occur and you have a lot more rem sleep. We're here with sleep expert michael j. Lindell, founder and inventor of a revolutionary new sleep aid called my pillow. Over the last seven years, what I came up with is a theory, after talking to hundreds of thousands of people that have the pillow... There's eight cervical nerves on each side of your neck, and what they do... They need to be in alignment, okay, to get-- for the signals to go to your brain. Remember the old-fashioned TVs THAT HAD THE Horizontal hole, you know, the wavy line when it wasn't clear? When you first get set at night, you first get comfortable on your pillow, your brain says, "okay, I'm comfortable," 'cause your cervical nerves are lined up. Yeah. Well, what happens is the air startsng out of that pillow and they're bent, like bending a water 

[00:10:05]


hose, okay? When you do that, you go... [Mimics gushing sound] your signal's not going through. Same way with your arteries, your precerebral artery and your carotid artery... The blood flow to the brain needs to be, um, you know, open like a hose. Is that why my concentration is so much better after i sleep on my pillow? That's exactly right. Good support, which is somehow the miracle of my pillow, uh, throughout the night is what we want. It's nice fall asleep, but then, as your pillow collapses, you're gonna wake up again 'cause your position's changed. The my pillow, it seems that we're at a state that is comfortable and it stays the same throughout the night. What dr. Kolodny has to say really reinforces what you've been telling us about my pillow. What it does.... That it can put you in a deep rem sleep, which is the healing sleep. It's also the most comfortable sleep. When you get comfortable at night, that's what sends you into the rem. That's when your cervical nerves, your neck is lined up. And, interesting enough, what's my theory on this-- this theory was brand new-- and it's true, and it's real and everybody knows that. Now, it's out there because you've all done that with your arms, folded your pillows and done all this stuff and flip-flopped all night like a guppy. Here, you stay with my pillow. Wherever you set this pillow, it's gonna hold, exactly for you as an individual. With my pillow, by keeping all those things in your neck straight, you get the best sleep of your life every single night and I guarantee it. We make 'em right here in the united states. The reason why I'm still in business is to help people. That's my calling, that's why I'm here and I want everybody to have the best night's sleep they've ever got in their life. Absolutely, absolutely! [Applause] I discovered that having my head, neck and spine perfectly aligned all night, whether it's on my side or whether, occasionally, I'm on my back, I can get a perfect cervical curvature, and my aligning that spine, the four 

[00:12:06]


cervical nerves running right through the middle of my neck going everywhere in my body and reporting back up, everything is in alignment. It's a phenomenal difference in the way that you're able to sleep. I fell asleep instantly... Instantly. I have found that i have more energy during the day. I sleep better, I'm not rustling around. My wife used to tell me that I used to flip around and move all over the bed. She has not said that since I've had the my pillow. So it's just been, it's overall has given me a better night's sleep, and again, that's why the rest of my family has the my pillow as well. With those other pillows that you're getting at the markets, they're just trash, really. They're just cheap. And after you wash them, they bunch up, they're not the same anymore. With my pillow, you can toss it into the wash, you can air dry it, toss it into the dryer. It's such an easy pillow to take care of and it's gonna last you forever. Earlier we talked about the importance of a good night's sleep which is something I can really relate to. I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical, but michael told me it would really work. And after about two or three weeks, I noticed that all of my migraines had disappeared. And what I really noticed is that I could start going out to the gym, i could start exercising more, because any time i tried to do that before, i just would get cruciating headaches. And so, uh, one of the things... We talk about washing and drying a pillow... I've washed hundreds of pillows where they end up in that clump. Well, I put it in the washer machine and when i took it out of the dryer and when it looked just like it did the day i bought it, I was sold. And that's when I wanted to buy 'em for my kids because my kids are always taking their pillow in the car. They're taking it to grandpa and grandma's house, they're throwing it in front of the tv and so I'd always end up washing their pillows and I knew that I was spending more money on gas driving back and forth to the department store to buy them a new one. And the other thing that i really wanted and I knew is that if they really started getting a good night sleep now, keeping their cervical nerves in alignment and doing all 

[00:14:06]


that stuff for their health that hopefully, when they got to be my age, they wouldn't have the kind of problems that I've had. So it's really important for me that my kids sleep on a great pillow. And they've even commented. My daughter-- I was out working one day-- and she said... I was kind of telling my pillow story, and she said, "mom, I had no idea you were in that much pain." And she said, you know, and I just know that it's made me a much better mom.

We've had several people drive across the country today so that they could be here in our audience so that they could share the impact that my pillow has had made on their lives. And one of the first people that I want to introduce to you is andy. Andy, if you'd be so kind, we'd love to hear how my pillow has made a difference for you. Hi, mike. How you doing, andy? Good, I met you at the state fair last year. Yes, I remember. And I didn't even know I was looking for a pillow and you saw me and said, "i need to talk to you." And I gotta tell you, thanks, you know? Its changed my life. It's changed the way I sleep. [Laughs] I sleep, i think, is the big thing. It's a miracle. With your big shoulders-- there's a lot of people already like you. You have all kinds of problems because of, you know... And I'm a side sleeper, I've always been a side sleeper. My arm falls alseep... Not anymore. Not anymore. That's amazing, yeah. That's why I love some of these pillows, because of stories like yours. I take it with me everywhere. Right, right. It's been to texas twice, arizona... Right. It didn't go on one trip. ..Hat went well for you. And, well, it didn't work too well. The first night I was down there-- it's two hours away to my wife's folks and, uh, it didn't make it. I woke up, you know, after an hour, two hours, three hours. Finally, five o'clock in the morning, I got up, drove back up to where we live, grabbed the pillow... Wow! There you go! So, on the second night... [Applause] the second night, I had a good night's sleep. Right, that's awesome. And then, my wife, she'd like to thank you because I don't snore. Wow, that's a... [Laughs] you're back in the same bedroom! It's great. 

[00:18:08]


You know, it just goes to show even someone your size... We help everybody, from the smallest person up to the biggest, you know? It's great. That's an awesome story. And we're gonna see you again at the state fair this year? Yes, you are. I'll be there myself. Thanks. Thank you. [Applause] andy was so enthusiastic about sharing his story and being here today so I can see why. Thank you, andy. And next we have jennifer. I'm very happy to have jennifer up to share with us how my pillow's made a difference in her life. Hi! Hello. Hello, jennifer. How are you guys? Mike and GOOD. Um... I just am a busy person on the go. I have two little girls that I chase after and i have my own company, a floral design company, and I volunteer every day. So when I go to bed, i really, really need sleep and I've tried pretty much every pillow out there: The flat pillows, the firm, I tried a water pillow and those memory foam pillows and I always woke up with a dull headache, just... It was not, you don't have the energy and you can't deal with children when you're dealing with that. I saw my pillow at one of your shows and I thought, you know, I'd invested enough money on pillows that didn't work, so i thought I'd just try it. And that night I had the best night's sleep of my life in years and it's... It's, I've had the best night's sleep every night. I don't toss and turn anymore, I don't wake up with a dull headache. I just really feel good when I wake up. I have energy and I love my pillow. Did you believe it when you saw the sign that said it did all that? It's too good to be true! I was really skeptical. My husband is the biggest skeptic ever. He's like, "you want to spend money on a pillow? Go ahead, we'll see what happens," rolling his eyes. And, honest, it worked so well. I love my pillow, love it. Thank you, that's awesome. Thank you. Thank you for making it. [Applause] I know, mike, that the 60-night money-back guarantee really makes a big difference for people who are skeptical, who know that they want to try a pillow but maybe they're afraid because they have 

[00:20:08]


had so many in the past that didn't work. Right, and I've said, you know, back when i invented this seven years ago, or eight years ago, whatever it's been now, that was the one thing i wanted people to not have, that skepticism, so I gave the... Believed in it so much, that's why I gave the 60-day money-back guarantee so they'd have nothing to lose and everything to gain. You have everything to gain. Your health is the most important thing to your life. Absolutely. And my pillows are more supportive of your health. Absolutely, hands down. Well, we have another gentleman in our audience his name is michael, and michael, thank you for being here today. Well, my pillow helped a lot. A few years back I had a medical scare-- I had a jaw joint that was getting eaten away by a tumor. The good news is it wasn't malignant, it was benign. The downside of that is when they actually do the surgery, they actually have to sever the muscle that normally fits over your jaw joints, so now, at night, I've found that my mouth would come open and I would start snoring. My wife did not like that very much. So I came across my pillow at a county fair, and i thought, no, I'm not gonna buy a pillow. And he talked to me, he said, "listen, it's a money-back guarantee, try it out. What do you have to lose?" Thought, okay, that's a pretty good pitch, let me try it. That night I slept through the night and it really was one of the first night's that I can remember where I didn't toss. It was a nice, comfortable feeling and I woke up cool and I wasn't getting headaches. So the product does work. Thank you for making what you made. And you don't snore anymore, you said? I don't snore anymore. [Laughs] that's amazing. That's why I love selling this pillow, that's a wonderful... It's a miracle product, isn't it? Yes, it is. Definitely a life-changer. Thank you. [Applause] well, I want to thank you for those great my pillow stories and for joining us today. I know so many of us are grateful for the pillow that you've made, mike. And you get thousands and thousands of testimonials... I've got one here. I get these all the time, you're right. This is from... I've sent pillows over to afghanistan. This guy, he wrote me. He said, "i'm writing you because I haven't gotten a good night's sleep 

[00:22:08]


in over a month. We work 24-hour shifts so getting our crew rest is very important. Right now, I'm sleeping on a cot with a bag full of unused clothes as a pillow--" which can be better than some of the pillows you've slept on! Some of those we've seen today. What we did, we sent some pillows and here was their response. "Your pillows came in the mail two days ago, so i was able to test it out for two nights now, and i can't begin to tell you how nice it is to wake up with no neck pain and to be able to get a good night's sleep. I've already told the rest of my guys how much of a difference your pillow is already making. Thank you so much and god bless, chief warrant officer patrick devlin, afghanistan." And what we've got... [Applause] and what I've done since we got that... We've been sending more and more over there to our troops and we've also.... In the united states, just the military bases, to be able to sell in there because they like our product and we've been okayed for... All the way to alaska. And we're helping, you know, not only the everyday people but we're helping our troops through it and it's just amazing. This is why i sell the pillow. Mike, you just have my utmost respect for your commitment to our troops, for your commitment to the american people, for manufacturing here in the united states, and just what you provide for people's overall health. [Applause] I would recommend if you're taking medications to fall asleep at night and coffee to keep you awake in the day that you try my pillow and see what a difference it can make in your life. My pillow is all I need. I don't need two pillows, uh, and I don't need to constantly tuck it in the back of my neck and shoulders to be comfortable as the night wears on. I work in a physical therapy clinic and we see a lot of patients with stiff necks and sore shoulders and just having difficulty sleeping. And since my experience with my pillow I recommend that they give it a try. I know that most of us never stop to think about the tremendous difference that a pillow can make to 

[00:24:10]


our overall health and well being. But my hope for today is that you'll take this valuable information and you'll experience for yourself the tremendous difference that a my pillow can make in your life.

=======================================================

>>> Thanks, randi. See you at the top of the hour. Good morning, everyone. I'm christine romans. A painful election is behind us. Now the hard work begins. Creating middle class jobs. It used to be a ticket to the middle class was by making things. But what are we making these days, and where is the middle? Take a minute to look around your living room. Your tv, the jaens you're wearing, the lamp next to you, all of those things likely aren't made in the usa. It's a trend, of course, long in the making but made worse by the great recession. When more than 2 million manufacturing jobs were lost. Since june 2009 when the recession ended, just 241,000-of-those manufacturing jobs have come back. That's according to government data. For years, for years, conventional wisdom was we don't need to make stuff here. We'll invent it in america and then become a service-based economy. Well, here we are, and these new service sector jobs aren't paying off, literally. Right now a job in the leisure and hospitality sector averages $13 an hour. That's $27,000 a year, if you work full-time. Retail, not much better. Average hourly rate, about $16 an hour. This is the average. It takes into account everyone from the store manager to the stock boy. Let me show you one tier higher, manufacturing. Bringing in almost $24 an hour on average. That's a solid $50,000 a year. That's also the median income for u.S. Households. Education and health services, these are important jobs for society. Workers there earn an average of $24.28 an hour and also around 50 grand a year. Again, if you work fulltime. Then there's the very top. Those are highly educated, highly skilled and highly motivated. Census data show the top 20% making six figures, pulling in almost half of the income in the u.S. For this american recovery to work we need to have a middle, a big, prosperous happy middle. Don't you think? It has defined generations of americans. The question is how do we get there? Peter morici is a professor of international business at the university of maryland and former director at the u.S. International trade commission and peter navarro is the author of "death by china the "and john doggett is a professor at the university of texas at austin. Professors, thanks for joining me. Let's get to school. Let's get to the lightning round. 25 seconds or less. What is your number one way right now to grow middle class jobs? Peter morici, you get to start. 

[00:02:32]


>> Develop more domestic oil and gas and address the trade balance with china. Together if we did those things we'd create 5 million jobs. Both areas require skilled workered, pay high wages and use domestic materials and as a consequence we could easily grow the economy. 10 million jobs. Grow at 4% to 6% a year for the next three years. Professorial, definitely 50 seconds. John, what about you? 
>> We need to build big and heavy things that are hard to ship and expensive to ship. There's a company calledenergex in michigan building wind turbine blades with composites doing a good job. Big heavy things will hire a lot of americans. 
>> Peter navarro, your turn? 
>> Let's start this week. Instead black friday, let's have red, white and blue friday, stop buying made in china stuff, tell our friends to stop buying made in china stuff. Tell the stores to start stocking made in the usa. 
>> Peter naff voe, I'll stick with you on that idea. I go a little crazy this time of the year because I'm told the u.S. Economy is driving the u.S. Economy. 75 misof economic activity. Maybe that's not a good economic model if we're sending people out with borrowed money and saving. The same people going out and shopping this past week are the same people they don't have enough money to save for college. How do we change that dynamic? 
>> High irony there. What I try to do, christine, is have people connect the dots between buying cheap made in china cheating products and the loss of their jobs, loss of our manufa pennies of every dollar we spend there at the great wall of mart is going to build a very powerful military in china that is going to challenge our pacific fleet soon, so if we vior. 
>> Come on, peter. 
>> We really need to make red, white and blue friday instead of black friday. 

[00:04:37]


>> You can grow america without demonizing china. China has its own national interests and strategy. What's ours? John, without -- what does america do? 
>> You know what, we have to do is stop whining and complaining and blaming china for the fact that we don't make things that americans want. If we make better products which have a higher quality, america is going to buy it. The other thing that is going on that peter doesn't talk about the prices, the wages for workers in china, the cost of doing business in china is requesting up significantly. We can now make things in america as cheaply as it can be made in china. Let's look at a. Perfect example is a. Apple could increase the price of all of its products by $5 or $10 apiece and can bring all that manufacturing from china back to the united states. 
>> Why don't they? 
>> Because right now the new ceo is trying to do that and my guess that time next year there will be a lot of new manufacturing in the united states of apple approximate because apple can afford to raise the price. 
>> I think you're right. When you look, I think you're right, john, that they can afford to. I also think they have made big investments ore seas and the shareholders are making a fortune. Here's the thing, and I'm going to bring peter morici in it. John is talking about applizing american companies and thinking like a. The issue here is when you're making everything some place else, the people who win are the people who invent those things and the people who invest in those things and the consumers who buy them cheap, it's not the workers. 
>> Absolutely. You know, the real problem though is that not everybody can be an inventor and engineer, and in manufacturing, and in any area, the engineering aspect of things creates a lot of value, but it doesn't use a lot of people. You simply employ many more people making apple products than you do design is the actual iphone itself. That's why it's so valuable and creates so many profits. 
>> So if you're peter morici in the middle, education and income, you're in the middle, where do you find a job in the labor market today? 

[00:06:37]


>> You're not one of the inventors but you have more education. You maybe have a college education. What if you're average in america today? 
>> The trick is you can't have average anymore. Can't be someone with a liberal arts degree and expect to go out and make $155,000 a year. Have you to get some kind of specialized skill. It doesn't necessarily skill me investing in a four-year college education. Does mean going to a trade or technical school or community college, learning how to do something in the health care sector or in manufacturing that requires a specialized skill. Simply, we need -- you need a starting point in the labor market and that's how you get it. 
>> Okay. Final thought from each of you. Can we have an american recovery, another lightning round, can we have an american recovery without manufacturing jobs, good paying manufacturing jobs, peter navarro? 
>> No. 
>> John doggett? 
>> No way. 
>> Peter moric sgli no, and peter navarro is right. Unless we address china's cheating on the system you can't compete with them. Need a level playing field to create those jobs. 
>> Gentlemen, professors, thanks for spending your saturday morning outside of the classroom with us. 
>> Have a good weekend, everybody. 
>> Our pleasure. 
>> Hope you enjoyed the seminar. 
>> The television you're watching me on was probably not made anywhere near where you're sitting, but I'll show you one company that's found it's cheaper to assemble in the usa than in general. Just like john doggett was talking about. First, guess the answer to this question. Which percentage of u.S. Households own an hdtv? 29%, 49%, 69% or do 89% of households own an hdtv? The answer right after this. ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ??????

[00:11:20]


>>> In 2006 only 17% of american households owned an hdtv. They were big. They were expensive and they were rare, right? Everybody wanted one. Now guess what, 69% of you have one of them. It's because they cost less, right, and they cost less now because in part they are made overseas. Just one example, but today we're taking a very hard look at the u.S. Economy and asking where's the middle? Where is manufacturing in this country, and can we have a recovery without it? Where's the middle in this country, hard to find frankly. Countries like china are trying to grow their middle class and are doing that by making things that the companies are selling then to our middle class and that's taking jobs from american shores and our own trade practices are to blame. Take a look at this chart. The trade deficit with china has displaced more than 2 million jobs. Data from a left-leaning think tank. Job losses were in computers and electronics. More than a million jobs lost in those industries over the years according epi. Other industries hit hard include apparel, accessories and fabricated medals, textiles and furniture and plastics and rub, motor vehicles and parts. Some companies are starting to see the economics of making appliances in the u.S. Makes sense to their bottom line, that's right. More efficient distribution, better work force oversight. It's turning good business, turning into good business for a company we visited in michigan. This assembly line in canton, michigan, is humming again. It's auto country, but workers like michael cox are building televisions, part of an industry that largely left when manufacturing jobs were OUTSOURCED IN THE 1970s, '80s AND '90s. 
>> Lots of things went overseas. Nice to see a lot of that stuff come back. A lot of people here need a job and we're willing to do just about anything to work. 
>> Element electronics has reshored an assembly line from asia stateside. The parts are still imported, BUT LARGE-SCREEN TVs ARE Assembled, checked and packaged in america. 

[00:13:27]


>> As consumers want more LARGE-SCREEN TVs, IT HAS CREATED An opportunity to bring that production here to the united states. 
>> Mike o'shaughnessy is ceo and fauner of element. He's determined to create american jobs. 
>> You grew up in warren ohio in THE 1970s AND '80s LIKE I DID, You watched jobs leave, and you watched the impact of those jobs leaving on the families and friends that you had. 
>> But this isn't just sentimental. O'shaughnessy says it's good business, and the math makes sense. 
>> We studied what our total product costs were. In particular we studies what labor does against duty and freight and other factors, and what we found is that we can PRODUCE AND ASSEMBLE TVs HERE IN The united states, and we can do that for about the same cost by introducing some component in larger screen televisions, u.S. Labor, u.S. Assembly, because it's offset by lower duty and lower freight. 
>> AND ASSEMBLING THESE TVs HERE Means better quality control and quicker delivery to retailers like target, walmart and costco. So far element has created 100 jobs here. Across the country the number of jobs for skilled factory workers is up 38% since 2005, suggesting at least some of the millions of outsourced jobs are making a round trip, helping former autoworkers like shelby get back to work. 
>> If they close my plant, and i was out of a job for two and a half years, so it was kind of hard to find something for a while there, but thank good for here. Stuff is being made in america so that's good. 
>> Imagine losing your job at an auto facility and then out of rk for two years and now putting together televisions. All right. 23 million americans are struggling to find full-time work, but business leaders say they can't find enough high-skilled manufacturing workers. I'll tell you why they are not looking hard enough. That's next. to future. Since ameriprise financial was founded back in 1894, they've been committed to putting clients first.

[00:16:56]


[ Male Announcer ] CAMPBELL'S CHUNKY SOUP. It fills you up right. 
>>> To hear corporate executives tell it, the only thing holding back manufacturing in america are americans themselves. Good jobs go unfilled because american workers don't have the skills needed to keep up with a fast-paced technology-driven factory floor. 600,000 manufacturing jobs, to be exact, according to one stud fredeloitte, are unfilled because of a skills gap. All that have would be pretty terrifying, right, if it were true. A recent report from the boston consulting group says, quote, trying to hire high-skilled workers at rock bottom rates is not a skills gap. The report estimates that the skills gap actually affects between 80,000 and 100,000 workers, less than 1% of the total manufacturing workforce. The co-author of that report is also a senior and managing partner of the boston consulting group and also author of the book of "the manufacturing renaissance." Thanks for stopping by to talk to us about this. I hear this a lot from executives. We've had people on this program who had people on this program who have said they just can't find the workers. You say they're not looking hard enough. They're not looking hard enough, they're not paying enough, and they're not investing in training enough. Is that the answer? 

[00:20:10]


>> Exactly. What we're seeing is companies who are not paying enough, they're looking at highly skilled jobs, they're trying to pay $12 or $15 an hour to. That's not a skills gap. They're trying to explore, you know, using lower end work force because they want to pay less money. That's not a skills gap. They're focusing on all sorts of other things. They're not doing training. Training san important part. A lot of companies took out training in 2008 when the economy went south and they haven't put it back. You have to train your workers. You cannot just take people off the street and have manufacturing workers. For most of the jobs, it takes two or three months of apprenticeship to get them skilled and companies just don't want to pay that. 
>> We've heard a lot about companies working with community colleges to try to train workers to have skilled workers. We've talked to, for example, fedex, working with two-year community colleges for machinists. They need them. They're working with the community colleges to make sure they have the right skills. Used to be unions did a lot of help with this retraining, something that was in union contracts with big companies and big manufacturers. So whose responsibility is it now? The company worker? The companies? Governments? The workers themselves? 
>> It's got to be the companies who have to do this. They're the ones who need the people. Well, individuals can do their own training and can go to community colleges and that's a big plus and that will help them in their employment, but companies need to make sure they have the skilled work force to do the jobs. That means they'll have to do it. They'll have to build relationships with community colleges so they can make sure the community colleges are training the people for the skills that they need. 
>> By 2020, this is a fascinating statistic, you estimate that the u.S. Will have 875,000 unfilled positions for machinists, welders, industrial machinery mechanics and industry engineers. That's probably because the average age of manufacturing workers is 56 years old. But then you point out just 14% of companies you surveyed are recruiting from high schools. What do american manufacturers need to do to recruit these young workers? Because they're going to have a real skills gap, a real worker gap by then. 

[00:22:24]


>> Exactly. We don't see a very significant skills gap now, but by the end of the decade, it's going to be very severe if manufacturers don't do things. They're going to have to partner with community colleges. They're going to have to go to high schools and they're going to have to put money in training. When you've got a work force whose highest age for these skilled jobs is 56 years, we're going to see a lot of retirements, so we're looking at something like 875,000 jobs that will go unfilled if we do not start the training now. So while we don't have a skills gap right now that's severe, it will be very severe by the end of decade if we do nothing. 
>> Well, so nice to meet you. Come back again. We try to look at this as close as we can because you really can't have a comeback in america without putting the middle back in manufacturing jobs. Hal, thanks so much. 
>> Absolutely, christine. 
>>> Coming up, it's black friday weekend. You're trying to score the best deal. What shouldn't you buy right now? What is this the worst time of year to buy?

>>> Apologies if I'm too late to save you from the black friday retail hike machine, but the answer to our quiz on what not to buy this weekend, d, all of the above. On toys, deal news says you'll find better prices in the two weeks before christmas, so just hold out a little longer. BRAND NAME HDTVs, YOU CAN FIND Deals on third-tier manufacturers, but the brand names, they're best bought in january or february. Think super bowl time. And for jewelry and watches, deal news says they're just as expensive now during the holidays as around valentine's day. You're better off buying those in the spring. The truth is the consumerism thrust on us during the holidays is self-destructive. Seeing images year after year of americans tripping over themselves to buy stuff they don't need, to pay for it with plastic, isn't it a little crazy? Credit card debt is creeping higher again, up 5% per borrower in the third quarter from a year ago. This is where you accuse me of being the grinch. ?????? You're a mean one mr. Grinch ???????????? and some of you tell me I'm ebineezer scrooge. And you're right. It's easy to get sucked into the holiday hype. Shop, shop, shop. Spend, spend, spend. Use your credit, hope you can pay it off early in the year. But you know what? There's a price to pay for chasing cheap. We've talked a lot on this show about the loss of american jobs to inexpensive labor markets overseas. Inventing here, manufacturing there, paying lower prices for just about everything at the checkout. It's a trap the middle class has fallen into. We want the latest and the greatest, but we don't want to pay too much for it. And this is what it means for jobs. 60% of the jobs that disappeared after the 2008 financial crisis were earners right in the middle. Construction, manufacturing, office management, middle wage jobs. Since then, low wage jobs are the jobs coming back. 58% of all the jobs growth in the recovery are jobs you can't buy a house with or send a kid to college on. The middle class is hurting, and to top it all off, it faces the fiscal cliff. Many of you count on your income tax refunds to pay off this holiday debt. If we go over that cliff, taxes go up an average of 3,500 a household, that refund is going to be a lot smaller. You won't have that tax refund to pay for all the stuff you don't need right now. The encouraging news, you're not taking the warnings lightly. The national retail federation says about 2/3 of shoppers say the fiscal cliff will affect their holiday spending. That's good. You've gotten the message. And it looks like congress may be getting the message, too. A deal to avert the fiscal cliff is looking more likely. It is. But I've been disappointed by this congress before. Millions of americans are counting on you, congress, to save their jobs and their financial futures. Do it. We'll all be celebrating like scrooge on christmas morning.

Underway. It is time to shop small we will show you how companies in california, south carolina and here in hard-hit new jersey are getting customers to shop local. And we'll give you tips so that you can take full advantage of small business saturday on NOVEMBER 24th. It's time to make money. Coming up next on "your business." 
>>> Small businesses are revitalizing the economy. American express open is here to help. That's why we are proud to present "your business" on msnbc. 
>>> Hi, there, everyone. I'm j.J. Ramberg. Welcome to a very special edition of "your business." It comes in between black friday and cybermonday. This year, small business SATURDAY IS NOVEMBER 24th. It is a day people are urged to shop local and is support their communities. We are coming from maplewood, new jersey. A storm-battered state where small businesses need customers more than ever. Across the country in burbank, california, the shop local movement has taken off in a big way. In the magnolia park section of that city, local retailers have banded together to revitalize not only sales but also their neighborhood. 
>>> It is the last friday of the month in the magnolia park section of burbank, california. Normally, the stores would be closing and streets would be quiet but the creative small business owners here have figured out a low cost way of bringing in customers with a huge return. They call it ladies night out where people are coming out in droves to celebrate and support these unique companies. 

[00:02:07]


>> I really like all of the small shops and things. I like to help the mom and pop type businesses and stuff. It makes me feel like I'm a part of the community. 
>> Magnolia park wasn't always like this. A couple years ago, the area known as antique alley, for its vintage antique and retail stores was a ghost town. 
>> The economy was horrible. There werbs out there. 
>> That's when sue can cade and kathleen bailey came up with the simple idea of staying open one friday a month to have a little party for their customers. Cathy said, what do we do to get more women in? Night, let's make it a party, have complimentary wine and offer a discount. 
>> We have these big four red dice that light up. When they come in, they have to roll for their discount. It is so funny. They bounce and it is hilarious. 
>> We have about 30, 40 people come in that first night. We knew we were on to something. 
>> The idea started to take off when amanda vernon of mindfulness and jennifer hard away of queens spa decided they wanted to participate in ladies night too. 
>> There really were no goals other than to create a night where people would come to the neighborhood and see how great it is and how many great stores there are here. 
>> Jennifer, amanda and the other retailers started working together on new idea to attract more customers on ladies night. One of the best, inviting l.A.'S trendy food trucks to be part of the evening's festivities. 
>> Adding food trucks to any event, people love food. You cannot get away from that. They like trying different things. You can go to three or four of them in one night if you dare. 
>> With legions of food truck devotees following the whereabouts of their favorite truck with social media, many more are discovering magnolia park on ladies night every month. 

[00:04:14]


>> They use facebook and twitter to post where they are going to be. So they have a built-in audience already for them. It is sort of, I think it is a win/win, because we've got new customers coming to an area that maybe they have never been in and they discover it and they are, oh, my gosh, this is so cute and it is really beneficial. 
>> Two years after starting ladies night, roux he tailers in magnolia park now have a very positive outlook and very healthy sales. 
>> That night is an important night for us. It comes at the end of the month. It is such a nice boost and we always say, if we make our rent that night, we are so pleased. We do. 
>> The success of ladies night is also attracting new businesses like shannon's wine bar which has been doing free tasting. Her new retail storefront is opening soon. 
>> To be able to come in and open my business, if I didn't have the support of the community, it wouldn't happen. I have been on the street and hear people saying did you no he there is a wine bar coming to magnolia par 
>> that feeling of community was never stronger than last year between small business saturday, the day between black friday and cybermonday reserved to support your local small businesses. 
>> This sounds cheesy but i cried a little. I really did. The store was full of people and they picked us as their small business to spend their money. 
>> Instead of once a year, the feeling amanda had during small business satury happens once a month at magnolia park. 
>> I feel that an event like ladies' night out has really changed the area and affected its residents. Community is so important. Knowing my customers' names and them coming in and seeing their kids, that's what it really is about. 
>> This super successful local community event is attracting everyone now, not just ladies, who want something fun to do in this otherwise quiet community. 

[00:06:17]


>> After a hard day's work, this is perfect with the economy the way it is. If you can help out a small business stay alive and keep thriving, it is going to help us all in the long run. 
>> Rick diaz who has lived in burbank for 25 years is amazed by the transformation. 
>> To tell you the truth, this place has turned around quite a bit. It was very gloomy and it's turned into a very popular place. If you look around, goodness, you see so many people around here. It is great. 
>> Shopping small has become a way of life in south carolina where local small business owners have discovered there is strength in numbers. They are spending time educating visitors, friends and each other about the importance of supporting low country small business. 
>> When you focus on just your business, it doesn't work. When you are a local business owner, you are part of the community. 
>> Christine osborn, the owner of the toy store, wonder works, says running a small business is more about cooperation than ever before. 
>> It is truly about not competition. It is about come rodry. 
>> Marianne na hey, the third generation of the jewel box agrees. She says when the economy was down, they turned to each other. 
>> We need something. 
>> The result was charleston south carolina's own buy local movement. It is called low country, local first. 
>> I often tell people we are about preserving a people and a place. I think it gave a collective voice to the local businesses here in this community. 
>> Executive director, jamie haley, says thinking small was something a lot of people talked about in 2007. 
>> There was nobody advocating for them or educating the community on why it was important. 
>> While trying to get started wasn't easy. 
>> Nobody was working together to try to get that message out. So we just did a whole lot of knocking on people's doors and saying, hey, will you meet with me? I would love to talk to you about this. 

[00:08:22]


>> Since then, low country local first has grown to 500 members. Each with a vested interest in getting residents and visitors to shop local. 
>> It's so grassroots that other people were telling their colleagues about it. It just sort of snowballed. 
>> In order to best support local outlets, members have to meet certain criteria. 
>> You need to be locally owned and independent. You have to have at least 50% of your ownership living here in the low country. You have to be head quartered here. You have to be able to make all of your own marketing, advertising decisions, et cetera. We want to see you are able to spend those dollars, your dollars, back in this community. 
>> Once accepted, those members can start telling people about it. 
>> Look for that buy local decal in the window. 
>> Low country local first backs a handful of initials. The biggest one is buy local month. It runs from november 15th to DECEMBERth. It was just a week long. 
>> The main idea, we are trying to get people to make conscious decisions about where they are spending their dollars. That's what our retailers say they needed. A week is great. We needed a longer campaign so it has a bigger impact. 
>> Christine says that the ripple effect from buying local is staggering, especially when it is locally made products flying off the shelves. 
>> For every dollar you spend in a local business, three is made for the community. I never knew that. If I buy from a local vendor or a local person and put that item in my local store, every dollar makes six. 
>> To ensure the success of local events, low country promotes all of its members. 
>> The network that supports each other is really important. 
>> Allison merrick's new kraft business got a boost from plenty of likes and tweets. 
>> I really got to see people coming in my brand new business that had been open two weeks. All of the sudden, my e-mail news letter burst to the people that liked my business on facebook. 

[00:10:28]


>> They find plenty of support off-line. 
>> I can call people and get what their best practices are. Who do they use for their accounting? What do they do about their credit card bills? Where can we do better? 
>> Even a walk down charleston's kings street, members are offering advice. 
>> It is part of my life. I am on the phone with somebody and I am asking them a question. They are my partners. 
>> This type of cooperation in the low country is here to stay. For many members, it is a way of doing business. Now, they wouldn't do it any other way. 
>> If somebody said christine osborn from german parents would be listening and embracing this new way of doing things, back then, I would have said no. I know how to run my business. I have been doing it successfully for 18 years. I can keep doing it. But jaymee hailey came in and opened my eyes and I am forever grateful that I did. 
>> We have gone past the point of competition and we are into collaboration now. People understand the value of it. 
>>> From the palmetto state to the sooner state, there are plenty of reasons why holiday shopper's attention and their wallets should be shifted away from big chain stores and towards mom and pop shops in their area. Joining me now is the mayor of tulsa, oklahoma, mayor dewey bartlett. What is tulsa doing to get ready for small business saturday? 
>> What we're doing is having a lot of local promotions, from our claim ber as well as from our city government. What we are trying to do is very specifically. In our downtown area, we are opening up buildings that have specialized shops inside the building in larger areas where they have an opportunity, because of one bit of advertising that brings people in the door. They can see a variety of shops in one building. It's sort of like having a mall in the downtown area. 
>> Mayor, for a lot of people that want to support small business but they want to do one-stop shopping at a big box store, it is a little bit cheaper at a big box store. As the mayor of a city, why is it so important that people support small business? 

[00:12:43]


>> Well, for our city, we really live and die off of sales tax revenue. That's for about 80% of our revenue comes from sales tax receipts. Small business is the life blood of a community. There is so much of it around. If we promote small business, it brings local people, supports local people. We are not quite as tied to decisions that might be made outside of our community with the big box stores. Locally, tulsa, our economy is doing very, very well. The rest of the country, unfortunately, is not doing that hot. We might have a different buying pattern and a more affordable buying pattern than other cities in our country. Decisions that are made locally usually are in our best interest. 
>> Are you and other city officials getting behind this? Are you going to be out there on saturday buying stuff at stores?

>>> When it comes to marketing your local business, think about a five-mile radius. This comes from linda duke from duke marketing who says there are a few things you can think about to create a community-based strategy. First, empower your employees to become ambassadors. Give them samples to distribute to their friends. Create community based partnerships. Are you trying to reach families. Support the local girl scouts. Finally, concentrate on local p.R. Make friends with your local newspaper editors and send them story ideas. 
>>> Tip number 140, the five-mile rule. Today, we come to you from maplewood new jersey at a local independent bookstore called words. When jonah and ellen bought this struggling bookstore a few years ago, they changed the mission making it a haven for young people with autism. It thrives as a bookstore and a place that teaches these kids the skills they need to transition from being students to part of the workforce. 

[00:17:39]


>>> In the quiet new york city suburb of maplewood, new jersey, another independent bookstore almost disappeared. That was until jonah and ellen zimely came to the rescue. They knew nothing about the book business. 
>> When jonah came, he didn't have a bookstore background. He was depending on us to be able to help him out with that. 
>> With the change in ownership came a change in management style. The former bookstore owner was hands on doing most of the work of her store herself. A recent graduate of business school, jonah was interested in the idea of job crafting to better utilize the talent of his staff. 
>> It's -- that can't always work 100%. Sometimes you have to buckle down and do something we're not good at or don't like. As much as possible, it's in everyone's interest if they do what they are good at and what they like to do. 
>> He worked with each of them to determine their likes and dislikes and did his best to play to their strengths. 
>> She does the ordering. It's her specialty. I do the scheduling, the tech stuff, things like that. I have more responsibilities now than I did before. 
>> With the day-to-day operations being run by the staff, the zimiles has a chance to try something else near and dear to their hearts. If their son diagnosed with autism, they wanted to expand the mission of the store to be a welcoming environment to people with special needs. 
>> It is on a spectrum. There is an understanding here. It is very comforting for me. I feel at home when I come here. I don't feel awkward if he should freak out or have an episode or just start screaming or whatever he may do, I don't think anybody here is going to care. 
>> They created a vocational training program where kids with special needs could develop skills to use in everyday life. 

[00:19:48]


>> The hardest thing for applying for a job is not having any experience, particularly for people with special needs. For all of us, apply for jobs. My thought was to provide a first job or experience on a resume so that people could leave us with real-life job experience and a recommendation for another job. 
>> I learned about teamwork and cooperation. I learned about organization. I learned a lot of skills here. 
>> He's not going to be protected for the rest of his life, he can't be. He's not going to be able to function that way, nor do I want him to. Having this as a stepping stone or initiation to the real world is wonderful and invaluable to him and me as a parent. 
>> Thanks so much for coming, really appreciate it. 
>> The approach has revitalized the bookstore and made all the staffers more engaged and fulfilled in their jobs. 
>> I'm a lot more vested now so when I go home, I think, oh, geez, I forgot to do this. First thing in the morning, i have to come back and do that. 
>> It's worked well to be empowered to make decisions and help run the place. They have been here since the very beginning, have a real ownership interest in the store. They really take pride in this place. This is their place. They started it. 
>> It's also given people with autism a chance at a better life. 
>> Hiring someone with special needs is a good business idea. Sometimes they will do jobs that it is hard to get a college graduate to stick with. They are very good workers. They show up, all weather, any time of day. They are on time. They're's a role that you have that would work for them. It is a win/win for everybody. 
>> See ya, jonah. 
>> So how are retailers gearing up for small business saturday? We spoke to some store owners here to ask them what they are doing to bring in more customers ON NOVEMBER 24th. 

[00:21:56]


>> We are going to have extended holiday hours so that people who are getting off the train later and stuff like that have time to do all their holiday shopping. On that day, we are going to have refreshments and a discount lottery. People will be able to come up to the register and pick out of a bowl and they either get 10% off or 20% off, up to 40% off. 
>> I'm going to do a special promotion. I'm going to do 10% off everything in the store. I do a blog for the store. I'll feature special items i have in for the holidays. Then I offer cookies and, you know, a special drink or something. Some kind of treat. 
>> Social media has been the biggest thing for us as far as getting the word out there and educating people. Instagram has been really great for us. I'm able to post pictures and i think people really connect to more if they see a picture of product and then a caption saying, oh, you can get this for 20% off on small business saturday. 
>> I send out e-mail blasts to my current customer base, facebook marketing and twitter. 
>> I'll get the word out that way. 
>> We have very loyal customers who our town really support it's small businesses. We have all independent businesses in downtown maplewood. Obviously, with all the publicity around black friday, people tend to be distracted and go to the mall and don't sit down. It is great to redirect people back to town centers. 
>> In years prior, those couple of days after thanksgiving were not very busy days for small businesses. Everybody was out at the malls or shopping online or whenever. It has definitely helped to increase business and put the emphasis back on keeping it local. 
>>> Washington is solidly behind small business saturday and the shop local movement. I spoke to karen mills the head of the sba to ask what the agency is doing to help owners get the word out. 

[00:24:00]


>> Well, I'm going to be shopping small on saturday. We are trying to encourage all of america to go down to main street and to take advantage of the terrific small businesses that are right there in your community. It's a win/win.

We are able, on small business year, to go and get the most wonderful food and restaurants and a persalized experience, maybe a unique gift from small business owners who are operating their own business right nearby. 
>> How can a small business take advantage of this so it's not just saturday that they are seeing an increase in customers but it happens all yearlong. 
>> This is a win/win. For small businesses, this is a chance for more revenue. Small businesses should come to sba.Gov and make a plan for small business saelt. Saturday. Many are doing ribbon cuttings and special promotions. They are having guests and making a celebraing environment. 
>> What will they find to help them plan for small business saturday?

>> What can small business owners do to encourage people to say no, why don't you come to my store and shop instead of the big box store and getting everything all at once? 
>> When you go to a small business, you are getting the attention of often the owner himself or herself and, for a customer, this means you can get a unique gift, a personalized experience and get i beautifully wrapped. Shopping small is not only a pleasant experience when you have that one-to-one relationship, but you can very often get unique and very od priced gifts for the holiday season.

>>> And black friday has come and gone and now the best barringians are 48 hours away, perhaps, on cyber monday. We'll have tips you need in order to try and save some cash this holiday season. "Your money" starts right now. 
>>> For months I wornd you about the economic storm of the dangers of going over the so-called fiscal cliff. The one washington created. It seems with the noise of the campaign behind us, washington is listening which means that after several months of harping on the dangers that you face, I'm ready to make a big switch to telling you about the opportunities that lie ahead. I'm ali velshi and this is "your money." I will not drop this issue until it is settled. Then we have the debt ceiling debate. But there is life after washington induced catastrophe. Frankly, it looks like a pretty good life. If all goes according to plan, 2013 could be a big turn around year for the u.S. The start of a recovery that feels real. Most of it will have very little to do with washington policy though your state and federal government will have to step in to make it happen. Let me explain. First, there's an energy boom under way in the united states right now. Fueled by hydraulic fracturing and by more drilling for oil. Natural gas is currently cheap, abundant and increasingly used not just as a fuel source direct to home and businesses, but as a source for electricity generation. As for oil, you don't need me to explain the value of producing it. It's not about cars and homes, more domestically produced energy will help fuel a resurgence in u.S. Manufactured goods, combined cheap and abundant electricity with costs in china and other countries and shipping costs and you make made in america more attractive to americans and to buyers abroad and that's good for u.S. Jobs. Finally, housing is already making a comeback. It started to turn around in 2012 with existing home sales rising for the first time in years. Construction is starting to pick up. Historically low interest rates averaging below 4% for a 30-year fixed mortgage will fuel rebound next year. A house will be the most important asset for most americans. A rebound there makes americans feel better about their financial situation and ready to spend a bit of money. Stephen moore is a senior economics writer at the "wall street journal" as well as a member of the editorial board. Michelle girard is senior u.S. Economist at rbs and daniel gross is a columnist and business editor at "newsweek" daily beast. Dansis is that washington is likely to avert a fiscal cliff, unleash the animal spirits. We have things going on that are going to lead to an american economic renaissance starting right about now. Am I wrong? 

[00:03:04]


>> Well, I don't share your optimism about us not going over the fiscal cliff. But I also don't think it will matter. What we've seen in the past couple years, the recovery we've seen has been in spite of government, not because of it. It's not just the factors that you cited, energy, manufacturing, housing finally coming back, housing starts up 40% in october year over year. Our exports are at their highest level ever, even in this world that is growing more slowly. Our goods and products have a big audience overseas. And the american consumer that was so down-and-out in '08 and '09 is back. Consumer confidence, highest level since prerecession. More people are working at payroll jobs. Their incomes are rising. Everybody is doing a much better job keeping up with financial obligations, credit cards, mortgages, et cetera. All that means this could be a pretty decent shopping season. 
>> Stephen moore, you and i don't share views on everything. We share views on wanting america and the world to be prosperous. And we've been riding the same gloomy wagon for a little while. Would you like to come and join me on the happy wagon? Do you find my argument that a renaissance is a foot compelling? 
>> I love the theme of this american renaissance. There is nothing more I'd like to see. Ry exactly right. There is so much right in america. But when it comes to the industries that you talked about, I'm right are with you. I love the american energy story. We can be the saudi arabia of oil and natural gas production. Don't forget coal. We have hundreds of years of that. We can have -- by the way, you're exactly right. Because we now have that access to cheap and abundant energy in this country, that has real peripheral effects with respect to manufacturing. I lot of manufacturing story because our electricity and energy costs are now lower than the rest of the world. I agree with you on housing. We haven't built any housing in this country with five years. You can see a renaissance in housing continue. So you and I agree on those things. But I do think policy matters. It's not just solving the fiscal cliff in my opinion, it's solving it in the right way. 

[00:05:14]


>> Who are you and what have you done with stephen more moore? 
>> Michelle girard, any recovery? Daniel he lead -- eluded to. This american consumes have been telling us for months that contrary to other economic evidence and indicators, things are looking and feeling better for them. Guess what? They have never, ever been wrong. Every time the american consumer says we're going down, we go down. When they say things are getting better, they're getting better. They feel okay. 
>> And I think it gets back to just like you said, the housing turn around. I think that that's helped consumers to feel much better about their own financial positions and, of course, the fact that the he can quit market through the summer was doing, you know, we've seen a rebound, certainly not in the last month. But part of that. I mean these things coming together I think have certainly bolstered consumer confidence. Although I will say in the end, so much of how the consumer will do is tied to jobs. And that's why you do get back to business. And that's what stephen said is so important, how do you resolve this fiscal cliff is incredibly important in terms of businesses knots only have uncertainty removed, but actually feeling like they'll be a better environment going forward. If that happens, then you can finally see more hiring and more investing and ultimately that's what gets the economy going at a rate that we haven't yet enjoyed so far in this recovery. 
>> So why? Why then, dan, are we feeling this way? You share the view that we are not -- you're not done with the fiscal cliff. We're not going to suddenly solve our fiscal problems. We certainly haven't been talking enough on the spending side. There seems to be movement toward the idea that some people's taxes will go up at the high end. Middle class won't see much of a tax increase. Why the optimism? Are we justified? 
>> Well, I think the typical consumer is not like you and me and our other guests here. The typical median income is $60,000 a year for a family. They're not getting a lot of money from capital gains and dividends. They're not freaked out at the prospect of those going up. They're concerned about what is in their paycheck. Paychecks are morsteady than they had been any time the last few years. Wages are going up a little bit. The biggest asset that anybody owns is a house. We finally seem -- it's not just the value of sales rising and construction but home values. And so with every passing week, you know, certain number of people underwater on their mortgages are now in positive territory. And that contributes to what we call the effect. When things are going in the right direction, that forces to propel them further. 

[00:07:52]


>> Stephen, again, you feel very strongly that tax rates should go down, certainly not go up. But these pro cyclical things, the idea that the price of your house could go up. You're stuck with a house and might be able to sell it. Credit marginally becoming a little bit easier. Jobs are coming there and ly you're more interested in the paycheck than the taxes you pay on the paycheck. Let's say we see a little tax increase. Does it outweigh it? I'm not asking you to give up your position. You're always here arguing your tax position. But does it outweigh your on going concerns that taxes are going to cripple us? 
>> Yeah, I think we can grow through this despite the fact that I do think if we raise the taxes our growth rate won't be quite as high. I want to make two quick points on this. One is that I think michelle is right. It all starts with jobs. Because if people don't have jobs, they don't pay the mortgage. They can't buy houses. The second point I made is to stay on this optimistic theme, maybe because it's thanks giving weekend. But you know, I made this point before on your show. You know, it comes to america relative to the rest of the world, we're the least rotten apple in the house, right? And that gives us a huge advantage in terms of investment coming to the united states, building new businesses. And that's why I'm, you know, I'm somewhat optimistic that despite the fact that unlike the direction washington is headed. 
>> We're always the least rotten apple but had a worm in it. Maybe this fiscal cliff discussion will remove the worm. Michelle, what does washington have to do to not reinstall the worm into the apple, to not get in the way of this consumer -- this feeling that things are getting better? 
>> Bottom line is that I do think that we are kind of talking about an economic that is goiabing if we can do the right thing, to grow 2% f we can get some longer term certainty in terms of a grand bargain and, again, release the constraints this economy and businesses face in terms of uncertainty, I think we can look at an economy that could grow better than trend for the first time in this recovery. 

[00:09:54]


>> I look forward it to. I just want to reach out and hug all of you. Thank you. Good discussion. This is thanksgiving, it's a useful time to point out a lot of the good things. We'll continue to do that as necessary, however. Dan gross, great to see you. Dan gross, global business editor for "newsweek." Michelle girard, director of ubs and stephen moore is a writer with "the wall street journal." Thank you. 
>>> Coming up, we just touched on it. Globalization chipped away at u.S. Manufacturing jobs over the last few decades. There are signs that some of the jobs are coming back. Certainly manufacturing is. Don't expect to wear overalls and a tool belt to the job site though. We'll look at the manufacturing jobs of the future when we come back. YOU'RE WATCHING "YOUR MONEY." @ l???? ??xw @ ??6@ ?? 

[00:13:31]


>>> made in america. One of the keys to an american renaissance. The economy is adding jobs but the jobs the u.S. Is adding aren't the same ones that it has lost. Take a look at this. Jobs in leisure and hospitality. One of the big growth areas. Pay on average $13.35 an hour. Retail, another area that we've been growing, $16.43 an hour. Neither of these pay as well as manufacturing with an average hourly rate of $24 an hour. Since january of 2010, the u.S. Economy added 508,000 manufacturing jobs. That's since the beginning of the recession. That is a blip compared to the last 25 years. Since 1987, take a look at this, the u.S. Lost 5.5 million manufacturing jobs. But in the same time, america's manufacturing output has increased by 84%. We increased our output as we employed substantially fewer people. Technology, automation. Scott paul is the executive director of the alliance for american manufacturing, a research and advocacy group. Will cane, conservative cnn contributor. Scott, we're producing more with less manufacturing looks promising in the u.S. As an industry. But do manufacturing jobs look good? 
>> Well, that's the real question. I do think that there's a good future for manufacturing jobs in this country. No, we won't have factories that are employing 10,000, 20,000 PEOPLE LIKE WE DID IN THE '50s OR '60s. There are lots of reasons to believe we should invest in manufacturing that we can actually add jobs on. And that it's a viable career path for young people today. We have an aging manufacturing workforce. Second, energy costs and other costs of production are coming way down in the united states. You're seeing firms that are reshoring jobs. You're seeing lenovo open up a laptop manufacturing facility in north carolina. These are things you couldn't have imagined a decade ago. 

[00:15:35]


>> Let me bring will into this conversation. President obama, as you know, during the campaign promised and people say all sorts of things during campaigns he was going to create a million new manufacturing jobs. He also wants to tax the rate on manufacturers. He wants to lower the tax rate on manufacturers, provide incentives for companies that reshore or bring jobs back to the united states. And you say exactly the opposite of what scott just said. You say this is a policy that TAKES US BACK TO THE '50s. Listen, everything -- president obama's list of things you just put up on the tv screen, that is the fly in the ointment. We have seen somewhat of a small manufacturing renaissance over the last decade. Bravo. So why does manufacturing need special tax rates, incentives, tax subsidies, so forth? 
>> Scott? 
>> There's a good answer for that. Yes, it does deserve special treatment. First of all, there is no other sector of our economy that has a higher multiplier effect. When you create a job at a factory, you create spinoff jobs. The logistics, cash going to the economy creates jobs. The opposite is hardly ever true. Second, we now know that manufacturing production and innovation are linkedtogether. When those two are separated by an ocean, it doesn't work very well. And that's what firms are discovering. In fact, some of the leading researchers at mit and harvard have included the same thing. If you actually want to have innovation in the economy that's going full t, you need to have production. 
>> So let me ask you, scott -- 
>> and finally exports as well. 
>> We'll get to exports in a second. Let me hold up an example. Apple managed to innovate successfully and manufacturing everything an ocean away. 
>> Apple is the jou liar. They have a rerisky workers in china that are working in deplorable conditions as we know. There's a smarter way to do it. And, yes, it would be highly automa automated. They could be employing thousands of engineers in california, making those products. It wouldn't raise the cost of an iphone more than a couple of bucks. But the returns for our economy would be fabulous. 

[00:17:47]


>> Here's the deal, scott. If those benefits are all exist as you lay them out, the innovation and manufacturing need to be geographically linked in order to fully be open timized, won't the companies realize that benefit? Why do we need government to provide special benefits to realize that goal? If it's there, it will be self evident and the company will choose that path. 
>> Well, am, that's a good quechlt here's the reason. Manufacturing is in the tradable sector. We have global competition. Hospitals don't. Retailers don't. Other sectors of the economy don't necessary sli that. Manufacturers do. And every other country out there has incentives to attract manufacturing. Whether it's the low road like china or the high road like germany f we're not in that game, we're going to be sitting on the sidelines and lose jobs. We've seen. That our manufacturing goods, trade deficit has gone up. 
>> That might be true that some play dirty, with don't we as well snt risk becomes thatwe encourage mal investment. All the things that make the united states unique and special over the past 100-odd years in the economy and that's innovation. And that's resilience had to do little with subsidies. Little with special treatment but rather equal playing field. Let's not corrupt what is made special to play dirty to keep up with the dirty players. 
>> I'm not suggest we go play dirty. I disagree with your economic history a little bit. Every successful industry that's been incubated in the united states has been subsidized like sems and you can go back to the telegraph and find. That I think we have a differing view of economic history. But what I'm suggesting is this, someone's going to make cars for consumers in the united states. I'd like to see them made here. Japan, korea, china, germany, they all have manufacturing strategies. If we don't have one, and i think -- I don't think it should be a dirty one. I think it should be smart and sophisticated. I think it should be based on incentives and what the private sector wants. But you can attract that manufacturing. It's why ford is bringing manufacturing of the fusion back to the united states. That's why gm is bringing back some of the r & d functions from india to michigan. That's why you've seen lenovo moving laptop manufacturing from china to north carolina. If you have the right kind of incentives, manufacturers will respond because there's an american manufacturers have a great workforce as you pointed out, will. We have great energy costs and we can successfully compete. 

[00:20:12]


>> Until I get the 90-minute version of this show where we can discuss whether anybody anywhere in the world should be providing incentives for manufacturing or for anything else, I know what your response is going to be, nobody should do it. Excellent discussion. I love having you on talking about this. I think we have to do this again. Scott paul and will cane. 
>> I said when you take pictures of ali, make sure to note this is not colonel sanders. It's tan, not white. 
>> Good to see you as always, will. 
>> Next, an energy boom. Will eluded to this. Is that bringing jobs back to the heartland in america? Fracking is putting americans back to work even as environmental concerns grow. I'm going to squeeze some energy out of this topic right after we pay the bills. mickelson. I've been fortunate to win on golf's biggest stages. But when joint pain and stiffness from psoriatic arthritis hit, even the smallest things became difficult. I finally understood what serious joint pain is like. I talked to my rheumatologist and he prescribed Enbrel. Enbrel CAN HELP RELIEVE PAIN, STIFFNESS, And stop joint damage. BECAUSE Enbrel, ETANERCEPT, SUPPRESSES YOUR Immune system, it may lower your ability to fight infections. Serious, sometimes fatal events including infections, tuberculosis, lymphoma, other cancers, and nervous system and blood disorders have occurred. BEFORE STARTING Enbrel, Your doctor should test you for tuberculosis and discuss whether you've been to a region where certain fungal infections are common. DON'T START Enbrel IF YOU HAVE AN INFECTION Like the flu. Tell your doctor if you're prone to infections, have cuts or sores, have had hepatitis b, have been treated for heart failure, OR IF, WHILE ON Enbrel, YOU EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT Fever, bruising, bleeding, or paleness.

[ Phil ] GET BACK TO THE THINGSTTTHAT MATTER Most. For you. 
[ Doctor ] Enbrel, THE NUMBER ONE BIOLOG Medicine prescribed by rheumatologists. @@,;8????0y0y3??o????????y@@, 
>>> For the first time, I'm seeing past the dangers of the fiscal cliff. Things are looking up, particularly when you look at the energy sector in the united states. A new report from the international energy agency predicts the u.S. Will become the world's largest oil producer by 2017. Temporarily surpassing saudi arabia. The same report projects the u.S. Will be nearly energy sufficient by 2030. These are loaded terms. You heard in the campaign talking about north american energy independence that, includes canada and mexico. But all of this business was something that was unthinkable not too long ago. There is an oil shale boom in the united states, new drilling methods are driving the growth and creating jobs. 1.7 million jobs have been created. That number is expected to grow to 2.5 million jobs over the next three years. Could reach 3.5 million jobs by 2035. It's unconventional oil and natural fwas production through a process called fracking. Hydraulic fracturing is the full name. It vofsz pumping water, sand, and chemicals into the ground at high pressure to crack rocks open. There is gas in them rocks. It's a costly process. There are environmental concerns. Some people even say they cause earthquakes. The chairman and chief investment of leeb capital management joins us. He is author of "the oil factor." Let's get to the -- I don't want to ignore the environmental concerns. We'll get to. That first, I want to ask you this. According to the department of energy, they say between 2008 and 2011 crude oil production in this country jumped 14%. Natural gas production climbed more than 10% in this country. Tell me what you think of this. 

[00:25:53]


>> I think that's a good thing, ali. I would not get that excited. I'm thrilled. I didn't know that number about the number of jobs created. I think that's wonderful. But I hope this country has the sense to realize this is a temporary phenomenon. This is not anything resembling a long term answer to our energy problems. I mean one point I have to make is the same agency that is telling us we're going to surpass saudi arabia five or ten years ago was telling us that saudi arabia was going to produce 10 million barrels a day. They're a little sarcastic. 
>> You're other worry is that with more energy production, there's a disincentive to use energy properly. 
>> This so true. And what you're seeing now is no one is making money fracking. I mean you may see profits on the bottom line. 
>> But natural gas prices plummeted? 
>> Natural gas prices plum itted. Even in the oil area which is very interesting in the shale formation. You have the biggest player continental resources producing great earnings. But once you subtract out how many rigs and the cost of those rigs, guess what? Negative, negative cash. They have to continue to borrow. The depletion rates on these wells are so great. So it's basically a short term fix. I mean definitely I think oil production will continue to go up maybe for another year. Maybe for two years. I don't think the ia will be right. But it will allow us to buy time, to really develop other kinds of energy sources. I really, you know, I'm not a green guy or anything else. I'm a resource scarce guy. I mean there is just not that much of it. 
>> It makes you see green. But you want it for the same reasons. You want to say let's have resources for energy production that are renewable and always going to be there. 
>> Right. I give somebody the argument that we don't understand what's going on with the environment. They could be the sun. It could be the hydro -- I give them that argument. The argument I won't concede is that resources are get ever scarce. And that we have abundant sun, abundant wind. Let's spend the money. Let's roll up our sleeves, take advantage of this little hiatus this little gift of time that fracking has given us and develop what will sustain us in the 21st century. That's what china is doing. I don't want to be beaten by china. 

[00:28:20]


>> Stephen, always good to see you. 
>> Thank you, ali. 
>>> All right. Coming up, we can't have an economic renaissance in this country without a recovery in housing. Home prices improve and mortgage rates hit record lows, you might be able to sell your house. Should you be buying a new one? Report after report says the housing market is back. I'm convinced. But not everyone else is. ] steve. He loves risk. But whether he's climbing everest, scuba diving the great barrier reef with sharks, or jumping into the market, he goes with people he trusts, which is why he trades with a company that doesn't nickel and dime him with hidden fees. So he can worry about other things, like what the market is doing and being ready, no matter what happens, which isn't rocket science. It's just common sense, from td ameritrade. lisa, quit. I honestly loved smoking, and I honestly didn't think I would ever quit. 

[00:30:27]


[ Male Announcer ] ALONG WITH SUPPORT, Chantix is proven to help people quit smoking. It reduces the urge to smoke. It put me at ease that you could smoke on the first week. 
[ Male Announcer ] SOME PEOPLE HAD CHANGES In behavior, thinking or mood, hostility, agitation, depressed mood and suicidal thoughts or actions while taking or after stopping chantix. If you notice any of these stop taking chantix and call your doctor right away. Tell your doctor about any history of depression or other mental health problems, which could get worse while taking chantix. Don't take chantix if you've had a serious allergic or skin reaction to it. If you develop these stop taking chantix and see your doctor right away as some can be life-threatening. If you have a history of heart or blood vessel problems, tell your doctor if you have new or worse symptoms. Get medical help right away if you have symptoms of a heart attack. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping and unusual dreams. With chantix and with the support system it worked. It worked for me. 
[ Male Announcer ] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF CHANTIX Is right for you. You see us, at the start of the day. On the company phone list that's a few names longer. You see us bank on busier highways. On once empty fields. Everyday you see all the ways all of us at us bank are helping grow our economy. Lending more so companies and communities can expand, grow stronger and get back to work. Everyday you see all of us serving you, around the country, around the corner. Us bank. 
>>> Look at me and then look up. You can see the clouds part and the sun breakthrough. I'm not done hammering away at the fiscal cliff. It is still the most immediate threat to the country's financial well-being and I will not stop until there's a deal signed on the dotted line. But today I'm going to venture beyond that cliff and look at the possibility of an economic renaissance. One of the brightest rays of sunshine, what I've been calling the golden lining on that storm cloud is the housing market. This week we got even more encouraging news. Existing home sales rose more than 2% in october after sagging earlier in the year. They are trending higher. Now with sales of homes picking up, the number of homes on the market, the inventory, is falling. Inventory, look at that. This is all the way back from december of 2002. This is for the last ten years. Inventory is at its lowest level since december of 2002. And that low inventory is putting upward pressure on home prices. The median sales price, that is the price at which half of all homes sold for more and half sold for less. It's not an average. The median home price for existing homes, used homes, if you will, rose more than 11% in october compared to last ar. Look at that. 178,000 is the median price. Home building is at a four-year high. Housing starts jumped 3.6% last month compared to september. Housing starts, that's number of new homes that are starting to be built. So is the recovery real? Warren buffett, the celebrated investor and the world's richest men says, yes. 

[00:33:34]


>> We have a large real estate brokerage firm. We have building supply companies. And we're seeing prices moving up somewhat. We're seeing demand improve. We're seeing the overhang of houses diminish. We're coming back. 
>> On the other hand, the former federal reserve chairman allen greenspan told me don't get excited yet. 
>> What's happening is real. It's slow. But we can exaggerate how big it is. But it's going, certainly going in the right direction. 
>> Joining me now is chris maier from columbia business school. Jonathan miller is the president and ceo of estate appraisal and consulting firm miller samuel. Dian home prices have risen for eight months in a row. The case schiller 20 city index up is five months in a row. You say don't look at the prices so much. 
>> I think looking at housing prices is the worst thing to look at. I think you want to look at activity levels. The reason we're seeing prices uptick is we're seeing foreclosure activity at a lighter level than it would have been. We had the scandal a couple years ago. Banks discovered during the process while they held back on foreclosures short sales were the way to go. We have a lot less distressed property in the mix right now. It's skewing the metrics. 
>> Isn't a market still a market. Doesn't that mean that people are willing to pay more for houses? 
>> I take word with the issue recovery. When I was at school, the word recovery meant getting better. I think the word recovery now means not getting worse. 
>> Chris, jonathan takes that view. Allen greenspan says slow down. We heard from ben bernanke this week. Listen to what he said. 
>> Unfortunately, while some tightening of the terms of mortgage credit is an appropriate response to the developments of earlier accesses, the pend la appears to have swung too far estraining the pace of recovery in the housing sector. 
>> I completely agree. I think the housing recovery is going on despite problems in the mortgage market, not because of them. The fed is critical about tightening of credit. That may well be at least potentially a cloud that could open a little bit in the coming year. 

[00:35:45]


>> You know, jonathan, I made the argument for well over a year that this combination of relatively low prices and low interest rates is a confluence you're not going to see for a long time. I've been wrong that the interest rates have gone down lower. Now with the fed saying their rates, which are largely connected to mortgage rates will stay low until mid-2015 before starting to go up, it does take that urgency out of my argument that you better buy a house now. If you look at all the sort of what you call and eluded to happy housing news, all the metrics that we're seeing is influenced by the credit being tight. The senior loan officer survey is saying that credit hasn't eased for mortgage lending since lehman. Listing inventory is falling. 
>> In other words, you don't have as much inventory because some people are not -- 
>> people forget that sellers become buyers. So if you can't qualify to trade up on your house, doesn't mean you're underwater on the mortgage. 
>> Just means you're not going to get out of your house. 
>> Why do you sell you? Wait. 
>> Let me pull that out. If credit became more lenient, if more people were able to get credit, more people would want to buy homes. Some people would be sellers. So you see more inventory. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> I see. 
>> I think you look at it at that end. You also look at new construction. New construction is clearly seeing an uptick. 
>> Small part of the market. 
>> Very tiny part of the market. Clearly up. Part of it is because we have lower distress sales in the pool and lower existing home listings in the pool as well. So it's creating demand. Remember, we have record low and seemingly every couple of weeks a new record low. Mortgage rate that is pushing people through despite how tight credit is. 
>> Let me ask you about that, distress sales, foreclosures, smalof the pie now. Is that a substantial drag? If we got to the end of foreclosures, if we got to a historically normal level of foreclosures, what would happen to this market? 

[00:37:47]


>> I think the foreclosures are actually part of why we have sales volume that is around five million as opposed to where it would be which would be much lower. I would take a more positive spin on the things that jonathan talked about which is I think it is quite possible to see a very hard tradeup market where people who want to sell a home and trade up to a new one have a challenge. First time home buyers coming in, if they can clean up the credit, I'm completely if your camp. 
>> It's a good time to buy. 
>> If you're selling and just getting close to not being underwater, is this the time to sell or do you hold on? 
>> The problem for people who are selling is you're going to have to put cash in to buy another home. 45% of homeowners with mortgages according to a recent study have less than 20% equity or negative equity in their homes. That is tens of millions of households having a hard time trading up. What you're seeing is the new construction market, the home, you know, first time home buyers using fha loans and for those people relative to renting where if you go in and try to rent a home from one of the private equity guys, you're going to pay 12% to 14% of the home value. Borrowing at, you know, 4.5% is a bargain. 
>> It is useful for my viewers to have your divergence of opinion. Thanks very much for being with us, as always. Jonathan miller and chris maier. All right. Superstorm sandy is over. Now the u.S. Has an opportunity to rebuild the infrastructure better than before. I'll tell why you that can protect us from storms like sandy and why it's the best thing to do to protect america from economic storms as well. You're watching "your money." We'll be right back. Nobody said an all-in-one had to be bulky. Or that you had to print from your desk. At least, nobody said it tous. Introducing the business smart inkjet all-in-one series from brother. Easy to use. It's the ultimate combination of speed, small size, and low-cost printing. you? I heard you guys can ship ground for less than the ups store. That's right. I've learned the only way to get a holiday deal is to camp out. You know we've been open all night. Is this a trick to get my spot? 

[00:40:21]


[ Male Announcer ] BREAK FROM THE HOLIDAY Stress. Save on ground shipping at fedex office. timeout apparently riding the dog like it's a small horse is frowned upon in this establishment! Luckily though, ya know, I conceal this bad boy underneath my blanket just so I can get on e-trade. Check my investment portfolio, research stocks... Wait, why are you taking... Oh, I see...Solitary. Just a man and his thoughts. And a smartphone... With an e-trade app. ?????? Nobody knows... ?????? 
[ Male Announcer ] E-TRADE. Investing unleashed. 
>>> Superstorm sandy reminded america of the fragile state of the infrastruck stur. 800,000 homes and businesses were without power, it flooded the transit system and shut down parts of washington and lower manhattan for days. America's infrastructure was in a sorry state even before sandy hit. The american society of civil engineers gave it a d grade in 2009. They said then that it would take $2.2 trillion over five years to bring it up to scratch. The investment never came. Now we already know that investing in infrastructure can help protect us from storms like sandy. It can be the best investment to protect us from economic storms. That creates construction jobs in the short term and makes the u.S. A more attractive place to do business over the long term. But the u.S. Has been slow to invest in its infrastructure. In 2005, hurricane katrina destroyed parts of new orleans. Now they have a $14.6 billion flood protection system. In 2007, this bridge in minneapolis collapsed. That bridge was rebuilt but many of our nation's bridges are still in a sorry state. It takes extraordinary events for us to upgrade our infrastructure. I spoke to infrastructure enthusiast and colleague fareed zakaria here on cnn. When we talk about infrastructure projects, there are many people in this country who feel it is stimulus, government spending, ineffective, it's decorated with sorts of favors for everybody and pork. How do you convince people that there's a way to spend that $2.2 trillion that the american society of civil engineers says we need to spend and get a payback? 

[00:44:29]


>> Actually a very smart idea about how to do it. It was co-sponsored by john kerry and kay bailey hutchison is create a infrastructure bank. Have the federal government seed it with capital but have private sector money. Have the projectsawarded by a board, a group of technical experts that evaluate the projects on their merit rather than congressional district. Guess who doesn't like this? Most congressmen. 
>> They want to be able to reward them. 
>> They don't want infrastructure built that is based on merit and not based on pork. They talk about how they hate pork. But then they want the bridge back home. Then they want the baseball field back home. So this is where presidential leadership can come in. This is where bipartisanship can come in. Do you have broad agreement, you know, infrastructure is something everyone agrees the government has to be involved in. 
>> What if the deals are profitable and what part are not? If there is an infrastructure bank, does that end up as a net cost to americans? Yet it increases trade and increases protection from storms. Or can these things actually be generating a profit? 
>> No. They can easily generate a profit. They can generate a return. For example, airports, the simplest way we do it is airports. You've seen it. You walk through an airport. You notice that the fanciest airports are the ones with the most retail in them. That's a win-win. Private sector makes money. They figured out a way to lease the shops and allow people to sell goods there. But we also get good runways, we have updated technology. The same applies with ports. The same could apply with train stations. 
>> You and I travel to a lot of high growth countries. The idea of either an infrastructure bank or private-public partnership exists. What is with that with the united states? It is such a free marketplace and yet we don't take advantage of this. You use airports as an example. It doesn't exist the same way in the united states as does it in other places. 

[00:46:38]


>> It's a fascinating question. We do infrastructure in a socialist way. Compared with most countries in europe. We think of europe as being the socialists. But, in fact, we believe that infrastructure has tbe paid for by the government, run by government, the projects have to be, you know, executed by the government. That's not how they build roads or trains in europe. They have a lot of it is private sector done. In asia, they privatise roads and railroads. The result is they get much faster movement, often much higher quality. It's just partly a mentality shift that we need to take here. But if we were to do it, very important thing you pointed out is there is a huge payback. We used to spend a whole 1% of gdp more on infrastructure in THE 1960s THAN WE DO NOW. If you look at the american economy, the big thing we stopped doing, you know, taxes, regulations, roughly the same as they were 30 or 40 years ago. Some have gone up and some down. The big shift in the american economy is we have stopped investing. 
>> Yeah. 
>> We stopped investing in infrastructure and other things as well. Here's the important thing. This is the best short term thing we can do. The area of the american economy which has the highest unemployment rate is construction. It is still 12%. Down from 16%. But if we could start rebuilding the roads, airports and things like that, it could make a huge dent in this huge problem we face of unemployment in america. 
>> And we'll stay on top of the discussion about istructure. Yorobably concerned about the fiscal cliff. I'll help you get your money in the right place regardless of what happens in washington.>?? future.

[00:51:16]


>>> you smell that? That's the smell of fear in the stock market. It's a stench getting stronger and stronger since about november 7th in an otherwise strong year in the market. NOVEMBER 7th, THE DAY AFTER President obama was re-elected. I don't think it's his fault, but the perception he would not be able to work with republican members of congress to avertthe fiscal cliff has caused investors to run for the hills. Take a look at the s&p 500 over the past 5 weeks. It probably resembles some of your investments, by the way. We don't know what is included in a deal to raise revenue instead of tax rates. But it's giving investors the heebie-jeebies. What are they worried about? They have a lot to do, the concerns have a lot to do with the expiration of the bush tax cuts, which could be painful for investors. Capital gains taxes rise from 15% to 20% for most people who file taxes. Taxes on dividends rise from 15% to your top income tax rate, which could be, depending on how much you earn, as much as $39.5%. Given a lot of people rely on those for their income, it's no surprise to see some of the highest dividend yielding stocks get slammed in the past few weeks. As I have been saying, today, if we can get past this fiscal cliff standoff, there are going to be a lot of opportunities for businesses to blossom and investors to make money. Even if there are higher taxes on the horizon. Mike is the chairman of holland and company. Welcome to the program. I haven't talked to you for a while. Tell me about the drop from NOVEMBER 7th, FIRST OF ALL. How much of that is fear of the fiscal cliff? How much of that is people who don't like obama? What was that? 
>> It's all of the above. You used the word heebie-jeebies before. It's a good ofessional description of what is going on and an extension of what's been going on since 2008. People have had a negative psychology and a fear psychology which was exacerbated by the november 7th time. We had benber nanky say what you said before. If we get by the negotiations referred to as the fiscal cliff in the next few weeks, several weeks, we could have, according to ben bernanke, a good year in the upcoming year. 

[00:53:37]


>> We spent the show talking about housing, energy, manufacturing, infrastructure, the things that could really light a fire under the economy here. Let's say some of this goes right, not all of it, but some of it goes right. What does my viewer do that from an investment standpoint? 
>> They should be prepared for a surprise to the upside rather than the downside. With the fear psychology of the past few years has been one we don't want to lose any more money. Let's get out of stocks, hide the stuff under the mattress. Under the mattress includes money market funds which yield virtually nothing. So if there is a surprise to the upside, just any one of the few thated about, how about all of them could happen? Stocks and other things will be going up in price. You probably want to have some exposure to that. I'm not suggesting for people who sold all their stocks or mutual funds several years ago, they take that money and put it back in, but they should be prepared for a surprise to the upside. 
>> Don't put money in a pous. I'm bullish on properties, bvt you may be able do better. Let's talk about china. New government there. Some of the tension dissipated. There has been a slow down in china because of europe. There's some sign it's stabilizing. Still growing at 7%. What do you tell your clients about china and asia generally? 
>> I have been going over there for many years and investing over there for many years, they, the government, said in 2008, we're going to stimulate the economy. They did it, did an incredible job. Very different than what we had here, in fact to the point of being so hot they had to pull it back which they said a year ago they were going to do. 
>> So it's all been predictable. 
>> You can look it up, so now they said this third quarter, where they just did the ten-year hand over of the leadership, this will be the time when we bottom out at 7.5% growth, which is incredible for the world's second largest economy. They said we will be growing in a very controlled way in the future, and that's what the companies I was over there in taiwan a few weeks ago, that's what the companies are telling us as well. 

[00:55:46]


>> Mike, great to see you. Do you believe in this economic renaissance in america we have been talking about? The economy may be on its way, but there are hills to climb before we get there. I'll put it all in perspective when we come back. So think? Basic. AT Meineke I HAVE OPTIONS... Like oil changes starting at $19.95. My money. My choice. MY Meineke. 

[00:59:03]


>>> Well, I gave you some things to be hopeful today. The american renaissance is a viable possibility, but a lot depends on the men and women you voted on to do what is right for the country. It starts with avoiding the fiscal cliff, but it doesn't end here. This country has debts and deficits that need to be addressed. 12 million of you are still unemployed and many of you who have a job want a better one. The middle east remains volatile, and europe stands as a tough reminder of the direction this country could go in if we don't get our fiscal house in order. I'm an optimist when it comes to the u.S. Economy, and I hope i have shown you some of the bright spots in what seems to be a darkening economic picture. We're here every saturday at 1:00 p.M., Sunday at 3:00 p.M. I'm be reading your tweets so tell me what you're hopeful
